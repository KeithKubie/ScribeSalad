00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,240

00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:09,780
June 19th,
2017 what's going on?

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,600
How are you doing now? Why? What's

doing good. Oh, gets good.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,700
I'm doing great. I'm actually recording
this on Sunday. Uh, June 18th.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,620
I'm 49 years old.
My first fucking

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,560
day. First Father's Day. Oh Geez. Belt.

9
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:39,170
What did you do? God bless
you. You're in the clubhouse.

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,930
Fucking turn. You finally became a dead.
What did you do? I had a great day.

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,460
Bye. Have a great day. You know,
they go all out for mother's Day.

12
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,480
Did she has brunch after
brunch after this? After that,

13
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,880
I went over to a car show over on a Rodeo,
uh,

14
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,920
uh, drive. They'll drive right where?
Dale Boulevard. Rodeo Rodeo road.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,700
Rodale drive. The fancy schmancy place.
Evidently they have a father's day,

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,140
a car show every father's day.

17
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:15,250
Obviously if it's going to call
the father state car show. Yes.

18
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:17,890
They've had it every year. And of
course, I never went. I was never a debt.

19
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,220
I never even heard about the fucking
thing. So I was not on the email list.

20
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,600
You know, Billy the kid list as
you guys call me back in the day,

21
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,330
you guys a five months ago,
you could still call me that.

22
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,020
So I was never on the email list
and a god damn. And I was like,

23
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:36,730
I'm going over there.
So we had over there and uh,

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,130
you know, it's like, you
know, the beautiful people.
You don't want people and me.

25
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:45,760
MMM.
Rich,

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,620
rich ass fucking yeah. Beverly Hills.
They call it the Beverly Hills, um,

27
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,730
car show. And I got to tell you,
man, it's fucking beautiful cars.

28
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,860
I was either going to go
to the Petersen Museum,

29
00:01:56,861 --> 00:02:00,130
I was going to do that and I figured I
can go to the Petersen museum anytime.

30
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:01,420
This is the father's day one.

31
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,480
I got to go to that one and then
I'll do the Peterson later. Right.

32
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:08,440
So I fucking go over there. A
Peterson Museum, by the way.

33
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:13,060
Right down next to that place. That's
right. What biggie got shot? Um,

34
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,610
we'll share in fucking Fairfax. So
anyways, so I'm over there on Rodeo drive.

35
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,090
I'm checking it out, right? There's
all these rich people, you know,

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,310
there's all these beautiful fucking,
you know, I don't know what, you know,

37
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:29,170
walking around,
God knows how old they are.

38
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,860
They really getting good with the
plastic surgery meant they really,

39
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,910
really get fucking,

40
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:38,290
I was still with some amazing old
looking women walking around, you know,

41
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,620
where in forever 21 shit that
they bought it, you know,

42
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,400
I don't know one of those stores
up and down the block. Right.

43
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,160
So we're walking around, you
know, it's fucking hilarious.

44
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,330
Every restaurant was like closed over
there. They're like, fuck the dads.

45
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,850
He like five food trucks. Even
over there. They're like, Yay.

46
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,710
It's the daddy doesn't give a shit.

47
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,240
Show him a couple of fucking Babel
shown the Lincoln from entourage,

48
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,310
which they had over there,
which was fucking coolest shit.

49
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,390
One of the great cars out there,

50
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,870
the Lincoln continental
suicide doors and all that.

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,210
I'm not a convertible guy, but you know,
it worked for the show, the overhead shot,

52
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,820
iconic shot at this point.
Uh,

53
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,220
they had the Eleanor car from gone in
60 seconds, but I liked, I like all,

54
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,850
I always liked the weird
shit. Um, I saw like a 19,

55
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:28,930
what the fuck was only had
1961 62 or 63 Mercedes Benz,

56
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,240
limousine and I, everything that
was there, there was a Tucker there,

57
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:38,620
there was a fucking one of
those mid feeling of 55,

58
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,990
uh, Mercedes gullwing, you know, bunch
of Ferrari's Lamborghini's, you know,

59
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:48,820
they have those weird years in the 70s.
Those ones,

60
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,050
uh, Adam Carolla has a lot of
them. I don't mean weird like that.

61
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:54,850
Not good look and it's just like,
you know,

62
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,740
I always saw him as the racing
car and then to me it was for me,

63
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:04,210
I just felt it went right to magnum
Pi and it wasn't until I did Carolla's

64
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:08,380
podcast back in the day when I saw the
Lamborghinis and Ferraris and I was just

65
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,300
like one of these, he was
like, oh, this is it. This one,

66
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:15,130
this is that one from like the, like the
late 67, seven. Now their coolest shit.

67
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,390
He was ahead of the curve by the
way. Um, I was watching a local,

68
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:22,600
a newscast out here and um,

69
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,720
Adam Korea's a free plug here.
Adam Corolla was on and he was promoting,

70
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,760
he's got a,

71
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,420
he's got a documentary on the 24 hours
of Le Mans in the 1950s when Ford decided

72
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,380
that they were going to guess compete
and see what they could do over there.

73
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,090
And uh, they came out with the
Ford Gt. He's got this great,

74
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:47,091
I can getting rave reviews and he has
another documentary that he already put

75
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:51,790
out about the racing life of Paul Newman.
And if you go to his website,

76
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,770
I believe it's chassis.com something,
if you just put an Adam Corolla Le Mans,

77
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:58,070
it's going to come up.
And uh,

78
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,390
what I love is all I could find
on the website was just the DVD,

79
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,720
which is great for me as an old
man. I don't like that fucking, hey,

80
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,290
you downloaded and then it's in the
air and somehow it's on my computer.

81
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,650
And then I dumped some orange juice on
the keyboard and then I don't own it

82
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:16,030
anymore. I like the DVD.
I'm gonna I, I'm an old man.

83
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,210
I like the DVD that's like having
the gold behind your money.

84
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,310
So had I known about this,

85
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:24,140
I would have asked for both
of those for a father's day.

86
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,190
So instead I'm just
going to buy it myself.

87
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,493
So anyways,

88
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,770
I fucking go over there and they got
this Mercedes Benz like 1960160260 three

89
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,850
some in their early sixties.
And it's a a, it's a limousine.

90
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,250
It's fucking black. It's got
this, uh, I took a video. I know,

91
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,300
I always say I'm going to post it.

92
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:47,920
Then I always forget that
I say I'm going to do it,

93
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:52,921
but I'm going to try to remember here
had this beautiful red interior and um,

94
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,030
it was just, I was like that, that
right. That's what the fuck is he?

95
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,340
The older I get,
as much as I enjoy driving,

96
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:04,760
I don't enjoy driving in La because
the traffic is just fucking insane.

97
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,320
And my wife, my laugh, she,

98
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,060
Uber's all the time.

99
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,630
So I'm getting used to this jumping
in a car and somebody else is driving.

100
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,450
You know,
when I go out with her and um,

101
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,820
I get all this business done,

102
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,530
be it breaking people's balls
back on some texts, you know,

103
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:27,560
call it back fucking Joe to
Rosa is some shit better.

104
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Call Saul's Joe to Rosa
for your consideration is
the fucking veterinarian on

105
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:39,020
that wonderful show.
Um, turn, email calls,

106
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:43,840
business shit, all of
that. And uh, you know,

107
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:46,180
you always read about these, these
fucking people out here, the,

108
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:50,230
these moguls like the
Ryan Seacrest's out here,

109
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:53,580
they don't fucking drive.
They have a drive around.

110
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,370
They sit in the back
and they get shit done.

111
00:06:57,371 --> 00:06:59,410
They pull the curtain right
and they just backed there.

112
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,080
They got like the Janet
Jackson headset on.

113
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,880
They're fucking firing off
emails that buying stocks.

114
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:09,100
I don't know what they're doing
back there. I'm not a mogul.

115
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,260
It's like they're going to tell you
fucking tell someone how to be a mogul.

116
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:15,880
Then everybody's a mogul in the way you,
you just sort of,

117
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,800
you're just a regular guy. Next thing
you know, you've stopped at a red light.

118
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,450
You looking over, you look, is that Ryan
Seacrest driving his own fucking car?

119
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:26,620
What happened that this guy
had 17 fucking TV shows?

120
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,830
Um, anyways, I,

121
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,770
I could really get into that to be
honest with you. But who's kidding who,

122
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,430
I'm not a mogul. I, I'm just
fucking lazy and I don't know,

123
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:42,070
I think that there's this two
types of people as they get older.

124
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:45,430
This is a person that just,
you know, takes up cycling

125
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,920
in rock climbing and they take like a
fucking glass blowing class or some shit,

126
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,790
you know? And then there's other
people being like, you know, and I,

127
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,790
I fucking tired man. You know, I,

128
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,350
I'd like to chill if I get another 49
years or whatever, I get, you know,

129
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:05,650
I'm on the back nine.
Who's kidding who 49 times two is 98.

130
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,370
I want to make a hundred stay in
positive or who's can do all right,

131
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,920
feel like I'm on the 12th hole.

132
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,300
Um,
it'll fuck wants to drive in La.

133
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,210
It's fucking horrible. I would actually
thoroughly enjoy it and I would just,

134
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,460
if you had that kind of loop,

135
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,470
you free do an old fucking beautiful
car like that. You restore it,

136
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:39,240
you bring it back to life, and then you
just in the back, you know, you got,

137
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,010
you got, you know, you've got a little
humor door, some fucking cigars,

138
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:44,844
you know,

139
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,230
couple of your favorite little fucking
accoutrements being the booze there.

140
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,580
Then you just fuck or whatever.
You just drive around.

141
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,070
Well,

142
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,520
whatever your driver's name is, you
still call him James. Every fucking,

143
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,660
every a chauffeur was always
named that when, that'd be great.

144
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,860
You want to go to the movies? You
know, I drink too much already, man.

145
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:10,590
There's no way I can, I can handle
always having a designated driver.

146
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:15,480
I began fucking stupid going to the
supermarket. Um, speaking of which Billy,

147
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:16,980
no fun.
Oh Jesus.

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,970
Jesus Christ was seven
days in seven fucking days.

149
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,210
And last night I had a couple glasses of
wine. We went out with another couple.

150
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,970
What am I supposed to do? Everybody
at, Oh, I'm having an Italian meal.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,160
I'm not supposed to have a little Barolo.
Come on, come on. What am I supposed to,

152
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:36,720
I had a couple of those, you know, and I,
I don't even fucking like mine. It just,

153
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,740
it's just, it's always reminding you of
the hangover. It's going to give you,

154
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,510
turned your teeth gray.
Um, but I actually enjoyed,

155
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,440
that's the one wine that I like.
I really enjoyed it last night and um,

156
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,210
I was actually gonna order
a whiskey, but uh, uh,

157
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,770
I almost said the referee, the waiter
forgot to come back and asked me.

158
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:02,460
At that point I was just like, fuck this,
I'm just going to stay with the wine.

159
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,490
And then tonight my family took me out
for father's day and I had one whiskey

160
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,680
and I, Oh man, I got fucking good one.
Right. I got a really good 28 years old.

161
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,000
And then I went outside to return a
phone call and I had set the glass down.

162
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:20,130
I came back and,
uh,

163
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,100
one of my red learners had bumped the
table and said they knocked a little bit

164
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:24,360
out and I didn't think
there was that much.

165
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:27,780
And then I looked down on those as big
puddle of it and I was like, Oh fuck,

166
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,140
that was 28 years old. I mean, the
back of my head, I was like, oh,

167
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:32,670
that's good because I'm
trying not to drink anyways,

168
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:36,150
but it was 28 years old
as shit poured in a glass.

169
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,690
I sipped it and then somebody
came by, boom, hit the table,

170
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:40,860
and then those are puddle of it.

171
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,910
Spent 20 years in a fucking barrel to
be spilled on the floor and then cleaned

172
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:51,930
up with a rag. Ah, that's a
travesty. I felt my liver crying,

173
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,470
but it was good because then I had the
perfect amount of booze and I was fine.

174
00:10:55,471 --> 00:11:00,270
So I don't know. I know you
guys who were in Aa, you know,

175
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,070
collecting your little chippy poos there.
You knew it.

176
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,003
Yes.

177
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,130
Sober, you know, give
you a little cookie. Um,

178
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,920
got you down that chain.
There's no way,

179
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:15,320
even if I was like a
full on fucking alkie,

180
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,590
like I'm in AAA of alcoholism.
Um,

181
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:20,900
I never got called up to the big show.

182
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,800
I'm basically like Kevin Costner and
a bull Durham, except I'm drinking,

183
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,013
um,

184
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,480
that would annoy me going to Aa and
they give me my stupid chip like that.

185
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,040
So I'm like, I'm supposed to be
fucking chasing these things.

186
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,500
I've got too much of a contrarian in me.
That's the new word for content,

187
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,810
by the way.
I'm a bit of a Canarian uh,

188
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,740
Canarian a contrarion a bit of
a contrary. Yeah. Yeah. You're,

189
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,640
you're difficult. You or can't, you know,

190
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,400
you're fucking in the ass.

191
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,900
You're the kind of guy I have to fucking
jet went down. You're the fucking guy.

192
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,280
You're the guy that would get us killed.

193
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:04,180
We'd all be fucking sitting there if we
survive going, hey, you know what I say?

194
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,410
We go over their storage.
Everybody agreement. Yeah.

195
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,330
And then they always want to
go, whoa, Mu, this rich. Well,

196
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:14,170
why don't you fucking go over there buddy.
We had mauled by a bobcat.

197
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,970
We'll wait for you to slowly
die and then they're there.

198
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:19,780
There's a new nourishment for the rest
of this fucking walked down this snowy

199
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,910
God forsaken Tundra.

200
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,573
Yeah.

201
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:29,470
Anyways, sorry. Um, the
fuck am I talking again? So,

202
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:32,370
so we go to the car show, right? None
of the fucking restaurants are open.

203
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:34,740
Fuck the dads. It's like
food trucks. Nobody gives it.

204
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:39,360
You know what's funny though? I didn't
give a shit. My wife was upset. Oh my God.

205
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,050
Why do we know any of
these places are open?

206
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,860
She's like, are you alright with
us? Like, yeah, I don't give a shit.

207
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,820
I don't give a shit. You
know, I really don't. I am.

208
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,750
I am the way I'm wired like a guy.
I walked around,

209
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:59,440
I looked at some shiny cars.
I'm happy. It's hot as shit.

210
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:04,120
Let's get back in the car and go
home. I'm fine. Completely fine.

211
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,610
Brunch. That's, that's some you shit

212
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,570
turning this whole fucking thing to
do a whole day. Yeah. Father's Day.

213
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:15,300
You leave that. I had to buy the
perfect father's day. And then, um,

214
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,630
I didn't even say I started my day.
Who fucking,

215
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,670
uh, no fun Billy. I can wake
up now like super early and um,

216
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:27,980
okay.

217
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,490
I finally have a little drum space,
about 20 ways a little row,

218
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,250
a little Jesus Christ who came to talk
a little ways away from like 20 minutes

219
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:41,600
away from my house. I got
a little rehearsal studio,
right? It can just rent them.

220
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,270
And I got the smallest fucking one.
Like if I stretch out,

221
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:47,180
I can touch the walls on all sides.
And I got this little fucking,

222
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:53,210
that little sonar kit that I bought, the
Martini Kit, 16 inch bass, a bass drums,

223
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,680
which cracks me up because I was playing
that giant bottom one that at a 26 inch

224
00:13:57,681 --> 00:14:02,270
fucking bass drum and a,
I'm trying to, you know,

225
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,790
just go in a completely diff,

226
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:10,060
different direction after all of these
goddamn years of just fucking trying to

227
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,950
ape everything that, uh,
that he did. And I just, I,

228
00:14:15,951 --> 00:14:17,930
it just hit me one fucking day.
I told you what,

229
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:19,510
if one day I just sat there and I said,

230
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,390
what is this fucking guy came back to
life and he came walking into my house.

231
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,040
I keep saying this on the podcast,
right? And I was just like, hey man,

232
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,700
John Bonam, Holy Shit. Hey, I'm a big fan
of yours. Come in and look at my drum kit.

233
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,600
And I had his exact drum kit
right down to the Rogers high hat.

234
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,170
He would have looked that he would've
slowly backed out of the fucking room.

235
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,100
And what was funny is, now I'm going
down this whole fucking rabbit hole.

236
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,960
You know, I'm listening to Pan Tara
and fucking Primus in Miles Davis.

237
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,083
Figure that one out.

238
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,710
Listening to all of fucking
great drummers from Philly, Joe,

239
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:59,711
Tony Williams to fucking Jack Dejan it
just listen to these fucking geniuses

240
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,150
and I'm trying to get something
else in my fucking head.

241
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,770
And uh,
through reading up on Tony Williams,

242
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,020
I went down this fucking
rabbit hole full of,

243
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,440
I don't know how many hours on
the Internet, just trying to,

244
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,440
Ellie's tracks I was listening
to and trying to see if I could,

245
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,970
there's so many tracks with Tony is
just killing it live and they just won't

246
00:15:23,971 --> 00:15:26,850
show him.
It's so fucking annoying though.

247
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:30,750
We showing miles or cold train a fucking
nickel. [inaudible] plaintiff Coltrane,

248
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,260
Myles are fucking,
was it shorter that he played with?

249
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,380
I don't know if they're always
showing those guys. Yes.

250
00:15:38,381 --> 00:15:41,860
It's like if everybody else stops playing,
they'll finally fucking show him.

251
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,420
It's annoying. Um, but you know,
typical, they never show the drum.

252
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,180
That's why I love the
Romantics when I was a kid.

253
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,840
And what I like about you came out and
I finally got the w the drummer was

254
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:53,200
singing.

255
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,700
If the drummer sang then there would
be on hotel California with Don Henley.

256
00:15:57,701 --> 00:16:01,770
You'd see the drummer the whole
fucking time. Okay. Other than that,

257
00:16:01,771 --> 00:16:06,630
you would shit out of luck.
Um, so anyways, I ended up,

258
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,480
when you read about Tony,
that leads to Billy Cobham,

259
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:15,270
which leads to fucking eventually,
you know, I dunno Vinnie,

260
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,690
Kali Yoga and Steve Smith
and all these fucking guys.

261
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:20,390
And then they start talking about the
guys they listen to and then you go back

262
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:22,550
around again.
It's amazing.

263
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:25,910
So I ended up finding this
quote that really made me

264
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,720
feel good about getting rid of the drum
kit that I did because sometimes I think

265
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:34,540
going on, man, I always wanted that
kid. And I finally fucking had it,

266
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,710
and then I just always think,
yeah,

267
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:39,340
and you sat down and played it and
you sounded like you so and it was too

268
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,860
fucking big for you and you
have all these other ideas.

269
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:43,120
Why don't you go pursue those?

270
00:16:43,121 --> 00:16:45,910
And I just stumbled on this
quote by Vinny Kali Uta, right?

271
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,030
That's actually transcends playing drums.
You can apply this to anything. It's,

272
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,500
he says, this is what he was trying
to find his own style. He said,

273
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:56,230
I went through periods where I
tried to imitate Tony and Billy.

274
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:57,700
That's Tony Williams and Billy Cobham.

275
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,060
He goes by eventually
realized how dangerous it was.

276
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,530
Basically trying to imitate those
guys. That goes, I began to ask myself,

277
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:08,800
what am I saying?
I wasn't saying anything.

278
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,890
It had been said before and
had a reason for being said,

279
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,130
but I didn't have a reason.
I wasn't making a statement.

280
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,420
I was just repeating it like a parrot.
By imitating and copying someone else,

281
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:20,860
a person becomes a parrot.

282
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,160
I saw the trap and I knew as great as
those guys were and still are that I had

283
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:30,760
to find my own voice and I was
like, God dammit, look at that.

284
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,130
That applies to stand up comedy.

285
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,970
That applies to fucking washing cars.

286
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,370
Do you want to be one of the greats?

287
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:42,340
You know how many times can you watch
misdemeanor Augie do the wax on,

288
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:44,380
wax off before you're going
to fucking break out of that.

289
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,440
Come up with a new way
to do it. Right. I know.

290
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:50,070
What the fuck to tell

291
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,650
you. I'm just happy. So now I got
this place so I wake up now cause um,

292
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,913
you know

293
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,310
the way my daughter sleeps,
she sleeps in these four hour chunks.

294
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,340
So she finally falls asleep,
you know,

295
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,250
around two in the morning after she
slept from my, you know, eight to 12.

296
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,070
Then she'd be like up for like
an hour and a half of some shit.

297
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,320
And then she sleeps till like seven.

298
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,640
My wife feeds her and then she
goes back to sleep again until 10.

299
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,510
So that window right there from seven to
10. Now, I just been jumping in the car,

300
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,120
drive 20 minutes down the street.
Nobody's up.

301
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,960
There's no musicians over at that place.
You know, they're just getting done,

302
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:26,460
doing blow. They're going home. You know,

303
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,110
I'm there at like eight in the fucking
morning and I get to play for like a nice

304
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:34,050
solid hour having the
time of my fucking life.

305
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,040
I don't know why I didn't do
this for myself years ago.

306
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,930
I didn't never dawned on me to do it.

307
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,740
I was always trying to play him in the
fucking house and trying to find quiet

308
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:45,720
ways to do it.
Cause who's kidding?

309
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:50,610
Who drums are fucking annoying other
unless you're the person playing him. Um,

310
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,420
so I finally got this place and I'm
a, I'm beyond psych, so we'll see.

311
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:02,280
We'll see what this little
kit leaves me. Um, but, uh,

312
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,430
I don't know, whatever. I'm just
saying it was a great father's Day.

313
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:10,290
So I went out tonight and then, uh,
get a nice framed picture of me,

314
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,200
uh,

315
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,520
hold my beautiful daughter and I could
not be having my arms around her anymore.

316
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,700
And she looks content is hell.
It's was an instant classic.

317
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:19,890
I'm kissing her on the
cheek and I get it framed.

318
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:23,670
I'm looking at right now sitting on my
desk and fucking psyched. So I'm happy.

319
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:27,870
Father's Day, Father's Day to
all the fathers out there. Uh,

320
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,900
you know, and if he used to play
drums, you want to play him again.

321
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:34,970
Go get one of those, get that fucking,
that quest love little break beats set.

322
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,830
Go find some fucking studio
space cause she like one 25,

323
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:45,090
200 bucks a month. Who
gives a fuck? You know,

324
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,140
go get it and go down there and
bring you fucking, you know,

325
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,370
or find a studio space like,
you know where I used to play,

326
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,760
I never used to say that cause I didn't
want anybody bugged me down there. Um,

327
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,340
the best place that I
found out here in La,

328
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,280
if you don't have time to get
a drum kit and all that shit,

329
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:04,281
but if you just want to go play someplace
is cascade studios down on Santa

330
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,390
Monica Av just east of Highland.
It's the shit. It's fucking cleaned.

331
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:12,790
The drum kits are great. And, uh,
it was the first class place and I,

332
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,660
I went to a bunch of places that
was the best place that I've found.

333
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:19,920
So free plug there, it, speaking of
that speaking and Oh, by the way,

334
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:24,921
everybody keeps telling me to watch the
fucking Lakers Celtics documentary thing

335
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:29,550
that they got on ESPN. So I
have to check that out. Um,

336
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,380
but before I do that, before I do
that have fucking fucked up too.

337
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,680
God Damn podcast, that
podcast, they fucked up the

338
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,863
password

339
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,730
ain't no complex. These things have to
be now, you know, I, you know, you know,

340
00:20:46,731 --> 00:20:50,290
I hate you fucking put a nice easy one
in and then they just say to you like,

341
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,730
Oh yeah, that's not a, that's not good
enough. That's not fucking good enough.

342
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:56,260
It's like, well, why
don't I determine that?

343
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,130
Why are you acting like I'm in
the Pentagon? I don't give a fuck.

344
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:03,560
You know what I mean? Um, oh,
you know what's hilarious too.

345
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,940
And now that I've got a, I'm
out of my bottom phase, um,

346
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,430
I still played to some Zeplin today.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

347
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:11,740
When I was over there.
But um,

348
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,830
somebody showed me his fucking, remember
that car in the song remains the same.

349
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,340
That crazy looking.
I don't know who made it,

350
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,600
Ford or some shit that he had that held
that crazy paintings and stuff like that.

351
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,221
You know,

352
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:29,920
you always wonder what happened to that
shit is somebody bought it and then

353
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,710
somebody else bought it
and now it's up for sale.

354
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,980
It's like 250 fucking grant.

355
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:42,110
You always going to buy that
thing. I'm, I'm Jim or say, uh,

356
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,210
the colts.

357
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,560
I think that guy's going to end up having

358
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,060
like the equivalent of
Jay Leno's car collection.

359
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,430
He's going to have that
with musical artifacts.

360
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:58,120
I mean the guy's getting to the point
where he can kind of fuck with the rock

361
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:00,670
and roll hall of fame.
He's got like a Prince Guitar.

362
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:04,570
He's got Jerry Garcia's guitar.
If you had John Bonam car,

363
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,010
I mean,
that really adds to the collection.

364
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,560
Then you put your fucking,

365
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,170
yeah.

366
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,580
Printers, guitars and all this.
Charlie Parker's saxophone,

367
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:20,470
whatever the fuck else that
guy owns in the back. Yeah.

368
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:23,260
Some hookers come over. He starts
doing blow, whatever the fuck it is.

369
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:27,940
He does mean it could, could be a
good time. No. Um, anyways, let's uh,

370
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:32,680

better way round a round. You turn to me.

372

00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:43,411

is take the upset down.

374
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,230

381
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:14,770
But what the fuck? How do I still get
a gift card worth hundreds of dollars?

382
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,870
I mean, if you get a bundle
and it's going to save money,

383
00:23:17,871 --> 00:23:21,020
I'm not going to come out around $300.
Then you get to give me 200 back.

384
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,940

fucking deal ever.

else. See you go, you buy shit.

407
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,970
You drown in your own fucking

408
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,543
okay.

409
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,840
Artifacts. Whatever the hell you
did. You find a black Tux, everybody.

410
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,150
Black Tux. There's only so many
opportunities in life to wear a Tuxedo.

411
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,750
So when your big day or special event,
what are the days,

412
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,913
you know,

413
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,610
getting married.
Going to a prom.

414
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,713
Okay.

415
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,890
Uh, you somehow know the mayor and
he's fucking got something going on.

416
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:05,320
Do you know what else did you
wear when you're on trial?

417
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,930
That'd be fucking hilarious.
Where it Tuxedo?

418
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,510
It's like you're shown respect and
saying you're a little crazy. Suny.

419
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:13,030
If they convict, you can be like, Hey,
give me the guy's out of his fucking mind.

420
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,170
Who is the Tuxedo? Who,
where does it talk soon?

421
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,560

there. Hang the fuck in there. Um,

451
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:16,130
is bored with my reading
as you are legal zone

452
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,700
in order to successfully run your business
attention to detail is so critical.

453
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,950
One contract slip up.
Ah,

454
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:31,010
Jesus or illegal misunderstanding I
didn't do it can really set you back.

legal zoom, zoom. Yeah.

456
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,500
You may already know that over a million
Americans have used legal zoom to start

457
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:44,760
their business, but legal zoom services
go well beyond business formation.

458
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,990
They built a nationwide
network of independent
attorneys who can provide legal

459
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:51,630
answers to day to day questions
you have about your business.

460
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,700
Because let's face it, things
like trademarks, employment laws,

461
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:59,280
and lease agreements can
get pretty complicated.

462
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:02,850
That's such a nice way of saying you're
too scatterbrained to want to deal with

463
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:04,080
this shit.

MMM. All right. So anyways,

497
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,680
I really fucking overextended myself.

498
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,503
Uh,

499
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:20,220
this month I said Yes
to way too much shit.

500
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,970
And for July my answer is going to be no.

501
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:31,150
I don't give a fuck what anybody
asked me. No a believe. No,

502
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,750
I'm not doing it. I'm not
fucking doing it. I uh, I got,

503
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,350
I'm on the road again. [inaudible]
chicka boom, boom, boom.

504
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:43,690
I'm doing the roast of David
Ortiz, uh, this week, Thursday.

505
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,560
And um, you know, I've got to figure
out how to, I don't do that a,

506
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:51,970
I'm not saying this guy, Waka Waka, but
this Booper bull bull, Yada Yada Yada.

507
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,910
You know, those fucking roast jokes
for some reason, the, the format of,

508
00:30:56,911 --> 00:31:01,390
of roast jokes is still from like the
1950s. I don't understand why that is.

509
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:05,590
I have to figure out how to do this shit.
Um,

510
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,910
so and so is here. You know, last time
I saw I had liked that it had a fuck.

511
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:13,900
You know,

512
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,220
they still use that except the young
guys now they all say aids and cunt and

513
00:31:18,221 --> 00:31:22,780
fucking, it just, it's just so
over the top, you know, nine 11.

514
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:23,530
It's always like,

515
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:27,640
I gotta figure out how the fuck to do
this and I only have four days to do it.

516
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,010
And of course I'm busy as shit.
So, uh, I dunno what to do here.

517
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,430
So, but this is the last
thing. If I just get past this,

518
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:40,740
which I will either by doing a good job,
a mediocre job,

519
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:45,660
or eating my fucking balls on it. The
bottom line is it's over. You know,

520
00:31:45,661 --> 00:31:48,120
it's a 12 minute spot.
I just have to get,

521
00:31:48,121 --> 00:31:50,910
if I get past this fucking roast,

522
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,140
the rest of them I've gone up the
rest of my year. It's downhill,

523
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:01,270
Billy. No Fund is saying no to everything.
What do you want? When is it not?

524
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:03,520
I can't make it now.
Can't do it.

525
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,790
[inaudible] know what it'd be like
that fucking buzzard. Way Back.

526
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,140
[inaudible] bashful
buzzard on a bugs bunny.

527
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,740
No, the whole market it
though. That's going to be me.

528
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,490
I have to start fucking
doing that because uh,

529
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,990
yeah, it's not good. It's just
too much shit. And I am a, I'm a,

530
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,100
and now with the kid, I'm
fucking, I'm exhausted.

531
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,690
It's nine 22 at night and I was
ready for bed two fucking hours ago.

532
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,370
It's just my cutie pie
doesn't asleep til about nine.

533
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,050
Um,
and you know what's great about no booze.

534
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:48,950
You sleep like a fucking baby. I
mean, booze, we'll put you to sleep,

535
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:53,090
but the next morning you wake up
and you're just like, you know,

536
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:54,940
yeah,

537
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,570
you wake up, you feel like you
should be tied to a chair, you know,

538
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,000
and there's some guy just waiting
for you to come around to continue

539
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:04,420
interrogating you by punching you in
the head. And then you realize like, no,

540
00:33:04,421 --> 00:33:09,200
I punched myself in the head with
all those fucking drinks. Um,

541
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,310
so I'm actually really enjoying it
despite the fact that drank the last two

542
00:33:12,311 --> 00:33:15,490
nights. I have one tonight and half
of it's built on the fucking ground.

543
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,990
All right. Fucking judge me. All right.

544
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,290
I decide I'm in my own Aa. Okay.
I still learned a chip today.

545
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,500
I just feel like for me,

546
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,380
having my own a is a good thing.

547
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,000
Speaking of from me in reality show stars,

548
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:42,001
you're not going to fucking believe
who I think was at that car show today.

549
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,480
We're walking around with
looking at data that's fucking,

550
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,600
this two door Cadillac that
I swear to God was like,

551
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:54,850
it was like two town cars put
together. Um, incredible fucking car.

552
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:55,980
Yeah.

553
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,250
Gigantic. Oh my God. I saw
this one Jaguar, you know
the one that has the early,

554
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,400
that one of the head in the
60s with the long fucking hood.

555
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:08,270
I'm not the one from the 50s that Sinatra
had that won the James Bond era one.

556
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:13,890
You know the one and like the patch
back open like a fucking regular door.

557
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,260
This guy showing it off,
right.

558
00:34:16,261 --> 00:34:19,410
He's got the back door open and then
the hood opens like the reverse way,

559
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,040
you know, from the windshield out looks
cool as shit. And then I look in there,

560
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:26,490
he's got like some small blocks,
small block Chevy engine in there,

561
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,080
you know, I don't know. That's
what you want to fucking do.

562
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:36,030
I don't know why you would
do that. Um, anyways, I um,

563
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,440
yeah,

564
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,240
so walking around and looking at those
cars and all of a sudden he is this,

565
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,490
these people on like,
you know,

566
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:45,000
the given out awards to cars and
shit and that there's these listings.

567
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:50,100
This person on the microphone going,
I think that's Caitlyn Jenner.

568
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:51,410
Yeah,

569
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:54,950
I think Caitlyn Jenner's. Yeah. And I was
like, no fucking way. I got to go seek,

570
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:58,550
I gotta go see K. Right. I've got to
go see when by the time we got there,

571
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,260
I'm not even sure if it was,
but like Nia said that Bruce,

572
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,860
it gets confusing. He sees, she
said she's really into cars.

573
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,340
So I got confused saying like,
all right was, was he not into it?

574
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:18,540
And then can that happen?
Do hobbies change?

575
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,380
Then I knew what she was saying.
It's like, no, he was into him.

576
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:26,650
He's always been into him
and now he's become Kaitlin.

577
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,090
Tr uh,
I want to sit transferred.

578
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:36,560
What's the fucking word you're
supposed to say? Transitioned

579
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,830
helicopter. November one,
five, three Sierra hotel on
with you. Information. Bravo.

580
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,700
Requesting,
talking transition through a transition

581
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:55,540
to, uh, you know, being Kaitlyn.
But the hobby stay the same.

582
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,623
Yeah.

583
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,680
There you go.
Who would've know that?

584
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:02,280
I would think you'd take up
some other hobbies, right?

585
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,450
Maybe you wouldn't.
I gotta look this up.

586
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,930
I gotta look this up.
This is fucking weird.

587
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,300
Cause I know you take hormones and stuff,
right?

588
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:18,100
So does that make it into other shit?
It's, it's fine. It's fascinating.

589
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,031
You know,

590
00:36:19,031 --> 00:36:21,390
and you know what's funny is they're going
to keep doing the same way they doing

591
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,660
the plastic surgery.
Whether,

592
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:25,960
you know it's going to keep looking
better and better and better.

593
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:28,030
You know what I mean? Same Way, you know,

594
00:36:28,031 --> 00:36:29,680
everything keeps getting
better and better and better,

595
00:36:29,681 --> 00:36:33,940
except for the fucking environment,
you know? Um, oh, by the way,

596
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:37,180
I did a fucking benefit the other
night and flea was in the crowd.

597
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,810
I can't fucking believe I didn't give
him a shout out for given a shit about

598
00:36:40,811 --> 00:36:41,644
bees.

599
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:42,900
Okay.

600
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,460
There was one of the few positive things
I saw about the environment last year

601
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,260
was that flee somehow. Got It. You know,
fleas up the fucking bees, a dying off

602
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,830
and fleet shows up like a goddamn hero
and that he gets into these beekeeping

603
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,030
stuff. He's got the whole
suit and everything. I saw
this whole article on it.

604
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,450
Eddie, he's, he's
hooking up like a little,

605
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:09,720
like there was like 10,000 of them
hanging out in his backyard. You know?

606
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,580
You know what's funny is that's one of
those things your neighbors would be

607
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:16,010
annoyed at because they don't
understand photosynthesis.

608
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,870
I don't know where that fucking word
came from, but I, I literally, I think I,

609
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,240
I think I used it correctly,

610
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,650
isn't that when the bees go from flower
to flower and stuff gets on their cute

611
00:37:27,651 --> 00:37:32,210
little feet, you know, a cute little
beef feet, you know what I mean?

612
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,660
And then they pollinate
shit inadvertently.

613
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:37,320
Yeah.

614
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,170
They're out there running errands for
the Queen, right? The Queen Bee. Um,

615
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,440
the fuck was I talking about?
Oh, I gotta look this shit up.

616
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,890
When you transition,

617
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:58,810
do your hobbies change fucking list.

618
00:37:58,811 --> 00:38:02,440
Am I going to get put on, look
in this shit up. Oh, come on man.

619
00:38:02,441 --> 00:38:05,340
Don't do this to me. Come on
Internet. Come on Internet. Huh?

620
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,530
Can you fucking work for once in
your life? You fucking content.

621
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,773
Okay.

622
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,770
Can you believe someone who can't even
get Internet in his whole house is

623
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:15,450
talking about having a chauffeur?
I mean,

624
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:20,451
how fucking first world country is that
habit change is easy when people move in

625
00:38:21,281 --> 00:38:25,310
your house for strategies
to change your habits.

626
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,080
Was that not specific enough?

627
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:29,710
Okay.

628
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,570
I, this has to be, I have to be wrong.

629
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:32,940
Yeah.

630
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,100
You transition to woman,

631
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,970
do your hobbies change.

632
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,583
Okay.

633
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,220
13 ways to master the transition
from college to the real world.

634
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,330
Habit changes easier.
How to successfully transition your diet,

635
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:56,430
nerd fitness, health, and your forties
wow. You know what? I searched to twice,

636
00:38:56,431 --> 00:38:59,280
I guess so Bruce was intuit.
Now Bruce is

637
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,910
Katelyn Katelyn's like, you
know, good on you Bruce.

638
00:39:02,911 --> 00:39:05,190
Way to get those fucking cars
cause I'm still digging them.

639
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,130
That's fucking amazing. You know, I
hope someone I know fucking transitions.

640
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,690
I just want to see that whole God damn
thing. You know something's got it.

641
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,450
Something, it's, it's gotta be something,

642
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,260
right?

643
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,090
Does your preference,
a color change?

644
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,020
If you taken hormones like you're
fucking would like the chemicals, right?

645
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:34,240
Is it at fucking amazing how I just
refuse to read about shit and I just

646
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,910
continue to ask questions
while answering them,

647
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:41,170
but this is how I come to conclusions
and then I can somehow legally get on

648
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,750
stage with the microphone
and do a fucking podcast.

649
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,730
I can't imagine how many people who used
to be men and are now women are just

650
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:52,600
slapping their female forehead.
They're transitioned forehead right now.

651
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:53,940
Listening to me as I'm talking to him.

652
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:58,310
I apologize to anybody out there
transitioning. I don't fuck them.

653
00:39:58,311 --> 00:40:03,240
Why would I think that? Yeah. Cause
she said she's really into cars.

654
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,660
It doesn't take a not to trip me up.
That's all I'm saying. All right.

655
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,610
Let's read some shit here, right.
Mute math and Cole bear. Hey Billy.

656
00:40:11,611 --> 00:40:15,120
Boom Bap. Boom Bap. Um,

657
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:19,650
thanks for putting me onto mute math.
Uh Oh my God.

658
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,580
That fucking amazing fucking incredible
band. They've got a brand new album out.

659
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,030
Whatever you kids say they got some brand
new shit that you can download through

660
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:31,980
the fucking air, man.
Capture it on your device.

661
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,470
Share it with your friends, man. Um,

662
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,231
this guy says,

663
00:40:37,231 --> 00:40:42,210
I've seen the name before
but never listened and they
are all caps. Fucking dope.

664
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,260
Uh, just bought a ticket to see them
on their tour in September. Dude,

665
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,730
you are not going to be disappointed.

666
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,310
They're fucking is good as their
bank or their, their albums are,

667
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:54,660
they're fucking incredible life.
Fucking incredible. Ben. Um,

668
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,110
and then he said to me,
he told me to check out these bands.

669
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,260
It says checkout big data in Portugal.

670
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,970
I don't understand this next sentence.
It says the man Comma,

671
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,890
I think you might dig them. Is the
man also a band? I'll look it up.

672
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,600
All right. If my Internet hasn't shut down
after that last stupid fucking search,

673
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,860
keep drumming and make Steven keep
drumming and making Steven Colbert or

674
00:41:20,861 --> 00:41:24,790
uncomfortable. Oh, I did this Steve
Colbert show last Thursday aired Friday.

675
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:27,190
I wasn't making them
uncomfortable. He, he enjoyed it.

676
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,950
I had a great time with them. He's a, uh,

677
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:34,060
I met him briefly one time at some
benefit, but uh, he's a really good dude.

678
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,180
It was fucking amazing to go back and do
that show cause that's where Letterman

679
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,910
used to tape and it's still
fucking ice cold in there.

680
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,910
It's still roughly like the same setup.

681
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,710
And it's just weird because coal
bears desk is over with a band is,

682
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,370
and um, I talked to him, you
know, during the break on and go,

683
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:58,940
oh, this is crazy being
over here. You know,

684
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:03,920
I did stand up on Letterman like four
or five times and this is where I always

685
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,950
look over. And Felicia and
Paul Shaffer, Anton fig,

686
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:11,840
all the whole band was over there and now
the desk is here. And he said that, um,

687
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:17,210
he asked Letterman where you should put
the desk and Letterman set on the right

688
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:20,870
side saying that he always wanted to sit
over there, but Johnny sat over there.

689
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:25,370
So out of respect, he sat on
the other side. That's how much,

690
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,210
you know, the level of respect that
wasn't made. Just amazing story.

691
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,750
The lead of a lover's SPEC that Letterman
had for Carson. And why wouldn't you?

692
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:37,400
The guys, the king of it all. Uh, but
Letterman was the car of my generation.

693
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:42,710
Alright. Phelps versus
the shock. Uh, Bill,

694
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:45,080
I just listened to your,
uh,

695
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:49,400
Monday morning or your Thursday afternoon
just before Monday podcast and enjoyed

696
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:54,180
your rant about the upcoming fight between
Mcgregor and Mayweather. I, it's not,

697
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,960
it wasn't a rant.
Was it a rant?

698
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:01,700
I just was discussing the fucking subject.
If I was screaming and yelling,

699
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:05,240
ranting and raving, that is
a fucking rent. You know,
I'm going to look up ransom.

700
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,280
I'm probably really wrong.
It's wrong. A mom, you know,

701
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,310
if you transition your
fucking habits change,

702
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:15,290
why the fuck would I be wrong
about this rant definition?

703
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:19,610
Come on. Oh, somehow I go to rant
now. What the fuck is that now? Rant.

704
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,080
You can't come on

705
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,180
definition.

706
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,520
Okay.
Rant definition.

707
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,830
Speak or shout at length in a wild,
impassioned way.

708
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,090
Yeah. She was still ranting
on the, I don't know. Wow.

709
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,200
I think this just goes back to me being
from Massachusetts in my ideas of,

710
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:49,520
of yelling and fucking
being out of control.

711
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:52,710
I just different than everybody else's.
But you'd want to say a ranted finally,

712
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,950
fine. Whatever. Um,
yeah. I just don't want,

713
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:00,570
I fucking hate most about that
McGregor Mayweather fight.

714
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:04,590
Aside from the fact that that Mcgregor
is only going to be allowed to box

715
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,310
B,

716
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,570
that guy's a fucking Swiss army knife of
death and that they only let them take

717
00:44:09,571 --> 00:44:13,500
out the spoon. You know? Um,

718
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:16,440
you want to fucking annoys the shit
out of me about that fight as I know.

719
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:20,910
I'm going to order it. I know I'm going
to order it. How do you lay off that?

720
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:22,860
Once they found out it's only
going to be a hundred bucks.

721
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,210
I thought it would be like 200 bucks.

722
00:44:24,211 --> 00:44:26,330
I thought they will both make
it 100 million, I guess May.

723
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,980
Whether it makes a hundred million
Mcgregor makes 20 million for whatever

724
00:44:28,981 --> 00:44:32,310
fucking reason.
How up is that?

725
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,240
I think the guy that isn't,
you know,

726
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:40,950
if they were doing the fact that Mcgregor
isn't allowed to do what the fuck you

727
00:44:40,951 --> 00:44:41,784
know,
we could do,

728
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:45,030
which is put Mayweather right on his
back and the thing would be over in 30

729
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,630
fucking seconds,
he should be getting 100 million.

730
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:49,920
Yeah,

731
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,860
this is a walk in the park for Mayweather.
This is his fucking strike.

732
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,210
And if we went the other way,

733
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,060
Mcgregor was allowed to use all
of his fucking fighting skills,

734
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,050
then may whether she get the hundred
million. This is classic, may one it,

735
00:45:02,051 --> 00:45:03,250
this guy's a fucking genius.

736
00:45:03,251 --> 00:45:06,880
He's getting an entirely his way and
he's making $80 million more than this

737
00:45:06,881 --> 00:45:10,450
other fucking guy. Um, anyways, he goes,

738
00:45:10,451 --> 00:45:14,380
did you see that Michael Phelps is going
to race a great white shark for some

739
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:18,160
discovery channel thing? I fucking
refused. That's a joke, right?

740
00:45:18,161 --> 00:45:20,200
That has to be a joke.
Do I have to look this up?

741
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:24,270
I thought you might like that one. That's
that. That is fucking ridiculous. I'm um,

742
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:30,160
all right. I got to look it up, dude. Even
if the shark was full, I mean, that's,

743
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:33,310
this is like the Mayweather fucking
McGregor fight. This is what he does

744
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,920
mean Phelps Swims, but he also does
other shit. He goes to restaurants.

745
00:45:37,921 --> 00:45:39,930
You know what I mean?
He hits a bong every once in awhile.

746
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:44,670
What the fuck does a shark do? It's
all it does. There's no fucking way.

747
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,730
There's no self. Oh my God. It can't know.

748
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:50,190
Phelps Verse Shark.

749
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:57,550
This can't be fucking real
Michael Phelps to race a great,

750
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:02,320
uh, to race against a great white shark
in shark week's Phelps Verse Shark.

751
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:07,060
Jesus Christ. Whenever I haven't just
been on the fucking Wheaties box,

752
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:11,870
not making enough money doing that.
Michael Phelps isn't done swimming yet.

753
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:17,180
The 23 time I'll be 23
time Olympic gold medals.

754
00:46:17,181 --> 00:46:21,650
This guy is 23 gold fought.
You know what?

755
00:46:21,651 --> 00:46:24,200
This guy wants to race us. You
know, we, of course he does.

756
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:29,360
He's done with human beings.
I think a shark is,

757
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:33,650
is a good tune up fight when you're going
into the ocean. I think this is who,

758
00:46:33,651 --> 00:46:35,990
I don't know who put this together.
Maybe it was Mayweather he sent me.

759
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:38,260
He always picks the
perfect fucking opponent.

760
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,380
You go in there and gets a great white
shark. You know what I mean? They're,

761
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,140
they're not known for their speed,
are they?

762
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,670
It's always dolphin zipping around.

763
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:52,500
It's always the shit that they have
to fucking catch. That's fast, right?

764
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:54,420
Than the slowest thing gets caught.
All right,

765
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:59,130
23 time Olympic gold medalist will
compete in the most adrenaline filled race

766
00:46:59,131 --> 00:47:04,131
yet when he swims against a great
white shark for this discovery channel.

767
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:06,990
Shark Week. All right, so
how do I handicap this?

768
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,390
Are they starting in the water?

769
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,320
Is the shark got to get up on that fucking
block two and wait for the whistle?

770
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,600
Are we've got a false start?
We got a false start.

771
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,780
We have a difficulty explaining to
the shark what the fucking whistle is.

772
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,520
He's just so freaked out that he's out
of his natural atmosphere here. Um,

773
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:31,450
and Phelps verse shark,
Great Gold Verse.

774
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:33,340
Great white is what they're calling this.

775
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:37,690
The retired athlete will take on
the oceans most efficient Predator

776
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,970
in a competition of speed.

777
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,320
Yeah.

778
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,630
Jesus Christ. Can you imagine, Oh,

779
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:46,700
who is Nike putting up the swim
goggles for the fucking shark.

780
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,530
MMM.
Okay.

781
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,160
All right.
And I guess Phelps tweeted something.

782
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,110
I was able to do something
that I'd always wanted to do.

783
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,780
Be in a cage and dive
with great white sharks.

784
00:47:59,080 --> 00:47:59,550
MMM.

785
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:04,350
Wait, is he married? He's got a kid.
No. Good Fam. First Birthday party. Hey,

786
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:08,780
happy father's day to him.
What kind of a dad he's got?

787
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,050
You know what? He's got all that gold, you
know, you know what's funny? The dollar,

788
00:48:12,051 --> 00:48:16,010
the entire US economy could
collapse and he's going to be fine.

789
00:48:16,011 --> 00:48:19,190
He's got 23 gold medals.
You just melt those fucking thing down.

790
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,200
You make a little nickel size coins.

791
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,830
That guy's eating subs for the
rest of his fucking life. Um,

792
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:28,790
Phelps great white race isn't
the only shark week special.

793
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:32,390
He'll be appearing in the
father of one will also join.

794
00:48:32,391 --> 00:48:36,160
I don't give a fuck about what he's doing
together.

795
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:41,161
The trio will dispel myths
and misconceptions and teach
Phelps the proper way to

796
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:45,520
get up close and personal with
hammerheads and great whites.

797
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:47,973
Okay.

798
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,480
You know what's funny about fucking the
discovery channel after all these years

799
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:54,310
of being the champions,

800
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:59,590
the absolute champions of
miss information about sharks,

801
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,470
that you'd always watched
their things on the sharks.

802
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,143
MMM.

803
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,220
You'd always watch these
things on the sharks

804
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,380
and uh,

805
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,090
while you watch the program, they'd
always say all this, you know,

806
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:19,150
these things are being hunted down, there
aren't misunderstood, blah, blah, blah.

807
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:22,330
But when you watch the
fucking advertising,

808
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:23,580
yeah.

809
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,500
For that week, Shark
week, it was always the,

810
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:30,000
there was like another jaws movie
was coming out was really bad.

811
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,210
So now I guess they're finally feeling
guilty or maybe some younger people came

812
00:49:33,211 --> 00:49:36,570
in on the discovery channel
and they're finally done a,

813
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,900
I dunno, shitting on sharks. So wait,

814
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,600
where are they going to be
in a fucking saltwater pool

815
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,140
if they're in a pool?

816
00:49:47,141 --> 00:49:51,680
I like Phelps for the simple fact that
I have a feeling that the shark's going

817
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,640
to go out of its lane and be disqualified.
And at the very least,

818
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:58,030
the shark can't do that little somersault
flip at the end of the fucking pool.

819
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:03,160
Um, Jesus Christ is this,
this is what the world is.

820
00:50:03,161 --> 00:50:06,580
The world of sport is becoming.
Um, I dunno, back in the day,

821
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:10,060
used to have those fucking fat bald
guy, strongman, Theo always bald, right?

822
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:13,270
Some about lifting weights back in
the day, you know, you went bald.

823
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,330
They would always be pulling
trains with their teeth and shit.

824
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:18,820
Yeah.

825
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:22,090
All right. First Time listening. Hey Bill,
first time listening to your podcast,

826
00:50:22,091 --> 00:50:26,670
my husband and I came to La for the Rose
Bowl last year and saw your standup.

827
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,810
We it. Thank you. Thanks
for taking so much.

828
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:33,920
Thanks so much for take talking
in detail about jazz and sports.

829
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:35,600
I think this show,

830
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:40,460
this think this shows a lot of respect
for your audience. We like cool shit.

831
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,380
Obviously we like to stand up.

832
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:46,430
Don't be afraid to go into technical
details about whatever. It's interesting.

833
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,370
Any who happy podcasting. Wow. All right.

834
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:52,330
There's two people that are enjoying it.
Um,

835
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:56,260
I think I talked about it a little bit.
Um,

836
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,790
I downloaded all of this fucking
miles Davis Shit. I am like a,

837
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:04,830
I was a huge miles Davis fan
like in the early nineties,

838
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,600
and my favorite album was in a silent way.

839
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:12,250
And I read his autobiography,
I got like fucking,

840
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,510
I mean I had all his shit on like cassette
tapes. I even got like on the corner,

841
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:20,950
which he talks about in his book how and
Herbie Hancock came out with chameleon.

842
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:25,150
Like that's what he was trying to do,
that head hunters album.

843
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:26,681
But you know,

844
00:51:26,681 --> 00:51:30,430
he's blamed the record labels saying that
they know they fucked up the promotion

845
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:35,350
of it. Um, but I got into
all of that shit and then

846
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:42,450
I moved to New York and I stopped
playing drums because uh, you know,

847
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:45,960
I was living in a walkthrough fucking
bedroom apartment and I just drums it too

848
00:51:45,961 --> 00:51:48,300
goddamn loud. I didn't play
for like five, six years.

849
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,920
And then I started back up again. So I
started in [inaudible] 88 and I've been,

850
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:57,870
I would like a five year break in there.
So I've been playing about 19 years.

851
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:01,320
Is that it? Whether it is, I don't know
what the fuck it is, but um, anyways,

852
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,320
Dave Brubeck Jess stuff here. We
got more drunk shit. Ah, dear.

853
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:08,220
Billy backbeat not the exact
error you were asking for,

854
00:52:08,221 --> 00:52:13,221
but Dave Brubeck's band experimented with
some crazy time signatures starting in

855
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:18,260
the early sixties. Look for the album,
the Dave Brubeck quartet at Carnegie Hall.

856
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:23,680
I bought it when I was a music major
in college and it was a borderline

857
00:52:24,051 --> 00:52:27,710
spiritual experience.
It's got songs in 11,

858
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:30,830
four aptly named 11 four.

859
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:37,670
Wait a minute, 11 for now. How the
fuck does that work out? 11 four.

860
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:42,420
So you just count. That's when you
would, you've count that just up to 11.

861
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,360
All right. So that's just basically it's
like playing three, three bars of four,

862
00:52:50,361 --> 00:52:53,680
and then you just play one bar three,
four and you just lop off that last beat,

863
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,270
right? Five, four, take five, nine,

864
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,950
eight blue Rondo, Alla Turk. Uh,
not only are the song's great,

865
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:06,590
but the audio quality is
impressive for the time period.

866
00:53:06,591 --> 00:53:10,070
Every once in awhile you can even hear
Dave or another member of the band blurt

867
00:53:10,071 --> 00:53:13,850
out a cool jazzy during a solo.

868
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,080
It really immerses you in the time period
and culture. All right. You know what,

869
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:19,220
this is a classic.

870
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:22,970
I'm going to download this and listen to
this with from really nice headphones.

871
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,470
MMM. He probably wished that I,
you know, did some drugs. Um,

872
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,790
if you listened to a checkout,

873
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,510
the track Castilian drums
at the four minute mark,

874
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,960
there's a drum solo where he turns to
snare off and does some really cool and

875
00:53:37,961 --> 00:53:39,910
creative stuff with his hands
and his sticks on the stairs.

876
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,120
If you look at Joe Morello Shit where
he's playing with his hands and stuff.

877
00:53:43,121 --> 00:53:46,440
And then once John Bonam playing
with his fucking hands, um,

878
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:49,570
I'm sure he Morella wasn't the first two.
You only got to do it.

879
00:53:49,571 --> 00:53:51,970
But there's just a couple things where
he's hitting with the back of his hand

880
00:53:51,971 --> 00:53:55,210
and shit and you see bond and do that.
But then there's also like,

881
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:59,840
like youtube and all
that shit did not exist.

882
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:05,900
Would Barnum was coming up so
he was over in England.

883
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:10,520
The odds of him checking that out and
actually seeing it is it's so fucking,

884
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:14,100
I don't know how people we're able to,

885
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,010
you definitely listened
to everything you could,

886
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:21,500
but to actually get to watch all the
venues fucking in when some something came

887
00:54:21,501 --> 00:54:26,240
on the TV, you just fucking sat there and
watched it. There was no hitting pause.

888
00:54:26,241 --> 00:54:28,850
There's no, all this is going to
be a rerun and if you missed it,

889
00:54:28,851 --> 00:54:31,610
you fucking missed it. Um, anyways,

890
00:54:31,611 --> 00:54:35,270
this guy says thanks and go fuck yourself
with that shiny new high head stand.

891
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:38,870
Jesus Christ. All right. Join in the army.

892
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:41,250
Yeah.

893
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:44,160
Hey Nia, if you want to come
in as a question for you.

894
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:51,050
Yeah, grab a, grab a mic,

895
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,220
bring in the Tyco and grab a

896
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:01,110
Mike Breaking in the TYC and grab
a Mike [inaudible], la La, la,

897
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:06,150
la La. Get your ass in
here. Do the pod cast.

898
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:08,250
Buh.
Where are you?

899
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,420
Oh, you're coming. It's hot as
hell in here. And open a window.

900
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,740
Why don't we open a window? I don't
know. I waiting for the okay. Can you,

901
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:24,930
uh, can you, there's a microphone over
there. Can you in the closet area?

902
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:30,960
Oh, Jesus. She's a, she's a cutie. Yeah.

903
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,880
Well I can't do a podcast and all the
kid at the same time. Jesus Christ.

904
00:55:35,881 --> 00:55:38,370
Where my multitasking.
Hey Body.

905
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,150
What am I looking for?
A Mike up on,

906
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:47,070
on top of the fucking thing there on
top of that, that thing straight ahead.

907
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:52,980
She's got it. Please don't tip over
my computer. Don't tip it over. Um,

908
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:56,220
all right. This is perilous here. I'm
holding her and as a computer here,

909
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:01,950
she's gonna knock it over and she's
gonna knock it over. What's up,

910
00:56:01,951 --> 00:56:06,940
Cutie Pie? What's up cutie?
All right, plug it in there.

911
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,830
Plug it in, plug it in. And here
we go. Ladies and gentlemen,

912
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:16,500
coming back to the podcast,
I don't need to put the screen.

913
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:18,590
You don't need to put a windscreen
on any of the window open.

914
00:56:18,591 --> 00:56:20,390
Can you grab your beautiful
daughter in here? Please,

915
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,510
please me.
Crazy.

916
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,520
I know, I know, I know, I know. All
right. Here's a question for you.

917
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:31,870
How did you pull the map up?
Alright, here's your question.

918
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:37,170
All right, you're ready? Dancing wedding.

919
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,590
Okay. Hey there, Billy back. Freckled uh,

920
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,140
my girlfriend and myself are attending
a wedding for our good friends too.

921
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:52,050
Gay Fellas, this is a very progressive
podcast by the way that you're doing.

922
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:53,063
Yes.

923
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:56,880
Oh well cause I already brought up Caitlyn
Jenner and I learned something today

924
00:56:56,881 --> 00:57:00,540
when you kind of freaked me out when you
said like, oh, she's really into cars.

925
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,940
Why did that freak you out then?
For,

926
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:06,420
cause I know I had to do the math in my
head. I was like, was Bruce not into cars?

927
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,600
So then I was like, no, wait.

928
00:57:09,601 --> 00:57:12,390
I remember reading sports illustrated
had Porsches and he was a pilot and all

929
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:16,830
that shit. Right. Does his pilot's
license? It must transfer over.

930
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,270
Do you gotta change the name of how fun?
How crazy is that?

931
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:23,250
And then you've got to go down there
and be like, listen, I'm this guy now.

932
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:27,290
I'm sure it's, it's every, everyone
knows their Caitlyn Jenner is alright,

933
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,500
so if you're not famous, but if you're
not famous, yeah. If you're not famous,

934
00:57:31,501 --> 00:57:36,440
you probably got to do who got some
pain in to do. But I am, I'm gonna,

935
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,280
you know, I'm going to get you
for mother's Day next year.

936
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:41,910
They speaking into a mic class.
Sorry.

937
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:46,440
All right, so here it is. Um, by the way.

938
00:57:46,441 --> 00:57:48,900
So I googled it when you
transition to your habits change

939
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:51,280
and nothing came up.

940
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,850
So I guess it does.
Okay.

941
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,550
What's the color you wouldn't take one
little thing would be kind of like,

942
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:00,040
Oh shit, now I'm into this. Have
you taken like hormones and stuff?

943
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:04,090
Like when something change, your favorite
color would change? I don't think so.

944
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:07,330
It doesn't affect your brain,
right?

945
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:11,230
Why don't you allow to ask questions
about this shit isn't be like, oh my God,

946
00:58:11,231 --> 00:58:15,820
what are you a fucking Trump supporter?
I'm really excited to go to this wedding.

947
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:19,290
He's saying, okay, these two gay guys are
getting married, great to gay fellows.

948
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:23,800
As he says, I'm really excited to go minus
the fact that they are dancing fools.

949
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,290
Could they be more stereotypical?
Uh,

950
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:31,870
my girl and that whole group will be
dancing the night away. Well. So wedding.

951
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:32,763
Yeah.

952
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,043
Okay.

953
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:38,850
Do you not want to do this? No,
I'm just trying to, I'm, I'm,

954
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:42,870
I should wait to hear the question
fully. Please proceed. Okay.

955
00:58:42,871 --> 00:58:45,720
You seem annoyed if any point you need
to walk out and I'm fine with it. Okay.

956
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,700
He says me for me. He says
me for me or me, I just feel,

957
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:54,990
he says me. I'm not a dancer.
Perhaps I shouldn't assume,

958
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:58,260
but I'm assuming that
you're no dancer yourself.

959
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:02,670
Evidently he is not seen
daddy's home rights. Um,

960
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:07,530
I'm the worst. I'm your standard pasty
white guy who doesn't really dance.

961
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:11,210
I don't like it. I don't really understand
it. It's just, it don't understand.

962
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,620
Just seems goofy to me.
I totally lined up with this guy.

963
00:59:13,621 --> 00:59:15,450
I have an appreciation for it.
You're on the bay.

964
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:18,960
You danced at the wedding though. You
dance at our wedding all night long. Yeah,

965
00:59:18,961 --> 00:59:22,550
I was drunk.
My girlfriend has her dislike

966
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:27,320
with my opinion of dancing after a couple
of drinks going as far as to tell me

967
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:29,060
it's a real disappointment.

968
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:36,950
[inaudible] that I don't enjoy
dancing. Oh, I love how honest she is.

969
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:40,880
You know, it's a real disappointment,
uh, in our four years together. Have you,

970
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,380
but I'm really,

971
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:46,700
this really went in and I completely
don't respect the fact that you don't like

972
00:59:46,701 --> 00:59:49,430
something that I like. Hey
Nia, do you like hockey?

973
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:55,400
Uh, I'll do what I do. Could
you just play along? No,

974
00:59:55,401 --> 01:00:00,350
I doubt that's a real disappointment.
Um, um, in our four years together,

975
01:00:00,351 --> 01:00:04,070
we've never really had any
sort of arguments other
than that one. Jesus Christ.

976
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:06,500
That's the only thing you are,
you about how you're very lucky.

977
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:09,290
How often do you guys go marry this girl?
He goes,

978
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:12,410
I don't try and guilt her into
doing something she doesn't like.

979
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:15,930
So I get a little hot blooded
when she does it to me. Hi.

980
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,390
Can she see you'll be dancing to that one?
How blood?

981
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:24,600
It wasn't a god robber.
Hundred and three.

982
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:30,230
Come on, baby. Do more. They dance
right here. That's another white guy.

983
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:35,210
Doesn't want to dance. They do more to
dance. Can we get outta here so we get a,

984
01:00:35,211 --> 01:00:39,560
yeah, invent herpes. Uh, well, what
do you think? What do you think? Oh,

985
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:43,911
Ruby Pubi Ruby Pews Day.
Um,

986
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:48,911
I don't stand my ground in what do
I stand my ground and what will most

987
01:00:48,951 --> 01:00:52,550
definitely become a disagreement
when I don't go flail around.

988
01:00:52,551 --> 01:00:57,160
Like the non dancing whitey that I am
or do I sack up and do my best Travolta

989
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:01,340
from pulp fiction and go attempt to cut
some rug even though I'll be miserable

990
01:01:01,341 --> 01:01:03,650
the whole time. Best to you? Uh,

991
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:07,490
your little one and season two of
f is for family has been great.

992
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:11,990
Thanks for the content. And go f yourself.
All right. All right. All right. So, um,

993
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,990
what do you say? Well, as I'm
snarkily said earlier, it's a wedding.

994
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:21,080
So obviously there's going to be dancing
whether they're gay guys are straight.

995
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:23,630
Like everybody dances at weddings.
Let's not,

996
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:27,230
I don't know how he explains like why
would he think that there wouldn't be

997
01:01:27,231 --> 01:01:29,760
dancing? Maybe that's not the, had
nothing to do with the gay guy.

998
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:33,440
He was just saying he doesn't want to,
he just doesn't want to dance.

999
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:35,980
No one can dance.

1000
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:42,510
Oh, let little thing about
me is a way that I wo

1001
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:50,430
I don't know. Oh listen,
girls that liked to dance,

1002
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,920
like guys that liked to dance with them.

1003
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,830
That's just how it is that the
name of a new reality show.

1004
01:01:55,890 --> 01:02:00,540
If you don't go in there and do
the why MCA and the electric slide,

1005
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:04,920
you can at least do a couple of slow
dances. How about that? Can you come? Hi.

1006
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:10,080
Made me outside.
How [inaudible] knows cashmere that um,

1007
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:15,560
maybe that can be the compromise. Listen,
I'm not going to go up there. YMCAS

1008
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:22,400
break. Good out dude. Dude, dude,
this is not the karaoke singing.

1009
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:27,120
So none of those things
were [inaudible] prince.

1010
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:31,420
Did we have prints at our wedding? I don't
know. Let's let's stay focused on, yes.

1011
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,680
I think the compromise,
sir,

1012
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:40,370
is that you should give your lady a
couple of slow dances and also also,

1013
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:46,260
wait a minute.
It's one night.

1014
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:50,970
It's not going to kill you to get
up there and like be goofy with her.

1015
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:55,050
No one's watching you because I feel
like there's a little bit of you that's

1016
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:58,020
like, you don't like to dance cause
you feel like you can't dance.

1017
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:02,970
Nobody's looking at you, nobody's judging
you. It's one night out of your life.

1018
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:07,410
Just be silly, have fun with it
and definitely slow dance with her.

1019
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,700
She'll really appreciate it.

1020
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:13,020
This was one of those times where even
though you don't like doing something,

1021
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:16,920
you do it for the person that you love.
This is what it isn't. My suggestion.

1022
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,350
You're not going out dancing
every single Saturday.

1023
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:22,350
Would you both for the wedding?
You should.

1024
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:26,640
I'm a little distracted so I'm sorry
I can't put my mouth like, you know,

1025
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:31,250
you want me to blow the damn
microphone? No, I just want you to,

1026
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,530
he can do. He just, hello?

1027
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:39,120
I feel I can't drive a car.
Don't do that.

1028
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,270
I just,
this is what he should do.

1029
01:03:42,271 --> 01:03:47,220
He should go go there and
have five quick drinks,

1030
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:48,293
five,

1031
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:53,250
five get fucking hammered and then
just go out there and then just,

1032
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,830
that's it.
You blackout drunk.

1033
01:03:55,831 --> 01:04:00,750
I don't think that's a good walk around
like a fish out of water the next day.

1034
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:01,381
I don't agree.

1035
01:04:01,381 --> 01:04:03,930
When you're hung over and you're
laying there and she's giving you look,

1036
01:04:03,931 --> 01:04:07,560
she just looked at her and your best Clint
Eastwood voice and you just feel like

1037
01:04:07,561 --> 01:04:11,910
it was your idea.
You want me to dance?

1038
01:04:11,911 --> 01:04:13,890
These are the rules that would
just sell. It said, listen,

1039
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,950
I'm going to dance my ass off that night.
Okay,

1040
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:20,610
and I want you to know how stupid I'm
going to feel. I'm doing this for you.

1041
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:24,870
However, these are the rules. You
line up five shots. I'm doing those

1042
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:29,220
like Mister Blonde
going through that bank.

1043
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,620
That bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

1044
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,910
If you had made me go out
on the fucking dance floor,

1045
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:41,440
I don't think he should get a good
mister blonde. That was all right.

1046
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,950
I don't think he should be five shots
wasted. Break. Thank [inaudible].

1047
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:49,290
Would you accept three? I would
take two and see how it goes. Oh,

1048
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:52,680
you're the worst three. Give him
three. This gives us a major anxiety.

1049
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:56,340
Need to think of all this stuff you
all like to do, right? Exactly. Yeah,

1050
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:58,950
but I'm just saying at,
well how about this?

1051
01:04:58,951 --> 01:05:02,520
Can he at least give her us
salad before he gets wasted?

1052
01:05:02,521 --> 01:05:05,520
Can you just give her a slow,
cause we love slow dances.

1053
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:07,290
They don't start with the slow dance.

1054
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:11,670
I know you go out there and it's like
immediately like medially. Get down on it.

1055
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:16,210
Yeah, get down on it.
Don't Du du, Du du Du du

1056
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,270
Du du Doo Doo Doo Doo

1057
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:19,950
to the pain.
Was it?

1058
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:23,390
I'm just barely doing the neutron dates.

1059
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,750
The team and someone stole
my brand new Chevrolet.

1060
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:34,330
Yeah. At that point you've got to be like,
you gotta be like fucking, you gotta be,

1061
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:38,500
you gotta be five shots in.
It's one night out of your life.

1062
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:42,650
Do it cause you love her.
Chosed and say,

1063
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:47,950
this is my dancing for the
year given love you Mo.

1064
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:55,900
He's gotta be Shit faced. Can you
just let the guy get drunk? Nia,

1065
01:05:55,901 --> 01:05:58,450
I don't say this a lot. I don't see
this lot. This is a white thing.

1066
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:03,640
What do you mean we don't do, we don't
dance. Why people dance all the time.

1067
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:07,480
Fred Astaire. We did do it
professionally. We just don't do it.

1068
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:14,860
Read reason. One of those
people on dancing with the
stars and that's it. I know.

1069
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:19,250
All right. Here's another one for a
girl at Jujitsu. Hey, Billy Biloxi.

1070
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:22,970
So my dilemma

1071
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,970
is I'm 18 and I've checked on my,

1072
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,270
it's hot is frigging Health Indiana.

1073
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:32,170
You turn the AC on because what am I
supposed to, oh, I'll hit pause. Hang on.

1074
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:34,360
All right, I'm back. Here we go.

1075
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:37,360
So my dilemma is I'm 18 and
I've just finished the first,

1076
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:40,600
my first year of college a few months
ago and I've been hitting the gym.

1077
01:06:40,601 --> 01:06:44,710
Good for you as much as possible. Good
for you. And I've been going to Jujitsu.

1078
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:49,810
You're crushing it for the past couple
of months. Anyway, first day going there,

1079
01:06:49,811 --> 01:06:54,220
I noticed a girl in the beginner's class
with me and thought she was hot and

1080
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:57,160
she's doing Jujitsu.
This is,

1081
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:01,870
this is nothing but a great stuff so
far. Uh, so after a couple of weeks,

1082
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,180
I work up the nerve to talk to work.
Good for you.

1083
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,960
Turns out I went to school with the
younger brothers, something in common.

1084
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,730
This is like all rainbows right now.

1085
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:13,300
And I was also the youngest in my year,

1086
01:07:13,301 --> 01:07:17,530
so I think she might be 19 or 20.
Jesus Christ,

1087
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:22,420
this is just all aces. Uh Oh. Why does
my computer screen keeps shutting down?

1088
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,480
Um, I don't know. Anyway, after
train, I don't know. Anyway,

1089
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:29,830
after training yesterday I asked her,
I asked for her snapchat.

1090
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:34,540
Is that the way millennials as for
digits now. I never even said digits.

1091
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:37,750
I'd be like, what's your
number? Can I call you?

1092
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:40,370
You like my z Kaveri cheese.

1093
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:44,950
Daisy Buchanan instilled itself Micmac it.

1094
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:48,880
Try not to curse in front of her even
though I've already done it 50 times here.

1095
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,340
I don't know any, I don't know.
Anyway, it's a triple blah blah.

1096
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,210
And she gave it to me and
after I asked her for it,

1097
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:58,660
I felt like a weight had been lifted
because I've never really talked to that

1098
01:07:58,661 --> 01:08:01,990
many girls, let alone get their
snapchat or whatever is good for you.

1099
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:07,660
Cause I'm incredibly reluctant and
a bit scared to talk to them. Yeah,

1100
01:08:07,661 --> 01:08:10,960
pathetic. I know, but I think this
girl, his girlfriend material,

1101
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:14,200
that's not pathetic.
Not just a fuck one time bitch.

1102
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:18,560
That was pathetic. Yeah. He really
just made a left turn there.

1103
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:22,940
That statement was pathetic. He kind of
built himself up as the AW shucks guy.

1104
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:27,650
Yeah. And then he now turn it around
into, now he's a lady killer. Yeah.

1105
01:08:27,651 --> 01:08:31,220
Well I know what it is.
What he's afraid of.

1106
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:36,380
Low of whatever. No, no g see what you
just did you just turn her off. Alright,

1107
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:41,330
I think I'm solo on this one. Um,
so Billy boy, what should I do?

1108
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,820
How should I go about this?
How should I text her?

1109
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:47,720
Any advice would be a pro appreciated.
Loved the podcast.

1110
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:51,410
Wouldn't mind hearing for the lovely
knee as input to have possible.

1111
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:57,170
We'd love for you. Can you just
let a guy be a guy woods near?

1112
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:59,870
That's the equivalent. You guys being
like, well what does he do for a living?

1113
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:03,710
How much does he make the, Oh,
what size house could I get when I,

1114
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,710
oh, is that the equivalent bill? Yes.

1115
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:11,540
Equivalents equivalent as equal. Nobody's
onsite that at least not on my son.

1116
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:14,660
Oh, sorry. And I, God, for me,

1117
01:09:14,661 --> 01:09:19,360
I feel I need a twin from house.
However your friends talk,

1118
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:22,550
we'd love for you to like play
a Gig in Ireland sometime.

1119
01:09:22,551 --> 01:09:25,670
Thanks to go f yourself too. I played
a Gig, I played three last year.

1120
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:30,350
I went from Dublin up to Belfast and out
to Galway and an Isosceles triangle of

1121
01:09:30,351 --> 01:09:33,190
freckled. Fuckos I perform two
out there. Are you trying to be

1122
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:37,650
bad ass with this whole,
not a one time bitch fuck type of thing.

1123
01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:41,370
Like what was that? What was that
little statement he threw in there?

1124
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,930
Because that did really turn me off.

1125
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,430
Why do you keep latching onto that?
This guy has all kinds of great qualities.

1126
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:51,200
He's 18 he's, he's, he's
one year into college. Okay.

1127
01:09:51,201 --> 01:09:54,710
He's hitting the gym, he's taking
Jujitsu. He saw a beautiful woman.

1128
01:09:54,711 --> 01:09:58,460
He was smitten by her and he's nervous.
Okay.

1129
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,260
He loosely used it's locker room talk to,
they just don't understand why he has,

1130
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:09,030
I just don't build a wall
around categorizing girls
that he doesn't even know.

1131
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:14,500
And so this is like the kind of bitches
fuck ones and this is girlfriend

1132
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:16,750
material. Go fuckers. So
how about your neither,

1133
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:18,430
how about you're not going to get laid?

1134
01:10:18,431 --> 01:10:20,920
And you're an asshole that won't have
a girlfriend. And how about that?

1135
01:10:20,921 --> 01:10:21,754
How does that feel,

1136
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:27,050
Mimi? How Sad. How about
dad? It's gets me out. Yeah,

1137
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,270
you guys do the same thing.

1138
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:35,500
We're not talking about what you
guys do and what everybody else does.

1139
01:10:35,501 --> 01:10:39,870
I'm talking about this person that wrote
in this question. Okay, that's not,

1140
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:43,720
that's not what this conversation is
about. What everybody knows child,

1141
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:48,930
I want her to feel my
passion. Okay. No. Oh her,

1142
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:54,430
her. Um, I'm not, we are,
we're not discussing what
women do versus what men do.

1143
01:10:54,431 --> 01:10:59,230
We're talking about this particular
person who is like, oh good for you.

1144
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,950
You got her snapchat also like snapshot,

1145
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:06,550
grow a pair and get her number. If you're
really trying to like come with it,

1146
01:11:06,551 --> 01:11:10,240
like don't be lurking on her snapchat
so you can like jerk off to her like

1147
01:11:10,241 --> 01:11:14,280
little selfie pics. I'm annoyed with this
person. I'm sorry. I just, you know what?

1148
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,250
I'm jealous of this person.
You know what son?

1149
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:19,910
I don't want to eat and he's working
out, you know, the general appreciation,

1150
01:11:19,911 --> 01:11:22,840
that little line that you threw in,
so married his wife,

1151
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:28,350
that type of way about
it. So, um, all right,

1152
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:32,970
here's my advice, sir. Here's my advice.
You know something, I swear to God,

1153
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:35,880
if you were a pitcher right now I'm
coming out and before you even get to the

1154
01:11:35,881 --> 01:11:38,460
mountain of taking you out of the game,
I don't even know what that means.

1155
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:41,640
It means you got way too emotional.
You lost your control and you're gonna,

1156
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:46,590
you're gonna kill somebody,
hit the shower.

1157
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:50,200
She's girlfriend material, not
just a one time the, you know,

1158
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:54,480
bitch you fuck was this guy cannot
run in from the bullpen quick enough.

1159
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:59,430
You've completely lost your composure.
Hit the showers on this one. All right.

1160
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,580
How do you know what kind
of person she is? Oh boy.

1161
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:07,910
Cause you decided because
you've projected what?

1162
01:12:07,911 --> 01:12:10,820
You want your fantasy because she's
out a real person to you, right?

1163
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,590
She's not a real person. She's just
someone you saw doing Jujitsu and is like,

1164
01:12:15,591 --> 01:12:17,450
oh my God,
this is like my dream girl.

1165
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:20,930
Not like those other girls that
you just like tossed to the side.

1166
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:25,100
You don't even know her. You don't even
care to know her. You got her snapchat,

1167
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,590
her snapchat really via.
Oh,

1168
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,940
a pair asked for the number
or stay the fuck away.

1169
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,920
Don't be lurking online like some kind of
creep. What does this person saying? Oh,

1170
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,380
he's from Ireland.
Colin.

1171
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:46,420
Mia,
don't Seamus.

1172
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:57,230
Shame is only airy. Uh, no
shame is this guy has no Seamus,

1173
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:02,440
I'm sorry. Sorry.
Patrick. Listen. Yes. Um,

1174
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:08,160
don't you hit [inaudible] guys have
like, oh, this guy's husband material.

1175
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:13,710
Yes. Well, all right then. So
why don't you relax. All right,

1176
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:18,390
good luck, Lord. I do get it. I
really got hot. You got grumpy.

1177
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:24,450
All right, fine. Yes, this is it. There
are days that you're like this guy,

1178
01:13:24,451 --> 01:13:26,040
you would not want to be in relationship.

1179
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:30,590
This is a guy that you just like bang
out a few times and don't ever see again.

1180
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:34,570
Yes. That, what do you mean
bang out a few times? No,

1181
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:39,900
you're right. You're right. Women do
the same thing. It's, it's 100% true. I,

1182
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:44,330
it just took 20 minutes to get there. I
Dunno. Just bug me, of course bugged me.

1183
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:47,690
But I am being a hypocrite because I've
certainly had those feelings towards

1184
01:13:47,691 --> 01:13:49,580
certain guys, so, exactly.

1185
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:53,690
And it's about time I start fucking
admitting then instead of acting like the

1186
01:13:53,691 --> 01:13:56,900
world ozo rounded drinks.
Now here's a man he's found,

1187
01:13:56,901 --> 01:13:59,910
he's smitten with this
girl. He's afraid, you know?

1188
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,690
So he just in the tooth
coming in their house. Yes.

1189
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:10,590
Well, this is what I would say. Uh,
how should you go about this? Uh,

1190
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,070
you're gonna have to do something that's

1191
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,610
probably difficult at your age.
And I hate when older people say this,

1192
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:19,990
but you got to figure out a way to
be yourself. You just gotta walk. I,

1193
01:14:19,991 --> 01:14:22,990
you've said enough there and I
think you've said, I'm sorry Shane.

1194
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:26,020
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I think you've said enough here.

1195
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:31,840
I think you dumped a whole bunch
of other stuff from other days.

1196
01:14:31,841 --> 01:14:34,690
Was it something I did? I don't know.
But this guy did not deserve that.

1197
01:14:34,691 --> 01:14:39,010
This is an 18 year old. He
just became a man. Okay. Okay.

1198
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:43,380
I overreacted a little bit and
he's a colleague don't to college.

1199
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:46,600
He's going to know how to defend his
family bag full of goodies. Right?

1200
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,730
With his Jujitsu. I'm just saying, if you
were my son, I'd be like, can you not?

1201
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,950
Can you get off at Nia? Alright, a
Moffett on. Yeah, you're a hypocrite.

1202
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:57,791
You're a hypocrite.

1203
01:14:57,791 --> 01:15:02,050
But what I love about you is you admit
what a pig you are like the rest of us.

1204
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:06,460
Jesus Christ.
Can you give the kid some advice here?

1205
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,480
What was the question?
He got her snapchat and he's nervous.

1206
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:12,320
He actually likes this woman.
What does he do?

1207
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:15,480
Is you just be himself just to listen.
I got to like I,

1208
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:19,900
I saw you across the room.
A man one was a little mini heart attacks.

1209
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,130
I really like you. I'd like to
take you out. You've got it.

1210
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:25,130
You got to go on a stage is asking.
Yeah,

1211
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:29,850
you don't have to sit there and brewed
in the corner and there no reason to feed

1212
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:33,070
. What you do is you, you,
you fake with those ones.

1213
01:15:33,071 --> 01:15:36,650
You just going to bang somebody actually
like you gotta be honest with them or

1214
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:40,330
else it's not gonna work.
So just a, yeah. Okay.

1215
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:43,240
This level one is getting filled up.
I see. I'm going to go. Okay, cool.

1216
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,330
I think you will get, I think you
both need a nap. Yeah, I know.

1217
01:15:46,331 --> 01:15:51,190
I'm sorry about that. Hey, we all
get there. Whatever his name is. It's

1218
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:57,190
my bad. Yeah. Well all you
know his name is Vinny. Um,

1219
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:58,543
all right.

1220
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,093
Okay.

1221
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:04,560
Dancing at the wedding. I already
did that girl, that Jiu Jitsu.

1222
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:09,000
I already did that. Did I answer all
the questions? Oh, joining the army,

1223
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:14,720
joining the army as you can
sail the seven seas in the army.

1224
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:21,060
You can eat some mushy peas in the arm.
You'll get joining the army. Dear William,

1225
01:16:21,061 --> 01:16:21,894
no fun.

1226
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:26,490
I'll skip all the ass kissing since you
blow through all your bolts through on

1227
01:16:26,491 --> 01:16:29,760
your reads. Anyways. All right.
I'm a 34 year old married guy,

1228
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:34,770
former navy vet [inaudible] who
is sick of feeling like a shitbag.

1229
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:38,640
I want to do something with my life
and feel like making a difference.

1230
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:43,740
I've kicked around the idea of going back
into the military for a while now and

1231
01:16:43,741 --> 01:16:45,630
it's shit or get off the pot time.

1232
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:47,923
MMM.

1233
01:16:48,690 --> 01:16:51,300
Why you want to go back into the military?
34 okay.

1234
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:56,040
I brought this up to my wife in the past
in all she can say is you're married

1235
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:59,940
and changes the subject,
so backstory on us,

1236
01:16:59,941 --> 01:17:04,170
we've been together for seven
years and married fiveish.

1237
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,810
We've had our ups and
downs like any couple,

1238
01:17:06,811 --> 01:17:10,520
but I get sick of being treated like
a child. It comes to my own life

1239
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:16,670
anyway.
I'm just about at the cutoff age cutoff,

1240
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,280
age wise to go down the
path I want in life.

1241
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:24,320
I want to be a combat
medic. Jesus Christ. Dude,

1242
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:28,970
good lord man. I mean how much
excitement that you need in your life.

1243
01:17:28,971 --> 01:17:31,940
You already serve and you want to go
back here and this guy's a frigging hero

1244
01:17:31,941 --> 01:17:32,810
here.
He said,

1245
01:17:32,811 --> 01:17:37,040
I'm a determined man who cares about
my family and my family and my country.

1246
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:41,900
I've done my research and I have the
time to join. Do the medic training,

1247
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:46,070
Goto Rasp,
ranger assessment program.

1248
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:50,260
You're going to become
an army ranger at 34.

1249
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:54,580
Did you guys ever watched that
documentary on Netflix about

1250
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:58,080
just to see if you're worthy of,

1251
01:17:58,210 --> 01:18:02,560
of going through like the week
long of 10 days or 14 days of hell?

1252
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:06,940
Only thing I remember was they had
this giant like telephone pole that you

1253
01:18:06,941 --> 01:18:10,420
intend of. The guys had to hold up
and do curls with it or some shit

1254
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:15,150
and his people quit.
The rest of you had to hold the thing up.

1255
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:19,460
I mean I was screaming in pain watching it

1256
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:24,520
and if you puked in the pit you had
to get your puke out of the pit.

1257
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,740
It was just like,

1258
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:32,550
just that beginning thing
was more obstacles than
I've ever faced in my entire

1259
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:36,740
life. Um, you are a driven man.

1260
01:18:36,741 --> 01:18:39,830
You're a special kind of person, man.
If you can, does special forces, right?

1261
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:45,140
He says then special operations, combat
medic training. My question is built,

1262
01:18:45,141 --> 01:18:49,820
what do I do here? Do I risk losing
her or stay here and resent her?

1263
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,650
I don't want to do either,

1264
01:18:51,651 --> 01:18:55,130
but I also can't continue to work myself
to death as a construction worker.

1265
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:59,030
Making someone else rich at the cost
of my health and happiness. Dude,

1266
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:03,410
if you want to be a combat medic
in your fucking putting drywall in,

1267
01:19:03,411 --> 01:19:05,810
I mean that's gotta be torturing you.
He said,

1268
01:19:05,811 --> 01:19:10,670
I've worked seven twelves for six
months, six, seven days a week,

1269
01:19:10,671 --> 01:19:15,410
12 hours a day for six goddamn months
trying to save money to go to nursing

1270
01:19:15,411 --> 01:19:18,110
school.
She tells me she booked us on a cruise.

1271
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:22,310
She spent that money on a cruise,
Lee.

1272
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:26,420
Oh boy. I don't know what
to do and I need your help.

1273
01:19:26,421 --> 01:19:29,210
Thanks in advance for your advice
and thanks for the [inaudible].

1274
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:34,280
Mediocre job on F is for
family. Go Fuck Yourself. All
right, here's the deal, dude.

1275
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:38,080
Um, what's going on in your
relationship and is a, is,

1276
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:42,800
is a critical lack of communication.
Okay?

1277
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:45,920
You're telling her what you want to do.
She's just saying you're married,

1278
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:50,420
changes to subject your, you've saved up
all that money to go to nursing school.

1279
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:54,890
And either she didn't realize that that
was what it was for and booked you on a

1280
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:57,800
cruise or

1281
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:01,760
she's one of the most
selfish people on the planet,

1282
01:20:01,761 --> 01:20:03,800
which I don't think you
would've brought that up.

1283
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:08,550
So I think what's going on
here is you're one of these,

1284
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:13,560
you're disguise guy, John Wayne
type. And like most of them,

1285
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,420
you know, people like that. You ask you
how you're doing and you just say, fine.

1286
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:22,400
All right, well you need to do what?
You got to open up. You got to sit down.

1287
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:23,191
You got to say,
listen,

1288
01:20:23,191 --> 01:20:27,480
we got to talk and you have to sit down
and didn't tell her what you want to do.

1289
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:32,690
Tell her how you feel at work and you
have to communicate and start there and

1290
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:38,100
work your way
to the ranger assessment program.

1291
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:39,480
That's what you have to do.

1292
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:41,903
MMM.

1293
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:47,730
Because other than that,
uh, you have a major blowout

1294
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:53,720
argument on the horizon and
her catchphrase is going to be,

1295
01:20:53,721 --> 01:20:55,340
where is all of this coming from?

1296
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:56,873
Okay.

1297
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:57,853
You know?

1298
01:20:58,860 --> 01:20:59,693
MMM,

1299
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:05,840
Yup. If you're one of those guys that does
stuff the right way, there's a problem.

1300
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:12,630
You can run into where you
have this expectation that
everybody else should also

1301
01:21:12,851 --> 01:21:16,210
do things the right way. And when they
don't, then you get fucking pissed.

1302
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:20,260
And uh, it's, it's all of
it builds it as complete.

1303
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:24,700
Like I lead by example and all that shit.
You got to learn how to communicate.

1304
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:29,930
So yeah, I would sit down with her and I
would talk to her. Um, all right. And, uh,

1305
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:34,180
good luck with that.
Those are amazing frigging goals.

1306
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:38,050
I just want to learn how to play Tommy
the cat. That's what I want to do

1307
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:45,020
anyways. That's the podcast,
everybody. I hope you enjoyed it. Um,

1308
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:47,260
by the way, I have, um,

1309
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:51,760
I have a number of friends on that show.

1310
01:21:51,761 --> 01:21:54,400
I'm dying up here and uh,

1311
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:56,800
they're telling me that
as good as the pilot was,

1312
01:21:56,801 --> 01:21:58,870
it just keeps getting better
and better and better.

1313
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,870
And there's a zillion shows out there,
so they really need people to watch. Um,

1314
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:06,310
the book was fucking incredible.
I know Jim Carey's names attached to it,

1315
01:22:06,311 --> 01:22:10,480
so I know it's going to be great. I'm
going to watch episode two right now. Uh,

1316
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:15,070

1317

comedy podcast network with,

1318
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:21,910
and it's just a friend in
general is killing it on there.

1319
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:24,323
MMM.

1320
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:28,340
I don't know. I hope you guys watch
the show cause I'm, I'm really, uh,

enjoying a family van keys. All right.

1322
01:22:33,121 --> 01:22:37,580
So what am I going to do here? Is there
anything else I need to fucking say?

1323
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:40,550
Anything else that I need to hype here?
Um,

1324
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:45,480
should I give a shout out to anything?
I already gave you a shout out to flee

1325
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:51,230
for saving the bees.
I wonder if enough people,

1326
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:54,230
fuck it did that,
you know,

1327
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:59,560
I still can't believe that
I pulled photosynthesis and
of my age and in a way I

1328
01:22:59,961 --> 01:23:03,860
came up with that one. Um, all right,
