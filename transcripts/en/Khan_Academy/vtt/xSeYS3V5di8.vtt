00:00:00.535 --> 00:00:01.949
- [Voiceover] Let's see if
we can take the indefinite

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.211
integral of sine squared x
cosine to the third x dx.

00:00:05.211 --> 00:00:06.838
Like always, pause the
video and see if you

00:00:06.838 --> 00:00:09.602
can work it through on your own.

00:00:09.602 --> 00:00:13.134
All right, so right when
you look at it you're like,

00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:15.267
"Oh wow, if this was just a sine of x,

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:16.877
"not a sine squared of x.

00:00:16.877 --> 00:00:19.094
"Well that's going to be the negative of

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:20.825
"the derivative of cosine of x.

00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:22.948
"Maybe I could have used u-substitution.

00:00:22.948 --> 00:00:25.322
"Likewise, if this was just
a cosine of x not a cosine

00:00:25.322 --> 00:00:28.101
"to the third of x, I could
have used u-substitution.

00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:29.899
"I could have said u
is equal to sine of x,

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.877
"but I can't do that over here."

00:00:32.877 --> 00:00:36.549
So the general ideas here,
if one of these has an

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:39.505
odd exponent and you see
that this one does have

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:42.153
an odd exponent, the
cosine has an odd exponent.

00:00:42.153 --> 00:00:44.458
What you do is you try to

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:47.016
algebraically engineer
this expression inside,

00:00:47.016 --> 00:00:49.208
so that you can use u-substitution.

00:00:49.208 --> 00:00:51.597
The way that you can do
that, if you have an odd

00:00:51.597 --> 00:00:54.685
exponent like this, is to
separate out one of the

00:00:54.685 --> 00:00:59.313
cosine's x and then use
the Pythagorean Identity

00:00:59.313 --> 00:01:02.888
with the remaining cosine squared
x, what do I mean by that?

00:01:02.888 --> 00:01:07.141
Let me just rewrite this,
so this can be rewritten as

00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:11.160
sine squared x times...

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:12.890
Let me write it this way.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.827
Times cosine squared x

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:18.996
cosine x.

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:21.316
All I did is I rewrote
sometime to the third power,

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:23.245
something to the second
power times that thing

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:26.232
to the first power, dx.

00:01:27.325 --> 00:01:30.513
And this could be rewritten as,

00:01:30.513 --> 00:01:33.779
sine squared x,

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:36.425
then I'm going to use
the Pythagorean Identity

00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:40.759
to convert this into
one minus sine squared.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.151
So that, by the Pythagorean
Identity, is the same thing

00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:48.151
as one minus sine squared x

00:01:48.157 --> 00:01:50.017
and then we have cosine x,

00:01:50.017 --> 00:01:53.934
times cosine x dx.

00:01:56.842 --> 00:02:00.150
Now I can distribute this
sine squared times one

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.852
minus sine squared and I am left with...

00:02:03.576 --> 00:02:07.451
Let me do this in a new color,
this business right here.

00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:11.569
Now I'm left with the
indefinite integral of,

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.144
Sine squared x times one is going to be

00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:19.635
sine squared x and then sine squared x

00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:22.264
times negative sine squared x is

00:02:22.264 --> 00:02:26.340
negative sine to the fourth.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.833
Then all of that times cosine x.

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:34.639
All of that times cosine x dx.

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.695
Now this is starting to look interesting,

00:02:37.695 --> 00:02:41.355
cause I have sine squared x
minus sine to the fourth x,

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:44.052
but I have the derivative
of sine sitting out here.

00:02:44.052 --> 00:02:45.963
I have cosine x, that's
the whole reason why we

00:02:45.963 --> 00:02:48.450
did this little algebraic manipulation.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.032
So u-substitution works
out quite well now.

00:02:51.032 --> 00:02:54.459
Because if we said that..

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.250
Let me do another color, I'll do purple.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.432
If we say that u

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.752
is equal to sine of x,

00:03:02.752 --> 00:03:07.296
then du is going to be equal to cosine

00:03:07.296 --> 00:03:10.773
of x dx, and that works out quite well

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:14.072
because we have the du right over here.

00:03:14.072 --> 00:03:17.618
Then this would be u squared
minus u to the fourth.

00:03:17.618 --> 00:03:20.238
Which we know how to take
the anti-derivative of,

00:03:20.238 --> 00:03:21.831
it's over the whole stretch.

00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:24.814
We can rewrite this as
the indefinite integral.

00:03:24.814 --> 00:03:27.341
Instead of sine squared
x we're saying sine is

00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:30.745
the same thing as u so
we can rewrite that as,

00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:37.033
u squared minus

00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:41.408
u to the fourth

00:03:41.408 --> 00:03:44.185
times du.

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:49.901
This is pretty straight
forward, now this is going

00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:54.293
to be u to the third over three

00:03:54.293 --> 00:03:59.293
minus u to the fifth over five plus c.

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.438
Then we just do the reverse substitution

00:04:04.438 --> 00:04:06.724
and then that gets us to be, instead of u

00:04:06.724 --> 00:04:08.414
we want to put a sine of x there.

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:12.146
So we're gonna get sine to the third,

00:04:12.146 --> 00:04:14.466
sine of x to the third over three

00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:18.325
minus sine of x to the fifth power.

00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:20.069
Let me rewrite that five a little bit.

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:24.080
Sine of x to the fifth power over five

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.385
plus c and we

00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:30.747
are done.
