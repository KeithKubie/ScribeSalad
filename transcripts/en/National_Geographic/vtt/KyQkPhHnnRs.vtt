( instrumental music )

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:08.574
<i>One of the things I like to
do when I'm in the Amazon</i>

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:10.042
<i>is just bust all the myths.</i>

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:11.544
<i>I don't want all this nonsense</i>

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.280
<i> this romantic image we
have of indigenous people.</i>

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.281
<i> They're just people.</i>

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.384
<i> You know, the reason
I like these pictures because</i>

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.618
<i> we've... we always go
 and look at these places</i>

00:00:19.618 --> 00:00:20.987
<i>to see how different we are and</i>

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.056
<i>what I... gets me about these...
 those two pictures</i>

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.524
<i> actually we realize
 how similar we are.</i>

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:27.960
<i> You know,
my kids do stuff like this.</i>

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.596 line:0%
( audience applause )

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:33.900 line:0%
<i> Manú National Park is in
the Peruvian Amazon, okay.</i>

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.302
<i> It's the far west side
 of the Amazon, alright.</i>

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.470
<i> At the bottom of...
 of the Andes.</i>

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.739
As national parks go,
it's pretty big.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.942 line:0%
It's 17,000 square kilometers.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.411 line:0%
It's twice the size of
Yellowstone National Park.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.413
<i>What makes Manú special is</i>

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:51.718
<i>it has the highest diversity of
life of anywhere in the world.</i>

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:56.489
You're dealing with a place with
1,307 ( laughs )

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.057
known species of butterfly.

00:00:58.057 --> 00:00:59.959
That's six percent of
the world's total.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.061
<i>It has 15 species of monkey.</i>

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:05.665
<i> Ten percent of all the
bird species in the world</i>

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:07.700
<i>live in Manú National Park.</i>

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.002
There's more tree species
in a single hectare

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.371
than the whole of North America.

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:15.141
<i>You know, this is just, it's
just nuts, the diversity here.</i>

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:19.045
<i>There's an undescribed species
of Poison Dart frogs called SP3.</i>

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:21.247
<i>It hasn't got a name yet.
It's only just been discovered.</i>

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.382
<i> A friend of mine,</i>

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.417
<i> a Peruvian Herpetologist
 found it.</i>

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.851
Who knows how many species.

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:27.853
Manú has got more
reptiles and amphibians

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:29.088
than anywhere else in the world.

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:31.591
<i> There's a giant otter.</i>

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:35.728
<i> A six foot long, eat
eight pounds of fish a day.</i>

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:37.964
<i> Eats Piranhas.</i>

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:40.065
You know, how bad-ass have you
gotta be to eat Piranhas.

00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:42.802
- I've eaten Piranhas, you know.
- ( audience laughter )

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:45.538
So, that doesn't mean I'm badass
because I've eaten Piranhas.

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:46.739
But, they are.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.208
Now, people say to me

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:50.509
"Oh, you know, I don't wanna
go to the rainforest.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.179
I'm scared of snakes and
like, biting flies."

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.549
And I always lie to them and
say, "Oh, you don't need to be."

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.185
Um... these things scare
the crap out of me.

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:01.487
- ( Charlie laughs )
- ( audience laughter )

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:04.490
This is a
Two Striped Forest Pit Viper.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.759
It's perfectly camouflaged,
as you can see

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.294
from the color of
the background.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:11.297
It's highly hemotoxic
and cytotoxic

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.998
and it hangs at
around neck height.

00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:14.200
( Charlie laughs )

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.368
What have you got
to worry about?

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:16.369
( audience laughter )

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.738
And I saw...
I photographed this snake.

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:21.908
I'd been walking within
18 inches of that snake

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:24.009
for about half an hour,
setting a camera trap up

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:25.512
backwards and forwards, back...

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.747
And then, my friend Lex

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:30.149
just suddenly freaked
and just shouted.

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.718
And they call them
'loro machaco'

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:32.852
it's the local name.

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:35.221
Alright, and our hearts
were going crazy because

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:36.255
we'd just been--

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:37.824
And then, so every
time we went near it

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.458
it would contract,
ready to strike.

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:41.260
And it can almost strike
it's body length.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:42.762
You know, if that thing gets you

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:44.764
you're gonna be dead
in 25 minutes.

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:46.966
<i> This is called a
 Cock-of-the-rock.</i>

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.202
<i>This is a supercool bird.
 I love these birds.</i>

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:52.171
<i>If you can't work it out...</i>

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.873
( audience laughter )

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.409
You can, look, you can just see

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.478
the bottom of it's
beak poking out.

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.813
Yeah? Maybe not. Okay.

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:02.548
( laughter )

00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:06.519
So these... so, one of the
reasons Manú is so diverse

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.786
is a bit of a cheat

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:09.621
because it actually
starts at high altitude.

00:03:09.621 --> 00:03:11.824
So, the Park starts
right up in the Andes

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.692
and it goes right down
to lowland rainforest.

00:03:13.692 --> 00:03:16.896
And this, and in that process
it goes through Cloud Forest

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:19.231
which is really diverse and,
you know

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:22.468
one of the least studied regions
of the tropics, actually.

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:26.272
<i>That is an Ocelot, one of
seven species of cat in Manú.</i>

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:28.107
<i> I think, I took
 nine camera traps</i>

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:30.342
<i> for three months
 and got one photo.</i>

00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:31.411
( Charlie laughs )

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:34.147
I'm not... clearly
not doing very well.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.983
<i> Anyway, so, these are,
 I guess what you imagine</i>

00:03:37.983 --> 00:03:39.852
<i> when you think of
 people of the forest.</i>

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:43.956
<i> These are, I guess what,
slightly mis-correctly termed</i>

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:47.360
<i> 'Uncontacted
 Mashco-Piro Indians'</i>

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.397
Uncontacted in the sense,
that they have almost no contact

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.599
with modern
western civilization.

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:58.170
I took this image, traveling
up through the southern

00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:01.707
southern part of Manú
on a boat one day and

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:04.910
a group of these women were
washing a baby in the river.

00:04:05.377 --> 00:04:10.082
Most of them vanished into the
forest and you know, we...

00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:12.718
You're not allowed to stop,
so we carried the boat on.

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:14.820
You're not allowed to
communicate with them

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.689
you're certainly not allowed
to go and talk to them or...

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:19.826
or, you know, get close to them.

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.994
Because we could very
easily give them flu virus

00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:24.196
and it could wipe out
their entire population.

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:26.932
This particular group
are one of--

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:29.701
They think,
around 800 uncontacted people

00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:31.304
living in Manú at the moment.

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:35.007
They've been more visible and...
since about 2011.

00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:36.608
Coming out onto the... you know

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:39.812
an area on the
southern end of Manú.

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.413
They've killed two people.

00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:47.519
So, there's a slow process to
come into contact with them.

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:49.021
<i>Last summer, I went into Manú</i>

00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:50.623
<i> to shoot a story
 for the magazine.</i>

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.958
<i> I went to live with the
 Machiguenga people.</i>

00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.027
And they're the most,
sort of numerous of

00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:56.795
indigenous people
that live in Manú.

00:04:56.795 --> 00:04:58.797
These people are
hunter-gatherers still.

00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:01.034
<i>I took this photo from a plane.</i>

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:03.402
<i> This is what you'd call
 a first contact hut.</i>

00:05:03.402 --> 00:05:05.104
<i>These people are living in</i>

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:09.074
<i>the early stages of contact
 with the outside world.</i>

00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:10.142
So, they're very remote.

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:14.346
I think this was 23 miles by
plane from the nearest village.

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:16.082
These people are,
they're really going to

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:19.084
only see people from that
village, maybe once a year.

00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:20.652
Maybe, do a bit of trading.

00:05:21.253 --> 00:05:24.156
And then I went to stay in
a very remote community

00:05:24.156 --> 00:05:25.190
in the middle of Manú

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.525
which no one's allowed
into, really.

00:05:26.525 --> 00:05:28.094
You have to get
special permissions.

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:29.195
<i> I met this family.</i>

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:31.464
<i> These people were about
 two weeks in contact.</i>

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:33.832
<i>They'd come down from the
head waters of the Manú river.</i>

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:35.234
<i> And these people have
 always just lived</i>

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:37.437
<i> very isolated in a
 tiny community.</i>

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:40.238
They've never been to the
big community village

00:05:40.238 --> 00:05:41.773
called Yomibato, where I was.

00:05:41.773 --> 00:05:43.742
This was their first trip there.

00:05:43.742 --> 00:05:46.378
So, the villagers always...
they, you know

00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:49.248
referred to them as the
uncontacted people.

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:51.550
And they'd come there and
they'd get... machetes

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.286
You know, stone,
uh, sorry, metal tools

00:05:54.286 --> 00:05:56.621
which is the most important
thing in the world to them.

00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:57.756
So, it was really interesting

00:05:57.756 --> 00:05:59.726
meeting them and
photographing them.

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:02.094
And as a photographer,
you wanna go and hang out

00:06:02.094 --> 00:06:05.964
and shoot people as they are,
shoot them relaxing and really--

00:06:06.331 --> 00:06:07.933
You wanna be invisible.

00:06:07.933 --> 00:06:10.002
But, with these guys,
that was impossible.

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:12.504
I said to them, "Have you ever
seen a white guy before?"

00:06:12.871 --> 00:06:15.841
They said, "We've never seen a
non-Machiguenga Indian before."

00:06:15.841 --> 00:06:17.943
They didn't change their
expression at all

00:06:17.943 --> 00:06:19.178
for the entire time I was there.

00:06:19.178 --> 00:06:20.513
They just stared and...

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:22.114
( Charlie grunting )

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:24.016
They were
totally underwhelmed

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:25.584
by the entire experience
as well.

00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:27.653
Here I was thinking,
"Oh, this is amazing!"

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:29.021
( Charlie grunting )

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:30.456
( audience laughter )

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:33.392
<i> So I posed them.
 You know, arrange them</i>

00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:35.027
<i>and try and photograph them.</i>

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:36.161
<i> Because it was all I
 could do with them.</i>

00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:38.230
<i> But, I kind of like the
portraits we were getting</i>

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.666
<i>and I lived in the community.
One of the things I like to do</i>

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:43.568
when I'm in the Amazon is
just bust all the myths.

00:06:43.568 --> 00:06:45.071
I don't want all this nonsense.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.574
This romantic image we
have of indigenous people.

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:50.309
They're just people.

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:53.813
And their culture is fascinating
and everything else...

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:57.950
But, they are just people and we
tend to over blow that a bit.

00:06:58.183 --> 00:07:00.186
<i> I went on the school
 swimming lesson.</i>

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:01.820
<i> And the teacher
 took all the kids</i>

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.856
<i>she put like, 30 kids in a boat.</i>

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:06.725
She directed everyone with
this enormous carving knife.

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:10.529
She crossed the river,
got out of the boat

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:12.531
and then just buggered off
into the forest on her own

00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:14.600
to cut guavas or something

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.234
and all the kids
just went swimming.

00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:17.803
That was the swimming lesson.

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:20.106
I thought this is the
way to live, isn't it.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.406
<i> This is Yoina.</i>

00:07:21.406 --> 00:07:23.776
<i> Every day, she would
 walk past our camp</i>

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:24.910
<i>with her Saddleback Tamarin</i>

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.012
<i> which is that
 gremlin on her head.</i>

00:07:27.746 --> 00:07:30.849
<i>And that was her toy, and
she'd take it swimming and it...</i>

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:33.819
it just absolutely hated water.

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:34.520
( audience laughter )

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.291
It was just this protracted
awful experience for it

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.625
going in the water.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.694
And all it wants to do is
get onto her head.

00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:46.465
So, I said, "Can I take your
picture?" "If you want."

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:48.767
She was so like...
you know, whatever.

00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:50.569
So for three days, I just...

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:52.838
I took every day that Yoina
went swimming

00:07:52.838 --> 00:07:54.907
I'd take this picture of her
with this thing on her head.

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.275
This is eventually
what happened.

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:57.676
You know, and her
story is very sad.

00:07:57.676 --> 00:07:59.578
I don't wanna bring a
downer on it,

00:07:59.578 --> 00:08:01.013
but I'll tell you her story.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.549
After this picture was taken

00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:07.986
the monkey died when a pot
of boiling water fell on it.

00:08:08.553 --> 00:08:10.556
Her mum died in childbirth.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.826
She now, wanders
around with her sister

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:16.195
who is called Grace Kelly.
I have no idea why.

00:08:16.728 --> 00:08:18.430
And she's... you can
see in this picture

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.932
she's got so many head lice so
she shaved all her head off.

00:08:20.932 --> 00:08:23.836
So, you know, just in a few
months since I took this picture

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:26.639
her entire life and world
has completely changed.

00:08:29.374 --> 00:08:31.544
- ( audience laughter )
- ( Charlie laughs )

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:33.980
<i> I wanted to photograph
 the education system.</i>

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:36.849
<i> You know,
 this was a story about</i>

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:40.185
<i>how an indigenous group of
people live in a national park.</i>

00:08:40.185 --> 00:08:41.720
<i> Well, they have
 healthcare, education</i>

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.988
<i>everything they should have.</i>

00:08:42.988 --> 00:08:44.857
So, I wanted to photograph that.

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:47.359
And this photo and
this picture as well.

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:49.862
<i> You know, the reason
I like these pictures, because</i>

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:52.264
<i>we've... we always kind of
 look at these places</i>

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:53.432
<i>to see how different we are.</i>

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:55.568
<i> And what gets me about
 those two pictures is</i>

00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:57.936
<i> actually, you realize
 how similar we are.</i>

00:08:57.936 --> 00:09:00.306
You know my kids do
stuff like this.

00:09:01.306 --> 00:09:04.176
<i> This is the wisest
 man I've ever met.</i>

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:06.411
<i> He's called Don Alberto.
 He's a shaman</i>

00:09:06.411 --> 00:09:08.314
<i>and he blew my head off with</i>

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:11.584
<i>the most powerful hallucinogen,
 known to man.</i>

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:13.319
Which is probably why

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:15.120
I'm grinning so much
in that picture.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.355
( audience laughter )

00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:17.323
What I didn't have

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.391
is any form of spiritual
connection with the rainforest

00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:22.060
because I don't have a spiritual
connection with anything.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.797
I'm the least spiritual
person in the world.

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:29.135
So, I thought, alright,
I'll be open-minded.

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:31.704
Blow my head off,
let's see where we go with this.

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:32.772
<i> And he did.</i>

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.881
Charlie:<i> According to western
science Ayahuasca activates</i>

00:09:42.881 --> 00:09:45.384
<i> parahippocampal areas
 of the brain</i>

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:48.921
<i> that are involved in
processing emotion and memory.</i>

00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:52.224
<i> Don Alberto describes</i>

00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:56.128
<i> how forest spirits will
talk to Charlie in a dream</i>

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:58.230
<i>and show him his true path.</i>

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:09.842
( Don Alberto chanting )

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:42.675
Charlie:<i> Snakes, wasps,
 spiders, crocodiles.</i>

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.645
<i> There were a lot of
 animals in the visions.</i>

00:10:46.645 --> 00:10:48.547
<i> But the only ones
 giving me messages</i>

00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:50.716
<i> were actually the
 rainforest animals.</i>

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:56.021
( Don Alberto chanting )

00:10:56.021 --> 00:10:59.925
Charlie:<i> Whatever he did,
it worked. It really worked.</i>

00:11:04.896 --> 00:11:07.032
<i> What I wanted do,
 was go on a journey</i>

00:11:07.032 --> 00:11:09.368
<i> to discover more
 about the forest.</i>

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.405
<i> And irritatingly,
 it was about me.</i>

00:11:13.405 --> 00:11:17.410
( Don Alberto chanting )

00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:23.582
<i>The understanding of myself and</i>

00:11:23.582 --> 00:11:27.219
<i>being given this understanding
by the creatures of the forest</i>

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:30.723
<i>was the most enlightening
 and profound experience</i>

00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:32.058
<i> I've ever had.</i>

00:11:32.758 --> 00:11:34.994
<i>It absolutely blew me away.</i>

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:39.265
So then, you know, a few
years later, do I feel the same?

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:42.434
No, I just feel more
confused about spirituality

00:11:42.434 --> 00:11:44.002
than I was before.

00:11:44.002 --> 00:11:47.806
But, I did see
the forest spirits...

00:11:47.806 --> 00:11:50.142
in my... in my visions.

00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:51.711
You know, I was out
for three hours.

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:55.581
I saw a world made of
toffee Lego, at one point.

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:58.617
I saw all kinds of, I
had a whole world of

00:11:58.617 --> 00:12:02.821
nice frogs on that side and
nasty frogs on that side.

00:12:02.821 --> 00:12:03.589
( audience laughter )

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:06.358
I was kind of rolling a bit
and then I was...

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:09.862
They were filming me, as you saw
and they'd talk to me like...

00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:13.065
because you're sort of... you
have a conscious level as well.

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:15.601
So, I was talking and I was
watching these blue words

00:12:15.601 --> 00:12:18.303
coming out of my mouth
and going into the lens.

00:12:18.303 --> 00:12:21.173
And at one point, I was flying
over the Shetland Islands

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:24.176
looking down on it.
It was crazy.

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:26.878
One thing about Ayahuasca, that
drug, I gotta tell you, right.

00:12:26.878 --> 00:12:28.514
It's made out of a vine.

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:31.417
They pound this vine and
they mix it with a leaf.

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:32.517
Right, and if you just...

00:12:32.517 --> 00:12:36.622
and you boil it for like,
a day, this pounded vine.

00:12:36.622 --> 00:12:38.624
And if you drink it,
it does nothing.

00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:41.760
You have to mix it with a
specific species of leaf

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.795
in order for your body
to really metabolize

00:12:43.795 --> 00:12:45.063
and for it to do its thing.

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:46.198
Well, that's great, isn't it!

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:49.935
There's 17,000 species
of wooded plant there.

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.570
Now, how did they
figure that out?

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.740
That always just blows my mind.
How did they figure it?

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.209
Pound that up,
boil it for a day...

00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:59.144
You know,
they didn't have Jamie Oliver

00:12:59.144 --> 00:13:01.347
or the Barefoot Contessa,
do they?

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:03.248
Put those leaves in it,
mix it up

00:13:03.248 --> 00:13:04.917
it's gonna blow your head off.

00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:05.951
Mind blowing.
