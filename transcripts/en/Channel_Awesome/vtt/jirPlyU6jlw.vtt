00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.200
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.680
Did you all see the remake of Beauty and the Beast?

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.680
That Emma Watson got some pipes on her, huh?

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.180
She's just like a well-oiled car, in that
 there's certainly been a lot of auto-tuning.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.360
[booing]

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.600
Good, good. I can feel your anger.
 The hate is swelling in you now!

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.240
Regardless of your thoughts on this movie (it blows),

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.960
most people can agree that
 Emma Watson is no Paige O'Hara

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.540
(O'Hara as Belle)
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere!

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.860
(Watson as Belle)
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere!

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.220
But if she can't sing it better or in an entertainingly unique way, why sing it at all?

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.100
This is not the first time in the past
 several years we've asked this question

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.720
Big-name actors like the Rock,
 Emma Stone, Pierce Brosnan--

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.320
"And I'm Javert!"

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.460
And of course, our darling little song Crowe.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.580
All have singing voices, most people would agree, are not that musically impressive.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.160
At least certainly not strong enough to 
survive in musical theater.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.500
For years, though, this wasn't really seen as a 
problem as when an actor couldn't sing

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.820
They just dub them!

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.820
Yeah, nobody even cared. If you could sing, great!

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.880
But if not, you were still loved! You just got 
someone else to sing your part for you

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.720
But recently there's been this big thing about not dubbing singers, even if they're not musically inclined!

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.100
Because of that our eardrums 
have paid with Gerard Butler--

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.700
"All that the Phantom!"

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.660
Marlon Brando-

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.940
(Brando in Guys and Dolls) 
"But there is room for doubt."

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.460
Even Eastwood gave it a try,
 much to our everlasting horror

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.320
(Eastwood in Paint Your Wagon)
"But suddenly my words reach someone else's ear."

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.060
So the big question is: if an actor is not a good singer, should they be dubbed?

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.700
Well, let's look at the pros and cons!

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.200
The big argument is that if an actor is dubbed, 
it takes away from their performance!

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.380
It's not the actor's inflections, tone, or even voice.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.420
So many would say we're not 
actually watching the actor.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.300
I'll admit there are times where an 
obvious dub can get in the way.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.180
Johnathan Taylor Thomas's voice change in 
Lion King is pretty distracting.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.760
Simba (speaking)
Well when I'm king, that'll be the first thing to go.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.700
Simba (singing)
I'm gonna be the main/mane event!
Like no king was before!

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.300
But then again, Matthew Broderick's
dubbing is almost identical.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.860
(Joseph Williams as Simba)
So many things to tell her, but how to make her see?

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.680
VO: Cary Elwes's dubbing is laughably
 noticeable in Quest for Camelot.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.200
Gared (speaking)
Really? I'll have to take your word for that.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.140
Gared (singing)
Everything breathes, and I know each breath!

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.960
But George Clooney's in O Brother, Where art Thou? 
has made the song a helpful favorite!

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.460
(Clooney singing "Man of Constant Sorrow)

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.520
I don't think that song would be as big a hit 
if George used his original vocals on that one...

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.820
Nevertheless, I get the argument.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.980
When a dub is really obvious, it CAN take you
out of the moment.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.040
But if an actor isn't a singer, why have them sing?

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.000
Isn't that the whole reason we watch people to begin with, to see them do things we can't?

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.680
Gregory Peck is impressive because he's a better actor than most of the people in the audience

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.100
Audra McDonald is impressive because 
her singing range is incredible

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.860
compared to anyone else most likely listening to her!

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.480
Both create an emotional reaction with their gift.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.440
Of course there are some that can do both:
Idina Menzel, Julie Andrews, Hugh Jackman...

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.520
The list goes on, but not for an incredibly long time.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.669
Most can either act well and sing bad 
or act bad and sing well.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.669
While star power is not quite as huge as it used to be
 in the past, it still counts for a lot in movies.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.359
And having a big name can, and usually does,
 bring a lot more people in

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.840
So the idea of putting in a big draw in a genre that's now becoming popular again is no big shock,

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.960
but forcing them to be out of their element 
in a field where people spend YEARS

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.140
tuning their gifts seems pretty unfair.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.360
Now don't get me wrong, Hollywood is the Land of Unfair, but if someone can make you cry with THIS:

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.660
(Michael Crawford as The Phantom)
This is the point of no return!

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.460
And it's being replaced with THIS:

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:25.280
(Gerard Butler as The Phantom)
This is the point of no return!

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.960
People are going to notice.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.520
But there is something interesting that's 
happening with bad singers and film,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.040
that sometimes could work in
their favor: having charm!

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.160
Compare, for example, 
two bad singers in two different films.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.520
First we have Russel Crowe from Les Mis.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:50.240
(Russel Crowe as Javert)
Lord, let me find him, that I may see him
safe behind bars...

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.920
Next we have The Rock from Moana

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.920
(The Rock as Maui)
There's no need to pray! It's okay! You're Welcome!
HA! I guess it's just my way of being me!

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.520
Even though both of these voices are not especially great, the Rock sounded a lot better, didn't he?

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.080
Look at how unfocused, uncomfortable,
 and uninterested Crowe seems,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.760
He looks like he's more concerned about how to carry a tune rather than being a passionate character.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.440
The Rock, on the other hand, listen to his inflections, look at how he's animated!

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.320
Observe how 100% in the moment he is!

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:30.620
(The Rock as Maui)
What can I say except you're welcome
For the tides, the sun, the sky!

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.440
Despite both these two not being good singers,
 the Rock is having so much more fun

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.040
and doing a much better job at sucking you in
 that it doesn't even really matter!

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.430
Now let's switch it around.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.599
Let's have another Disney song 
with another Les Mis song!

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.620
Anne Hathaway, by no means, has given the 
best rendition of I Dreamed a Dream!

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.880
There are literally dozens of other recordings of singers with powerhouse voices who can do it a lot better,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.420
But her performance is engaging, gets you invested,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.980
makes you feel every ounce of pain
 this person has gone through.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:13.740
(Hathaway as Fantine)
But there are dreams that cannot be,
And there are storms we cannot weather.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.340
Compare this to the Beauty and the Beast remake, where poor Emma Watson sounds like she's reading notes

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.240
in a recording studio rather than discovering her 
captor might have a redeemable humanity,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:30.400
(Emma as Belle)
There's something sweet and almost kind,
But he was mean, and he was coarse and unrefined

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.980
It's so cold, lifeless, and robotic that of COURSE
 we're going to notice the flaws even more,

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.480
as well as the technical corrections made afterwards.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.840
Now I know a lot of you really like this movie, 
so I will say this role can't be easy!

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.180
[Emma Watson] portraying Kristen Stewart 
portraying Belle HAS to be difficult.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.580
[ Booing ]

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:56.100
Good, good! Strike me down with all of your hatred
and your journey toward the Dark Side will be complete!

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.520
There's plenty of other actors who 
have won people over in a similar wa,y

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.520
despite them not having the most phenomenal voice.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.720
Johnny Depp's madness in Sweeney Todd distracted enough people to get an Oscar nod,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.800
Emma Stone actually WON an Oscar despite her singing being flawed yet beautifully vulnerable,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.500
and Disney once again helped 
Robin Williams's dazzling energy

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.580
leap off the screen in this larger-than-life roller coaster!

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.160
(Robin as the Genie)
Friend!

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.400
(Robin as the Genie)
Friend! Like!

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.380
(Robin as the Genie)
Friend! Like! Meeeee!

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.140
It's not great singing, but it's a great voice 
and sometimes, that's enough!

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.860
And bizarrely enough, it can work both ways!

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.520
In My Fair Lady, Audrey Hepburn is dubbed 
while Rex Harrison isn't,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.210
despite Hepburn obviously having a better voice than him!

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:47.580
(Hepburn as Eliza)
Lots of chocolates for me to eat!
Lots of coal makin' lots of 'eat!

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.640
(Rex as Henry Higgins)
--or worse, hear a Cornishman converse.
 I'd rather hear a choir singing flat.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.960
But again, this isn't what was needed for the movie.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:02.060
HER musical sequences needed to be huge and grand, while HIS musical sequences need to be snarky and witty

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.640
His form of talk-singing, as some people call it, 
works perfect for what's needed

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.120
while Hepburn's good, but not great, voice would have weakened what was needed in her scenes.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:18.280
(Marni Nixon dubbing Hepburn)
I get words all day through, first from him, now from you.
 Is that all you blighters can do?!

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:24.460
(Hepburn's actual voice)
I get words all day through, first from him, now from you.
 Is that all you blighters can do?!

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:29.540
Her voice is totally passable, but it's not huge and this sequence needed a huge voice

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.240
So yes, there are times where a good singer 
needs to be replaced with a great one

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.420
while a bad singer can just be kept and,
 surprisingly, they can both work

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.640
Sometimes though it makes it worse.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.880
In The Phantom of the Opera, Minnie Driver is dubbed 
despite the fact that she can sing

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.880
Just not great like an opera singer, 
which was required for the role

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:56.360
Yet everyone else is allowed to use their real voices 
despite them obviously struggling like hell!

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.710
Now only do we have non-singers singing,

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.560
But we have an ACTUAL professional singer
 to compare them to!

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.480
That just makes things a million times more awful!

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.740
So with all this going back and forth, 
what's it all amount to?

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:14.740
Well, maybe some actors should be dubbed while other actors should be allowed to sing.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.080
Depending on what's needed for the movie.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.640
If a non-singer can pull off the emotion of the scene stronger than a professional singer,

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.980
it makes sense to use them.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.380
If the emotion of the scene completely 
rests on how well the song is sung,

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.060
it should probably go to the dubbing department.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.480
The Rock and Hathaway have emotional ups and downs that their vocal flaws can make more effective.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.920
it also gives more leeway to hide their weaknesses.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.160
Watson and Crowe's short breaths and audio correcting can't be hidden as well in what's supposed to be

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.380
a grand sweeping epic, so it would 
make sense then to dub them over!

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.120
Especially when we have 
something to compare it to already!

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.040
It just makes it that much harder to make it their own!

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.900
(Philip Quast as Javert)
This I swear by the STARS!

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:08.900
(Crowe as Javert)
This I swear by the STARS!

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.380
And to those saying that dubbing 
takes away from an actor's performance,

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.960
I'd say it's like any other special effect!

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.300
Some are done great, some are done poorly,

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.759
but you still work with it to create an illusion that results in a strong emotion.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.400
It doesn't matter what means you use 
to get there, or who did the most work

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.380
as long as the audience is engaged by what's going on.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:33.460
An actor doesn't insist they do their own special effects makeup, they leave that to the professionals!

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.120
Yet they still have to act with it to suck the audience in.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.740
That's exactly how dubbing is supposed to work if it's done right.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.820
There's also no shame if someone's not a good singer.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.300
A playwright doesn't have to be an 
actor to get an emotional response,

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.980
a special effects artist doesn't have to be a writer to suck somebody into a new world!

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.260
So why would anyone expect an actor also has to be a singer to win an audience over?

00:10:57.529 --> 00:11:00.900
It's all an illusion anyway and the better it dazzles,

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.980
the more we forget we're just sitting in a seat watching a screen.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.000
We instead feel like we're being absorbed into a different environment

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:11.378
So rather than letting poor actors like Pierce Brosnan--

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.540
(Brosnan in Mamma Mia!)
Where are those happy days?
 They seem so hard to find.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.840
Or Lee Marvin--

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.660
(Marvin in Paint Your Wagon)
Wheels are made for rollin', mules are made to pack.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.700
embarrass themselves again.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.309
Just remember, film is a collaborative art form!

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.020
Asong as the focus is taking people on an amazing journey,

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:34.540
people are always ready to hear that music,
no matter how it's done or who sings it.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.740
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. 
I remember it so you don't have to!

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:27.150
Hey, Doug Walker here doing the charity shout-out and this week, we are doing the Waterkeeper Alliance

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.160
This is the world's fastest-growing
 environmental movement.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:38.580
With more than 200 local Waterkeepers patrolling rivers, lakes, and coastal waterways on six continents,

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:44.400
Waterkeepers defends their communities against anyone who's tainted their right to clean water.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.880
They speak with a single powerful voice as they tackle the world's most pressing water issues.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.920
The Alliance stands behind every Waterkeeper, increasing their ability to function

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.860
as community defenders in their efforts 
to protect the world's waterways.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:05.440
They support them by providing expertise in science, law, strategic planning, and communication,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.180
Making them more effective in their community of courtrooms and classroom.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.000
If you look at this site &amp; their YouTube page, you can experience all the

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.940
various ways that they help people get the clean water that they deserve.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.000
This is a great organization that deserves to get
 as much support as it can.
