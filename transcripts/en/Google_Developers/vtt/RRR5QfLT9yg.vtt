00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
IKAI LAN: Hi everybody.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.570
Welcome to another edition of
Google Developers Live.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.520
This is Apps Script.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.810
My name is Ikai Lan.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.960
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Arun
Nagarajan here.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.260
IKAI LAN: And we have a good
show for you guys today.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.210
There's a lot of good
stuff coming up.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.380
And before we get started, I
want to announce a few things.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.850
First off, if you haven't yet
signed up for our Los Angeles

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.790
Hackathon, that's happening
in the middle of November.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.460
It's happening in, I think,
what three weeks now?

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.140
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah,
November 13.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.230
IKAI LAN: Something like that.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.095
Go to your favorite search
engine, whichever it may be,

00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:29.950
and search for Apps Script
Hackathon, Los Angeles.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.770
We still have some spots.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.877
I'll be sending out reminder
notices on whatever channel I

00:00:34.877 --> 00:00:37.091
have, be it Twitter,
G+, blog posts.

00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:37.470
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Everything.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.260
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.840
You start getting bombarded.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.790
So we would love to
see you out there.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.260
So definitely sign up.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.893
And tell us what your dietary
preferences are, so we don't

00:00:45.893 --> 00:00:47.250
get you something
you can't eat.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.760
The second thing I wanted to
announce is that we've got a

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.940
very special Office Hours
happening next Tuesday.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.670
It's actually less of an Office
Hours and more of a

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.780
live session.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.110
We'll be having a guest from
the BigQuery team.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.800
And we'll be talking about how
to use BigQuery in Apps Script

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.459
to do large-scale data analysis
and import it into

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:05.930
your various Apps properties.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.090
So, we'll have a guest.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.730
That's next Tuesday.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.290
I believe it is at 4:30,
3:30, 4 o'clock.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.200
Either way, I've
posted on the--

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.560
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It's
4:30, yeah.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.650
IKAI LAN: I posted it
on the live sight.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.620
So go to
developers.google.com/live.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.440
And click on next Tuesday,
and you'll

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.490
see when that's happening.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.480
So, hopefully, you'll be
able to join us then.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.810
And, if not, as always, our
sessions are always recorded.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.860
So you could watch
it later on.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.910
So, Arun, I'm sorry.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.275
I've been taking up all
this time speaking.

00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:33.530
ARUN NAGARAJAN: No, no.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.700
IKAI LAN: And Arun has had a lot
of cool stuff happening.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.650
And why don't you tell
us about some of it.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.990
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.940
So I think I spoke about last
time, I've been really trying

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.510
to get engaged with the
community and go out to these

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.830
DevFests that have been going
on around the world.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.970
I went to DC, presented there.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.570
I also went to a Meetup here
locally in New York and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.160
presented at the Twilio
user Meetup.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.910
Talked about how SMS and phone
calls could be intercepted,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.680
and kick off Apps Script
events and services.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.500
IKAI LAN: And Twilio.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.360
Tell us what that is for the
people in our audience.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.690
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So Twilio
is cloud-based

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.560
telecommunications.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.900
So they're a pretty
cool company

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.470
based out of San Francisco.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.810
Twilio is twilio.com.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.140
Check it out.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.710
It's pretty cool,
very affordable.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.566
I think it's $0.01 to text
message, $0.01 a minute for a

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:19.820
phone call.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.740
So very interesting things
that you can do.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.900
Where, let's say, if you're
a school, if you're taking

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.030
attendance through a spreadsheet
through forms, you

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.560
can run an automated script
once a week and find the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.540
students that are being tardy,
or skipping class, and notify

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.020
their parents proactively,
rather than waiting until the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.220
teacher gets around
to that report.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.990
So things like that.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.370
So the fact that you can write
it all in JavaScript, call out

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.590
the RESTful services, with
authentication from Apps

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.405
Script, is, I think, a pretty
powerful combination.

00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:51.910
IKAI LAN: And Twilio has
a bunch of things.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.140
You can use it as an IVR system
for, you know when how

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.200
you call, hello, welcome to
movie ticket services.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.920
Or they also have

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.420
text-to-speech if I'm not mistaken.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.650
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.890
So you can actually have it
read out a blurb of text.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.490
I forget how long the text can
be, but a paragraph or

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.110
something less.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.240
You can have that be read out
by a woman with a British

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.066
accent or a man--

00:03:16.066 --> 00:03:17.180
IKAI LAN: I didn't know
you could do that.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.290
So not just robot.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.130
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And you can
play mp3 files as well.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.710
So it's actually kind of cool.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.750
And that's one of the things
that I'm trying to really

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.540
engage with the community is.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.060
The beauty of Apps Script a lot
of times is not just with

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.380
Google Apps, but to go out and
hook into other systems like

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.940
Salesforce.com, or Twilio,
or getting weather from a

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.850
third-party system.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.930
So URL Fetch can be a really
powerful friend.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.300
And it can do a lot of cool
things, especially because it

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.590
has the ability to do
authentication through

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.890
headers, OAuth 1 support.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.250
And we're constantly looking
to make that all better.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.350
IKAI LAN: Cool.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.206
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And I'm also
going to continue my whirlwind

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:01.040
tour of trying to get
to meet as many

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.200
developers as possible.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.770
So, this weekend, I'm going
to be at the SLC

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.720
camp here in New York.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.640
SLC stands for Shared Learning
Collaborative.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.570
And they're a nonprofit
organization that collects a

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.720
lot of anonymous data
about students,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.800
and stats, and behavior.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.810
And that data can be
used for mashups.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.880
And you can hack together
interesting reports,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.170
interesting analytics.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.910
You can actually provide
information to teachers and

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.580
education administrators
proactively.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.910
So it's sort of a Hackathon
where they're inviting

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.400
teachers, and students, and
also, in some cases,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.270
developers.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.550
And we're all coming
together to build

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.860
some interesting mashups.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.140
And I'm hoping to build a lot
of interesting things with

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.700
Apps Script.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.400
IKAI LAN: Cool.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.300
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And then
a couple more things.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.210
So the weekend after is
24 Hours Of Good.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.660
So that's also here
in New York.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.180
It's actually 24hoursofgood.com.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.802
If you're in New York, Seattle,
and San Francisco, I

00:04:59.802 --> 00:05:00.430
think, are the events.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.290
Or maybe it's LA.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.440
But check it out.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.220
I think it's really
quite good.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.040
And we're actually going to be
there, and give a talk on Apps

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.890
Script, and encourage
people to the build

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.370
stuff on Apps Script.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.500
And then I'll be at EDUCAUSE
in Denver.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.790
That's for a couple of days.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.410
And then I'll be with
you at the LA--

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.360
IKAI LAN: Yes.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.650
Los Angeles Hackathon.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.200
See, I'm going to plug that
as much as possible here.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.950
Well, besides going to events,
you're also working with some

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.830
of our customers and some of
our users to solve some

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.190
problems they are having.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.785
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:05:32.785 --> 00:05:36.390
And it's been really exciting
to get to know our large

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.830
customers, large partners,
that are doing some very

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.800
interesting things, in some
cases, running into some

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.970
limits or some issues
that might not be

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.340
apparent and easy to solve.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.860
So it's been quite good to get
on the phone with these

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.740
customers, do a Hangout,
and get to know them

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.780
a little bit better.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.370
And one recent experience that
I think is a little worth

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.840
noting is a customer
deployed globally.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.480
I think they had 40,000 or
50,000 users worldwide with a

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.840
lot of interesting use cases
around workflow.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.120
So they wanted to be able to
come up with a document

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.220
approval workflow.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.520
And email was going to be the
mechanism to notify when

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.405
something gets delegated to a
manager for approval, or when

00:06:19.405 --> 00:06:22.330
something was approved or denied
back to the employee.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.540
And with that many users, I'm
sure you're aware, there are

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.920
limits around how many emails
a single account can

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.260
send out per day.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.250
I believe it's 2,000 for
a domain account.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.190
So we came up with an
interesting mechanism where

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.810
they could use ScriptDb as sort
of a cue for emails to be

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.570
sent out, that the main
script would write to.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.360
And then that shared library
with the access token to the

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.420
ScriptDb will get used by all
of these other worker

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.360
processes that run on a minute
trigger or five-minute

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.560
trigger, whatever makes sense,
spread out amongst multiple

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.700
different service accounts--

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.310
10, 15, 20, whatever
makes sense--

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.000
each of them that get the 2,000
mail limit per day.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.420
And they can pick up those
emails, and send them out, and

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.750
say I've sent this email out,
and mark it checked, so that

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.190
some other agent doesn't
pick it up.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.570
So, in this case, it happened
to be an interesting

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:14.160
work-around.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.980
But, with the power of ScriptDb,
which allows you to

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.220
share this persisted state
across multiple accounts, and

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.850
then have something run on a
trigger, you can start to

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.370
build some interesting workflows
that, in some cases,

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.490
can help you get around things,
in some cases, help

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.300
you build something really
cool and exciting.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.270
So if you're doing
things like that,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.310
definitely shoot us a note.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.170
I would love to hear
more about it.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.020
And it helps us to really
understand where are those

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.010
limits, what are those things
that you're having trouble

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.730
with, and make sure we advocate
for you internally,

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.610
and build those capabilities
up.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:51.150
IKAI LAN: Oh yeah.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.250
I mean I think it's really
important for us to turn up

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.600
the limits.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.295
I know I keep saying this,
but things are happening.

00:07:57.295 --> 00:07:58.030
Alright?

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.570
You guys just have to believe
me on this one.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.400
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.650
And it should be a process that
takes a little bit of

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.930
time, because your code, as
you know, are running on

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.160
Google servers.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.540
So we can't just turn the
knob and walk away.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.215
We have to really make sure
that it all makes sense.

00:08:14.215 --> 00:08:16.980
And, obviously, we all
understand the

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.423
issues around it.

00:08:19.423 --> 00:08:21.350
IKAI LAN: Alright.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.330
So thank you, Arun.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.150
So, normally, this is about the
time when we'd go over the

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.920
release notes.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.950
But we haven't been pushing
on anything

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.150
that's externally visible.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.260
So just stay tuned.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.330
There's a lot of cool
stuff coming.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.990
How'd you like to jump
on the Hangout?

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.630
Do you know if there's
anyone on right now?

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.940
Or, if not, we can start
with the questions.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.299
And if anyone jumps on the
live hangout, we can--

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:43.570
Yes.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.290
We've got a couple of folks.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.900
Why don't say hi to
these guys first.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.680
Hey guys.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.330
BILL: Hey.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.370
How are you doing?

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.110
IKAI LAN: Doing well.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.510
How are you?

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.285
Bill, is that you?

00:08:52.285 --> 00:08:52.970
BILL: Yeah.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.290
That's me.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.650
I'm at my secret hideout.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.720
That's why the background
looks different.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.940
IKAI LAN: I'm not in my
usual position here.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.260
So I can't see the
Hangout screen.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.300
But I'm just peaking
over when I can.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:05.870
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.170
We had some technical issues.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.590
And we decided to put the
Hangout monitor on our right.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.190
So, if you see me looking away
from the camera, I'm actually

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.520
looking at the folks
on Hangout.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.620
So I apologize.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:16.580
BILL: Cool.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:16.710
Hi, Arun.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.970
I don't think I've
met you yet.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:18.950
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Nice
to meet you.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:19.420
Is that Bill?

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.620
BILL: Yeah.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.860
I got caught up on the last
couple that I missed.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.775
So--

00:09:25.775 --> 00:09:26.420
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Cool.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.070
BILL: Nice to meet you.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:27.770
Welcome to the team.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:28.650
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Thank
you very much.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.410
I got my official Developer
Relations hoodie.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.611
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So it's
welcome gift.

00:09:33.611 --> 00:09:35.330
IKAI LAN: Those are great
hoodies, by the way.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.790
They're super comfortable.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.190
I was evangelizing for weeks
before I realized that these

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.230
guys didn't have them.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.090
And I was like, I'm sorry.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.630
There's one other gentleman
on the Hangout.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.030
You don't have to say hi if
you're shy, but we just wanted

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.280
to say hi to you.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.660
He's shy.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.840
That's OK.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.830
So, Bill, how are you?

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.580
BILL: Good.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.520
I see that you answered the
one question I had on the

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.430
Moderator about the Google
Sites custom URL.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.280
IKAI LAN: Why don't we answer
that for everyone that's not

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:09.580
looked at the Moderator.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.470
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I think that's
officially the number one

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.780
requested bug fix of all time.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.470
So we can't--

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.670
IKAI LAN: Within Apps Script.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.940
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Exactly,
within Apps Script.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.092
We can't sweep that
one under the rug.

00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:28.390
IKAI LAN: So I have good
news and bad news.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.960
And the good news is that, yes,
we're working on this,

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.930
and it's on our radar.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.540
And that I'd like to think that
a fix is coming out soon.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.160
And, hopefully, a fix
is coming out soon.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.060
But I don't have anything
to announce yet.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.216
Just stay tuned.

00:10:41.216 --> 00:10:41.690
BILL: OK.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.280
So the bad news is
it is not yet.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.020
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.080
The bad news is not yet.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.160
But for those people that aren't
familiar, the issue is

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.945
that when you want to create a
gadget and put this gadget on

00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:55.070
the Sites page, and the Sites
page is mapped to a custom

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.450
domain, it won't work because of
various cross-domain issues

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.860
and authorization.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.700
It's completely cross-domain,
if I'm not mistaken.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.630
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.200
It's completely to do with the
security and authentication.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.380
Because we're serving the
scripts off of .Google.com, we

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.570
need to make extra sure
that it's sanitized.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.570
And there's no cross-frame
communication going on.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.270
So we've been in close touch
with our developers, and

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.720
engineers, and our security
analysts.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.650
And we've explained to them how
important this is, and how

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.630
critical this is.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.610
And, obviously, all this
information that's been--

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.450
including the ones in all
caps-- all the comments

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.700
do get passed on.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.450
And we do review it and ensure
that it makes sense to fix,

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.590
and this one without a doubt.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.850
IKAI LAN: I don't know if I'd
pass on the ones in all caps.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.430
I do pass on the other ones.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:42.590
No.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.620
This is definitely a very
important issue.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.820
It's a really bad experience.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.680
People go ahead and create this
gadget, and you go to

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.630
custom domain, and the
gadget stops working.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.962
So, hopefully, we'll have this
fixed for you very soon.

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.440
BILL: I think it's something,
just from the developer

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.600
community prospective, just
to know that it's

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.140
being worked on.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:01.840
Because I recognize that is a
pretty serious security issue.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.230
So I don't have any problem with
you guys doing a great

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.840
job building it right.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.240
The important part was getting
an idea that it is actually

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.640
something that is actively
[NEW USER ENTERED HANGOUT]

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.540
being worked on.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.370
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:11.940
IKAI LAN: Yep.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.310
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Without
a doubt.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.230
BILL: I did have one question
I didn't put in there not

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.920
related to that.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.240
IKAI LAN: Sure.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.640
BILL: I've been trying to
empirically find out how many

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.970
bits of things I can get in a
ScriptDb by stuffing it with a

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:25.180
known size.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.390
So I've got a script that's
running, trying to figure--

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.250
IKAI LAN: There is
a specific limit.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.180
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.530
BILL: Yeah, 200 megabyte.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:31.850
Right?

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:32.690
For the paid domain.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:33.590
IKAI LAN: Oh, it's
up to 200, OK.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.640
I was going to say it was 50.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.710
BILL: A personal
account is 50.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:43.625
A free Google Apps domain is
100, and a paid domain is 200.

00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:44.120
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.650
BILL: So I want to know, with
200, how many objects is that?

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:49.630
That's in megabytes.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.070
It's not in JSON objects.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.950
So I've got a script that's
running right now that's

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:55.610
stuffing it.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.540
And one of the interesting
things that I've found is

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.660
there seems to be a limit--

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:05.930
It takes a little while to get
objects into the database.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.190
So I think it's going to take me
a while to actually get to

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.980
the upper limit.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.740
Is there any bottlenecks
or anything?

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.780
I've tried the batch.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.190
I've tried saving individual
objects.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.020
I've tried saving
batch objects.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.505
Can you give me any
insight into--

00:13:20.505 --> 00:13:23.390
IKAI LAN: So, when you say that
there's a limit, you mean

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.120
that you're not able to push
things at a certain speed, or

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.357
that you'll put things
but they aren't

00:13:27.357 --> 00:13:27.440
visible right away.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.740
BILL: A certain number
of items.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.670
Yeah.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.190
So, first, I started by--

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:37.040
I just created a simple loop to
stuff a fixed-size object

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.660
into the ScriptDb and looped
through it a bunch of times.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.570
And then I was like, okay,
that ran slow.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:43.510
That's what I expected.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:48.640
I put it into a batch
save process.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.280
And it seems to go in about
at the same speed.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.280
It seems to time out.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.210
The fastest I was able to do
it was about 2,000 objects

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.480
before the script
would time out--

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.800
sorry, 4,000 objects before
it would time out.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.760
It's just one key value
pair, not very big.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.030
And so I just wondered if
there's some sort of limit.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:16.060
It seems to be a little bit
slow in accepting objects,

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.210
even in the batch mode.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.530
ARUN NAGARAJAN: In the batch
mode, you're only calling the

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.570
save batch function once?

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.332
BILL: Yes.

00:14:23.332 --> 00:14:27.060
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So you have an
array with about 4,000 or so

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.570
items, and then you call
save batch on those,

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.252
and it times out.

00:14:32.252 --> 00:14:36.540
BILL: Yeah, at around
4,000 times.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.320
So I just wondered if
there's something--

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.230
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah, time
out seems to be an odd

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.790
response for that.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.230
IKAI LAN: It does
seem to me like

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.490
something that would happen.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.680
But we just need to figure out
why it's doing that, why it's

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.460
stopping it at 4,000
objects or so.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.460
So you're saying that when you
try with 4,000 objects in a

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.180
single call, that
it times out.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.730
And if you try with more,
it times out.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.285
If you try with fewer,
it does not time out?

00:14:59.285 --> 00:15:00.582
BILL: That's right.

00:15:00.582 --> 00:15:01.460
IKAI LAN: OK.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.030
BILL: And, I should mention,
the 4,000 was the highest I

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.510
was successfully able to do.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.560
And it fluctuates with
the time of day.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.510
Scripts run faster or slower
depending on the time of day.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.940
Monday morning seems
to be a little bit

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:17.680
slower through the day.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.420
But if you run it on Sunday,
at 3 AM, things

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.230
run a little faster.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:26.444
And I assume that's just
Google's overall server load.

00:15:26.444 --> 00:15:30.420
IKAI LAN: I can't speak
to that particularly.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.430
I haven't seen that myself.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:36.980
BILL: I've got customers that
notice that, in particular

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.545
times a day, scripts run
a lot slower than

00:15:40.545 --> 00:15:41.240
other times of day.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.960
And they're running with
big data sets.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.375
They're running with
spreadsheets with 2,000 lines

00:15:46.375 --> 00:15:51.830
of 40 columns, and things like
big, jumbo spreadsheets on

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:52.720
multiple spreadsheets.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.622
And they notice a difference
in how fast scripts run

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:55.940
throughout the day.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:56.940
IKAI LAN: I do have a theory.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.730
But, again, I always
say this to Arun.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:15:59.010
I have a theory.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:02.220
It's backed by nothing, except
me making stuff up, which is

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.520
that if you doubled the size
of the objects, you would

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.570
probably stuff half the
number of objects

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.190
before it times out.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.440
I'd be really curious.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.630
Send me your scripts sometime.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.722
I'd be really curious if it has
to do with the size of the

00:16:14.722 --> 00:16:15.960
total objects or the number
of total objects.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.280
Now, I can see a case either way
for why it would time out.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.460
If it's the number, then
it's the overhead

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.400
of creating an object.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.220
Whereas if it's just straight
up size, then maybe it just

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.400
has to do with the amount
of data that is being

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.660
pushed down the pipe.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.360
BILL: Once I get a little
farther along--

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.420
I've got one script that's
running now.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.470
And I've got a couple--

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.220
What I was going to do is run
it with an object of that

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.110
size, and then run it with an
object twice that size.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:46.430
Because what I'm trying to do
is get a sense of how big of

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:47.870
an object, how many
objects can you

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.400
stuff, for 200 megabytes.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.120
Just so I have some sense of how
big, and that was my goal.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.710
And it's when I came up to this
writing speed was the new

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.025
interesting observation.

00:16:57.025 --> 00:16:59.240
IKAI LAN: So shoot
me an email.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.090
If you don't have my email
address, it's my first name

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.545
@Google.com.

00:17:02.545 --> 00:17:03.270
BILL: OK.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.490
IKAI LAN: So that's that your
challenging puzzle, to

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:06.853
decipher my email address.

00:17:06.853 --> 00:17:07.760
It's not that hard.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.190
It's plastered all over
the internet.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.589
But shoot me an email with your
results, and I'd love to

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:13.040
dig at this for you.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.369
Because I'm totally interested
in data stores.

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:16.655
Data stores just
rock my world.

00:17:16.655 --> 00:17:17.490
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Aren't
you writing a

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:18.555
blog post on ScriptDb?

00:17:18.555 --> 00:17:21.460
IKAI LAN: It's eventually
happening.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.520
Aren't you doing--

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.569
and I have to call him
out on something that

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:25.450
he's working on now.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:26.069
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yes.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:27.140
A lot of things that
are not done yet.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.650
IKAI LAN: So I heard someone
jump into the Hangout.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:30.590
We just want to say hi.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.790
You don't have to say hi back.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.770
We just want to say hi to you.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.680
If you do, we'd appreciate it.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.760
Silence.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.820
I need to find a new way of
doing that, a new way of--

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:42.680
MATT: Hey.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.350
My name is Matt.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.990
I'm actually a computer science
major at University of

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.080
Central Oklahoma.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.100
I just wanted to jump in and
just observe the discussion.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.490
IKAI LAN: Sure.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.235
Did you say University
of Oklahoma?

00:17:53.235 --> 00:17:53.970
MATT: I'm sorry?

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.035
IKAI LAN: Did you say University
of Oklahoma?

00:17:56.035 --> 00:17:58.980
MATT: Central Oklahoma,
a little bit north.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.830
IKAI LAN: Cool.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:03.050
Yeah, just hang out and stay
as long as you want.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.990
MATT: Yeah, thanks.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:05.890
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Great.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:06.760
So let's see.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.200
What other questions
could we answer?

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.100
So here's a gentlemen that
would like to attach a

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:17.412
favicon, an ICO file, against
a web app built using UiApp.

00:18:17.412 --> 00:18:21.530
IKAI LAN: So with UiApp, because
you can't change the

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.610
structure of a document, you're
not able to do that.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.090
But when you're working with--

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.600
I think they're pronounced
"fave-i-cons." I don't know.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.210
"Fav-i-cons, fave-i-cons."
Favicons.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.740
If you're using HTML service,
you should be able to set it

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.820
using the link parameter.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.844
Now, if Kaha is preventing you
from doing this, you should

00:18:37.844 --> 00:18:38.550
let us know.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.190
I don't see any way how this
would be harmful, so we would

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:42.870
want it whitelisted.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.910
But you should be able to set
it inside the head element,

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:51.760
where you say link rel =
"fav-i-con," "fave-i-con," and

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.560
point to favicon.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.690
Now, we can't host the
favicon for you.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.890
But there are lots of places
where you can host it.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.190
You could host it in
a Google Site.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.710
You could host it in any kind of
hosting that's retrieval by

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:02.190
the public.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.360
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.770
That's actually a really
good point.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.766
So I would like to know
if that works as well.

00:19:07.766 --> 00:19:09.194
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:19:09.194 --> 00:19:10.620
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Great.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.610
What are my choices to back up
a Google Apps Script project.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.890
I mean, saving my whole project
code on another place

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:17.780
with some automation.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.380
Script files are not included
in Drive Sync, neither can

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.250
they be downloaded.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:26.220
IKAI LAN: So one thing that I
do is I just make a copy of

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.090
the script itself.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.950
So, in Drives, you could just
do this quickly and cheaply.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.050
And this is one way that
I back things up.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.040
Now, I understand what you're
saying, which is that how do

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.940
you back it up off site.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.890
And there are a lot of reasons
why you would want to do that.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.490
The are a lot of reasons
why I want to do that.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.050
Our code review tools here at
Google, for instance, do not

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.570
work with Apps Script
directly.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.930
Unfortunate, and we're working
on those guys.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.580
But, for now, what we're going
to need to do, what I do, is I

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:52.590
take those files.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.730
I save them to my local
file storage.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:57.930
And I push them into
our source control.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.440
So source control is another
feature that

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.010
we've heard asked for.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.810
And, hopefully, we'll be able
to get that out as well.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.182
But, for now, those are
your solutions.

00:20:06.182 --> 00:20:07.350
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yes.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.220
IKAI LAN: I don't know if
you do anything else.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.360
ARUN NAGARAJAN: No.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.230
I guess I just trust the
system in this one.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.220
So there is a version
history built in.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.540
So you can see what is usually
going into your file.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.560
So that's part of the
system there itself.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:26.150
And I just make it so that I
save versions as I need to for

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:27.640
bigger snapshots.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.600
And I just assume that it's
going to be there the next

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.400
time I come in.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.890
So I don't really download
it to my local

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.160
file system that often.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.360
The Editor is quite good.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.980
So I don't really need to go to
a different editor to edit

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.836
that JavaScript.

00:20:40.836 --> 00:20:43.890
IKAI LAN: One thing about
versions though is that it's

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.790
not a version of the code that
you can go back to and edit.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.440
And so, for instance, you can't
save a version six and a

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.160
version seven.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.880
And your version seven
is terrible.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.260
So you go back to version six.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.950
You throw away version seven.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.500
So I do understand the
need for this.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.020
But, in those cases, if I have a
very important point, that's

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.450
when I usually fork
the script.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:07.140
And it's not the best
solution, but it

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.800
works really well.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.310
And search will work.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.950
And it'll show up
in your drive.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.800
It won't show up on your local
hard drive, but it's something

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.220
that I've been doing.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.587
ARUN NAGARAJAN: When you say
fork a script, you mean file,

00:21:17.587 --> 00:21:18.130
make a copy.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.140
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.220
File, make a copy.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.740
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I just want to
make sure, terminology-wise.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.950
IKAI LAN: I've been bugging
the team for

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:29.100
a Apps Script app.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.490
You know how you have
spreadsheet app and Docs list.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.320
So that I can actually
write scripts

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.480
that manipulate scripts.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.170
But I start to blow too many
minds when I suggest it.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.710
So I'm just wondering, anyone
else on the Hangout, if you

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.680
guys have any practices
you guys use

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.720
for backing up scripts.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.750
Bill?

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.380
BILL: No.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.160
I trust Google.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.120
I'm a Google Apps reseller
as well.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.490
So I spend all day selling
people on why Google has got a

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.430
great storage right there.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:57.670
So I do run into that problem
when I have a version.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.030
You know I've saved a version,
and I want to go back.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.185
So I try not to make mistakes.

00:22:02.185 --> 00:22:05.330
But, pretty much, I do
the same as you.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:10.270
If I really want to secure
a version, I fork it.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:14.640
One interesting tool you might
want to pass along is, I just

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.110
found the JSLint,
the web page.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:22.050
And I've been pasting my
Apps Script into it.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.550
And that's helped a little
bit improve my code

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.290
discipline, if you will.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:32.530
And I was thinking, like you,
I should write a script that

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:34.930
writes scripts, or
reviews scripts.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.440
So it'd be nice if we
could have a script

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.600
access another script.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.600
And we could build our own
JSLint, or if you want to

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.130
build that in for us,
into the Editor.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.830
There's a bit of one
in the IDE now.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.110
IKAI LAN: I think one of the
limitations, though, that we

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.400
run into, is that because an
Apps Script is not treated as

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.670
a set of files and drive,
which is complicated.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.700
If it were, for instance, we
could write a drive app that

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.990
downloads it, lints it, pushes
it into the source controller,

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:01.860
pushes it into your
code review tool.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.620
I mean part of me wonders.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.330
It's good that we provide all
of this functionality.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.630
But there's that line we draw
between what should we

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:12.350
provide, and what should we just
build on what exists now.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.220
Source control has
so many people--

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:14.915
I'm sorry?

00:23:14.915 --> 00:23:18.260
BILL: I was just going to say
that part of the value in Apps

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.820
Script is the simplicity of it.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:20.220
Right?

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:20.390
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.240
BILL: It's not meant
to do everything.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.760
So yeah, I agree.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.310
Adding features adds
complexity.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.990
And that actually raises
the bar to new

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.030
developers using it.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.210
IKAI LAN: But what new features
can we add such that

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.670
if you were an advanced
developer, or an experienced

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:40.930
developer, and you have a
specific tooling need.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:41.995
You should be able
to do workflow on

00:23:41.995 --> 00:23:43.030
your Docs and email.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:45.680
But you also should be able to
do workflow on your apps

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.360
themselves.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.250
BILL: Yeah.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.640
Is there a particular reason
why they're not saved as an

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.140
actual file?

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.520
Because they are simply
just a text file.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.020
Right?

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.470
And they are somewhere.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.640
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah, they
are certainly somewhere.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.200
IKAI LAN: They are somewhere.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.670
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Up until
recently, I think this spring

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.770
is when you could create
standalone scripts.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.580
Up until then, they were
container bound.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:06.890
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.720
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So the
container-bound scripts,

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.800
imagine if all of a sudden they
just started showing up

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.600
in your drive.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.960
I think that might be a little
alarming for some folks.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.650
Because a single spreadsheet
might have four, five, six

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.480
scripts, depending on the events
that you may tie into.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.935
So that's one of the reasons,
up until recently, we didn't

00:24:22.935 --> 00:24:25.390
have this concept of a project,
that's standalone

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.940
that's on your drive.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.180
It becomes more of a
possibility now.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.600
Because you've specifically
said this is a standalone

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.270
container, rather than bound
to another container.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:40.070
So it becomes more reasonable,
I guess, but not something

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.190
that we've actively
considered.

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:43.290
BILL: It was interesting.

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:46.330
I have someone that I'm
teaching Apps Script.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.530
And he is a 20-year coder.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:51.760
And it took a little while in
the first session to explain.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.420
This was just back in the
spring, before they had the

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.320
standalone.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.980
It took a little bit of a
discussion about the idea of a

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.900
spreadsheet as a container, or
as a site as a container.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.580
It took a little bit of time to
say, well, no, it doesn't

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.030
really exist anywhere, except
it's attached to something.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:06.500
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.710
I wonder if there are ways
we can improve the Ui.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.175
For instance, now that
you have the

00:25:11.175 --> 00:25:12.140
standalone script editor.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.380
For instance, you have a
spreadsheet-bound Ui.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.370
There should be some indicator,
like, hey, here's

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.150
how you get back to the
original spreadsheet.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:19.060
And there are things
that we do now--

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.095
BILL: That's in the
issue tracker.

00:25:20.095 --> 00:25:20.950
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.090
I believe it.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:23.430
And I'm wondering what
the right thing

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:24.450
for us do there is.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:27.320
So let's move on to
something else.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.640
There's a couple of questions,
which I've posted comments on.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.010
So let's see.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.655
I'll let you pick who the
winning questions are.

00:25:33.655 --> 00:25:36.280
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Let's
see here.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:41.310
So this one is the error
messages around your script

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.580
has recently failed to
finish successfully.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.205
So this must be maybe they
registered for a trigger.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.430
You've already responded
to this one?

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:51.940
IKAI LAN: I've tried to.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.300
So the question is your script
not found has recently failed

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.090
to finish successfully.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.840
Now, I'm pretty sure that
we finished dealing

00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.900
with orphaned script.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.555
But there probably are
a few orphaned

00:26:01.555 --> 00:26:02.410
script out there somewhere.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.850
So what you'll want to do is
open up Script Editor.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.720
This is at script.google.com.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.610
And go to, I think, it's tools,
all of my triggers, and

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:10.660
you'll see if anything
is running.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.820
Because I know I've solved this
for someone, where if you

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.990
go there, you'll say, oh, I
have these extra triggers.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.430
Delete, delete, delete.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:18.100
It'll do what you need to do.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:18.350
And--

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.850
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's
a good point.

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:19.330
IKAI LAN: --you'll close
this thing down.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.020
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's
a good point.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.660
Let's see here.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.770
Links to stack overflow.

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.206
I won't click on that for now.

00:26:27.206 --> 00:26:31.440
IKAI LAN: So the question is
about can we clarify quotas.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.508
And we're running out
of time, so we won't

00:26:32.508 --> 00:26:33.110
be able to do this.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.600
But that is a very
good question.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.280
The question is about which
quotas are being

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.330
used in a web app.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.320
And it's very confusing, because
sometimes you use

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.310
ScriptDb quota, which
is the user's quota.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.805
And sometimes it's developer's
quota.

00:26:44.805 --> 00:26:46.850
And when something is
run by a user, it's

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.110
using the user's quota.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:50.330
So where do we draw
those lines?

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:53.346
And I think that we need
to draw this out.

00:26:53.346 --> 00:26:54.075
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I agree.

00:26:54.075 --> 00:26:57.480
IKAI LAN: And if you have
anything else to add to make

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.085
that simpler for people.

00:26:59.085 --> 00:26:59.580
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.300
In general, it really depends
on whether you're publishing

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.680
your app as a user-authenticated
app, or an

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.220
anonymous-authenticated app,
which is running as yourself.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.764
So, if you're sending emails in
that scenario, you'll have

00:27:11.764 --> 00:27:14.310
to be really worried
about that limit we

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.000
talked about earlier.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.790
So there's a multitude of user
cases that are now possible.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:23.670
And we probably need a little
chart of saying, here's what

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.960
your impact is going to be.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.440
Little sliders, and
knobs, and stuff.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.690
IKAI LAN: Charts, charts.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.280
All right.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.830
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I think we're
coming up on time.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.110
Do we have time for one more?

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.310
IKAI LAN: We are just
running out of time.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.650
ARUN NAGARAJAN: All right.

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.020
Cool.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.480
IKAI LAN: I'm getting
the signal.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.190
So thank you all very much
for joining us today.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.890
And, again, we will have Office
Hours next Thursday, as

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.130
well as next Tuesday is
a special session.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.120
We'll be talking
about BigQuery.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.680
And BigQuery, if you're not
familiar with BigQuery, it's a

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.720
way to take very large
data sets and do

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.720
SQL-like analysis on them.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.850
And this is very useful.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.410
This is built on a tool
that we use at

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:04.170
Google to do logs analysis.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:05.390
We have lots and lots of logs.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:06.940
And we need tools
to analyze them.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:09.110
So the tool that we've
exposed is called

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:10.830
BigQuery, very cool tool.
