00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.820
One long molecule, spiraling around
in a double helix.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.880
Exquisite, ordered, simple 
and regular.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.020
Two strands of nucleotides,
each with a strong backbone

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.920
composed of sugar and phosphate.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.600
With what we call nucleotide bases
on the inside:

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.420
Adenine, 'A',

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:38.920
guanine or 'G', cytosine, 'C',
and thymine or 'T'.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.580
And these bases always pair together, according to some simple rules.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.039
A always pairs with T,
and C always pairs with G.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.900
These four bases make up an alphabet
of four letters, the genetic code.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.400
And that is the key, DNA is a code.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.680
A code that holds all the information
to make all living things.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.660
Somehow, DNA must tell each
and every cell in the body

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.840
what it is to become, 
and when and where.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.860
But how?

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.600
1950s scientists had a big job to do,
they had to crack the code.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.120
So if you consider how a code works,
let's think it out.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.040
We've got four bases,
and we need to make

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.540
20 different amino acids.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.920
So if we have a code that
just consists of one base,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.840
we could only make four possible
amino acids, right, which isn't enough.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.760
So if we had a code that consisted
of two bases

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.760
that could get together
in any combination,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.620
how many different amino acids
could we make then?

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.280
Yes, 16, exactly.
It's not enough is it, we need 20.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.360
so if we had a code
based on three bases,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.000
that could get together
in any combination,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.220
how many amino acids
could we produce then?

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.820
Nine? Not quite... yes, 64, exactly.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.960
More than nine
and more than we need.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.980
So three bases would work.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.040
And that's exactly what scientists
found to be the case,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.620
they worked out the code
and they worked out

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.300
that it was arranged in
threes, a triplet code,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.240
with each group of three bases
called a codon.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.440
And each group of three bases
or codon specifies or codes

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.000
for a particular amino acid.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.660
So we can see that here,
here's a codon of three bases

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.620
and that will give us an amino acid,
which we give another single letter code to.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.380
We needn't worry about
the amino acid code for now.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.220
Here's another codon, CCC,
that gives us this amino acid, P.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.380
And here's another codon GAA,
that gives us that amino acid, E.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.340
So we can start to decode
this DNA sequence

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.920
and turn it into
an amino acid sequence,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.300
so we can see a growing
amino acid chain in a protein.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.800
Now I'm not going to waste my time
decoding all of that.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.480
Now we've got one here
that we prepared earlier,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.220
we know it's the same,
this is all these nucleotides,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.300
all these codons
decoded into these amino acids.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.840
So here is our protein chain.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.280
So a protein is like a sentence
of amino acid letters,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.180
and you can even see
that we've got some punctuation

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.240
in our sentences,
because it turns out

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.780
that there are special codons
that make something like a full stop

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.040
at the end of the protein.
