6/16 is equivalent to 3/8 and
it has 16 in the denominator.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.940
How do we determine that
the numerator is six?

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.040
Well, our original fraction was 3/8 and
we wanted to turn that into some

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.910
fraction that had 16 in the denominator,
no numerator yet though.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.900
So we need to turn 8 into 16.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.390
I know that eight goes
into 16 two times.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.940
So I have to multiply eight by two.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.740
if we want this fraction to
stay equivalent to three eights

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.520
anything that we do to the denominator
we must also do to the numerator.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.270
So multiply by two on the top as
well and three times two equals six.
