WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.920
The Joe Rogan experience.
I'm interested in where again,

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.670
in with your own,
do you feel uh,

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.200
connected to the person you were as an adolescent?

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.330
Did you notice it in your own parent in,

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.940
do you notice it in the type of choices you make because of the image?

6
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:20.880
I have a view from the outside is like you have literally built something for

7
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:21.241
yourself.

8
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:26.220
You operate within it and you are quite protected and you are independent and

9
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:30.330
not forced to deal with too many negative outside influences by an unavoidable

10
00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:33.300
dynamics.
The unnecessary dynamics like uh,
you know,

11
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:36.060
as a father and dealing with colleagues and stuff like that.

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.990
Do you experience a lot of tension,
anxiety?

13
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.890
What was happened to that guy?
Do you feel that you have transcended that?

14
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:47.010
Cause I do in my own life feel like,
yeah.
After I'm not the adolescent boy was.

15
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:47.701
I've like,
you know,

16
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:51.600
I've learned from that and are still in a very sort of cold psychological way.

17
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.920
Yeah.

18
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.790
When I'm doing a era that's the g Bjj classes I'm doing over here with Professor

19
00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:01.110
Ricardo will,
he's amazing guy.
Like when I'm,
when I'm doing those classes,

20
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.030
I have a sense of fathering my child self of like,
you know,

21
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:08.230
cause I weren't doing those kinds of things when I was a kid.
I'm like,

22
00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:08.961
it's all right Russell.

23
00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:13.961
We're just in a Bjj class and it's a panic then I to impress anybody.

24
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.140
Right.
Just do that.
If you don't know,
just ask.

25
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.440
I've got a voice in myself because I chat to Tony Robbins,
you know,

26
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:23.280
he's like another obviously high achieving guy who I admire and respect a great

27
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:26.610
deal and like you know when he talks he does like these cold plunges and he says

28
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:30.570
before I get in that plant jogging and that fucking punch lucky took us,
my God,

29
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:32.520
I don't talk to myself like I would like,
right Russell,

30
00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:33.720
we're going to get in the cold plunge.

31
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.150
We're going to let you know I have to talk to myself.
Generally.

32
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.790
What are you doing with that aspect of yourself?

33
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:40.050
Do you still have a relationship with it?

34
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:44.010
How is it like when you're doing all these psychedelic cosmonaut explorations of

35
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:48.020
the psyche,
are you not encountering aspects of yourself that are on,
uh,

36
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.620
on developed and addressed?
There's always always

37
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.230
<v 1>going to be unaddressed and undeveloped aspects of yourself,
but I'm very,
very,</v>

38
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:59.180
very different to who I was when I was a young boy.
I mean,
um,
um,

39
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.720
I'm not 100% self actualized.
I don't think anybody is,

40
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.290
but I'm just a totally different human being.
I remember it,

41
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:10.580
but I remember it with humor.
Like I remember a laugh.
I'm like,
wow,
so silly.

42
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:13.940
I was so weird back then.
And uh,
you know,

43
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.970
with life experience and developing confidence and understanding of who you are

44
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:23.840
and why you had those feelings and why you were insecure and why he had so much

45
00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:27.950
self doubt,
martial arts helped me with,
with that tremendously.

46
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:30.710
Because it was the first thing that I ever did where I didn't feel like a loser.

47
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.580
So the first thing that I ever did where people like respected me and they liked

48
00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:36.560
me for it,
you know,
I'm like,
wow,

49
00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:40.340
this is like something that was a feeling that I was completely unused to in the

50
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.270
14 previous years of my life.
All of a sudden there was this,

51
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.490
this feeling that I was unusual.
I was unique,
I was special.
Wow.
You know,

52
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.160
I was appreciated.
They were good at quick.
Yeah,
I was,

53
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.570
I had a natural inclination towards it and I was obsessed with it.

54
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.640
So I was obsessed with,
it's those training every day,
all day long.

55
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.910
And then my instructor recognized it really early on,
so he,
uh,

56
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.240
allowed me to train there for free and just,

57
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.540
I would teach classes and teaching classes helped me a lot as well because when

58
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:14.530
you're teaching,
you're breaking down techniques and you're,
you,

59
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.540
when you're showing someone how to do it,

60
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:19.810
you really cementing those pathways in your own mind.

61
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.250
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah,
that's right.
That must be an important step on the road to mastery.</v>

62
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.110
I see that clip where Eddie Bravo gave you your black belt and he were very

63
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:32.500
moved by that.
Like,
so for me that like moments like that,

64
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.400
it must connect you to the beginning of the journey.
Yeah,

65
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.240
<v 1>that does.
Yeah,
for sure.
And it's still,
you know,
the,</v>

66
00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:43.470
the journey of Jujitsu is a fascinating one because unless you're someone who's,

67
00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:46.230
you know,
a solid he barrow or John Jacques Machado,

68
00:03:46.231 --> 00:03:49.350
or it's just a true master who's dedicated their entire life to it,

69
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.150
the journey is so long,
it's so long.
It's like if you're a guy who runs,

70
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.690
you'd like to run,
I like to run a mile three or four days a week,
no big deal.

71
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.321
But then,
you know,

72
00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.500
your next door neighbor's and ultra marathon runner is preparing for them the

73
00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:05.760
Moab to 40 where he's going to run 240 miles.
Yeah.
You're just,

74
00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:09.120
you're never gonna catch up the same amount of times and you should always defer

75
00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:11.040
to that person when you have questions about running.

76
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.880
And that's how it is with Jujitsu.
Like is,
you know,
yeah,
I'm a black belt,

77
00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:15.720
but I'm not a black belt.

78
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.860
Like John Jacques Machado is a black belt is that there's levels to even to
that,

79
00:04:19.861 --> 00:04:23.340
so I always have questions so the journey's never over.
It's always long.

80
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.020
There's always a better way to get out of an arm bar or a better way to set up a

81
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:30.220
triangle or whatever it is.
There's the,

82
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.480
one of the beautiful things about Jujitsu is that it's so complex.

83
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.520
There's so many variables,

84
00:04:35.521 --> 00:04:39.780
there's so many situations and interactions and exchanges and entries and

85
00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:44.781
defenses and and way to chain moves together and the correct way to set

86
00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:49.851
something up to three steps ahead to know that if you grab the lapel this way,

87
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:53.400
the guy's going to try to shake it off that way and that exposes this,

88
00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:57.000
which exposes that and then the next defense will expose this and then you keep

89
00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:59.130
going and going and going and going until you get them.

90
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.250
<v 0>It's so beautiful to watch that because it's like as if there's a preexisting</v>

91
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.310
net or grid of interrelated signs that we'll work together and like as a white

92
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:12.790
belt,
I've got three stripes now.
I was like,
thanks.

93
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.810
I was really hoping that by the time I came back on here I'd have a blue belt

94
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.330
and that cut the closing on it.
I'm on the train,

95
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.860
I'm training free times a week privates and I'm attending two classes and what

96
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:25.360
I've done.
That's great.
Thanks a lot.

97
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:28.920
And was a significant step for me is like now in the classes when I'm spire of

98
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.280
people,
I don't try just in the handshake to manipulate them into going easy.

99
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.000
[inaudible]
lovelies Deco Ralph we go.
Then

100
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.500
we tried to manipulate people.
Yeah.

101
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.670
Like just the subtle gesture or something like that.

102
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.440
Just try to take it easy on me.
Don't hurt me.

103
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.860
Come on to a avoid big people.
Yeah.

104
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:53.380
Sometimes like I try and stay down that white belt ended a room,

105
00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:54.880
but like now the more I do it,

106
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.040
like the more they coaxed me up near great big giant men,

107
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.880
like a lightly as a guide.
I go like the soft ones up area,

108
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.490
like the hard end of purple belt and above Dave,
uh,

109
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.180
Porpoise Bay and that there's people out their hands and their feet look

110
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:12.150
different to my hands and feet as different than their hands and feet over

111
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.680
different from mine is mine are to my daughters and I feel like,

112
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:20.000
how am I supposed to ever do anything with these people?
Like hard water,

113
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.090
like drowning in hard war,

114
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.390
the way they move and followed around me and I want to try that if it was

115
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:29.430
supposed to do and my breathing goes.
Yeah,

116
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.390
but the fingers with other white belts is that,
uh,

117
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.220
what I feel is like there is,
my ego comes back in because there's,

118
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.390
I feel like no,
I should be getting something.

119
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:41.090
The first time I got choked out by another white belt I like,

120
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.830
I felt like I went into a room I'd not been in since I was 16 getting my ass

121
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.000
kicked in,
in bus stops,
you know,
stuff like this.

122
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.020
I felt like I was quiet for 24 hours just sitting and reflecting on Oh shit.

123
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:55.760
And I just picked up like this is a combat sport.

124
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.220
There's happens you're going to experience with by,
right.

125
00:06:58.221 --> 00:07:03.140
So it doesn't mean I'm a bad person.
The I filed a no,

126
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:07.010
you're going to have to get used to that.
You're going to be used to humiliation.

127
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.070
You get used to defeat,
but it's,
it's that humble

128
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.530
<v 1>bullying is very good for you.
You know,
I've been,</v>

129
00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:13.690
I don't know how many times I've been tapped out in my life,

130
00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:18.610
but it's probably more than a thousand,
probably thousands,
you know,

131
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.630
<v 0>and that the,
yeah,
there,
uh,
do you sit there while,</v>

132
00:07:21.631 --> 00:07:24.870
I'll tell you about Jujitsu and the other and the other thing that's been good

133
00:07:24.871 --> 00:07:28.530
about it is like when it is the other way,
like I remember like a guide,

134
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:31.170
it was a big guy on top of me and like he,

135
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.660
he was in mount right.

136
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.960
I'm not like he won't actually applying a submission,

137
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.710
but there's just the sheer discomfort of having someone there.
Their body,

138
00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:44.950
their sweat,
their hair,
their abdomen,
their reproductive organs.
They,

139
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.970
the jest if system theses in their bow.

140
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.720
And I just nearly tapped out at,
but then he went to move to get an armbar.

141
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.420
Bideford hang on a second.

142
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.920
There's a moment and I managed to escape from that and like the amount of energy

143
00:07:58.921 --> 00:08:03.040
that that release is like,
fuck you.
Yes.

144
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.570
<v 1>That's hilarious.
Yeah,
it is very satisfying feeling.</v>

145
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.920
It's also very satisfying to to defend against something that someone used to

146
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:18.850
catch you with.
Like say if someone's a really good at taking your back.
Yeah.

147
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.500
He choked you a couple of times and then one time they take your back,

148
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:25.370
but you defend and you get out.
You're like,
are cut out.
Yes,
there's an escape.

149
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:26.900
I can make this.
I'm getting better.

150
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.430
<v 0>I love being in the cave.</v>

151
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.660
That meant we'll spice because what my technique was,
oh,
I'm not good at that.

152
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.990
Never bother trying.
I'm not good at that kind of stuff.
Never bother trying.

153
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.190
So for me at this stage in my life to go and do something that I'm not good at

154
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.290
this with other men that is competitive,

155
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.850
they involve so much vulnerability and failure and learning.
I'm thinking,
well,

156
00:08:47.851 --> 00:08:49.770
you've got growing.
You've got to be growling.

157
00:08:49.771 --> 00:08:51.960
She'll doing stuff that you never would have done before.

158
00:08:51.961 --> 00:08:55.030
Even turning up a new place like I'm doing here in NAM,

159
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.920
making those new relationships and doing that.
You know,
it's amazing for me.

160
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:02.550
And another thing I'm into is the integrity of it.
Right.
But it was Chris Clear,

161
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.660
uh,
black belt on the [inaudible] Gracie,
right in UK.
My teacher,

162
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.620
like if he gave me a blue belt that would look good,
man.
He'll be videoed it.

163
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.230
I would be everywhere.
Russell brand got blue belt is shit must work.
But no,

164
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:19.470
he doesn't do it out of integrity and respect for that,
you know,

165
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:23.910
it means more to him.
Yeah.
Evidently.
Than as simply the act of kindness.

166
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.460
Did,
you know,
so lightly.

167
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.430
What is nice to belong to something that has protected and valuable systems.

168
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:32.520
He did say to me,
you keep going by the end of the year Blue Bell I think,

169
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.490
but like,
uh,
you know,
is not dished out like these.

170
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:38.390
Nice to know that there's some kind of order or an area where celebrity

171
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.340
manipulation,
charm human,
none of those things all redundant.

172
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.140
<v 1>No.
In Jujitsu,
it's very protected.
Anyone that gives out a bad belt,</v>

173
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.020
it's very bad for their integrity.
It's the,
the,

174
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.080
the school would lose face so badly in the community and you meet someone who's

175
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:58.020
a Hicks and Gracie Brown belt,

176
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.910
that mother fucker's a Hicks and Gracie brown belt.
He's is as legit as they get.

177
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.660
They don't get any more legit.
Like if you got to that point of,

178
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.120
and Gracie gives you a brown belt,
it's a dis,

179
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.210
it's irrefutable and that's how it should be in.

180
00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:16.590
The beautiful thing about the art form is that it has this self correcting sort

181
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:21.050
of aspect to it,
that when you roll,
when you spar with each other,
it,

182
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.740
your ability or lack of is exposed and there's no other way around it.

183
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.580
Yeah.

184
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:31.580
That's good to not avoid that [inaudible] but you'll be better.

185
00:10:31.591 --> 00:10:34.260
You know,
you're,
you're a fit guy.
You're a healthy guy.

186
00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:37.710
If you just keep going and get off that fucking Vegan Diet and keep going.
