00:00:00.774 --> 00:00:02.508
To which intervals could we restrict

00:00:02.508 --> 00:00:04.977
f of x is equal to cosine of x minus pi

00:00:04.977 --> 00:00:08.911
over four, so that f of x is invertible?

00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:12.177
And they show us what cosine
of x minus pi over four,

00:00:12.177 --> 00:00:14.367
what it looks like, the graph of it.

00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:15.978
So lets just think about what it means

00:00:15.978 --> 00:00:17.642
for a function to be invertible.

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:19.774
A function is a mapping from a set of

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:22.136
elements that we would call the domain,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.712
so let me, my pen is a little

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:26.838
off today so lets see if it works ok.

00:00:26.838 --> 00:00:30.034
So this right here is our domain.

00:00:30.034 --> 00:00:36.434
And this over here is our range.

00:00:36.434 --> 00:00:39.510
And a function maps from
an element in our domain,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.311
to an element in our range.

00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:43.105
That's what a function does.

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:45.437
Now the inverse of the
function maps from that

00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:49.640
element in the range to
the element in the domain.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.637
So that over there would be f inverse.

00:00:51.637 --> 00:00:53.377
If that's the direction of the function,

00:00:53.377 --> 00:00:55.771
that's the direction of f inverse.

00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:58.636
Now, a function is not invertible,

00:00:58.636 --> 00:01:01.573
one of the situations in which
a function is not invertible

00:01:01.573 --> 00:01:03.914
you could have a function
where two elements of the

00:01:03.914 --> 00:01:07.546
domain map to the same
element of the range.

00:01:08.112 --> 00:01:11.568
So both of these elements map
to that element of the range,

00:01:11.568 --> 00:01:13.644
so both of these are the function,

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:16.711
but then, if this is the
case, you're not going

00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:18.629
to be able to create a function that maps

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:20.301
the other way, because if you input this

00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:23.045
into the inverse
function, where do you go?

00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:24.646
Do you go to that element of the domain?

00:01:24.646 --> 00:01:27.100
Or do you go to that
element right over there?

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.571
So one way to think about it is,

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:30.443
you need a one to one mapping.

00:01:30.443 --> 00:01:34.508
For each element of the
range, there's only one

00:01:34.508 --> 00:01:37.444
element of the domain that gets you there.

00:01:37.444 --> 00:01:38.972
Or another way to think
about it, you could try to

00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:41.908
draw a horizontal line on
the graph of the function

00:01:41.908 --> 00:01:45.914
and see if it crosses through
the function more than once.

00:01:45.914 --> 00:01:47.447
And you could see that this is indeed the

00:01:47.447 --> 00:01:49.573
case for this function right over here.

00:01:49.573 --> 00:01:52.027
If I did a horizontal
line, right over here.

00:01:52.027 --> 00:01:53.776
Now why is this the issue?

00:01:53.776 --> 00:01:55.576
Well this is showing, actually let me show

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:59.245
a number that's a little
bit easier to look at.

00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:01.567
So lets say I drew the
horizontal line right over here.

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:04.177
Now why is this horizontal line an issue?

00:02:04.177 --> 00:02:07.779
Well, showing us the
part of the domain that's

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:10.113
being graphed here, that
there's several points

00:02:10.113 --> 00:02:12.577
that map to the same element of the range.

00:02:12.577 --> 00:02:15.639
They're mapping to 0.5.

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:19.376
0.5, this value right over here.

00:02:19.376 --> 00:02:23.439
When you take f of that
is equal to 0.5, f of this

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:29.635
is equal to 0.5, f of this
right over here is 0.5.

00:02:29.635 --> 00:02:32.704
So if you have multiple
elements of your domain

00:02:32.704 --> 00:02:34.435
mapping to the same element
of the range, then the

00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:37.837
function will not be
invertible for that domain.

00:02:37.837 --> 00:02:39.170
So really what we're going to do is,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.498
we're going to try to
restrict the domain so that,

00:02:41.498 --> 00:02:44.509
for that domain, if I were
to essentially apply this,

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:46.646
what I call the horizontal line test,

00:02:46.646 --> 00:02:49.246
I'd only intersect the function once.

00:02:49.246 --> 00:02:52.169
So lets look at the graph
of the function once.

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.166
So lets look at these choices.

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:59.633
So the first one is an open
set from -5 pi over four.

00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:02.511
-5 pi over four, so that's pi, that's

00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:05.713
negative pi, and another fourth of pi.

00:03:05.713 --> 00:03:08.700
So that's, I think,
starting right over here,

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.773
going all the way to negative 1/4th pi.

00:03:11.773 --> 00:03:14.509
So that's this domain right over here.

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:16.570
Let me do this in a new color.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:23.401
So that's this, and this does
not include the two endpoints.

00:03:23.444 --> 00:03:26.578
So here I can still apply
the horizontal line and,

00:03:26.578 --> 00:03:30.311
in that domain, I can show
that there's two members

00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:33.973
of the domain that are
mapping to the same element

00:03:33.973 --> 00:03:37.113
in the range, and so if
I'm trying to construct

00:03:37.113 --> 00:03:40.646
the inverse of that, what
would this element, which I

00:03:40.646 --> 00:03:44.514
guess is -0.6, what would
that f inverse of -0.6 be?

00:03:44.514 --> 00:03:46.301
Would it be this value here?

00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:48.775
Or would it be this value here?

00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:51.177
I would rule this one out.

00:03:51.177 --> 00:03:54.980
Let's see, negative pi to pi.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.233
I'll do this in this
color right over here.

00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:01.311
Negative pi to pi.

00:04:01.311 --> 00:04:04.375
This is a fairly, so once
again, this is enclosed,

00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:05.702
so we're including the two boundaries,

00:04:05.702 --> 00:04:10.902
we're including negative
pi and pi in the domain.

00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:12.979
But once again over that interval,

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:17.038
I could apply my horizontal
line here and notice,

00:04:17.038 --> 00:04:18.177
or actually I could even
apply the original one

00:04:18.177 --> 00:04:21.437
that I did in blue, and
notice there's multiple

00:04:21.437 --> 00:04:25.839
elements of the domain
that map to, say 0.5.

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:28.369
So what would f inverse of 0.5 be?

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:30.573
You can't construct a function where it

00:04:30.573 --> 00:04:32.979
maps only to one element of the domain, so

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.977
we could rule this one out right as well.

00:04:35.977 --> 00:04:40.577
Now, negative 1/2 pi to positive 1/2 pi.

00:04:40.577 --> 00:04:46.308
So negative 1/2 pi, so let
me, I'm running out of colors.

00:04:46.308 --> 00:04:51.745
So negative 1/2 pi to positive 1/2 pi,

00:04:52.163 --> 00:04:55.039
This one is interesting, if
I apply a horizontal line

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.837
there, there, there, so
lets see, but if I apply

00:04:59.837 --> 00:05:02.977
a horizontal line right
over here I do intersect

00:05:02.977 --> 00:05:06.378
the function twice, so
I have two members of

00:05:06.378 --> 00:05:08.847
this domain mapping to the same element

00:05:08.847 --> 00:05:11.605
of the range, so I can
rule that one out as well.

00:05:11.707 --> 00:05:13.376
And I'm left with one last choice.

00:05:13.376 --> 00:05:15.300
I'm hoping this one will work out.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.512
So 1/2 pi, it's an open set, so 1/2 pi,

00:05:19.512 --> 00:05:23.380
right over there, to five pi over four.

00:05:24.764 --> 00:05:28.502
So that's pi and another 1/4th,
so that's right over there.

00:05:28.502 --> 00:05:32.890
And lets see, this is, if I
were to look at the graph here,

00:05:33.074 --> 00:05:35.445
it seems like it would pass
the horizontal line test.

00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:37.238
At any point here I could make

00:05:37.238 --> 00:05:38.976
a horizontal line over that domain.

00:05:38.976 --> 00:05:40.911
Actually, let me do it
for the whole domain.

00:05:40.911 --> 00:05:42.116
So you see that.

00:05:42.116 --> 00:05:43.378
For the whole domain.

00:05:43.378 --> 00:05:45.844
And I'm only intersecting
the function once.

00:05:45.844 --> 00:05:50.974
So, for every element of the range that

00:05:50.974 --> 00:05:52.777
we're mapping to, there's only one element

00:05:52.777 --> 00:05:54.644
in our domain that is mapping to it.

00:05:54.644 --> 00:05:56.910
It's passing our horizontal line test,

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.337
so I would check this
one right over there.
