00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 If crowds of women 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 They wore the uniform of the servants 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Jacobin 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 Step down or leave 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 I will write it in a better color 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Champ de Mars 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 He was the brother of Mary Antonette 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 All they do 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 Treaty of Pellentz 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 We must have a republican system 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 We stopped with the previous video at the end of 1789 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.733
 When the Bastille prison was broken into in Jolay when the people of Paris wanted it 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
 To take the weapons that the Bastille contained 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 To free some political prisoners with the aim of 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
 To protect themselves from the tyrannical ruler Louis XVI 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
 Louis XVI was forced to 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 He says: Well, the National Assembly, I will not 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 Stand in your way after the day 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 Because he absorbed whenever he tried to 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 Stop their work, this leads to more 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 Of the tension in the political situation 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 So in late 1789 chaos broke out in many 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 Cities of France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 So the National Association contributed to the composition 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 Constitution will be applied and applied in 1791 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 But they began to make plans 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 To form this constitution 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
 But in the month of August 1789 they showed their version 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 Of the Declaration of Freedom 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 Declaration of human rights and citizens 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 If things were good at that time they would wait 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 For a few years to write the constitution and perhaps 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 That constitution was a royal constitution 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 But of particular misfortune to Louis XVI 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Things were not satisfactory 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 As I mentioned this thing began 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 Because the people were starving 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 We have this financial crisis for our famine 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.066
 In October 1789 - we were still in that year - October 1789 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 Some rumors spread that Mary Antonyt 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
 The king's wife was hiding bags of wheat in Versailles 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 So the people began to imagine bags of wheat 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.066
 In Versailles and at a time when people could not even find 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 the bread 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 Bread was the staple food 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 So crowds of peasants marched 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 To Versailles 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Be armed 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
 This is a picture of the crowds of peasant women who went 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 To Versailles 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 They went to Farassy and in fact they managed 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 To break into the palace 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 And they demanded - because they doubted what he was doing 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette in Versailles 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 They demanded that they move to Paris 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 If crowds of women 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 They got their demands 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 This led to the transfer of Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antonet 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 to Paris . Because they can not 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 There is hiding wheat 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 They will be surrounded by all 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 These unkind people who are watching 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 All they do 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 I think the most important factor is that the people were hungry 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 Rumors spread that the king was storing wheat 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
 But another rumor began to spread that the king was 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 Disrespectful with the symbols of new France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
 With the National Assembly 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 This also made the people angry 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 In fact all learned 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
 Including Louis XVI he did not like what was happening 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 Did not like the idea of ​​the Royal Constitution 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.066
 Which was formed and the amount of power and power that he would have lost 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 To the National Assembly 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 So we have this uncomfortable situation 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 At the beginning of 1790 he was king and king 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.466
 As if they were being held in a house called the Tuileries Palace 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 And you have the National Assembly established 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 the Constitution 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
 They have the task of establishing the constitution 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 They all took the tennis court section 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 At the same time you have all over France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Riot control 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.066
 This is France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 In all the countries there were rioters 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
 Some people did not live up to their French Revolution 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 And they were losing 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
 All the people were conspiring against each other 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 And you have some nobles who said: 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 do you know ? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 I do not like the evolution of it 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 We have a lot of violence 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 The people are angry 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 I will take my money and all I can pack 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
 I will deceive the country 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 I will leave the country 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 And you have a class of nobles leaving France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 They were called immigrants 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 I know I did not utter it correctly 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 They had the idea that he was living well here 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 In France, why not live well 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.466
 I'd better leave. This idea began to occur in 1791 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 If in 1790 it was an uncomfortable period 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 In 1791 this idea was attempted 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.066
 Getting away from the danger King Louis XVI began to wonder 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 And Mary Antonette 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 But could not leave the country 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 They did not trust Great Britain 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 They did not trust these nearby children to blow them 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 political asylum 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 One of the generals who sympathized with him 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.066
 They told them the least they would do was go to the border 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 In order to escape from all these problems 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 That occur 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 So wear the clothes of the servants - and this informs you 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 Their personalities - 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 They wore the uniform of the servants 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 They made the servants dressed in noble costumes 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 So they make them servants to set them ambush 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
 After all they were trying to escape from Bryce 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Dressed as servants the king and the king - the king tried 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 To escape to the ownership of this general 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 But when they arrived in Varen here 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 You know them 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 They arrested them and took them prisoner 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 And brought them back to Paris 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
 They launched the event 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 Escape to Paris or Escape from Paris 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 Any name you like 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
 In advance Louis XVI began 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 I am impressed by what happened 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 So they tried to flee 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 But the people returned them 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
 Perhaps I began to imagine that a lot of people 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 Do not like the king 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
 They did not like the idea of ​​having a king 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 And more revolutionary and extremist group 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 They were called Jacobin 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
 After the royal family attempted to evade and be returned 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 They said it would be better 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
 Is there a king at all? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 For you, the National Assembly, you shall give 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 Any power in the constitution 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 For the king? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 We must have a republican system 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 This in short means - there are a lot of definitions 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 For the term republican but easier 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 It is a state without a king without 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 The emperor without his king 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
 So they said we do not need you National Assembly 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 You are trying to solve the problem 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 But we do not match our thoughts 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 We want to lack the existence of the royal government 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 all of which 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 And the fact that Louis VI tried to escape 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 We see that here he stepped down from the throne 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 Step down or leave 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 They began organizing themselves in Paris 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 Here at the Champ de Mars 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 I know that you are wrong 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 This is his current picture 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 They began to collect votes 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 In this public park they carry out an idea 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 We do not need a king 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 We want to be a republican system 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 The National Assembly does not solve the problem 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 So the General Assembly gathered here 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
 Things became out of control in the Champ de Mars 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 So they sent soldiers 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 To calm the situation 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 These forces were previously controlled 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 National Association 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 The people who controlled the situation 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 For their possession of the third power 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 But the situation has increased 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 They threw stones at the soldiers 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 Some of the soldiers at the beginning did 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 Shooting in the air 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 But in the end it led things out of control 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 They were fired on the crowds 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 Killing 50 people 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 And this is the carrot 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 Or the massacre of Champ de Mars 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 I know that you are wrong 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 This is not a video in teaching French pronunciation 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 This led to the anger of the people more 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 People are still starving 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 The problem did not resolve 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 The king and the king were hated 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 All expected them to try to return 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 For the throne and power 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Try to escape 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 Jacobin or the year 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 The thorans who were their Jacobin commanders 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.333
 When they began to propose the formation of a republican system 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 And that there is no family owner 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 They gathered people here 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 Which was under the leadership of the National Assembly 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 They fired at the crowds and killed civilians 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 Because they threw stones 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 They were probably large stones 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 But you can imagine this will make people hungry 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
 The press is more angry 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.466
 And in order to make the people more mad with doubt that the king 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
 And the king is trying to return to power you also had 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
 Two forces are suddenly trying to engage themselves 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 French Revolution 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 Let's mention it on the Han side 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 Because this information is when you learn it 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.133
 In European history it will be a bit difficult to understand 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 You have these states that are so true 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 You have Austria .., you shaded it in orange 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 This map is a map of the present 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 But in the orange show you how Austria was 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.133
 In another time 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 In 1789, 1790, 1791 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 This is in Russia 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
 I want to show you that this is very different from 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 Austria at present 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 This is Austria today 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 Russia does not exist in the present world 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 And I have the name of the Roman empretorism 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 A union with these other kingdoms or empires 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 Where was her name? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
 I want to mention a quick information on the side 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 The Roman Empire was sacred as Voltaire said 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 Neither sacred nor Roman nor empire 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 He was right 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 The definition of the monarch was unclear to the German 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
 And its sectors - particularly the German Kingdom 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
 If you notice, she now has what is known in Germany 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 And the most powerful authorities in the Roman Empire 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 Or strengthened two powers in the Roman Empire 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.066
 It was Austria 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 The governor of Austria had a title 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 He is Leopold II 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 If Leopold II was the emperor of the Roman Empire of the Holy 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 But he was not the founder of the Roman Empire 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 The founder of the Roman Apostolic Empire was of Rome 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.666
 He observed that nothing in the Roman Empire was sacred at that time 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 Simplifies anything in Rome 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 So we said Roman were not because they did not 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 They speak ethnic 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 We speak of German-speaking people 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 It was not an empire 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
 It was not a government with a fixed organization 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 It was an unorganized union of some countries 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 But the most influential sense 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 Were under the authority of Austria or 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Leopold 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 The ruler was not only or had him 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 The abbreviation for that country is abbreviated 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 He ruled Austria or could say imperialism in 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 that time 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 He was the brother of Mary Antonette 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
 Leopold II was her brother 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 Leopold II and the governor of Prussia, Frank William 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 It is a strong nation 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 I will write it in a better color 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 They issued the Treaty of Pellentz 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.133
 I will write it 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 This added more anger and humiliation to 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 People of France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 Treaty of Pellentz 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 And took place in August. and I want to 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Explain this 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 In the month of John 1791 tried war 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 They were arrested in Varen 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 In Julai 1791 you have the massacre of Champ de Mars 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 This made the people very wary of the government 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 The idea is they do not want them to increase 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 And the people became more angry 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 And now you have the Treaty of Piltons 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
 Of these Western countries and one of them is governed by them 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 Brother of the royal family 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 This treaty is mainly provided for 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 The restoration of power to power in France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 They did not want to 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 Intervene militarily 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.333
 But a declaration that they do not agree with what is happening 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 in France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 And they were not so serious about it 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 But the people of France took it seriously 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Very serious 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 You have these troops on the border here 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 And you have Austria and Prussia 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 This was not something people could do 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 To insult him 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
 This increased their fear that the royal family would try 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 Planning to return to strength 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
 And you'll be surprised 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 This increased the anger of Jacobin 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 They wanted to be Republican 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 So I'll stop here in this video 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 You can see things at the beginning of this video were bad 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
 And now it is worsening 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 in France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
 The people are now wondering whether they need it 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 King or king 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 Western forces began to intervene 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.066
 And saying that she does not like what happened with the king and the king 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
 They have removed power 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Maybe that will hurt them and their people get these ideas 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 And so is her brother so 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.133
 I will help you 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 This increased the fear of the people 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.133
 The National Assembly was at the beginning of the revolution 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 They are now 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 The massacres are inhabited by people 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 This will lead to an ugly and bad period 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 In French history 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.466
 And you will notice that this will lead to his era 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 Which is called the era of terrorism 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 We'll see it in the next video
