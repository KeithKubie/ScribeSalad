not linear so essentially you create

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970
not linear so essentially you create
 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.640

these things called collections which

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650
these things called collections which
 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.519
these things called collections which
are essentially lists or graphs or

all these different components work with
 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.570
all these different components work with
each other and the way it does that is

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580
each other and the way it does that is
 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.730
each other and the way it does that is
through simple mechanisms you already

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740

allows you to simply store all the
 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.480
allows you to simply store all the
different collections that you have in

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490
different collections that you have in
 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.010
different collections that you have in
your notebook so you can quickly find

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020
your notebook so you can quickly find
 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.930
your notebook so you can quickly find
them again there are four core

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940

the daily log it's a way for us to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180
the daily log it's a way for us to
 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.910
the daily log it's a way for us to
capture all the thoughts that bubble up

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920
capture all the thoughts that bubble up
 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.860
capture all the thoughts that bubble up
throughout the day and categorize them

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870
throughout the day and categorize them
 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.960
throughout the day and categorize them
into tasks events and notes using

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970
into tasks events and notes using
 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.000
into tasks events and notes using
different symbols so we keep our entries

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010
different symbols so we keep our entries
 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.120
different symbols so we keep our entries
very short and then we also tag them

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130
very short and then we also tag them
 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.210
very short and then we also tag them
essentially with an icon then we have

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220
essentially with an icon then we have
 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.430
essentially with an icon then we have
this thing known as a monthly log and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440
this thing known as a monthly log and
 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.520
this thing known as a monthly log and
the monthly log on one page is a monthly

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530
the monthly log on one page is a monthly
 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.760
the monthly log on one page is a monthly
calendar and then on the next page is a

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770
calendar and then on the next page is a
 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.010
calendar and then on the next page is a
monthly tasks list essentially where you

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020
monthly tasks list essentially where you
 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.290
monthly tasks list essentially where you
can create a monthly inventory each

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300
can create a monthly inventory each
 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.450
can create a monthly inventory each
month you take a step back think about

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460
month you take a step back think about
 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.800
month you take a step back think about
what you want to get done that month

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810
what you want to get done that month
 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.450
what you want to get done that month
anything that's bubbled up and getting

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460
anything that's bubbled up and getting
 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.700
anything that's bubbled up and getting
it out of your head and on paper the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710
it out of your head and on paper the
 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.740
it out of your head and on paper the
calendar on the monthly log can be used

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750
calendar on the monthly log can be used
 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.300
calendar on the monthly log can be used
in one of two ways in a traditional way

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310
in one of two ways in a traditional way
 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.580
in one of two ways in a traditional way
but I prefer to use it as a way to

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590
but I prefer to use it as a way to
 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.219
but I prefer to use it as a way to
actually write down things after they

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229
actually write down things after they
 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.410
actually write down things after they
happen so the calendar quickly becomes a

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420
happen so the calendar quickly becomes a
 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.840
happen so the calendar quickly becomes a
timeline of the decisions you made and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850
timeline of the decisions you made and
 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.620
timeline of the decisions you made and
the events that have happened

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630
the events that have happened
 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.649
the events that have happened
essentially and having the context of

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659
essentially and having the context of
 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.899
essentially and having the context of
when what actually happened can be very

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909
when what actually happened can be very
 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.730
when what actually happened can be very
revealing in its own right like did you

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740
revealing in its own right like did you
 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.770
revealing in its own right like did you
actually start working out three weeks

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780
actually start working out three weeks
 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.719
actually start working out three weeks
ago or a week and a half ago did you

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729
ago or a week and a half ago did you
 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.699
ago or a week and a half ago did you
send that email then or what not so it's

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709
send that email then or what not so it's
 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.850
send that email then or what not so it's
a timeline of highlights in your life so

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860
a timeline of highlights in your life so
 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.010
a timeline of highlights in your life so
you have the monthly log then you have

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020
you have the monthly log then you have
 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.210
you have the monthly log then you have
the future log for

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220
the future log for
 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.240
the future log for
the things that happen outside of the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250
the things that happen outside of the
 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.280
the things that happen outside of the
current month the bullet journal unfolds

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290
current month the bullet journal unfolds
 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.320
current month the bullet journal unfolds
in real time so we don't hoard pages

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330
in real time so we don't hoard pages
 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.970
in real time so we don't hoard pages
essentially every time you flip a page

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980
essentially every time you flip a page
 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.910
essentially every time you flip a page
it can accept pretty much anything that

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920
it can accept pretty much anything that
 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.790

lists projects whatever you want and the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680
lists projects whatever you want and the
 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.360
lists projects whatever you want and the
way that works is with the index so

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370
way that works is with the index so
 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.970
way that works is with the index so
every time you flip the page and you use

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980
every time you flip the page and you use
 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.470
every time you flip the page and you use
it for a different purpose you number

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480
it for a different purpose you number
 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.330
it for a different purpose you number
your pages and then you list that page

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
your pages and then you list that page
 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.000
your pages and then you list that page
and it's title in the index so you have

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010
and it's title in the index so you have
 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.770
and it's title in the index so you have
these four core collections but you can

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780
these four core collections but you can
 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.330
these four core collections but you can
create collections for pretty much

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340
create collections for pretty much
 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.800
create collections for pretty much
anything you like

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810
anything you like
 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.840
anything you like
again shopping lists vacation planning

again shopping lists vacation planning
 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.330
again shopping lists vacation planning
lists can be infinite pretty much you

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340
lists can be infinite pretty much you
 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.940
lists can be infinite pretty much you
can keep writing things down and whether

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950
can keep writing things down and whether
 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.490
can keep writing things down and whether
or not you do them well you know that

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500
or not you do them well you know that
 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.920
or not you do them well you know that
just depends on the person what I found

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930
just depends on the person what I found
 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.660
just depends on the person what I found
really important is that I keep re

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670
really important is that I keep re
 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.550
really important is that I keep re
engaging with the things that I write

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560
engaging with the things that I write
 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.430
engaging with the things that I write
down and keep curating the substance of

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440
down and keep curating the substance of
 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.770
down and keep curating the substance of
my experience if you will so we have the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780
my experience if you will so we have the
 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.410
my experience if you will so we have the
monthly log essentially every month we

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420
monthly log essentially every month we
 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.449
monthly log essentially every month we
set up a new monthly log and in between

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459
set up a new monthly log and in between
 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.090
set up a new monthly log and in between
the monthly logs you have the daily logs

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100
the monthly logs you have the daily logs
 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.009
the monthly logs you have the daily logs
and the daily logs are there to capture

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019
and the daily logs are there to capture
 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.410
and the daily logs are there to capture
your tasks events and notes so at the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420
your tasks events and notes so at the
 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.770
your tasks events and notes so at the
end of every month you reflect through

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780
end of every month you reflect through
 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.660
end of every month you reflect through
the past month and see the things that

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670
the past month and see the things that
 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.979
the past month and see the things that
you've done and the things that you

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989
you've done and the things that you
 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.540
you've done and the things that you
haven't done and then you have a choice

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550
haven't done and then you have a choice
 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.360
haven't done and then you have a choice
to make if something isn't done you can

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370
to make if something isn't done you can
 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.970

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170
upfront but if it's not even worth
 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.730

much more time than they need to I think
 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.160
much more time than they need to I think
the question is does it need to be done

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170
