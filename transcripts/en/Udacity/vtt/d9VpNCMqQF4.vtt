00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is the second is actually a good representation of this outcome.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
When I color the pieces of the pie, we'll see that 50% of the pie falls into one class

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and the other 50% in the other class.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Compare this to this pie over here, which seems to be a 75 to 25 split,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or the one over here, which is 25 to 75.

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is the one I would've chosen.
