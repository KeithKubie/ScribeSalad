DAVID TSENG: Hi everyone,
my name is David Tseng.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.690
I am a software engineer
on the accessibility

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.090
team here at Google.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.070
And I have here with me my
colleague, Volker Sorge, who

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.470
is a visiting professor from the
University of Birmingham.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.210
We're here today to talk to you
about ChromeVox, and some

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.920
of the exciting work we've been
doing to make reading of

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.610
mathematics on the
web possible.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.430
To tell you more about this,
I'm going to hand it off to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.770
Volker for a brief introduction
to the work.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.910
And I'll then come back for
a brief introduction to

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.040
ChromeVox, in general.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.860
Volker.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.180
VOLKER SORGE: Thank
you, David.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.200
So my name is Volker Sorge.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.130
I'm a senior lecturer
at the University of

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.830
Birmingham in the UK.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.940
And I've been spending the last
year, together with the

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.650
ChromeVox team here, to make
an effort in order to make

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.519
scientific material that's out
of the web accessible for

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.480
people with visual
impairments.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.590
And first, we have concentrated
on making

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.170
mathematics accessible,
using ChromeVox.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.830
Now why is that important?

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.400
Well, one of the problems with
scientific material is that it

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.180
is a hurdle in education that
many people that have visual

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.340
independents are excluded from
having scientific material

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.640
readily available as their
normal peers would have.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.840
Because it is much harder to
make scientific material fully

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.510
accessible.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.290
And particularly, if you think
about something like

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.450
mathematics, it is not as
straightforward as reading

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.920
just regular texts.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.430
Therefore, it is often very
difficult to make it

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.860
accessible using your average
screen reader.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.620
Now there have been a number of
efforts in order to make,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.120
in particular, mathematics
accessible,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.790
that are on the web.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.480
But these are generally efforts
that require either

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.139
particular, special tools or
particular plug-ins for

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.560
special browsers.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.680
So what we have been trying to
do with ChromeVox is make

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.590
mathematics accessible in just
the standard screen reader--

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.930
so making, effectively,
mathematics a first class

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.400
citizen in the world
of accessibility.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.950
And we have done, also, in
addition, some special

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.480
elements, like, in particular,
exploration of mathematics,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.850
that we believe are fairly
novel, and that we're going to

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.180
demonstrate to you in
the upcoming hour.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.650
So first, we'll start with a
general introduction to what

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.340
ChromeVox actually is, before we
then go into more detail on

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.290
how one can use it to speak
mathematics, and also, how one

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.170
can, in particular, use it to
customize how mathematics is

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.430
being spoke.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.312
And for the general
introduction, that's going to

00:03:01.312 --> 00:03:02.590
be done by David.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.510
David, please.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.320
DAVID TSENG: Thank
you, Volker.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.200
So just to get everybody up to
speed and on the same page,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.520
I'm going to give a demo of
ChromeVox, and its general

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.120
features and functionality as
a general screen reader.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.270
So for the past, I'd say, three
or so years, we've been

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.670
developing ChromeVox.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.500
And ChromeVox is just
a Chrome extension.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.290
So it's all written
in JavaScript.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.880
And we have access to all the
information that any other web

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.770
page would.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.700
And this gives us a lot of
things that ordinary screen

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.340
readers don't get, and
everything that they do get.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.350
So we've been able to create
something that, I think, is

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.070
fully featured, and allows
a blind user to

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.950
navigate all of the web.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.280
So to start off with, I will
show everyone a standard page

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.470
from Wikipedia.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.010
This is a square root.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.700
The topic for this page
is on square roots.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.050
And I will start off by simply
tabbing around, and letting

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.430
everyone hear the type of
feedback we provide.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.350
CHROMEVOX: Navigation--

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.900
internal link.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.230
This page has one alert.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.019
Do you want Google Chrome
to save your password?

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.660
DAVID TSENG: So there, you've
heard quite a few things.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.610
So it says a lot.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.750
It says, first of all-- the
first thing that you've heard

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.550
was "navigation" and "link--"
"internal link." So those bits

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.430
of information are contextual.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.910
And it tells you what the
currently focused item is.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.450
So a user who's using a screen
reader can then know how to

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.820
interact with this.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.970
So since it's a link, one can
press it, and therefore land

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.670
in another place on this page,
since it's an internal link.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.930
And the second bit of feedback
you heard was an alert given

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:01.790
by the Chrome browser.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.070
So we actually speak
that, as well.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.370
So besides landing on focusable
items, we can

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.210
actually move about the
page and move to

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.120
things that aren't focusable.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.470
So you do that by pressing the
ChromeVox modifiers, and the

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.120
arrow keys.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.117
So let's hear what
that sounds like.

00:05:21.117 --> 00:05:22.340
CHROMEVOX: Comma.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.980
Search--

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.640
internal link.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.780
Quote square roots quote
redirects here.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.290
For the music festival,
see square roots--

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.265
link.

00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:33.630
DAVID TSENG: And you
hear quite a few

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.625
other things there.

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:37.820
There were some static
pieces of text.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.380
There were some more links.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.130
And one other item that is kind
of interesting to point

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.180
out is-- you heard a sound
effect, kind of

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.930
like a "ding" sound.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.470
And that actually represents
a link.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.610
So whatever a user hears that,
they automatically know that

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.110
they can click on it.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.170
So some other interesting things
are that a user doesn't

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.590
necessarily have to
go item by item.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.830
They can actually jump from
section to section.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.320
And that's done via another
keyboard command.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.190
And let's hear what
that sounds like.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.910
CHROMEVOX: Contents--

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.580
heading two.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.020
DAVID TSENG: So there, I just
skipped a lot of material on

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.230
the page, and was able to jump
right to the contents listing.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.860
So let's try that again, and see
if we find anything else

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.690
interesting.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.730
CHROMEVOX: Properties--

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.048
heading two.

00:06:30.048 --> 00:06:32.160
DAVID TSENG: All right,
and keep on going.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.850
CHROMEVOX: Left bracket,
edit source-- link--

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.480
pipe, edit, beta,
right bracket--

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.410
link.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.100
Enlarge the graph of the
function f left parenthesis x

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.010
right parenthesis equals square
root of x-- math.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.330
DAVID TSENG: And there, we have
something that alludes to

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.330
the rest of the talk.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.780
And it's how we actually make
it possible to read that

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.130
expression, and make it possible
for ChromeVox, and

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.150
the user, to then communicate,
using something that's a

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.710
little bit richer and a little
bit more unique.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:15.250
So with that, one last thing
to show is we can actually

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.800
read content, continuously,
just by

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.350
pressing another command.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.370
And it'll actually read it kind
of like a book, from this

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.690
point on to whenever you
want to stop it.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.630
CHROMEVOX: Made up of
half a parabola--

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.130
link-- with a vertical
directrix--

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.120
link-- dot.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.540
The principal square root
function f left parenthesis x

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.850
right parenthesis equals square
root of x-- math--

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.970
usually just referred to as the
quote square root function

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.210
quote, is a function.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.480
DAVID TSENG: And I'll
just stop it there.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.550
And that, overall, gives you a
flavor of what ChromeVox is,

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.920
and what it does, and how the
user would use it, and a

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.170
little bit of a taste of how
math works, and spoken math

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.330
sounds like.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.110
So with that, I will throw
it back to Volker.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.380
And he will continue on with
some of the more interesting

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.060
things that we're doing
with math, and

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.646
how this is all possible.

00:08:11.646 --> 00:08:12.720
VOLKER SORGE: Thank
you, David.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.880
So as you could already hear
when David was demonstration

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.500
the continuous reader on the
previous paragraph, there was

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.070
math contained in
the paragraph.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.830
And the math was just being
spoken out in a

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.950
fairly verbose way.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:32.010
We'll talk about that a bit
later, why this is so verbose.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:39.480
And in order to explain how that
is being spoken out, it

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.860
is probably worthwhile going a
bit into detail on how math is

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.810
actually represented
on the web.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.600
And in particular, for those
who are not fully aware how

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.160
math on webpages works, or
should work, I'll give a quick

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.930
introduction on that now.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.170
So ideally, mathematics on the
web is represented by a

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.630
special markup language
called MathML.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.100
MathML has been around
for some time.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:08.060
And it has evolved and matured
to a degree that it's now been

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:14.240
made a stand for HTML5,
and as a consequence,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.950
also for EPUB 3.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.290
So in other words, every EPUB
3 reader, in the future,

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.830
should also be able to
deal with MathML.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.480
Now the question, of course,
arises, why is there a

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.060
specialist markup language
just for mathematics.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.790
Well, the reason is that
mathematics is fairly

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:37.390
involved, in terms of the way
expressions are being set up

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.680
and how they're being
structured, which is normally

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.460
not doable--

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.180
or not easily doable--

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.465
with just regular HTML.

00:09:43.465 --> 00:09:47.110
In particular, think about that
regular HTML is very good

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.530
with dealing with text
and these things.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.310
It can also do sub
and superscript.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.980
However as soon as things become
more involved, as in a

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.210
mathematics expression--

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.260
which is, by nature, effectively
two dimensional

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.170
and very, very nested--

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.520
HTML alone can normally
not deal with it.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.700
Therefore, MathML provides all
the basic functionality--

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.600
or the basic tags--

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.430
in order to create complex
mathematics expressions, and

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.130
display them on the web.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:27.470
Now while it is, in general,
a good thing that MathML is

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.190
fairly mature, and that it's a
part of standards, what is a

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:36.390
drawback about MathML is that
it is not implemented in all

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.570
browsers, or all
EPUB 3 readers.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.360
As a consequence, there are
several ways of getting

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.060
mathematics on the web
to work nevertheless.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:53.180
So one of the ways it is done
by many sites, such as

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:59.140
Wikipedia, by default, as well
as other pages, is that one

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.950
actually displays an image of
the mathematics instead of

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.530
having a MathML expression
in there.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:09.760
And therefore, it can be easily
read by people who can

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.870
actually see the image.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.240
But it cannot necessarily be
picked up by a screen reader.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.820
Now the advantage of this is,
sometimes, that the real

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.550
mathematics is still provided
somewhere in the background,

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.620
not visible.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.710
And therefore, it can indeed
be used by screen reader.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.730
And I'll demonstrate it to you
later, how that is being done.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:35.110
The other way of displaying
mathematics on all browsers on

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.260
all platforms is by using a
little library called MathJax,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.960
which is done by the
MathJax Consortium.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:48.000
And if you want to check this
out, this is at mathjax.org.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.110
And the way this works is that
MathJax can be injected in any

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.135
page that contents
mathematics.

00:11:55.135 --> 00:11:56.840
And it's JavaScript.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.870
And it just renders the
mathematics, which is either

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:04.510
given as MathML or a more
traditional markup language

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.960
like LaTeX or ASCIIMath.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.970
And it then renders
the mathematics.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.940
Now the challenge with this
process, for a screen reader

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.850
who actually wants to use the
mathematics in order to speak

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.180
it, is that we actually have to
deal with all these types

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.800
of mathematics as
they can occur.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.660
So we have to be able to deal
with just standard MathML

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.460
expressions as well as
expressions rendered by

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.100
MathJax, or expressions that are
just hidden somewhere, in

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.760
an alternative text,
behind the image.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.900
And I'll show you,
now, how that

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.765
actually works, in practice.

00:12:37.765 --> 00:12:41.040
Right, so let me just quickly
demonstrate how this is then

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.220
spoken by ChromeVox.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.040
So let's go to the first
math expression,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.325
again, in this paragraph.

00:12:50.062 --> 00:12:54.560
CHROMEVOX: f left parenthesis
x right parenthesis equals

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.300
square root of x--

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.090
math.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.860
VOLKER SORGE: As you can see,
the first maths expression

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.100
here, in the DOM, is actually
the math expression which is

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.650
in the caption of this
particular image.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.120
But it still spoke it.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.420
And it went to it.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.380
And you can see it's been
indicated by this highlighter,

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.110
which is, for instance,
particularly helpful if you

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.033
need to see where you are in the
text-- so for instance, if

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:22.105
you are dyslexic.

00:13:22.105 --> 00:13:25.320
And for dyslexic students,
this is useful.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.650
And we'll just go to the next
maths expression, which should

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.164
now be this one in
the paragraph.

00:13:29.164 --> 00:13:32.060
CHROMEVOX: --left parenthesis
x right parenthesis equals

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.190
square root of x-- math.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.420
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.080
Now as I said, this works,
now, nicely.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.880
Because I'm actually logged
into Wikipedia.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.720
And if I were to now log out of
the Wikipedia page, I then

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.660
would get it just as an image.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.380
And it would still work.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.090
Because we can use the
alternative text, which is in

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:56.150
the background, which is
actually the LaTeX expression

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.040
which you saw of the
beginning before

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.570
the MathJax was rendering.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.030
Now I'm not going to log out
of this Wikipedia page,

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.410
because we will need it later.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.210
However, let's go to a different
page, where we have

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.000
a similar effect.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.870
CHROMEVOX: Sum from
Wolfram Math.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.850
VOLKER SORGE: And this is
Mathworld, which is a

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.920
particular encyclopedia,
just for mathematics.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.000
And what happens there is that
you have the mathematics given

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.210
as an image only, always.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.190
However, you also have
alternative text.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.090
And in that case,
it's ASCIIMath.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.900
And we can leverage this
ASCIIMath in order to

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.990
pronounce it.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.110
And just to show you that the
math expressions here are

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:41.700
indeed images, I'll just
grab it quickly, and

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.800
I'll move them around.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.160
See, this is an image.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.860
And I can take this sum, and
just move it around on the

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.110
screen here.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.880
And all these are images.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.870
CHROMEVOX: A sum is the
result of an addition.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:56.670
For example, adding 1, 2, 3,
and 4 gives the sum 10,

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:04.840
written 1 plus 2 plus
3 plus 4 equals 10.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.640
Full stop.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.170
Math.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.680
VOLKER SORGE: So you could
hear, now, that this is,

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.230
indeed, a math expression.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.230
Although it was an image, it's
being fully pronounced because

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.860
we can leverage the
alternative text.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.080
And you could hear, also, why
it was a math expression,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.990
because it was specially
announced using an earcon as

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.170
well as, in the end, an
announcement that this is a

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.000
math expression.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.350
Similarly, we can go to the
next math expression, for

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.270
instance, and--

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:38.590
CHROMEVOX: k equals 1 under and
4 over n-ary summation.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.250
k equals 10-- full
stop-- math.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.290
VOLKER SORGE: So again, this
is the maths expression how

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:45.860
it's being spoken
at the moment.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:52.210
And this now gives us the
possibility to have math

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.750
spoken where it's on Wikipedia,
even without

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:57.710
logging in, as well as on
MathWorld, as well as on many

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.670
other sites where there's
a similar effect.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:03.800
So for instance, there's many
math blocks out there.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.420
So one of the block so I'm going
to demonstrate here is a

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.380
famous block from a famous
mathematician, Terry Tao, who

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.580
is a Fields medalist winner.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:18.130
And he regularly blogs on his
latest mathematical research.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:22.450
And he does it in a similar vein
to what we've just seen

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.170
on the MathWorld site, that the
mathematics is actually

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.390
given in images.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.630
And I'll grab one of those
images here, and move it

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.520
around, so you can see that
this is an image.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.640
So this is an image.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.120
Here's another one.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.550
But the alternative text in the

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.510
background is indeed LaTeX.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:42.790
And therefore, we can actually
speak it, using ChromeVox.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:47.260
So let's just speak this first
definition, for instance.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.580
CHROMEVOX: Definition one--
multiple dense divisibility--

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:53.090
let y greater than or
equal to 1-- math.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:57.140
For each natural number k
greater than or equal to 0--

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:57.680
math--

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.800
we define a notion of k--

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.320
math--

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.780
tuply y--

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:02.470
math--

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.099
dense divisibility recursively,
as follows--

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:06.609
list with two items--

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.690
every natural number-- list
item-- n-- math--

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:10.750
is 0--

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:11.290
math--

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.760
tuply y--

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.670
math--

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.500
densely divisible.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.770
If-- list item--

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.732
k greater than or equal
to 1-- math-- and--

00:17:19.732 --> 00:17:21.730
VOLKER SORGE: Right,
I'll stop it here.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:27.060
So what you could hear was
that all the math in the

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.640
paragraph has been spoken.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.230
Although it's as images, we used
the alternative texts in

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.590
order to translate it with
the MathJax library.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:39.920
It's the same library we saw,
previously, rendering the math

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.680
on the Wikipedia page.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.210
When it comes back from the
MathJax rendering, we can then

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:51.190
use this representation
in order to speak it.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.970
And however we do this in the
background, in that sense,

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.890
none of the content
in the page is

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.650
actually, physically changed.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:02.580
So it still has the same visual
appearance as before.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.450
What you could also hear, when
we were speaking the maths, is

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.810
that it was always giving a
little earcon, and the math

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:11.870
announcement, which gives you
the possibility to actually

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:13.570
find out where the math is.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:18.110
And this is, in particular,
important if you want to have

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.230
more interaction
with the math.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.960
And with this, I'll pass back
to David, who's now going to

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.420
explain to you one of the
specialities of ChromeVox

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.950
which allows you to actually
interactively explore a

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.720
mathematics expression, which we
believe is a very important

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.060
step in order for people to
fully engage with mathematical

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.910
content that's on the web.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.310
DAVID TSENG: I think everybody
can identify with me,

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:46.990
personally, in that hearing all
of this is kind of a lot

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.710
to take in.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.890
I mean, if you consider the
often quoted figure of 7 plus

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:56.840
or minus 2 bits of information
that we, as humans, can store

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.110
and keep in our short term
memory, what we just heard was

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.820
way more than seven words.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.040
So what do we do about that?

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:12.220
Well, speaking personally, I, in
the days when I was in high

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.150
school and in university, used
several methods to actually

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.550
access mathematics.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:22.000
One primary way, and one that's
pretty popular still,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.890
is to use audio books.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:27.320
And at the time, we actually
used these four-track audio

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.980
tapes-- so a tape which has two
sides, using both stereo

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:38.030
channels, splitting those into
mono, and having each channel

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.980
record audio tracks.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.315
And someone--

00:19:41.315 --> 00:19:43.570
a really, really nice
volunteer--

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.870
would sit down in a room
and read through

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.680
an entire math textbook.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.330
So this included anything from
algebra all the way up to

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.770
calculus and even beyond.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:58.180
I remember listening to a real
analysis book in college,

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:03.430
which was once in a lifetime
experience.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:07.700
So it was really, really
difficult.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.170
And there was a lot of
rewinding, and pausing, and

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.050
taking notes.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:17.660
So we feel like ChromeVox can do
a lot better, since we have

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:23.700
a computer, and we have the
ability to write code to make

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.130
things easier.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.910
So what have we done, exactly?

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.940
Well, think about
any expression--

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:35.230
and I'll demo this,
briefly, later on.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:39.460
But just think about something
that you've seen in the past,

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.500
say, the quadratic formula.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.630
How would you actually
read that?

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.460
It's not exactly obvious.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:52.780
And even harder is then to tell
a person who's never seen

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.090
it before where all
the pieces lie.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:59.260
So if you think of it
like geography--

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.700
where are all the countries?

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.570
And where are all the
large pieces?

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:03.630
Where are all the continents?

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:08.240
And if you want to dive in to
a specific region, well,

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.430
what's inside there?

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:12.550
And how do you actually give
a quick summary of

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.160
all of these things?

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.380
And how do you actually let
a person then ask you to

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.460
describe something further?

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.750
So this is the challenge that
ChromeVox has faced.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:27.170
And we feel like we've come up
with a pretty good solution.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:31.040
So let me go ahead and just
demo that for you now.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.980
We can hear how does it now.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.020
And I can show you how a person
would actually explore

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.940
the various pieces of it.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:44.150
CHROMEVOX: We have x equals
minus b plus/minus square root

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:50.080
of b square minus 4ac
divided by 2a--

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.800
math.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.120
DAVID TSENG: Now you
see immediately

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.080
notice quite a few things.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.710
There were a lot of words,
for one thing.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.610
We also slowed down the speech
rate quite a bit so that we

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:05.200
can do some more intelligent
things like speeding up

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.260
certain parts, slowing down
others, inserting pauses,

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.340
changing pitch.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:16.330
So one thing to add there is,
you'll notice a little bit of

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.180
pitch drift.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.810
So all the stuff in the
numerator, you'll hear go up a

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:21.350
little bit.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.480
All the stuff in the
denominator, you'll hear go

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.720
down a little bit.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.770
In that power, the b squared,
the squared part is actually

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.070
up a little bit, even
more, in pitch.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:35.740
So it gives you another
dimension to work with.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:40.720
So pitch gives me, as someone
who is the listener, an

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.510
additional hint as to how high
something, or low something,

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:47.870
is vertically represented.

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:51.680
But this is still a pretty
beefy example.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.280
If you remember your first
algebra class, it's a lot to

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.020
take in for someone
who is seeing this

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.360
for the first time.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.350
So how do we actually let
someone explore it?

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.880
Well, we have one of these other
ChromeVox commands that

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:11.990
lets you go and dive deeper
into the structure.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:13.460
So I'll go ahead and hit that.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.630
CHROMEVOX: Entered math--
x equals minus b plus--

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.620
DAVID TSENG: And you
heard that again.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.720
There was a sound icon that

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.640
represents exploring something.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.470
And you heard the expression
starting to read again.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.010
And I just stopped it, for
the sake of brevity.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.720
So how do we actually
go and figure out

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.130
what pieces are here?

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.350
What's the general geography?

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:43.810
So there is this concept of
granularities, in ChromeVox,

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:47.450
that lets you zoom in and zoom
out, essentially, of something

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:48.160
on the page.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.770
So I'll go ahead
and press that.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:52.690
And let's hear how
that sounds.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:54.740
CHROMEVOX: Down to
level one-- x--

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.070
DAVID TSENG: So I just
moved down a level.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:01.610
And I'm in a bigger chunk
not as big as the whole

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:02.790
expression.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.470
So what is this?

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.100
This is x.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.470
And it's obviously very
important, so we let the user

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.440
hear that in isolation.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.050
And we have some keys
to move you around.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.010
And those are basically to move
you forward and backward

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.880
on the current level
of things.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.460
So let's hear what
that sounds like.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.260
And I will move forward.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.150
CHROMEVOX: --equals--

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:28.080
DAVID TSENG: So "equals" is
obviously also very important

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.720
in this equation.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.915
So what's the next thing?

00:24:32.915 --> 00:24:35.790
And I will go ahead and
press Next again.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:39.740
CHROMEVOX: --minus b plus/minus
square root of b

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:45.880
square minus 4ac
divided by 2a.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.420
DAVID TSENG: And you
heard, again,

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.780
that whole, big fraction.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.370
And you heard the pitch changes,
and everything else.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:57.120
And I will press the
Next key again.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.280
CHROMEVOX: Minus b

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.890
DAVID TSENG: Oup, and you heard
a little "ch-ch" sound.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.330
And that represents that we've
bumped against an edge.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:06.380
So there's only three big
chunks in this thing.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.770
And as a user that, perhaps,
has never seen this formula

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:15.620
before, well, I now have a
really good sense of all the

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.800
big pieces, and all the
big players, here.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:22.180
But say I, still, am a little
bit hazy on this fraction, and

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.440
I want to look a little
bit more.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.710
I can actually dive
in even deeper.

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.280
So let's do that, and hear
how that sounds.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.330
CHROMEVOX: Down to level 2--
minus b plus/minus square root

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:37.570
of b square minus 4ac

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.020
DAVID TSENG: And you heard
the numerator.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.270
So that sounds great.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.890
And let's move forward.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:44.030
CHROMEVOX: 2a

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.520
DAVID TSENG: And that's
the denominator.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.720
So that all makes
a lot of sense.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.620
And let's try moving
forward again.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.000
CHROMEVOX: 2a

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.180
DAVID TSENG: Oup, bounced
against an edge.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.360
Move back.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.610
CHROMEVOX: Minus b plus

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:54.850
DAVID TSENG: OK.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:55.820
We heard that before.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.720
Move back again.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.440
CHROMEVOX: Minus b

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.335
DAVID TSENG: Oup, another edge.

00:25:58.335 --> 00:25:59.180
All right.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.480
So we've gotten a really
clear sense of where

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.010
everything is, again.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:05.800
So I can even dive
even further.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.330
And let's do that, real quick,
into this numerator.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:10.470
CHROMEVOX: Down to level 3--

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:11.380
minus

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:11.730
DAVID TSENG: OK.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:12.360
Minus

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:12.530
CHROMEVOX: Minus

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.150
DAVID TSENG: Oup, that's
the beginning.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.710
So let's move forward,
instead of backward.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.050
CHROMEVOX: B plus/minus

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:20.120
DAVID TSENG: Forward

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.635
CHROMEVOX: Square root of
b square minus 4ac.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.150
Square root of--

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:27.440
DAVID TSENG: --oup,
and that's the end

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.700
CHROMEVOX: --b square
minus 4ac.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.850
DAVID TSENG: And if we really
wanted to, we can even dive

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:33.900
into the square root.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.330
So let's do that.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:37.786
CHROMEVOX: Down to level
4-- b minus 4ac.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.380
DAVID TSENG: And that's it.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:48.240
So with that, it is our hope
that students will be able to

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.090
then really easily explore
an equation like this.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:58.180
That's now becoming
possible with what

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.750
we're doing with ChromeVox.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.610
And in the past, you would have
had to rewind and fast

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:07.870
forward through a tape, and do
it that way, or perhaps, if

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:10.780
you're really lucky, get
math through braille.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:16.460
But with the possibility of
using online math, now you can

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.730
get it in real time, and
look up a wealth of

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:21.180
information on the web.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.520
So with that, I'll pass back
to Volker, who will discuss

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.150
some of the intricacies of
actually applying some of

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:33.010
these text to speech changes,
and the way we speak, and some

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:37.300
cool stuff that you, as a
developer, can actually do to

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:41.560
improve any math that you
might come across.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.080
VOLKER SORGE: And this, as you
have previously mentioned

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.540
earlier, at the moment, what
we've demonstrated to you, the

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.670
way things were spoken, is
very, very verbose in the

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.780
sense that every single
element is indeed

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.240
being spoken out.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.360
Now that is not necessarily
how mathematics is being

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.995
spoken in real life.

00:28:00.995 --> 00:28:01.270
All right.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:04.500
Often, you omit things, although
they are written.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:09.570
And this is something we can--

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:13.940
I'm going to demonstrate a few
examples where things are

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.830
being very awkward when
everything is being spoken,

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.720
and where we then apply changes
to our underlying

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.300
structure and rule base in order
to have them spoken more

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.600
intelligently.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.040
And I will then, afterwards,
tell you how this is actually

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:35.690
being done, and how that can
be customized by users,

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:39.650
themselves, or by creators
of web pages.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:39.890
Right.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:45.160
So this is, here, a Wikipedia
page with a matrix example.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.930
So matrixes are particularly
difficult to speak, because

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.490
they are fully two dimensional
objects.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.990
And I'll show you, at first,
how we could speak it in a

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:55.265
full, verbose fashion.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.650
CHROMEVOX: Left square
bracket matrix--

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:02.610
element one, one--

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:03.380
1.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.670
Element two, one--

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:06.260
9.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.570
Element three, one--

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:10.040
minus 13.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.040
Element one, two--

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:12.880
20.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.240
Element two, two--

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:15.750
5.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.290
Element three, two--

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:19.305
minus 6.

00:29:19.305 --> 00:29:20.670
Right square bracket--

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:21.930
full stop--

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:22.830
math.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.780
VOLKER SORGE: Right, so as you
could hear, everything was

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.850
being spoken.

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:31.150
Every bracket, every punctuation
is being spoken.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:34.660
Now we have the possibility,
in ChromeVox, to actually

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.700
change the underlying
representation in a way that

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.790
we can get a bit more
intelligence, a bit more

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:41.620
semantics in there,
if you like.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.410
And actually, I'll do that now,
in order so you can see

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:48.340
how this is being spoken then.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:48.990
CHROMEVOX: Matrix--

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.520
row one, column one--

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.490
1.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.310
Column two--

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:53.200
9.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.100
Column three--

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.190
negative 13.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:57.332
Row two, column one--

00:29:57.332 --> 00:29:58.216
20.

00:29:58.216 --> 00:29:59.320
Column two--

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.180
5.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.060
Column three--

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.072
negative 6.

00:30:03.072 --> 00:30:04.840
Math.

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.540
VOLKER SORGE: Right, so as you
can see here, ChromeVox is

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.980
slightly more intelligent.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.790
It applies a slightly
better way of

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.350
pronouncing rows and columns.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.120
In particular, it omits some
of the punctuation which is

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.780
not strictly necessary for a
reader to know, exactly.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:25.160
Whether this is a round bracket
or a square bracket,

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.860
in this particular instance,
might not make any big

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:28.910
difference.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.140
Right.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.940
These things can get
particularly worse when the

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:39.060
underlying representation is
very similar, however the

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.000
meaning is particularly
different.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.860
So let's go back to our
square root example.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:49.320
And I'll read you the first
example here, in the normal,

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.040
verbose style.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.340
Let's go to this case
statement down

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.780
here, on the page.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.480
CHROMEVOX: Square root
of x square equals--

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.450
vertical line--

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:01.160
x--

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.140
vertical line--

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:02.880
equals--

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.280
left curly bracket, matrix
element one, one--

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.510
x comma--

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.760
element two, one--

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.880
if x greater than
or equal to 0--

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.250
element one, two--

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.110
minus x comma--

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:20.360
element two, two--

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.940
if x less than 0.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.490
Full stop-- math.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:26.220
VOLKER SORGE: So what you could
hear, now, was that it

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:30.090
not only spoke everything in a
very verbose way-- all the

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.400
vertical bars, as well as
the opening brace--

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:39.220
but ChromeVox also fell into the
trap that it saw something

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.385
it thought might look
like it's a matrix.

00:31:41.385 --> 00:31:45.250
Because it's exactly the same
MathML structure, underneath,

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:48.560
as the matrix on the previous
page, which I have

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.360
demonstrated.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.490
Now if we apply some slightly
more intelligent way of

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:56.640
reading this here, we actually
get something

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.160
slightly more sensible.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.480
CHROMEVOX: Equation sequence--

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:06.060
square root of x square equal
absolute value of x equal--

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:11.760
case statement, case one-- x, if
x greater than or equal to

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.270
0-- case two--

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:18.295
negative x, if x less than 0.

00:32:18.295 --> 00:32:20.350
Full stop-- math.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:25.780
VOLKER SORGE: So you could see
here that what happened was

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:31.160
that now, first of all,
ChromeVox has a more semantic

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.510
interpretation of
the expression.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:36.160
It gives you a quick summary
at the beginning-- it's a

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.280
sequence of equations.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.200
So there's more than two
parts of the equation.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:45.450
And then, it reads it in a
more intelligent way, by

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.660
realizing something is an
absolute value, as well as

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:55.970
actually finding the case
statement correctly, rather

00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:00.640
than pronouncing it as a matrix,
as it has done before.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.650
And a similar semantic
interpretation can then be

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.920
applied to all the
other statements.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.470
So if you go back, for instance,
to this statement

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:14.130
here, and pronounce it, first,
in the old way--

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:18.880
CHROMEVOX: f left parenthesis
x right parenthesis equals

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.270
square root of x-- math.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:22.475
VOLKER SORGE: All right,
supply some semantics.

00:33:22.475 --> 00:33:29.805
CHROMEVOX: f of x equals square
root of x-- math.

00:33:29.805 --> 00:33:31.240
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.930
So as you could see here,
instead of pronouncing all the

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.490
parentheses, we now say "f of
x." Because we realize this

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.860
is, indeed, a function
application, and we pronounce

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.950
it accordingly.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:46.350
Now the way this is being done
is by using an underlying

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:50.770
speech rule engine, which allows
for various ways of

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:55.990
customizing the rule base that
is being used in order to

00:33:55.990 --> 00:34:00.090
speak the mathematical
expressions.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:04.230
And I'll explain, very briefly,
how that works.

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:06.790
Effectively, what happens is
the math expression is, of

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:09.510
course, a tree representation.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:12.530
In particular, it's a MathML
tree representation.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:17.540
And this representation is
recursively being traversed.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.889
And in every node,
an applicable

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:23.750
rule is being computed.

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:28.090
And that rule then has some
actions which fire, in the

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:33.530
sense that they produce some
speech output, as well as

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:37.810
produce a way to further
recursively traverse the rest

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:39.870
of the tree.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:45.030
And these rules can be
customized in various ways.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:48.429
One way of customizing them is
customizing them with respect

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.080
to mathematical domain.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.489
So what might be useful in one
mathematical domain might not

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:55.710
be the same in another
mathematical domain.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.130
And when I say "mathematical
domain," what I actually mean

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:04.290
is something like algebra,
geometry, analysis, calculus,

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:05.610
things like this.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:09.550
So you might want to pronounce
one expression, in algebra,

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:13.130
differently than in geometry.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:16.860
In addition to this, we have
the possibilities of

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.210
customizing rules
by their style.

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:22.760
And when I say "style" here, I
mean something like, do I want

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.010
it to be spoken short.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:28.450
Do I want it to be spoken in a
verbose mode, for instance.

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:31.710
Do I want it to be spoken in
some particular way that I

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:35.510
like, and nobody else
likes, et cetera.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:40.570
And finally, we also have the
possibility of swapping the

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:47.610
underlying representation
while the

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:48.870
speech engine is active.

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.700
So that's what I've
just showed you.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.130
The underlying MathML
representation, here, was

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:56.700
swapped out with a more
semantic enriched

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.950
representation.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.160
Now the problem with this
semantic enrichment is, of

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:07.320
course, that this is a fairly
ad hoc procedure.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:14.820
MathML is a language which
primarily aims for display.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:19.140
So there's two types
of MathML.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.720
One is called Presentation
MathML, and one is called

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.470
Content MathML.

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:29.620
The idea of Presentation MathML
is that it takes care

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:34.210
of how the math expression is
being laid out on the page.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:36.650
And this is what we're currently
working with.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.490
The idea of Content MathML is
that an author of a math

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:41.600
expression actually puts
in some semantics.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.880
Unfortunately, that is hardly
available on the web.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.970
Therefore, what we have to
do is we have to take the

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:51.840
Presentation MathML expression,
and interpret it

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.000
in a way that seems
reasonable to us.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.200
Obviously, this can break
down in many cases.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:02.450
And therefore, the person who
actually knows best how to

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:06.440
interpret a MathML expression is
generally the author of the

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.200
expression, themselves.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:14.390
As a consequence, we believe
that it is very useful for

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:17.410
people to actually be able to
customize the speech rules in

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:19.510
a way that they will pronounced
the MathML

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:23.370
expressions they write
in the correct way.

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:29.790
We therefore, in ChromeVox,
offer an API to users out

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:34.780
there, to authors of web pages,
to developers of EPUB 3

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:40.130
readers that allows them to
define their own math rules--

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:45.030
either override or add
to our rule base--

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.890
in order to have math
expressions being spoken in

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.380
the way they prefer.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.560
And the rest of the time I will
now spend introducing

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.190
this particular way of--

00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:00.790
these particular rules, as well
as demonstrate how they

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:03.640
can be written, and what the
different components

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.820
of these rules are.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.380
Let's, for this purpose, all
go back to our favorite

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:14.880
example, the quadratic
formula.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:20.930
We'll start manipulating the
division in the formula in

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:24.130
order to demonstrate how
we can change rules.

00:38:27.554 --> 00:38:28.006
Right.

00:38:28.006 --> 00:38:29.980
Here, I'll bring up the
console quickly.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:38.380
Let me get back to
the expression.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:46.700
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals minus b plus/minus

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:53.300
square root of b square minus
4ac divided by 2a--

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.080
math.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.770
VOLKER SORGE: Right, so this is
the default way, currently,

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:59.821
ChromeVox speaks
the expression.

00:38:59.821 --> 00:39:05.290
I will now write a rule
here, in the console.

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:07.710
I've already written it
previously, so I'll just bring

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:13.230
it up here, and explain to you
the components that will alter

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:17.050
to the way the expression
is being spoken.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:17.760
Right.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:24.790
So what you can see here, in
detail, is that we have--

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:31.270
these function names are the way
one can call ControlVox--

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.070
sorry, not ControlVox,
ChromeVox--

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.110
through the API.

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:35.760
So here's the ChromeVox API.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.895
It's, in particular,
the math API.

00:39:37.895 --> 00:39:41.360
And it offers a defined
rule function.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.265
And the function here, at the
moment, has four components.

00:39:43.265 --> 00:39:45.470
All of these are string
components.

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:48.470
The first component is a name.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:54.980
It's practically irrelevant
what that name is.

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:58.700
The whole idea of a name is that
one can more easily find

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.300
the rule later, somewhere in the
speech rule engine, say,

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.910
for debugging purposes.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:05.870
But for now, we can
just ignore this.

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:09.960
So we'll just call this
"fraction rule."

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:13.370
Then, comes some admin
information which has to do

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.840
with the domain, and the style,
I've been referring to

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.240
previously.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.550
So the domain was, just to
recall this, the idea that we

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:23.490
can specialize our rules with
respect to different

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:28.150
mathematical domains such as
algebra, geometry, et cetera.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:32.020
In addition, we always have a
default domain, which is the

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.880
one we're working on right now,
which means that if, for

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:40.490
a particular domain, no rule is
there, we can always fall

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:43.381
back to the default rule.

00:40:43.381 --> 00:40:46.060
And currently, the way domains
are being selected is

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.180
interactively, by the user.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.060
Right.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.840
So this is what the default,
here, says.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.040
Then, we have a little dot,
which separates the domain

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.840
name from the style name.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.760
And styles--

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:03.430
again, we have styles like
short, verbose, or I think we

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:05.890
also have super brief.

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:09.470
But there is no limit to what
you want to call your style.

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:11.980
If you want to call your style
after your personal name, then

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:15.010
we'll have an additional style
in ChromeVox, in the future.

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:17.350
And again, there is
a default style.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:20.410
Here, we're working, now, on
the default domain, and the

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.370
style is short.

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:23.290
All right.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:27.880
And then, the rest of the rule
is effectively a way how to

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:32.230
test whether a rule is
applicable, plus the action

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.300
the rule is supposed
to perform.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:38.000
In ChromeVox, this is given
the other way around.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.530
We first start with the action
and then with the

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:47.550
precondition, or the part of
the rule that tests whether

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:50.770
the actual rule is applicable.

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:55.130
I'll tell you, in a second,
why this is the case.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:42:00.210
Let's first have a look at this
letter part, which talks

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:04.410
about the precondition if
the rule is applicable.

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:10.010
What we want is a node, which
is our fraction up here.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:19.660
This division node is given
by a MathML tag,

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.560
which is called mfrac.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.480
And we select this using an
XPath expression here.

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.350
So this is a regular XPath
expression, which just says,

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:30.320
well, the current node--
the node we are on--

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:35.940
is a node with an mfrac tag
in the MathML name space.

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:40.550
So this is just a regular
XPath expression.

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:44.050
Then, the rule will fire.

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:46.420
And it will perform
it's action.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.500
So what are the Actions?

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:51.680
Well, actions are a sequence
of components of different

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.240
things the rule does.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.910
In this case, we only have
one compartment.

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.060
And that component is currently

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:00.270
composed of two things--

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:05.000
the type of the component,
as well as

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.550
what is being performed.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.330
So the type of the
component here is

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:11.970
given in square brackets.

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:15.880
In this case, the type is t,
which means it's just a text

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.160
that is being spoken.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.440
And the text that is being
spoken is then given as a

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:24.500
string here, in string syntax,
with double quotes at the

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.560
beginning and the end.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:29.430
So when we find the division
node, all we want, at this

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:32.560
point, is a string being spoken
where it says, "some

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:36.440
division." Let's put
that rule in.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.440
And let's see what ChromeVox
says now.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:44.180
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division-- math.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.000
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.870
That's all it says--
some division.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:48.260
x equals some division.

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.580
We haven't specified
anything else.

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:58.250
In particular, what we have not
specified here is how it

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:01.820
should deal with any of the
other content that's still in

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:02.990
the expression.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:04.710
So all we say at this
point is, say one

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:07.150
string and then stop.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:09.551
Do not recurse any further.

00:44:09.551 --> 00:44:13.280
I'll show you, in a second, how
we can do that, otherwise.

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.440
Let's first talk a bit more
about the precondition.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.340
So the precondition here is an
XPath expression, as I said,

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.690
that selects this particular
node--

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.290
this particular node
with the mfrac tag.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:27.630
So it's this division node.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:31.350
Now in addition to this, one
can then give additional

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:32.230
constraints.

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:37.080
And the number of additional
constraints is unlimited.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.170
Therefore, this is the reason
why we put the precondition at

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.460
the end of this particular
rule definition.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.840
Because you can add more, and
more, and more, and more

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.280
constraints to it.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:53.720
And I'll add one constraint,
just for you to be able to see

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:54.980
what this will look like.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.050
So when we say, OK, so we want
this rule just to be

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:04.930
applicable to something
that says that

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:06.970
it's the node, itself.

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:14.186
And it has a descendant, which
is an m square root.

00:45:14.186 --> 00:45:15.000
All right?

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.890
So that means it has a
descendant, which is a square

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:20.950
root, up there.

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:23.545
And again, this is in the
MathML name space.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:29.370
Right, sorry.

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:33.300
Unexpected token means I have
forgotten to close my

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.880
expression, my string
expression,

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.010
with a square root.

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:41.490
Let's see whether
it's applicable.

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:45.520
Well, the thing is that we
haven't really changed any of

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.020
the actions.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:49.040
So let's change the actions,
so we can actually hear

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:53.030
whether the different rule
is being applied.

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:59.166
"--some division with
square root."

00:45:59.166 --> 00:46:07.280
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.030
square root-- math.

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:10.750
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:12.830
So this has, indeed, worked.

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:18.400
And it now applies
the other rule.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.710
So we have specialized the
rule even further.

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:25.240
So in addition, we can now add
more and more constraints.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.780
Anything XPath1 allows you to
express, you can express in

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:29.770
these constraints.

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:31.140
And those are binary
constraints.

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:34.930
So they only have
to hold, or not.

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:39.100
Right.

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.230
So this is as far as I want to
explain the preconditions.

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:45.000
Now let's examine, a bit
further, what we can do in

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.750
terms of the actions
of our rule.

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:51.610
In particular, just having one
string pronounced, if you

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:54.540
actually have a complex
expression, is usually not

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.240
very fruitful.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.440
So we might want to have
a bit more pronounced.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.710
Therefore, let's dive into the
expression and pronounce some

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:05.210
of the child nodes, actually.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:05.910
Right.

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:08.580
So we now start a
new component.

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:11.470
Components are being separated
by semicolons, so that's very

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:15.320
similar to what you have
in regular JavaScript.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:19.190
And we now want to specify
a new component.

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:21.460
And this is a particular
component which works on

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:22.940
single nodes.

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.500
So therefore, it gets
the type n.

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:28.740
Again, the type is given
in square brackets.

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:32.570
And now we can write a selector
which is just yet

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:34.010
another XPath expression.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:39.160
So we write another XPath
selector that selects whatever

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:43.720
child we want to work on,
or whatever node we

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:44.350
want to work on.

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:45.630
It doesn't necessarily
have to be a child.

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:49.540
You can effectively also work
on any other node that is

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:54.600
reachable from this particular
node you're on.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.680
But in our case, we want
to work on the child.

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.470
But let's not work on both.

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:01.090
Let's just work on the second
on, for instance.

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:05.220
So this XPath expression, now,
just selects, from the given

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:09.610
node, the second child node.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:10.450
Right.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:13.820
And what the action now does
is it will pronounce the

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:18.000
string "some division with
square root." And afterwards,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:24.050
it will ask the speech rule
engine to recurse on this node

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:25.948
that we have selected here.

00:48:25.948 --> 00:48:27.370
Let's do that again.

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:31.920
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.740
square root 2a--

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:34.632
math.

00:48:34.632 --> 00:48:35.080
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:38.570
So what you can hear is that we
heard the expression up to

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:39.520
the division.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.350
Then, it would pronounced
the string.

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:46.630
And then, it would pronounce
the second child node.

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:47.060
Right.

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:52.110
Similarly, we could now
put in more content.

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:57.570
So say we put in another
string of type t.

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:00.300
Say this is now a string
called a numerator.

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.970
And we now, for instance,
want to recurse on the

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:11.530
first node, as well--

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:15.630
on the first child as well,
not the first node.

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:16.510
Let's do that.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:17.535
Let's listen to what's
happening.

00:49:17.535 --> 00:49:24.630
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:28.190
square root 2a and
numerator minus b

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:30.770
plus/minus square root--

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:31.910
VOLKER SORGE: I'll
stop it here.

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:33.770
We all know what the
numerator is.

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:35.630
But you can see how
this now works.

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:38.820
Now one of the things that David
pointed out earlier was

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:43.810
that you can actually do changes
to the way the text to

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:48.370
speech engine speaks things
from within a rule.

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:49.810
And let's do that.

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:54.090
The way this works is by
adding, in particular,

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:57.410
annotations to each component.

00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:02.310
So for instance, say we want
to change the pitch on the

00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:06.310
first component that's
being spoken.

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:09.220
Or in our case here, it's the
second component of the

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:10.310
denominator.

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:14.240
And let's say we just want to
have a significantly pitch

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:17.390
change, say, to 1.5.

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:20.870
Let's see how that sounds.

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:24.580
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:29.630
square root 2a and numerator
minus b plus--

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:31.420
VOLKER SORGE: So you could
hear that the pitch was

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:36.030
changed quite drastically when
the denominator of the

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:37.860
division was being pronounced.

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:48.920
So the way we do these
annotations is by adding in

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:54.560
round brackets, the particular
property we want to change, as

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.980
well as the value
that changes it.

00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:57.610
All right.

00:50:57.610 --> 00:50:59.770
So in addition, we can, for
instance, also increase the

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:01.110
rate of the speech.

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:03.940
Say we increase it to 2.5.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:06.710
And now let's see what's
being spoken now.

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:09.940
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:14.400
square root 2a and
numerator minus--

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.120
VOLKER SORGE: That
was not really--

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:16.770
That was--

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:19.270
CHROMEVOX: Simple school
algebra, Volker Sorge, the

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:21.100
third April, 2013

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:23.360
VOLKER SORGE: Sorry, that was
not much of a change.

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:27.610
I'll just refresh the console
so we can see a bit more.

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:31.590
Let's try to change it to
something different.

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:34.740
Maybe 0.5 will make
a difference.

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:39.160
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:42.450
square root 2a and
numerator minus--

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:43.810
VOLKER SORGE: Now you could
hear that it was actually

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:45.060
quite a bit faster.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.130
So what else can we
do with this?

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:55.730
Well, another thing that we've
heard earlier was that we can

00:51:55.730 --> 00:52:01.270
add pauses to our rule.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:02.540
Let's do that as well.

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:07.260
Let's add a pause annotation,
say, to the second--

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:09.830
uh, no, to the first
of these--

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:15.220
children that we speak.

00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:17.770
And let's add quite
a drastic pause.

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:19.030
Pauses are given in
milliseconds.

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:20.910
So let's add one second,
so we can actually

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:23.270
hear it more clearly--

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:26.874
so 1,000.

00:52:26.874 --> 00:52:31.020
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:37.234
square root 2a and numerator
minus b--

00:52:37.234 --> 00:52:37.726
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

00:52:37.726 --> 00:52:43.830
So the effect you could hear
here was something I wanted to

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:44.900
demonstrate.

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:49.640
It is that the pause, as well as
all the other annotations--

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.420
i.e. the pitch and the rate--

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:56.320
than we give a particular node
here, or particular component,

00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:00.620
are recursively being applied
by the speech rule engine.

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:04.650
That means if we change the
pitch somewhere, this pitch

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:11.180
change will be propagated
further down in the recursive

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:12.680
traversal of the tree.

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:16.290
That means is we have nested
expressions, and we change the

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:19.890
pitch several times, these
changes will add up, which

00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:22.177
gives a very nice effect
when it comes to

00:53:22.177 --> 00:53:23.140
pitch and rate changes.

00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:25.580
It doesn't really give a very
nice effect when it comes to

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:26.540
pause changes.

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.960
Because what that means is
that the pause is applied

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:32.470
after every single element
that occurs.

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:34.510
So you might want that.

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:36.080
But you don't necessarily
want that.

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.200
So in this particular
case, we don't.

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:41.660
So how do we actually do it in
order to apply the pause

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:46.260
between two chunks, rather
than having it applied

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.840
recursively, during traversing
the tree?

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.320
The way this works-- and I'll
show it to you here--

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:56.430
is by adding the pause
explicitly as we recall a

00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:59.850
personality annotation,
which is another

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:01.230
component of the actions.

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:04.590
And this component
has the type p.

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:06.300
So we put that in here.

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:07.780
Let's get the bracketing
right.

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:09.392
And let's see what
happens now.

00:54:12.104 --> 00:54:16.530
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:21.694
square root 2a and numerator
minus b--

00:54:21.694 --> 00:54:22.161
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

00:54:22.161 --> 00:54:25.110
What you could hear now was that
the pause was actually

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:30.180
only applied straight after
the denominator had been

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:31.430
pronounced.

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.290
Right.

00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:39.480
And in addition to this, we can
also, for instance, change

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.730
the volume.

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:44.850
But I'm not going
to demonstrate

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:46.070
that now, in detail.

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:48.610
Instead, I'm going to
demonstrate one final thing we

00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:53.590
can do with these speech rules,
and also, one final

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:55.330
component--

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:56.700
one type of component--

00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:58.930
for the action.

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:02.160
And that is useful when you have
a node where you do not

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:05.760
necessarily know how many
children the node has, and you

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:10.280
want to recurse over
all these nodes.

00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.340
And we'll do that--

00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:14.590
give them our division here.

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:21.540
Right.

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:24.440
And this component is
of type m, which

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.050
just stands for multinode.

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:28.840
And you then give it
a set of nodes.

00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:32.120
In our case, we select the set
of nodes, again, with an XPath

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:36.890
expression, which is
just all subnodes--

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:40.620
or all child nodes-- of
our mfrac expression.

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.430
Let's do that.

00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:42.450
Let's see what happens.

00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:46.310
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:51.190
square root minus b plus/minus
square root of b

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:55.290
square minus 4ac 2a--

00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:56.256
math.

00:55:56.256 --> 00:55:56.740
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

00:55:56.740 --> 00:56:01.330
So what you could hear now was
that all the elements are

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:04.920
actually being pronounced
properly this time, in order,

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:07.890
because this is just the regular
order within the

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:11.050
MathML expression.

00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:14.320
Now obviously, for an expression
like division,

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:17.430
where you really know that you
only have two children, this

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:18.590
might not make a lot of sense.

00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:21.990
But if you do not know exactly
how many children there are--

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:25.330
say, in the matrix expression
we've demonstrated earlier--

00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:29.960
you have to use this way off
accessing the children.

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.840
And then you have, in addition,
the opportunity, or

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:35.960
the possibility, to put in
something that is being spoken

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.410
in between all of these
expressions.

00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:41.780
And the last thing I'll
demonstrate to you now is

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:48.960
giving what we call a separator
string as a further

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:52.190
annotation to our component.

00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:56.070
And the separator is just a
regular string, in this case.

00:56:56.070 --> 00:57:10.380
And let's just say, "divided
by," and spell it right, and

00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:12.452
see what happens now.

00:57:12.452 --> 00:57:16.350
CHROMEVOX: Given we have x
equals some division with

00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:22.710
square root minus b plus/minus
square root of b square minus

00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:26.240
4ac divided by 2a--

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.500
math.

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:28.340
VOLKER SORGE: Right.

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:35.390
Back, we are, at the original
expression.

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.870
Right.

00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:41.620
So this, so far, is the
explanation of this API.

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:43.930
And why did we go into that
much detail in order to

00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:46.220
demonstrate to you how
this API works?

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:50.210
Well, the basic idea of
ChromeVox is, since it is an

00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:53.760
open project, that we're
hoping that people will

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:58.340
exploit this API in the future
in order to write explicit

00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:00.680
speech rules-- say, on
their web pages--

00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:03.610
to make sure that the math they
write, or they put on the

00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:07.160
web, is pronounced
in the right way.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:12.920
And for instance, I personally,
as a university

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:17.830
lecturer, university professor,
could imagine that

00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:21.490
I'll put some of my lecture
notes on the web.

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:26.490
And as I know exactly how things
have to be pronounced,

00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:31.480
I also put speech rules there
so my students with visual

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.950
impairments can actually go
there, and listen to the math

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:37.260
in the correct way, in exactly
the way I would

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:40.166
speak it in my lecture.

00:58:40.166 --> 00:58:40.690
Right.

00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:44.080
And with this, I'll end my part
of the presentation and

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:47.030
pass back to David, who's going
to conclude with some

00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:50.280
more details on ChromeVox
and the project.

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:53.640
DAVID TSENG: All right, thank
you so much, Volker.

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.620
I wanted to conclude by
thanking everyone for

00:58:56.620 --> 00:59:00.750
watching, and sticking with us
through all of our demos.

00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:04.260
You can find a little bit more
information about ChromeVox on

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.000
chromevox.com.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.850
And we are an open
source project.

00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:11.870
So you can actually even take
a peek at all of our code,

00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:17.060
including all of the things
that make math possible.

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:19.980
We'd be happy to take any
feedback that you have.

00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:24.520
You can also visit us, in
general, for accessibility, at

00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:30.400
Google, at the address
google.com/accessibility.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.520
Thanks again for watching.

00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:36.170
And we hope to receive any
feedback that you have.

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:37.420
Thanks.
