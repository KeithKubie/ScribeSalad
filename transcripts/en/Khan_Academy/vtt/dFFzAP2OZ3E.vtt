00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.820
I'm going to do one more
video on entropy.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.180
Maybe I'll do more
in the future.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.970
But I thought I would at least
right now do one more, because

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.080
I really want to make clear
the idea of entropy as a

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.290
macrostate variable.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.590
So let me write that down.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.320
An S, which is entropy, is
a macrostate variable.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.100
I'm going to write macro
in bold red.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.010
It's a macrostate
state variable.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.500
And I want to emphasize this.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.780
And I talked a little bit about
it in my previous video,

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.590
but I think even then I wasn't
as exact as I needed to be.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.850
And the reason why I want to
say it's macro is because

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.920
there's a very strong temptation
to point to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.520
particular micro states and
say, does this have higher

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.570
entropy or lower entropy
than another?

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.830
For example, the classic one.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.430
Even I did this.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.750
Actually, let me make a
bigger, thicker line.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.360
So you have this box that
has a divider in it.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.090
We've gone through this
multiple times.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.710
Let me draw the divider
like right there.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.960
OK.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.530
So at first if we have a
system where all of the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.550
molecules are over here-- so
that's our first scenario.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.510
And then our second scenario,
we've studied this a lot.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.190
We blow up the wall here.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.870
And we actually calculated
the entropy.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.630
Control.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.870
OK.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.240
Let me copy it and then
I'm going to paste it.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.210
Let me put these next
to each other.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.210
All right.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.540
So I have these two things.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.360
And then the second time,
I blew away this wall.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.200
Let me blow it away.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.120
Let me erase the wall there.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.230
And then we said, once the
system reaches equilibrium

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.640
again-- remember, these
macrostate variables, like

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.600
pressure, like volume, like
temperature, like entropy, are

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.240
only defined once the system
is in equilibrium.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.660
So once the system is in
equilibrium again, these

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.305
particles are now-- I wanted the
same number of particles,

00:02:07.305 --> 00:02:11.840
so let me erase some of these
particles, let me move them.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.160
Let me see if I can
select some.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.110
There.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.380
So we'll have a more even--
Let me just redraw.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.850
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8 particles.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.980
Let me erase what I have. And
I'll make it with a more even

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.230
distribution.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.770
So then, once I blow away the
wall, I might have 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.930
5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.520
Now, the reason why I'm doing
all of this is because there's

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.660
a temptation to say that this
state, what I just drew you

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.080
when I, you know, made sure to
blow these away and draw 8

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.600
more, I drew a microstate.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.850
This is a microstate.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.080
Anytime someone is actually
drawing molecules for you,

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.330
they're drawing a microstate.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.680
Now, I want to be very clear.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.260
This microstate does not have
more entropy than this

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.310
microstate.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.380
In fact, microstates you
don't have entropy.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.140
Entropy does not make sense.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.670
What you can say is a system--
and this time, I'm going to

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.050
draw it without the particles.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.900
That if I have a container
that is this big, that

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.210
contains-- so it has
some volume.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.700
So volume is equal to v1.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.840
Its temperature is equal
to a t1, and it has 8

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.860
particles in it.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.230
This has some entropy
associated with it.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.840
And what we can say, is if we
were to double the size of

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.880
this container, which we did by
blowing away that wall, now

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.160
all of a sudden our volume is
equal to 2 times v1, if we say

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.100
this is double.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.330
Our temperature is still
equal to t1.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.080
We saw that a few videos ago.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.445
And we still have 8 molecules.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.940
The entropy of this
system is higher.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.180
So now entropy is higher.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.500
And I want to make this very
clear, because you never see

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.279
it drawn this way.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.029
People always want to draw
the actual molecules.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.079
But that confuses the issue.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.380
When you draw actual molecules,
you're showing a

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.010
particular state.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.200
For example, this system, if
we were to actually measure

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.600
the microstate, it could be--
there's a very, very

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.310
infinitesimally probability--
but all of the molecules, all

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.160
8 molecules might
be right there.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.380
I mean, it's almost, you know,
you could wait for the whole

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.500
universe to come and go, and
it might not happen.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.270
But there is some probability
it would happen.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.160
So you can't assign entropy
to a particular state.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.110
All you can do is assign it
to a particular system.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.610
I want to be clear about that.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.410
So even I talked about
a clean and dirty

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.060
room and all of that.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.690
Clean versus dirty room.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.220
And the point I was making is,
the entropy of a room is not

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.840
dependent on its cleanliness
or its dirtiness.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.960
In fact, you could kind
of view these

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.670
as states of a room.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.980
But even more, these
really aren't even

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.890
states of the room.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.390
Because when a room is clean, or
a room is static at a macro

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.640
level, they're static.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.760
If my books or lying like--
you know, sometimes people

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.390
look at a deck of cards and
say, oh, if I have all my

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.940
cards stacked up like this, or
if I have all my cards that

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:43.320
are all messy like that, that
this has higher entropy.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.680
And I want to make
it very clear.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.740
I mean, maybe you can kind
of make an analogy.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.090
But that's not the case.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.960
Both of these systems
are macrostates.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.420
For example, it's not like
these cards are vibrating

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.730
around any more than
these cards are.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.660
It's not like these can take
on more configurations than

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.970
these cards can.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.770
So when you talk about entropy,
you're trying to take

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.800
a macro variable that's
describing at a micro level.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.710
And the cards themselves are not
the micro level, because

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.820
they're not vibrating around
continuously due to some

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.220
kinetic energy or whatever.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.410
It's the cards' molecules that
are at the micro level.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.000
And if these cards, if you have
the same mass of cars as

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.490
you have here, and if they're
at the same temperature, the

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.120
molecules in these cards can
take on just as many states as

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.500
the molecules in these cards.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.230
So they're going to have
the same entropy.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.380
Entropy is a macrostate
variable, or a macrostate

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.500
function, that describes
the number of states a

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.930
system can take on.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.790
So here, I would view the
cards as a system.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.580
And what we care about is not
the number of configurations

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.900
the cards themselves
can take on.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.280
The cards aren't constantly
vibrating and changing from

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.330
one thing to another.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.740
It's at the atomic level, at the
molecular level, that as

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.110
long as we're above absolute
zero, which we pretty much

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.460
always are, things are going
to be vibrating around

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.150
continuously, and continuously
changing its state.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.460
So it's almost impossible
to measure the state.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.860
And since it's impossible to
measure the state, we use

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.280
something like entropy to
say, well, how many

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.310
states can we have?

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.990
And I mean, all of these things,
entropy, whether we

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.580
call it internal energy, whether
we look at entropy,

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.730
whether we look at pressure,
volume, temperature.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.810
These are all, if you can think
about it in some way,

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.740
these are shortcuts around
having to actually measure

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.990
what each molecule is doing.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.600
And entropy, you can kind of
view it as a meta shortcut.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.060
I mean, temperature tells you
average kinetic energy, this

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.600
tells you all of the energy
that's in it, this tells you,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.010
you know, how frequently the
molecules are bumping against

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.220
a certain area.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.030
This tells you, on average, kind
of where the outermost

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.280
molecules are.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.130
Entropy is kind of a, you
can almost view it

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.260
as a metastate variable.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.030
It tells you how many states,
how many micro

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.570
states can we take on?

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.490
And so I just want to make this
very clear, because this

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.250
is often confused, and there's
a very, very, very strong

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.280
temptation to point to a
particular state and to say

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.820
that that has higher entropy
than another, that somehow

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.450
this state is more entropic
than that state.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.330
That's not the case.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.310
This system is more entropic
than this system,

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.560
than this half box.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.960
It has more volume.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:21.920
If it has the same temperature
with more volume, then its

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.860
particles can take on more
possible scenarios at any

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.560
given moment in time.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.670
Anyway, hopefully you found
that a little bit useful.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.900
I just want to make it very,
very, very clear.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.059
Because this is often, often,
often confused.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:37.650
It is a macrostate variable for
a system, where a system

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.429
is composed of things that are
bumping around randomly.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:46.210
Every millionth of a second,
they're changing states, so

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.740
it's very hard to even measure
one of the microstates.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.750
You can't point to a microstate,
and say, oh, this

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.820
has higher entropy
than another.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.190
Anyway.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.440
See you in the next video.
