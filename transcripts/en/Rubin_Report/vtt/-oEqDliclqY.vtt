00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.510
We're continuing our partnership with learn liberty today and joining me is the

2
00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:10.690
former president of the Hclu,

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.820
a board member for fire epic and the Heterodox Academy of Professor at New York

4
00:00:16.611 --> 00:00:21.611
Law School and author of the new book hate why we should resist it with free

5
00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:25.850
speech,
not censorship,
navy and stress and welcome to the Rubin report.

6
00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:26.900
Right to be here Dave.

7
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.340
So I have to tell you when I was reading through your bio and looking at all the

8
00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:34.130
boards you've sat on and head of the Aclu and all that,

9
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.750
I don't know that anyone has ever been more of sort of a perfect prime guests to

10
00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:42.320
sit in that chair and my prior book defending pornography,

11
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.430
I that caught your attention.
We can get into that too.

12
00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:51.380
But really your,
your life's work is sort of exactly why I do this show.

13
00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:55.940
And I know I'm setting you up now with a very,
you know,
high bar here but,

14
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:57.020
but this is what it's all about.

15
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.280
Thank you so much and thank you for your ardent defense of liberty that that is

16
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:03.350
the most important value for me.

17
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.650
And when people ask me what my politics are,

18
00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:11.651
I usually say I care more about my civil libertarian beliefs than I care about

19
00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:14.060
partisan political beliefs.

20
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:17.750
And one of the things that's true for the Aclu as well as for me as an

21
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:21.560
individual,
is not taking per say,

22
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:26.510
across the board positions on any candidate official party or group,

23
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.810
but judging on an issue by issue basis and issuing PR criticism or uh,

24
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.140
or praise on an issue by issue basis.

25
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:39.980
And there's not a single party or candidate or official that it hasn't earned

26
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.330
some praise and some criticism on some important civil liberties issues.

27
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:48.350
So looking at the glass half full as an activist,
I always do that.

28
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.210
There's nobody with whom I don't share some really strong convictions,

29
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:54.530
which is very nice.

30
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.340
Now it's also true that there is nobody with whom I don't have some strong

31
00:01:58.341 --> 00:01:59.180
disagreements,

32
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:04.181
but I'm used to therefore having a positive relationship across ideological

33
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:06.464
divides.
And,

34
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.470
and the absence of that or the fading of that in today's climate is very

35
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:15.560
bothersome.
Yeah.
All right.
What a great place to start this conversation then.

36
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:19.670
So as you've seen that fail,
that fade in society,

37
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.950
do you have a couple of markers or moments where you started to really see it or

38
00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:29.270
has it just been a slow slide into wherever it seems that we're at at the
moment?

39
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.430
That's a really good question Dave.

40
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:36.230
And I'm sure some sociologists have probably analyze it more.
Exactly.

41
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.700
Um,
my impression is at least on issues,

42
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.610
let's stay with issues of free speech.
Uh,

43
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.640
my strong impression is that there started to be a real breaking point in around

44
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.340
2015.
Uh,

45
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.330
I think that's when we had the Ferguson

46
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.740
riots and demonstrations and protests around the country.

47
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:07.720
And I am completely sympathetic to that cause believe me,

48
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.240
abuses in the criminal justice system.

49
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:15.130
I have been on my radar screen and the ACO use for ever,
uh,

50
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.450
way back in the dark ages or some would say that great ages of the I,

51
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:24.130
I meant only in the sense of old and it wasn't a a stigmatizing reference,

52
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:28.360
but the Reagan administration,
I used to debate his attorney,

53
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:33.361
General Ed Meese on proposition such as is the criminal justice system,

54
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.610
racially discriminatory.
So the,
and I was taking the yes,
possession.

55
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.760
So the fact that we have this outpouring in support of social justice and racial

56
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:49.540
justice and,
uh,
immigrants rights and antisexual violence,

57
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:53.200
all of that is wonderful.
But starting several years ago,

58
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.530
it started to seem more and more that advocates of these causes began to see

59
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:06.031
free speech as their enemy rather than what I know it to be,

60
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.810
which is their time tested essential ally.
Uh,

61
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:15.811
so there was this pitting of liberty against equality of civil rights,

62
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.020
against civil liberties.
And as I say that,

63
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.700
I realized that it was the second time that had happened in my adult lifetime.

64
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:26.210
The first time that,
uh,

65
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.300
that happened very strongly was in the late 1980s,
early 1990s,

66
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.570
which was the first time that hate speech codes were proposed on college

67
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:38.770
campuses.
The first time,
uh,

68
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:43.390
we started seeing criticism of what was called political correctness.

69
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:44.500
And then too,

70
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.740
especially law professors were arguing very strongly that you have to choose,

71
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.080
you can't have both liberty and equality.

72
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.770
And that's anathema to my own beliefs and experience.

73
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.050
And that's kind of where we're at right now.

74
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:01.690
That seems to be where this argument is boiled down to.

75
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:05.200
So before we unpack all of that stuff,
how did you get involved in this?

76
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:10.000
What was it about your education or your upbringing or whatever else that made

77
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:13.060
you care about free speech,
civil liberties,

78
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:16.510
everything else that you've just mentioned to you?
As far back as I can remember,

79
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.570
I have been in favor of individual liberty and resisting anybody who tried to

80
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:26.020
encroach on my liberty or that of anybody else's.

81
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:30.520
So long before I had the terminology,
I resisted my parents,

82
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:34.840
authoritarianism,
my school teachers,
authoritarianism.
Uh,

83
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:38.950
I was kind of a contrarian.
I would always like to see a different perspective.

84
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:42.910
And I remember being very puzzled as a fairly young student.

85
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:47.650
Maybe I was about 10 or 11 years old and a teacher said to me,
oh no dean,

86
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.070
why do you always have to defend the underdog?

87
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.070
And she said it as a criticism and to me it was,
well,

88
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.680
they're the ones that need the defense.

89
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.740
I have also always valued freedom of speech for ideas that I disagree with.

90
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:07.280
So I remember I was in college,
uh,

91
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.310
from 1968 to 1972 I'm very involved in the movement against the Vietnam War,

92
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.440
uh,
movements for reproductive freedom.

93
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.770
That was before the Supreme Court had decided Roe v Wade again,

94
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:23.810
that really dark ages.
Um,

95
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.840
but I also always defended freedom for people who disagreed with me.

96
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:32.450
So I would have lot big arguments,
uh,

97
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.190
with members of SDS,
students for Democratic Society,

98
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:41.750
very radical organization that wanted to shout down certain speakers that were

99
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:46.010
in favor of the Vietnam war administration officials and so forth.

100
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:49.490
And while I disagreed with the points of view of those speakers,

101
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:53.780
I didn't believe it that they should,
that we should be denying them a podium.

102
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:57.600
So as far back as I remember,
I've been,
um,
uh,

103
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.660
a cared much more about freedom in part because I do see that as the essential

104
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.140
means to advance whatever other cause is dear to you.

105
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.230
It's hard to defend the people that you don't like,
isn't it?

106
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:14.660
It seems to me that that's the one we're forgetting these days.

107
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.540
Like everyone screams about free speech all the time.

108
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.430
The second someone says they don't like,
then they kind of get quiet real quick.

109
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.230
Well,
so I was shortly after I graduated from law school,
uh,

110
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.580
the ACL.
Ooh.
And I was not involved at the national level at all at that point.

111
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:36.581
But the ACLU got involved in the infamous or famous Skokie case and that was

112
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:41.960
like a real litmus test.
I assume most viewers know what that is,

113
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:45.680
but for those who might not,
in 1977,

114
00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:50.681
the ACLU came to the defense of the free speech rights of a group of neo Nazis

115
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.790
who wanted to demonstrate in Skokie,
Illinois,

116
00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:01.090
a suburb of Chicago that had a large Jewish population and a large population of

117
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:07.730
Holocaust survivors and many members of the ACL,

118
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:12.620
you even this stalwart free speech organization,
uh,
loss,

119
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.920
we lost about 15% of our members who said,

120
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:18.080
we really defend free speech.

121
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:23.170
But this is the one exception we want to make for this absolutely apart speech.

122
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.020
Now my father is a holocaust survivor.

123
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:30.530
I have to say was sadly,
he died.
But,
um,

124
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.420
it wasn't even an issue for me.
I have to tell you,
Dave,

125
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.220
and it's coming back to your question,

126
00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:42.221
because you said something about how does it feel to defend people that you

127
00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:46.940
disagree with.
And to me,
I'm never defending them.

128
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.380
I'm never defending their ideas.
I'm never defending.

129
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:52.640
What did they say?

130
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:57.940
I am defending the principle that government should not have power to silence

131
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.780
speech just because the majority of the public,

132
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:08.781
even the vast majority of the public low despises the idea that the speech is

133
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:13.600
conveying.
Yeah.
So that's incredible.
Obviously I know the Skokie case well,

134
00:09:13.601 --> 00:09:15.000
and I'm sure many much of my audiences,

135
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:20.030
I didn't realize 15% did you say 50% of the membership of ACL EU members.

136
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.430
That's a massive name.
So,
and,
and you know,

137
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.840
so the ACLU really put its money where its mouth is.

138
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.510
It was a tremendous financial hit.

139
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:35.490
A and there was a lot of negative press.
Now,
in fairness,

140
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.180
a fairly soon after that they ACL,
Ooh,

141
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:43.920
began to recoup members.
Maybe not necessarily the same people.
In fact,

142
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:48.800
other people who wrote in and said,
we see that you really are neutral aid,

143
00:09:48.801 --> 00:09:53.280
defending civil liberties even for people that are anti civil air raise

144
00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:55.980
themselves.
Now,
that said,
I have to tell you,

145
00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:00.690
almost every time I give a speech anywhere,
people will come up to me and say,

146
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.090
I was an ACL EU member,

147
00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:08.091
but I quit over Skokie and a Raa nigher who was the executive director at the

148
00:10:08.581 --> 00:10:13.290
time.
And interestingly enough himself,
a Holocaust survivor.

149
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.850
He was born in Berlin.
His,
um,

150
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.350
extended family was completely exterminated by the Nazis.

151
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.010
He and his immediate family escaped.
And,
uh,

152
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:26.760
and he wrote a wonderful book about it afterwards called defending my enemy,

153
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:29.220
which I quote in my book.
Uh,

154
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.080
and we can talk about how that might seem paradoxical,
but it's,
it's really not.

155
00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:38.190
But anyway,
in this context,
I brought him up because he said to me,
Nadine,

156
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:43.191
if every person who said they left the ACLU over Skokie really had been a

157
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:44.371
member,

158
00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:49.371
we would have been the largest organization in the world game.

159
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.890
If I can just follow up on that.

160
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.920
It's not just an abstract principle because you can really see how the principal

161
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:02.430
has concrete ramifications for exactly the opposite ideas.

162
00:11:02.431 --> 00:11:05.010
So in our briefs,
in the Skokie case,

163
00:11:05.011 --> 00:11:10.011
we pointed out that the arguments that were being made to justify suppressing

164
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:11.701
the Nazis,

165
00:11:11.701 --> 00:11:16.701
namely that their ideas were offensive and insulting and threatening and seen as

166
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:21.780
dangerous to the Jews and the Holocaust survivors in Skokie.

167
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:27.050
That was exactly the same set of arguments that was made not that much earlier

168
00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:32.391
in 1968 when Martin Luther King was trying to demonstrate in Cicero,

169
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.490
Illinois,
the very same state,

170
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.020
but with a very different population that saw his ideas as threatening and

171
00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:43.890
dangerous and subversive,
offensive and insulting.
This is where this weird,

172
00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:45.870
subjective nature of this comes in,

173
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:48.750
which is why you've said several times now you're defending the principal,

174
00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:52.950
not the person,
and that that of course is the,
is the key to this whole,

175
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.100
but we've been pushed

176
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.480
<v 2>into this place these days where it seems like there's a large set of people or</v>

177
00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:03.430
certainly a set of very loud people who think that speech is violence.

178
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:10.050
<v 1>It ain't violence.
Well,
I suppose speech could advocate violence,</v>

179
00:12:10.051 --> 00:12:13.250
it could incite violence,
it could threaten violence.

180
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.731
<v 2>So do you,</v>

181
00:12:13.731 --> 00:12:17.330
so do you agree with where we have the law is now in terms of you can't directly

182
00:12:17.331 --> 00:12:18.410
insight and that sort of thing.

183
00:12:18.411 --> 00:12:20.930
Do you think all those laws are are just inappropriate?

184
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.620
<v 1>Absolutely.
And I have to say,
even though I've been teaching constitutional law,</v>

185
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:26.510
the First Amendment for decades,

186
00:12:26.511 --> 00:12:30.920
the process of writing this book and thinking about it and even more focused

187
00:12:30.921 --> 00:12:35.921
fashion really increased my respect for us law.

188
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.750
And I really think that for many people,

189
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:43.930
if they would just understand what the law actually provides,

190
00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:49.180
they would be much more supportive of freedom of speech because it is much more

191
00:12:49.221 --> 00:12:54.221
nuanced and much more common sensical then is often misdescribe when people say

192
00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:59.900
either,
Oh,
hate speech is not free speech.
We heard here that a lot,

193
00:12:59.901 --> 00:13:03.170
including when you were at the University of New Hampshire.
We are in that a lot.

194
00:13:03.171 --> 00:13:06.710
Right?
Um,
and then conversely,
people will say,
Oh,

195
00:13:06.711 --> 00:13:11.570
hate speech is protected.
And neither generalization is correct.

196
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.030
Yes.
I,

197
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:18.250
this fact that speech has a hateful or hated message idea or content can never

198
00:13:22.071 --> 00:13:24.680
be a justification for censoring it.

199
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.120
But if in a particular context,

200
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.550
a hateful message along with any other message,
uh,

201
00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:36.260
directly causes certain serious,

202
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.320
specific imminent harm and there's no way to avert that harm other than

203
00:13:42.051 --> 00:13:46.250
punishing the speech,
then the speech can and should be punished.

204
00:13:46.251 --> 00:13:51.251
And common examples that satisfy that standard are intentional incitement of

205
00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.030
imminent violence,

206
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:57.770
a genuine threat that instills fear that you're going to be subject to violence.

207
00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.030
Um,
uh,

208
00:13:59.031 --> 00:14:03.990
another example is a hate crime and that is,
it's,
it's,

209
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
it's a little bit different in the sense that a n I'm going so much into my

210
00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:12.590
constitutional it,
no,
we're going into the weeds with that,
but that's good.

211
00:14:12.591 --> 00:14:13.424
That's good.
Okay.

212
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:18.430
So if I can say there is no term hate speech and that was a point that you made

213
00:14:18.921 --> 00:14:23.750
in your University of New Hampshire.
They said that it's a fact,
right?

214
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.400
And,

215
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.400
and it's a fact that is subscribed to by every single supreme court justice

216
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.240
across the ideological spectrum,
you know,

217
00:14:32.241 --> 00:14:37.241
from Ginsburg and Sotomayor on the left to Alito and Gorsuch and Scalia on the

218
00:14:37.491 --> 00:14:38.840
right.
And I think that's a very,

219
00:14:38.841 --> 00:14:43.841
very important point there for all of their ideological differences on so many

220
00:14:44.121 --> 00:14:47.420
issues that so many justices,

221
00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:51.050
every justice in modern history has subscribed to this.

222
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:57.040
And I wish that people across the ideological spectrum in other branches of

223
00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:02.090
government and the general public which share that unanimity because no matter

224
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:04.040
who you are,
no matter what you believe,

225
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.810
you really have a stake in denying the government and the majority of,

226
00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.570
of people that wield power,
uh,

227
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.250
taking away from you the choice about which views you will express or listened

228
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:17.240
to or refute.

229
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.800
So in that University of New Hampshire speech that I know you watched when,

230
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.950
when I was saying there,
you know,
hate speech is not real.

231
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.940
Obviously I was making the distinction between the direct call to violence,

232
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:31.130
which I actually said,
unless it's a direct call to balance,

233
00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:34.800
but hate speech in and of itself is,
is nothing.
It's not a,

234
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.690
it's not a thing you can say mean things.
I would prefer you don't.

235
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.490
We wish we could all be nice to each other and say lovely things.

236
00:15:42.491 --> 00:15:45.350
I use pronouns the way people want it and all of those things.

237
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.970
But you can't have the government doing it.

238
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.540
Is there anything else that I should have added in that,

239
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:54.680
that perhaps could have gotten those young people to uh,

240
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:58.340
listen to that they were disposed not to listen,
but for,

241
00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.220
there were obviously some open minded people in the audience.

242
00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:03.890
And those are the ones that you're,
I mean,
the hecklers,
I think we're,

243
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.150
we're not Jen,
they didn't seem genuinely interested in,
in hearing you out,

244
00:16:08.151 --> 00:16:11.630
but have many other people.
They're dead.
And the other point that,

245
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.640
that I would make strategically,

246
00:16:13.641 --> 00:16:17.810
Dave and I already did it and pointing out the Martin Luther King counterpart to

247
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:23.050
the Nazis is I always tried to give an example where I an idea that you happen

248
00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:28.520
to support that the person I'm talking to it really supports would be threatened

249
00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:32.150
if we gave that power to the government.
So,
uh,
for that,

250
00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.540
that audience where you had people chanting black lives matter,

251
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:40.810
I would have pointed out how many government officials now are saying black

252
00:16:41.331 --> 00:16:46.331
lives matter advocacy should be treated as hate speech.

253
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:47.030
Uh,

254
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:52.030
that even saying that black lives matters should be treated as a hate group.

255
00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.710
Uh,
the southern poverty law center,

256
00:16:54.711 --> 00:16:59.711
which monitors hate groups has been lobbied to treat black lives matter as such.

257
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.280
And so then you had to say to people,
you,

258
00:17:02.281 --> 00:17:06.920
you have to understand that it's not your values that are going to be

259
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:10.760
implemented by the enforcing officials across the country.

260
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.000
And if we have this loose,
nebulous concept,

261
00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:18.410
I mean hate is an emotion.
It's inherently subjective.

262
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.930
What one person considers hateful,
somebody else cherishes.
Yeah.

263
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.490
So you mentioned the southern poverty law center.

264
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.940
I don't want to get you in any hot water here,
but they to me,

265
00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:32.000
strike me as an organization that has completely,

266
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:37.490
completely with almost no reservation.
Can I say this gone off the rails.

267
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.560
But they have,
you know,
between now they just,
just in this last week they,

268
00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:42.830
they lost this lawsuit.

269
00:17:42.831 --> 00:17:45.590
Margin wise is getting a three point $3 million settlement,

270
00:17:45.591 --> 00:17:49.830
but they had an eye on her cle and Bridgette Gabriel and several people who I've

271
00:17:49.831 --> 00:17:50.010
had

272
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.050
<v 2>on the show who I think are,
are wonderful people,
uh,
on their hate list.</v>

273
00:17:54.051 --> 00:17:55.520
They just put up a,
uh,

274
00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:00.030
an article about the evils of Prager university and called me out by name.

275
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.600
What am I to make of the shifting of traditionally organizations that were doing

276
00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:10.320
good work into becoming what I would say are really far left advocacy groups

277
00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:13.500
instead of maybe the original mission statement.
Would

278
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:17.040
<v 1>I think that was a fair assessment,
just not knowledgeable enough about,
um,</v>

279
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.030
the instances that you,
so I'll go back to something I said at the beginning,

280
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:26.031
which is I don't endorse or criticize any organization across the board.

281
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:30.370
I look at it issue by issue and I think they,
uh,

282
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:35.120
southern poverty law center has done a lot of good work on issues that,

283
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.660
that I care about,
including a freedom of speech on campus.

284
00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:43.890
And they definitely oppose censorship are including of hate speech.

285
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:48.810
I testified with a leader of the SPLC,
uh,
before,
uh,
Congress,
uh,

286
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.140
last year and completely opposed to censorship,

287
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.410
completely supporting counter speech.
And in fact,

288
00:18:55.411 --> 00:19:00.411
the SPLC put out a wonderful guide for college students at the beginning of the

289
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.490
last academic year urging them,
uh,

290
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:09.530
when a white supremacist recruiters are coming to campus not to engage in

291
00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:15.480
disruption,
not try to censor them or just shout them down,

292
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:20.100
but to ignore them.
And I thought that was right,
not only in principle,

293
00:19:20.101 --> 00:19:25.101
but also as a matter of strategy because you're just playing into their tactics.

294
00:19:25.861 --> 00:19:29.760
Now,
does that mean that every single thing they've done is,
is,
is praiseworthy?

295
00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:34.160
I doubt it.
I think even the ACLU is not a above

296
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.120
<v 2>criticism.
Yeah.
So I know when,</v>

297
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.900
when they sent over some notes about what w what we potentially could talk about

298
00:19:41.901 --> 00:19:43.660
in your book and everything else.
Um,

299
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.630
so because you did watch that University of New Hampshire thing,

300
00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.890
there's a moment where a girl that was challenged me kept implying that it was

301
00:19:50.891 --> 00:19:54.790
free speech,
sort of that led to the Holocaust,
that it was this,

302
00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.660
that they allowed incitement.
And that that's what led to it.
Now,

303
00:19:58.661 --> 00:20:01.570
my basic argument was the more speech there is,

304
00:20:01.571 --> 00:20:05.350
the more we can allow sunlight to disinfect bad ideas.

305
00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.590
But I think perhaps I could have been a little more forceful there.

306
00:20:08.591 --> 00:20:11.360
If you were standing next to me when we were doing this,
what,

307
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.770
what would you have been saying in my ear to that argument that if we just keep

308
00:20:14.771 --> 00:20:18.490
letting people say all these awful things that it can lead to awful things and

309
00:20:18.491 --> 00:20:21.230
awful things obviously have happened throughout the course of you.
Yeah,

310
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:22.630
<v 1>I have a lot of answers,</v>

311
00:20:22.631 --> 00:20:27.490
but let me start with the one that is most specific to the Holocaust.
And again,

312
00:20:27.491 --> 00:20:32.330
I have a personal stake and I know you also lost relatives in the Holocaust off

313
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.630
for me.
My father fortunately survived,

314
00:20:34.631 --> 00:20:39.580
but he was in a concentration camp and suffered grievously doing forced labor

315
00:20:39.581 --> 00:20:44.581
and in fact was scheduled to be sterilized and then was liberated by the u s

316
00:20:47.111 --> 00:20:50.830
military one day before.
So,
you know,

317
00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:53.770
I almost had my life exterminated before it began.

318
00:20:53.771 --> 00:20:58.480
I have no love lost for the Nazis.
In fact,
there was,

319
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:03.190
uh,
there were hate speech laws in the Weimar Republic,

320
00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:07.450
Drury Inn,
which is,
uh,
Germany where Hitler rose to power.

321
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:12.490
And the hate speech laws were very similar to the ones that exist in Germany and

322
00:21:12.491 --> 00:21:16.360
other countries today.
They were very strictly enforced.

323
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.600
Nazis were prosecuted and convicted repeatedly and gas what?

324
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:24.010
They loved it,

325
00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.850
it was a huge propaganda opportunity for them.

326
00:21:27.851 --> 00:21:32.680
They gained attention and support that they otherwise never would have had.

327
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.640
Just like the Neo Nazis in Skokie,
all those years later,

328
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.220
nobody would have heard of them if we adjust,

329
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:44.250
allowed them to have their miserable little march for the 20 minutes to 30

330
00:21:44.531 --> 00:21:48.190
minutes they were seeking to march instead of becomes two years' worth of

331
00:21:48.191 --> 00:21:49.690
worldwide attention.
Now,

332
00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:54.691
the problem in Nazi in Pre Nazi Germany was that there was no protection against

333
00:21:55.931 --> 00:22:00.760
violence that the Nazis were engaging in.
Uh,
so,

334
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.270
uh,

335
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:05.620
their political opponents as well as Jews and others were subject literally to

336
00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:10.621
physical assaults and even murder without any sufficient protection or

337
00:22:11.171 --> 00:22:15.430
punishment.
So,
uh,
the other point I would make is that,

338
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.593
um,

339
00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:21.690
those of us who are minorities and Jews are a tiny minority in this country and

340
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:27.301
around the world is specially depend on freedom of speech because by definition

341
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.960
we're never going to have majority power.

342
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.810
So all we have to depend on,
uh,

343
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:40.890
to limit the majority from trampling on our rights is freedom of speech to

344
00:22:41.711 --> 00:22:45.820
protest,
uh,
the First Amendment right of association,
uh,

345
00:22:45.821 --> 00:22:50.730
to the right to petition the government for redress of grievances are Jonathan

346
00:22:50.731 --> 00:22:53.440
route.
She had great gay rights advocate who my quota.

347
00:22:53.441 --> 00:22:58.060
My work makes the same point about,
you know,
as a member of sexual orientation,

348
00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:02.540
minority,
all minorities especially depend on free speech.
Uh,

349
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.910
I quote all a lot of civil rights leaders,
um,
in my book,

350
00:23:06.911 --> 00:23:10.110
Martin Luther King,
the Naacp,
uh,

351
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:14.920
throughout the civil rights movement were completely opposed to censorship

352
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:19.950
including hate speech laws in part because their speech was viewed as hated and

353
00:23:21.521 --> 00:23:25.200
even hateful and certainly dangerous.
How concerned are you,
you about

354
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.170
<v 2>self censorship?
Not,
not the government doing it,</v>

355
00:23:28.171 --> 00:23:31.800
but what I see more as the sort of the low level war right now,

356
00:23:31.801 --> 00:23:36.180
which is just the emails that I get every day about people afraid to speak up at

357
00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:38.400
work.
People are afraid to speak up at college.

358
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.570
People literally afraid to speak up in their own homes because they've been so

359
00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.250
crushed by political correctness.

360
00:23:44.251 --> 00:23:45.890
They don't want to start fights with loved ones.

361
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.490
<v 1>It's,</v>

362
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:51.490
it's a serious problem and I have to say it's a difficult problem because to

363
00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:57.210
some extent the point of counter speech,
which I advocate,

364
00:23:57.211 --> 00:23:57.891
and by the way,

365
00:23:57.891 --> 00:24:02.330
that's a legal listic way of saying anything you disagree with.

366
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:05.120
You just re rather than trying to squelch it,

367
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:10.220
stopping that expression from coming out,
you respond to it,
you debate it,

368
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.110
you try to persuade you could Joel,

369
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.490
so that's countering an idea you dislike with your own speech.
To some extent,

370
00:24:16.491 --> 00:24:21.491
the goal of counter speech is to chill certain speech and a certain ideas,

371
00:24:23.811 --> 00:24:24.320
right?

372
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.320
You want to dissuade somebody from adhering to white supremacist views.

373
00:24:29.691 --> 00:24:33.350
You don't see it as bad if they self sensor,
right?

374
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:38.650
But when does that persuasion crossed the line into bullying or Harrison?

375
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.840
I think that's a very important and difficult issue,

376
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:50.110
which was discussed very extensively in the famous John Stuart Mill Essay on

377
00:24:52.551 --> 00:24:55.640
liberty of many people who haven't recently read.

378
00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:00.640
It would be surprised as I was because I hadn't read it for a few years on my

379
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:06.070
travels and somebody reminded me that his main focus there was not on direct

380
00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.050
government coercion,

381
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:14.320
but rather on the social pressure that is exerted by colleagues,

382
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:19.700
peers,
civil society,
and in this country.
On the one hand,

383
00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:24.620
I'm very glad that there is such a robust civil society,

384
00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:29.650
condemnation of racist tweets by Roseanne Barr to site a fairly recent example.

385
00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:36.080
On the other hand,
I'm afraid of the mob,

386
00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:36.980
um,

387
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.980
ruthlessly punishing somebody who may have just said something that's

388
00:25:43.221 --> 00:25:48.110
insensitive.
Uh,
and,
and,
and,
and I'm concerned about that,
David.

389
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:52.070
Not only because I don't want to,
um,
you know,

390
00:25:52.071 --> 00:25:57.071
the mob is no more appealing as a force that drives certain ideas out of

391
00:25:59.661 --> 00:26:01.610
existence than the government is.

392
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:06.850
But I'm also concerned from the point of view of educating and persuading.

393
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.030
And,
you know,

394
00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.290
I've met people that have been not only members,

395
00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:20.291
but leaders of hate groups who have come to see that they were wrong,

396
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.820
who have come to,
um,

397
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.840
realize that all of us are equal and entitled to equal dignity and equal rights.

398
00:26:30.681 --> 00:26:35.681
And they've reputed they're formerly discriminatory ideas and they didn't come

399
00:26:36.531 --> 00:26:40.490
to that change by being denounced as racists,

400
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.760
much less as would happen in Europe by being imprisoned as,

401
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:49.130
as racist.
So if our goal truly is to,
um,

402
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.720
gain more support on the part of more people for the ideals of liberty and

403
00:26:53.721 --> 00:26:57.240
justice and human rights and equality and dignity for all,

404
00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.470
I think we don't do it by,
by shouting them down.

405
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:06.210
So it's a strategic question as well as a PR,
a principled question.

406
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.581
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

407
00:27:06.581 --> 00:27:10.270
Is that just one of those things where it's like in the moment that we live in,

408
00:27:10.271 --> 00:27:13.630
we often don't live up to our ideals in the best way possible because you

409
00:27:13.631 --> 00:27:18.070
referenced being constitutional law professor and I've got the declaration of

410
00:27:18.071 --> 00:27:20.650
independence and the constitution framed right in that room right over there.

411
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:24.640
And it's like these guys that were writing these incredible documents that have

412
00:27:24.641 --> 00:27:27.880
given more freedom to more people than ever in the history of the world.

413
00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.970
Well some of them were slave owners and,

414
00:27:29.971 --> 00:27:34.660
and plenty of other things and probably womanizers and whatever.
And it's like,

415
00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:38.350
but yet they were writing the things that freed us,
which is an incredible,

416
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.210
and that's just a little something about being human.

417
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.360
<v 1>And,
and I think it ties back to to some of our earlier conversation that um,</v>

418
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.400
so much of what passes as debate such as your hecklers at the University of New

419
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:58.470
Hampshire is not genuinely engaged in really trying to relate to you as a full

420
00:28:01.181 --> 00:28:04.000
fledged human being with whom they might.

421
00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:09.150
I have absolutely no doubt based on my experience that there are no two people

422
00:28:09.551 --> 00:28:14.551
in the world who won't have at least some strong common concern,

423
00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:20.620
some idea that they are passion that they both deeply care about and are

424
00:28:20.621 --> 00:28:24.700
committed to and,
and some that they deeply disagree about.

425
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:28.600
And I think it's not,
it's really important not to paper over the disagreements.

426
00:28:28.601 --> 00:28:31.450
I think we should discuss them and hash them out,

427
00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:36.690
but I think we can do that more constructively and effectively if we also find

428
00:28:36.731 --> 00:28:40.480
what we have in common and and relate to each other in,

429
00:28:40.481 --> 00:28:42.010
in a holistic way.
