00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
We're on problem 106.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.610
The present ratio of students
to teachers at a certain

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.110
school is 30:1.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.890
So the ratio of students to
teachers is equal to 30:1.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.770
If the student enrollment were
to increase by 50 students,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.040
and the number of teachers were
increased by 5, the ratio

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.220
of students to teachers
would then be 25:1.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.100
So if we increase the students
by 50 students, and increase

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:43.700
the teachers by 5, the new ratio
is going to be 25:1.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.200
What is the present number
of teachers?

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.660
Let's just simplify these
a little bit.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.010
We could cross-multiply.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.730
We could just write s over T.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.050
30 over 1 is equal to 30,
or s is equal to 30T.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.790
And let's substitute that into
this equation, because we're

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.050
going to have to solve for the
present number of teachers,

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.990
which is just T.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.830
So substitute this here, so we
get 30T plus 50, over T plus

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.920
5, is equal to-- well, 25
over 1, that's just 25.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.705
And then let's multiply both
sides of this equation by T

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:36.900
plus 5, and you get 30T plus
50 is equal to 25T, plus--

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.000
what's 25 times 5?-- 125.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.240
Let's subtract 25T
from both sides.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.980
You get 5T plus 50
is equal to 125.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.900
Subtract 50 from both sides,
you get 5T is equal to 75.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:07.950
And then T is equal to 15.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.140
15 times 5 is 50, plus
25, right, 75.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.190
T is 15.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.390
So the answer is E.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.126
Next question.

00:02:15.126 --> 00:02:16.940
I don't want to run out of
space, so I'll just do it

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.360
right here.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.130
Problem 107.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.950
What is the smallest integer,
n, for which 25 to the n is

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.030
greater than 5 to the 12th?

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.650
Whenever you see some type of
an equation or inequality

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.940
where the variables are under
the exponent, and you're

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.350
comparing numbers of different
bases, your first thing that

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.840
should register in your brain
is how can I get these to be

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.600
in the same base?

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.020
And it should be pretty obvious
here, because 25 is

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.750
the same thing as 5 squared, so
let's rewrite it that way.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.170
This statement is equivalent to
saying 5 squared to the n

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.080
is greater than 5 to the 12th.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.290
And 5 squared to the n, that's
the same thing as 5 to the 2n,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.340
is greater than 5 to the 12th.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.240
And this right here is going to
be true when 2n is greater

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.810
than 12, when the exponent up
here is greater than the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.870
exponent up here.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.020
That's when it's going
to be true.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.925
You divide both sides by 2, and
you get is greater than 6.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.830
So what is the smallest integer,
n, for which 25 to

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.410
the n is greater than
5 to the 12th?

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.850
So n has to be greater than 6,
so we can't pick choice A,

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.550
which is 6, because if we pick
6, then we would have

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.960
5 to the 12th here.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.110
And then it would be an
inequality, but this is

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.120
greater than.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.100
So the smallest integer, n, now
has to be greater than 6,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.280
so n has to be 7.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.530
So that's choice B.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.850
And don't get tricked there.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.660
When you get 6 as your answer,
you might want to pick A, but

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.100
n has to be greater than 6.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.420
So it's essentially the
smallest integer

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.220
greater than 6, is 7.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.940
Problem 108.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.370
If x and y are different prime
numbers, each greater than 2,

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.740
which of the following
must be true?

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.290
Each greater than 2, they're
both prime numbers.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:28.330
So statement number 1: x
plus y cannot equal 91.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.370
Let me think about that.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.420
If x are y are different prime
numbers, each greater than 2,

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.602
which of the following
must be true?

00:04:36.602 --> 00:04:40.822
x plus y cannot equal 91.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.900
Let me think about that
a little bit.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.310
That means that I can't have two
prime numbers that, when I

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.640
add them together, equal 91.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.000
Well, let's think about it.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.730
They're greater than 2, and
then they're prime.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.500
So what do we know about all
prime numbers greater than 2?

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.730
Well, we know that
they're both odd.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.880
All prime numbers are odd.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.830
2 is the only even
prime number.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.500
So both of these
have to be odd.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:14.080
So if I add an odd plus
an odd, what do I get?

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.900
One way to think about it, this
might be second nature to

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.530
you at this point, but an odd
number can be written in the

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.500
form, 2 times some
integer plus 1.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.900
It's some even integer, some
even number plus 1.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.190
So I could write the first
odd number like that.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.930
Maybe I'll say this is x.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.050
I'm just saying that x is odd.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.370
I'm not saying that x is prime,
but if you're larger

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.690
than 2 and you're prime,
you're going to be odd.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.110
Otherwise, you're
divisible by 2.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.250
And let's say y is equal
to 2 times some other

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.810
integer, plus 1.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.910
So if you add two odd numbers
together, you get 2 times k,

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.470
plus m, plus 2, which
is an even number.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.780
When you add two odd numbers,
you get an even number.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.380
So if you add two prime numbers
greater than 2, you're

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.110
essentially adding two odd
numbers greater than 2, so

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.110
they have to be equal
to an even number.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.370
So they can't be equal to 91.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.180
So statement 1 must be true.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.220
Statement 2, let's
think about it.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:27.880
Statement 2 tells us,
x minus y is even.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.500
So once again, x and
y are definitely

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.070
going to be odd numbers.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.360
When you add them, you
get an even number.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.440
What happens when you
subtract them?

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.690
If I were to subtract y from
x, what would I get here?

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:50.810
If I were to subtract it, I
would get 2 times k, minus m,

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.780
and then the 1 minus 1.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.030
But this k minus m is going
to still be an integer.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.370
These are two integers,
so this is still

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.910
going to be an integer.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.340
And they're different prime
numbers, so k and m are going

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.820
to be different, so this isn't
going to be equal 0.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.200
So the difference has got
to be an even integer.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.500
It might be a negative even
integer, because we don't know

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.180
that x is necessarily larger
than y, but we know that it

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.480
has to be an even integer.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.050
So statement 2 is
also correct.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.300
Now statement 3.

00:07:29.154 --> 00:07:37.300
x divided by y is
not an integer.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.600
Well, we know that x is prime,
which means that it only has

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.980
two factors, 1 and itself.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.560
And we know that x isn't 2.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.110
We know that y is another
prime number.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.530
Now, if this statement right
here-- if x divided by y-- if

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.890
that were an integer, then
that means that y divides

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.430
evenly into x.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.050
Which would mean that
y is a factor of x.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.380
Which would mean that x has
a factor other than 1 and

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.980
itself, which would mean
that x is not prime.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.430
But they tell us it x is a prime
number, and y isn't just

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.240
the number 1.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.280
They're both prime numbers and
they're each greater than 2,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.050
so y is definitely not 1.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:24.440
So in order for this to be an
integer, x could not be prime.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.260
Since x is prime, and y is some
number greater than 2, we

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.990
know that this is
not an integer.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.679
So all three of these statements
have to be true.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:41.620
And that's statement
E, answer E.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.380
Problem 109.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.100
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:52.100
All of the following have the
same value except-- OK, so

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.460
we're just going to try to do
the math real fast here.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:01.300
1 plus 2, plus 3, plus 4, plus
5, all of that over 3.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:06.970
1 plus 2 is 3, 3 plus 3 is 6,
6 plus 4 is 10, 10 plus 5 is

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.170
15, divided by 3, this
is equal to 5.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:18.740
B, 1/3, times 1, plus 1,
plus 1, plus 1, plus 1.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.886
That's 1/3 times-- this is 5,
so this is equal to 5/3.

00:09:23.886 --> 00:09:26.010
So after we see the next answer
we should know where

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.070
we're going.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:31.180
So the next answer, we have 1/3
plus itself five times.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:36.350
1/3 plus 1/3, plus 1/3,
plus 1/3, plus 1/3.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.210
Well, that's five 1/3s, so
that's also equal to 5/3.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:45.510
So we should immediately be able
to recognize that this is

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.630
different than the other two.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.100
And assuming there's only one
answer-- they say all the

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.720
following have the same value
except-- I think we've done

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.895
enough math, because we
know that B and C are

00:09:53.895 --> 00:09:55.570
the the same value.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.553
And A is already different,
so A is probably

00:09:57.553 --> 00:09:58.340
going to be our choice.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.805
And if we kept going,
D and E are going to

00:09:59.805 --> 00:10:00.300
have the same value.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.050
And just eyeballing
it, it does look

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.270
like that's the case.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.880
It definitely looks like that's
the case, because if

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.700
you look at the other two
problems, you still get 5/3.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.110
And E looks confusing, but the
fact that A is already

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.860
different than B and C tells
you that A is the answer.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.520
And I'll see you in
the next video.
