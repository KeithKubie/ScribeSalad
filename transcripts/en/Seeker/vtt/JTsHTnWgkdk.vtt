Howdy productive members of corporate society,
Trace and Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.820
You may have heard the term "work wife" or
"work husband" -- basically it's a platonic

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.520
partner in your office, separate from your
actual partner.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.990
Basically, a 'work spouse' is

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.660
a non-romantic significant other,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.259
like your BFF at work.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.390
According to informal online surveys done
by career websites like Captivate and Vault,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.120
around 60 percent of people said they had
a work spouse.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.829
A work-wife, or work-husband is a super-interesting
and fairly new development for researchers!

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.890
It was only defined in the journal Communication
Studies in June of 2015!

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.999
They were trying to define the idea of a work-spouse
to "chart a course" for "future research for

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:54.379
communication scholars."

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.710
Having a work-spouse is *not* the same as
dating a coworker.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.839
It's usually platonic -- so not about seuxal
interest -- instead, it's a way to get mutual

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.310
support, have a sounding board for frustrations
and over time the pair forms a strong emotional

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.310
connection.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.310
Again though, not sexual.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.310
Platonic.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.310
In fact,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.310
55 percent of those surveyed said

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.710
their work-spouse was same sex -- though there's
also the consideration of sexual orientation.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.280
If you're wondering who your office-spouse
is, think about a coworker who you talk to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.780
throughout the day; 21-percent said they talk,
IM or email constantly at work -- mostly talking

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.950
about work and co-workers, a bit more than
half talked salary.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.140
But don't think work-spouses are just for
gossip.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.760
For example, to paraphrase the Boston Globe's
Beth Teitell:

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.270
"No one has your back like your [work-spouse]!"

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.340
Occupational Psychologist Joanna Butler told
the Telegraph, "We're working longer hours…

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.030
[and] we're more likely to work in collaborative
environments."

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.780
And in those collaborative environments, social
support makes us happy, while researchers

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.170
have found again and again that isolation
makes people unhappy.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.820
You can't underestimate the power of a happy
worker.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.020
A study published in the Journal of Labor
Economics found

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.680
people who are happy at work are more productive.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.830
They use their time more effectively and work
more quickly without compromising work quality!

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.760
And having friends at work does make us happy!

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.960
A Gallup poll found close friendships at work
increase employee satisfaction 50-percent!

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.450
And the Harvard Business Review writes that
"Friends at work also form a strong social

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.020
support network for each other… whether
rooting for each other on promotions, consoling

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.540
each other about mistakes, giving advice,
or providing support for personal situations."

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.850
Perhaps part of the reason we're just starting
to study this, is because we're just getting

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.030
a new term for work-BFFS.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.090
Surely, close friendships have existed at
work before the 21st century, but now with

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.300
the tendency of work to go on at all hours.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.750
Maybe they're more important?

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.750
True!

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.390
If you're not a get-off-my-lawn Baby Boomer,
you know Millennials are not a lazy generation,

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.450
but rather that seventy-three percent work
more than 40 hours a week…

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.330
...and nearly a quarter work over 50!

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.660
On top of that, millennials are more likely
than past generations to have a marriage partner

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.660
who

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.780
works out of the home, and report that they
have less time to do what they want.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.270
Plus, they're paid less than their Baby Boomer
counterparts.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.840
Bottom-line, all these pressures means Millennials
crave a positive workplace culture -- which

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.770
includes making good friends in the workplace.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.790
And that's really what the "work-spouse" really
is, your work BFF.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.819
Some people don't even like the term work-husband
or work-wife, because it does imply so much

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.470
more than just a close non-romantic friendship.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.310
Additionally, some researchers have concerns
about falling into traditional gender roles,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.740
and still others fear work-spouses will disrupt
the workplace in general.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.740
But c'mon.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.540
Having a friend who is close in proximity
(like in the same office) can influence your

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.750
well-being… because again, having friends
positively impacts your health.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.650
Look, I think we all know work-spouses slash
work-BFFs exist, but way more research is

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.650
needed.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.780
But not about you and me right?

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.319
Work BFFs?

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.739
Obvi.

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.560
And if you are one of those working super-long
hours outside the home… maybe like… think

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.599
about ways to make your marriage partner feel
appreciated.

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.920
We'd like to thank our sponsor Kay Jewelers
for supporting DNews and this episode.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.280
For 100 years, every kiss begins with Kay.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.530
Do you have a work wife?

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.530
Work husband?

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.900
Tell us in the comments.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.270
Also when it comes to leadership in the workplace
(or elsewhere) who are better: men or women?

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.879
That debate happens (with science) on this
video here.
