00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.100
We can figure this out by looking at the roots, or the zeros of this function.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.955
We found before that they were 2, 9 plus i and 9 minus i. Now, these breakeven

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:14.700
points are going to be actual points on the graph. And remember, since our

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.669
graph is only plotting real values of x and real values of y, 9 plus i and 9

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:23.769
minus i, are not actual x values on the graph. That means the only real x

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:29.487
intercept is at x equals 2. So there's only one break even point, and as I just

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:35.590
said the value of x at that point is 2. Now remember, x in this equation, stood

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.344
for thousands of dollars spent on advertising. So Grant doesn't just need to

00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:45.595
spend $2 to break even, he needs to spend $2,000. He'd probably rather spend

00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:49.720
two but unfortunately, advertising is pretty expensive.
