00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:08.580
 
you

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590
 
 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.560
 
for any problem you work on this some

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570
for any problem you work on this some
 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.750
for any problem you work on this some
moment where this sort of maybe it's a

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760
moment where this sort of maybe it's a
 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.640
moment where this sort of maybe it's a
model that no one else cares about where

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650
model that no one else cares about where
 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.140
model that no one else cares about where
it sort of all fit together and I found

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150
it sort of all fit together and I found
 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.429
it sort of all fit together and I found
some simple way of doing something

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439
some simple way of doing something
 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.440
some simple way of doing something
there's also the models that people have

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450
there's also the models that people have
 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.179
there's also the models that people have
heard about some such as the models

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189
heard about some such as the models
 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.220
heard about some such as the models
about extra dimensions something else

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230
about extra dimensions something else
 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.420
about extra dimensions something else
that we did having to do with a

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430
that we did having to do with a
 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.620
that we did having to do with a
different way of communicating

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630
different way of communicating
 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.570
different way of communicating
supersymmetry breaking there were a lot

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580
supersymmetry breaking there were a lot
 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.850
supersymmetry breaking there were a lot
of Eureka moments in in that making it

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860
of Eureka moments in in that making it
 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.159
of Eureka moments in in that making it
work out and the fact that we could all

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169
work out and the fact that we could all
 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.200
work out and the fact that we could all
tied together so it's hard for me to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210
tied together so it's hard for me to
 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.939
tied together so it's hard for me to
pull this out because a lot of the time

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949
pull this out because a lot of the time
 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:36.900
pull this out because a lot of the time
when you're working on something that

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910
when you're working on something that
 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.090
when you're working on something that
there's that one thing that you get

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100
there's that one thing that you get
 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.650
there's that one thing that you get
excited about

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
 
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.490
 
I think one thing that surprised us

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500
I think one thing that surprised us
 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.450
I think one thing that surprised us
ramen and I when we were working

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460
ramen and I when we were working
 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.970
ramen and I when we were working
together was this existence of the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980
together was this existence of the
 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.290
together was this existence of the
possibility of the existence of an

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
possibility of the existence of an
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.900
possibility of the existence of an
infinite extra dimension you know people

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
infinite extra dimension you know people
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.770
infinite extra dimension you know people
who had actually thought there were

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
who had actually thought there were
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.690
who had actually thought there were
theorems that you couldn't have and if

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700
theorems that you couldn't have and if
 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.070
theorems that you couldn't have and if
an extra dimension that gravity would

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080
an extra dimension that gravity would
 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.390
an extra dimension that gravity would
just look wrong that there was no

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400
just look wrong that there was no
 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.280
just look wrong that there was no
consistent way to do it and it was

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290
consistent way to do it and it was
 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.750
consistent way to do it and it was
really interesting because we came

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
really interesting because we came
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.060
really interesting because we came
across this by work really following the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
across this by work really following the
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.160
across this by work really following the
consequence of our equations to the end

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
consequence of our equations to the end
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.770
consequence of our equations to the end
and there was just no mistaking that it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
and there was just no mistaking that it
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.450
and there was just no mistaking that it
was allowing the possibility of an extra

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460
was allowing the possibility of an extra
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.219
was allowing the possibility of an extra
dimension it was interesting to go back

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
dimension it was interesting to go back
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.290
dimension it was interesting to go back
and see what assumptions have been made

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300
and see what assumptions have been made
 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.020
and see what assumptions have been made
that made us think or made other people

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
that made us think or made other people
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.330
that made us think or made other people
think that it wasn't possible and just

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
think that it wasn't possible and just
 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.190
think that it wasn't possible and just
to see how the theory was almost smarter

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
to see how the theory was almost smarter
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.139
to see how the theory was almost smarter
than we were and worked it out that was

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149
than we were and worked it out that was
 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.539
than we were and worked it out that was
kind of fun
