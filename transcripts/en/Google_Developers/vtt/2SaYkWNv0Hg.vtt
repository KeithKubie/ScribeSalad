00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:06.750
SPEAKER: Wolff is here
to talk about basically

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.180
two of my favorite things
combined together into one

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.270
presentation, and that
is physics engines

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.520
and cool physics demos
and live coding, which

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.110
is kind of crazy to
combine together,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.050
but that's what he's doing.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.300
WOLFF DOBSON: I am that crazy.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.810
SPEAKER: He is crazy,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.780
WOLFF DOBSON: Can you
hear me, everyone?

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.080
SPEAKER: Use the mic.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.222
We've got a live stream.

00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:30.109
Oh, you've got it.

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.150
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm famous
on the internet already.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.191
SPEAKER: All right, then.

00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:35.690
WOLFF DOBSON: OK, so
let me start presenting.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.326
I'm Wolff Dobson, I'm a
developer programs engineer,

00:00:41.326 --> 00:00:43.700
and I'm going to be talking
to you about LiquidFun, which

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.720
is our open source physics
engine that we released

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.702
in December and, as of
today, is at version 1.0.

00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:52.690
[AUDIENCE CHEERS]

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.690
WOLFF DOBSON: Thank you.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.630
Yay!

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.450
All right.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.464
So, just to give you
a little preview,

00:00:58.464 --> 00:01:00.130
I'm going to talk
about physics engines,

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.780
I'm going to do some
demos, I'm going

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.940
to actually code in front
of you a little bit.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.064
So if you want to watch a
Google engineer screw-up,

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:07.297
this is your moment.

00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:09.880
And I'm going to talk about some
inspiration of what you could

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.780
be doing with a physics
engine like this.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.080
So how many of you
guys are engineers?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.640
Anyone?

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.640
How many of you
guys are artists?

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.570
All right.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.070
So most of you probably at GDC
know what a physics engine is.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.970
It's a system for generating
procedural animations.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.760
In this case,
physical processes.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.310
The one we're
talking about today

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.230
is steppable, that means that we
move time a little bit forward,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.021
a little bit forward,
a little bit forward,

00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:40.104
and if things overlap, we deal
with that physical process

00:01:40.104 --> 00:01:41.520
in some way that
looks believable.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.895
And we also try to do it in
real time, although you could

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:47.320
I guess use this
offline as well.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.910
A physics engine does not
include rendering code,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.810
although in fact, we do include
rendering code in our test bed,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.540
but we would expect you
guys to use your cool art

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.440
and engineering
skills to render all

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.710
this stuff in an awesome way.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.985
LiquidFun is based around Box2D.

00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:06.610
You've probably seen
this demo, and I'm

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.250
going to be bouncing back
and forth between demos quite

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.870
a bit.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.110
So, you've all seen this kind
of Box2D sort of looking thing,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.480
right.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.370
It's like a slider crank.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.839
It's got like a box
and another box,

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.630
and they're hitting
each other, and there's

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.740
like a couple of joints,
and they're cranking around,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.060
and that's Box2D.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.530
And Box2D is really awesome,
but what LiquidFun adds to Box2D

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.450
is lots and lots and
lots of particles.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.509
So, whooo!

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.050
And this is a live simulation,
so I can throw these particles

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.800
around, they can do cool stuff.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.640
These particles can
interact with rigid bodies,

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.300
so we can have them all thrown
around and look pretty awesome.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.230
We can do color mixing.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.801
So here we are going to
take this stirrer here,

00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:56.300
and we're going to stir this
up, and we're going to get sort

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.982
of a uniform grey.

00:02:58.982 --> 00:03:00.440
And we can do a
lot of other stuff.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.420
We also do buoyancy.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.620
So the squares are not very
dense, the circle is dense,

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.860
and then those two little
arrows there at the bottom

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.004
don't displace enough
particles to be floated.

00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:15.920
We got a lot of other
stuff, and I could go on

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.570
for a long time about this,
but that's the idea, particles.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.420
Particles are awesome, and
they can make your game better.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.740
So heading back to this, doink.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.980
So essentially, Box2D, an
existing thing, LiquidFun

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.420
is more on top of
Box2D that gives you

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.111
all these awesome particles.

00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:37.310
It's cross-platform.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.200
It's written in C++, which
means you can do it on Android.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.250
Yay?

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.540
Also Linux, OS X,
Windows, iOS, whatever

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.970
you bring to the table.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.650
And we're working
on some more stuff.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.760
We're working on Coco2D-x
integration, which

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.140
means you also get Android
and iOS and OS X and Win32,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.590
and like BlackBerry and
all kinds of great stuff.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.490
Daniel Murphy, of JBox2D
fame, has ported this all

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.850
over two Java.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.570
So in fact, if you go
to jbox2d.org right now,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:14.290
it'll just say, Box2D, well,
actually, LiquidFun in Java.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.519
So, we got all these
particles, how do they work?

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.490
So a Box2D Rigid Body is an
arbitrary size and an arbitrary

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.450
shape, and it's got rotation.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.680
And a particle is basically
the opposite of that.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.340
It's uniform, it's always the
same shape, it's a circle,

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.424
it's uniform size, and it
has no rotation at all.

00:04:36.424 --> 00:04:38.090
Which means, if you
were rendering them,

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.160
they'd all be pointing
the same direction,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.220
even as they moved around.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.250
They're also packed into memory
in a particularly efficient way

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.030
that makes them
very fast to render.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.030
So if you've got to render
a whole lot of stuff,

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.460
you got to plan ahead for that.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.840
Particles have color,
size, position, velocity,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.660
all of the regular
physical stuff.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.260
They also contain
strength, which

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.530
is how much they want to
be next to each other,

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.580
and we'll show you how
that works in a second.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.770
Creating a particle.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.090
How many of you guys have
ever done any Box2D work?

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.604
Anyone?

00:05:10.604 --> 00:05:12.020
Yeah, you got some
guys out there.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.820
This is going to
look really familiar.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.510
ParticleDef is like a stamp.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.310
So you say, I want to make
water particles, and this one I

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.376
want to be at position i, zero.

00:05:21.376 --> 00:05:22.750
And then you call
CreateParticle,

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.200
and it stamps one out for you.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.260
And if you want to make another
one, you call CreateParticle,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.635
and you set a
different position.

00:05:27.635 --> 00:05:29.398
You keep going.

00:05:29.398 --> 00:05:31.240
That's going to get the
number of particles,

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.698
I just showed you
in the dam break.

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:34.430
That's going to take
a really long time,

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.450
so we give you particle groups.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.900
Particle groups create and
destroy lots of particles

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.630
at the same time.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.120
It also adds
properties all at once.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.940
So you could have a shape that's
a big square and its spinning,

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.970
so it's got rotational
velocity and angle,

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.594
and then you can also
set the strength,

00:05:50.594 --> 00:05:53.110
so you can have them all
work together as a group.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.710
Again, we'll get to that.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.350
Oooh-- foreshadowing,

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.160
OK, so particle behaviors.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.610
I just showed you
water particles,

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.200
but we also have powder,
we have viscous particles,

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.670
which are ones that like
to stick to each other.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.253
Powder particles don't like to
stick to anything, so if you're

00:06:09.253 --> 00:06:10.700
going to act like smoke.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.240
Spring particles.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.760
Imagine all your particles
are connected by springs.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.544
Elastic particles.

00:06:15.544 --> 00:06:17.710
All your particles are
connected by-- well actually,

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.418
it's a little more
complicated than that,

00:06:19.418 --> 00:06:21.350
it's how much they want
to retain their shape.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.390
Wall particles, they
don't move at all.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.720
That sounds kind of lame,
but it's actually really cool

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.480
and I'll show you how.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.270
And today, LiquidFun
1.0, barrier particles.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.450
Barrier particles are like, you
spray Scotchgard or something

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.630
on the particles, like
nothing can interpenetrate

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.940
a group of barrier particles.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.329
Static pressure particles.

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:44.620
This is kind of, if you have
a whole bunch of particles

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.510
together and you spun
them all at once,

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.030
if you don't get them exactly
spaced apart just right,

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.360
they're going to sit there
and bounce a little bit

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.620
until it comes to rest.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.320
Static pressure particles
take care of that for you.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.670
Particle lifetimes, so if
you're making fountains,

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.770
that's going to be
kind of awesome.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.520
Multiple particle systems.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.232
So, you can have a
single particle system

00:07:03.232 --> 00:07:05.440
with all these particles
interacting with each other.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.682
You can also have several
layers of particle systems.

00:07:07.682 --> 00:07:09.890
So if you have a volcano
way in the background that's

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.760
doing its thing, you don't need
those particles to interact

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.343
with anything else, so you can
put that in a separate particle

00:07:14.343 --> 00:07:14.920
system.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.512
And it's better.

00:07:18.512 --> 00:07:21.496
You should check out
our release notes.

00:07:21.496 --> 00:07:24.280
I could get really nerdy
with you, but trust me,

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.290
it's way better.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.830
So here's the scary part.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.910
This is when I'm going
to code a little bit.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.050
I'm going to be using
XCode plus Cocos2D iPhone

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.195
and running it on
iOS, and as a Googler,

00:07:35.195 --> 00:07:36.695
that means I have
a great commitment

00:07:36.695 --> 00:07:37.653
to cross-compatibility.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.230
But we have this all running for
Android and C++, and in fact,

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.650
we're just doing it all on
C++, and they're going to be

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.330
the same in either language.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.600
So, let's start with a
standard Box2D implementation.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.440
So I go over to XCode here.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.050
I hide you because I don't
need you anymore for right now.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.090
And here we go.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.140
Thank goodness, my
build succeeded.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:01.640
OK.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.580
So this is your
standard Box2D going on.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.110
When I click, I drop a
box, and they kind of

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.390
ricochet off each other.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.950
So let's add something to this.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.220
Let's add a particle group.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.219
Now I'm cheating a little
bit because I actually

00:08:18.219 --> 00:08:22.230
practiced this beforehand,
so I coded it up.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.262
So when you create a
particle group, whoosh!

00:08:25.262 --> 00:08:26.220
You get a lot of water.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.430
That's kind of cool.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.530
And if we go back to my
slides for a second, what

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.990
we did there is we
created a particle system.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.500
Creating a particle
system is like,

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.309
hey world, make me
a particle system.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:39.360
And you set some
default properties

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.311
on the particles, so radius,
density, things like that.

00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:44.810
And then I created
a particle group,

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.407
which means I take a
standard Box2D polygon shape,

00:08:48.407 --> 00:08:49.740
I set it as a box in the middle.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.980
And then I want to
make water particles,

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.140
I want to set all the
particles in this group

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.840
to be the same colors, and then
I call CreateParticle groups.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.394
So we have these groups.

00:09:01.394 --> 00:09:02.810
And I keep talking
about strength,

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.210
and this is where I make
good on my foreshadowing.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.274
You can also make jellies
out of these things.

00:09:08.274 --> 00:09:09.940
And what you do then
is you say, instead

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.439
of making water particles, I
want to make elastic particles.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.710
And then I add a group flag to
it, so I want them to be solid.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.860
Which means, I don't
want other particles

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.184
interpenetrating my group.

00:09:21.184 --> 00:09:22.600
I'll tolerate it
for a little bit,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.410
but eventually I'm
going to reject it.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.150
So let's take a look.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.735
Let's get rid of
this-- oh no, let's

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.860
leave that on there, a
little water is kind of fun.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.350
But let's, instead
of when I click,

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.000
I'm going to add a jelly.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.490
So here you go, we're back.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.670
And I click, and, oh yeah.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.650
It's all gooey and weird.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.880
And you can set the
strength, how much you

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.114
want all these guys
to be touching--

00:09:49.114 --> 00:09:50.530
how much they want
to be together.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.710
You can see if I-- I
actually accidentally

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:53.980
made gameplay in here.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.688
One thing that turns
out to be really fun

00:09:55.688 --> 00:09:59.145
is trying to stack these as
high as possible without-- see,

00:09:59.145 --> 00:10:01.580
it fell over.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.824
Also, because they're
solid particle groups,

00:10:05.824 --> 00:10:07.240
they don't want
to interpenetrate.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.570
So if I kind of put them
on top of each other,

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.227
they'll eventually
separate themselves.

00:10:11.227 --> 00:10:12.810
So they don't want
to be part of this.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.550
And you can see
gravity and stuff

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.130
is acting on all this elastic
that is keeping them together.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.750
So that's kind of cool.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.720
And that's like a
game, right there,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.116
is like stacking
these gooey things.

00:10:24.116 --> 00:10:26.740
And again, you can stiffen them
up or make them totally blobby,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.600
but I thought that
was really cool.

00:10:31.332 --> 00:10:33.540
Let's stop doing that though,
because it's too silly.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:38.020
Instead, we're going to throw
down a particle emitter.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.980
So-- go back to my slides.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.010
When you're making
a particle emitter,

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.310
it's a little bit more code.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.980
And in fact, we give you a
sample one in our sample code.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.510
But basically every
step, you count out

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.640
how much time has passed,
and you figure out

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.830
how many particles per
second that you want to emit

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:04.740
and then just stamp out that
many using CreateParticle.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.210
And in this case, because we
want it to feel like a faucet,

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.501
we give it a starting velocity.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.230
Because when you
turn on your faucet,

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.710
the water doesn't just
suddenly exist and then

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:14.997
sort of fall into your sink.

00:11:14.997 --> 00:11:16.830
It's being pushed by a
whole bunch of stuff.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.570
So we're going to give
it a starting velocity.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.102
So if we head back
to XCode here,

00:11:22.102 --> 00:11:23.810
I'm going to turn on
my particle emitter.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:30.530
And when I run it, we get
particles flowing out here.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.680
And these particles
will kind of push

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.165
around these boxes,
which is kind of cool.

00:11:35.165 --> 00:11:37.790
And you can see here I actually
have different particle groups.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.630
I have the blue particle group
and the white particle group,

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.190
and they're mixing.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.148
And they're perfectly
happy because they're not

00:11:42.148 --> 00:11:43.220
trying to be solid.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.000
But the problem here
is this isn't much fun.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.660
I mean, I can kind of
stack and have stuff--

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.440
So let's go down to where we
create a particle emitter,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.150
and instead of having the
water start flowing downwards,

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.060
let's just fire it off
to the right really fast.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.685
So when we do that, now
you get this stream.

00:12:01.685 --> 00:12:03.560
And since they are being
distributed randomly

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.280
across a horizontal
line, it ends up just

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.850
being a jet going this way.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.940
And so if I throw
particles in-- well,

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.830
that's not really
strong enough is it.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.530
Ah, what we need is
heavier particles.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.110
So we can find the
particle system

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.570
and say "set particle
density" and oh look,

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:24.801
I happen to have written
this and commented it out.

00:12:24.801 --> 00:12:26.050
Let's set it to something big.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.310
And we can also set the
default size of the particles

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.150
up a little bit.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.780
I'm going to make them bigger.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.640
They're not going to render
any bigger because we haven't

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.098
changed the renderer,
but I'm going

00:12:33.098 --> 00:12:35.630
to make them sort
of mentally bigger.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.190
So here we go.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.337
We do this.

00:12:39.337 --> 00:12:40.420
We've got that same thing.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.370
You can see the particles are
spaced out a little bit more,

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.210
and then when I drop one
of these things in, ah,

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.750
here we go.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.260
Now we have a game.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.240
Now we're like, how many
of these can-- shoot,

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.240
I was really good at this
when I was practicing.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.930
I could get three of them
stacked up over here.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:58.230
There's one-- two-- oh-- I don't
think it's going to work-- yay!

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.030
OK.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.630
Again--

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.200
Thank you, thank you.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.070
But in all seriousness,
here we have another kind

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.539
of game play in
here, just by making

00:13:08.539 --> 00:13:10.580
these jets of all these
particles running around.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.859
So let's-- All right,
let me stop coding

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:15.150
because it's getting too silly.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.540
Let's head back to the slides.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:24.320
And what you saw here was
me creating a particle

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.610
group and a particle system,
creating elastic particles,

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.370
and creating a particle emitter.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.660
We have sample code
for all this stuff.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.810
Check it out on our website.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.430
Let's talk about what
you can do with this.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.770
Now, when I was thinking
about all the different ways,

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.810
and my teammates were helping
me think of crazy ways

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:47.860
to use a particle
system, we were

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.290
thinking about different
modalities, different ways

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.300
you can group
thinking about this.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.530
So obviously what we just
did there was moving things

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.489
with jets, so you could imagine
"Flappy Bird" being sprayed

00:13:57.489 --> 00:13:59.530
up and down instead of
just flapping up and down,

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.630
and that would be a different
thing, kind of weird.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.860
Mini-golf being played
with fire hoses instead

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:10.490
of regular mini-golf, could
be scary, could also be fun.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.040
You could stir a fluid
to move an object around.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.220
So you could have a bath
tub full of rubber ducks,

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.720
trying to get the
rubber ducks to go

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.830
someplace, that's something.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.440
And you could also
use the particles

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.270
to push things, kind
of like a rocket,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.910
and I just happen to
have a demo about that.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.650
So if we head back to this
guy, here's one of the demos

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:35.340
that we made during one of
our internal hackathons.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.300
Where's Sparky?

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.820
There's Sparky.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.610
So in Sparky, each time
these rigid bodies,

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.360
which are this big
circles, touch each other,

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.829
it creates a
particle group that's

00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:49.620
packed really tightly
together and then has

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.175
velocity all facing outwards.

00:14:51.175 --> 00:14:52.800
So as a result, you
get this explosion.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.050
Then we give it trippy colors
so you can sit and stare

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.810
at it while your
screen saver is on.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.750
But this is kind of cool.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.190
You can imagine having
rockets being propelled

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.386
by creating particles that
are pushing against it

00:15:04.386 --> 00:15:05.760
and driving it
upwards like that,

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.420
and it would give a really
interesting locomotion.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.120
Let's go back slides.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.260
We can also do water
as a destructor.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.950
So putting out fires would
be an obvious sort of thing.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.610
You can imagine sitting
there like having

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.410
to tap on your screen to try to
make the water get high enough

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.444
to put out a fire
on different floors.

00:15:26.444 --> 00:15:28.110
You could have multiple
particle systems

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:29.750
so the fire is on
one particle system,

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.290
the water is on another.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.220
The tidal wave that
ate San Francisco.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.800
You can attach a
bunch of rigid bodies

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.017
by joints the break
easily and then hit

00:15:38.017 --> 00:15:40.350
them really hard with a bunch
of high-density particles,

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.641
and I guarantee they'll get
knocked all over the place.

00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:46.950
Speaking of knocking
particles all over the place,

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.290
you could say, just have a
little stick figure here,

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:52.230
and then you could blast
him off into space,

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.067
and that would be
kind of awesome too.

00:15:54.067 --> 00:15:54.650
Oh-- poor guy.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:56.720
Anyway, going back.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.880
You could also imagine
fluid being sorted.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.340
Now there's, "Where's
my Water?" is a game

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:08.100
in which you dig to
sort of sort and control

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.260
where you want the water to go.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.820
The demo that I made
was drawing things

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.220
that allow you to control
where water is going.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.734
And again, there's
a game in here.

00:16:18.734 --> 00:16:20.650
You could have red
emitters and blue emitters,

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.650
and you're trying to
decide where they're going,

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.410
or something, get pumps pushing
them different directions.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.290
No matter what, I think
there's something there.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.650
Think about fracking.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.890
Fracking is basically
a particle system.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.750
Because when you're fracking,
you have basically a big matrix

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.720
with lots of little
holes in it, and you've

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.240
got a bunch of
stuff that's fluid

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.990
that you want to get
out of it, and you're

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:42.890
pumping some other
waste product in there

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.120
to shove that into some
straw that you're sucking out

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:45.620
of that.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.060
And we actually made
a little fracker game,

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.047
and we just barely explored
it, and it was totally fun.

00:16:52.047 --> 00:16:52.630
Going onwards.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.634
Think of water as a medium.

00:16:57.634 --> 00:17:00.050
So rather than controlling the
water or pouring the water,

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.008
water is just the thing
that you're traversing.

00:17:02.008 --> 00:17:03.000
So buoyancy games.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.585
Obviously boats, boats are
in water, that could work.

00:17:05.585 --> 00:17:07.960
I think surfing is probably
a little bit more interesting

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.587
because there you're
interacting with sort

00:17:10.587 --> 00:17:12.920
of the angle, the wave, and
the pressure and everything.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.850
Fluids as terrains, if
you have cars and mud,

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:20.099
and I just love this picture
because that dude totally

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:24.589
parked in front of the horse,
but the thing about that is it

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.052
also brings up legged animals.

00:17:26.052 --> 00:17:27.760
So if you have some
sort of legged animal

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.640
that was trying to
stumble through-- wait,

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.590
I actually wrote that.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.870
So we go back here, Theo
Jansen's walker right here.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.920
This is a very
famous Box2D demo.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.040
And all I did was add
a particle emitter

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.680
that emitted snow, so sort
of light, fluffy particles

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.590
and already a couple of kinds
of game play come out of this.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.660
One is that he can carry
it around on his head,

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.679
as you can see.

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:51.220
And another thing
is that he actually

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.080
acts as a little snow plow.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.930
And I mean, I'm from California,
so I don't really get snow,

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.540
but I assume this
is how they move

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.726
snow, giant legged beasts
that wander around like this.

00:18:00.726 --> 00:18:01.600
That's what I'm told.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:07.629
Anyway, I think that's a really
interesting-- there's already

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.170
gameplay kind of
spilling out of this

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.960
as I was just goofing around.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.820
Lastly, bottom line is this.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.676
If you're using
Box2D-- how many of you

00:18:18.676 --> 00:18:20.093
guys are using
Box2D in your game?

00:18:20.093 --> 00:18:20.592
Anybody?

00:18:20.592 --> 00:18:21.100
Yeah.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:21.730
All right.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.060
You're basically
LiquidFun ready.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.660
To do the Cocos2D
thing that we did,

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.530
we basically just went
into the Box2D folder,

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.270
deleted the old one, and
pasted the new one on top.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.455
And it's the same folders
and the same headers,

00:18:36.455 --> 00:18:38.330
it's just an extra
directory called particles

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:42.230
that implements all
this particle stuff.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.630
An hour is maybe a little
bit of an exaggeration

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.330
because you still
have to do a renderer.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.830
We give you a sample
renderer, but I

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.600
think you're going to
want to make a better one,

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.870
and, you know, think
about that Android.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.510
So where do I get it?

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.610
You can get it from
our GitHub page.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.760
If you want the Java
version, go to jbox2d.org.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.640
And if you want anything else,
or if you have questions,

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.900
you can email me, and
I will respond to them.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.380
We also have a Google group
where you can ask questions.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.671
If you want technical questions,
that's probably faster

00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:15.570
because I do sleep
from time to time.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.210
And plus, our eng team
reads it, and they're

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.180
super happy to answer
your questions.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.410
So one more demo.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.245
Very last thing I'm
going to show you.

00:19:24.245 --> 00:19:26.120
All the demos I've shown
you up to this point

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.536
were either in the test bed,
or they're in the Cocos thing

00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:30.970
where I was rendering all the
particles as little squares.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.750
That's not as good as
it's going to look.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.520
So instead, I'm going to
show you the eye candy demo,

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.020
and this is actually an early
version of the eye candy demo.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.640
The new one is even better.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.890
But what you've got
here is beautifully

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.860
rendered particles,
same physics.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.714
Here there's even some
memory in the image,

00:19:48.714 --> 00:19:50.630
it's a multipass renderer,
so you can actually

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.440
see smearing out over time.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.380
You can also do transparency.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:01.550
That looks kind of awesome,
at least I think it's awesome.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:02.610
So there you go.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:06.470
That's LiquidFun, and we
want you guys to use it.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.010
Drop us a line if you have it.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.180
It's open source.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.560
Try it today.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.050
Thanks so much.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:15.981
[APPLAUSE]
