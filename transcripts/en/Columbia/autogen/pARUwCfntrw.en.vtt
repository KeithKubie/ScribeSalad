01:25:51.859 --> 01:25:51.869
this world when there are rogue states
 

01:25:51.869 --> 01:25:56.359
this world when there are rogue states
like North Korea and Iran with religious

01:25:56.359 --> 01:25:56.369
like North Korea and Iran with religious
 

01:25:56.369 --> 01:25:59.029
like North Korea and Iran with religious
and communist fundamentalist you know

01:25:59.029 --> 01:25:59.039
and communist fundamentalist you know
 

01:25:59.039 --> 01:26:01.310
and communist fundamentalist you know
who can't feed their people and who

01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320
who can't feed their people and who
 

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:04.580
who can't feed their people and who
can't provide freedom and democracy when

01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:04.590
can't provide freedom and democracy when
 

01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:06.529
can't provide freedom and democracy when
the people are you know revolting in the

01:26:06.529 --> 01:26:06.539
the people are you know revolting in the
 

01:26:06.539 --> 01:26:08.750
the people are you know revolting in the
streets they just shoot them down so you

01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:08.760
streets they just shoot them down so you
 

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:12.680
streets they just shoot them down so you
tell me okay you tell me what do we do

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:12.690
tell me okay you tell me what do we do
 

01:26:12.690 --> 01:26:16.189
tell me okay you tell me what do we do
about those countries and countries that

01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199
about those countries and countries that
 

01:26:16.199 --> 01:26:22.399
about those countries and countries that
aspire to that sort of mentality do we

01:26:22.399 --> 01:26:22.409
aspire to that sort of mentality do we
 

01:26:22.409 --> 01:26:25.020
aspire to that sort of mentality do we
have a speaker there

01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:25.030
have a speaker there
 

01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:27.360
have a speaker there
and concrete or sub state actor wanted

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:27.370
and concrete or sub state actor wanted
 

01:26:27.370 --> 01:26:30.420
and concrete or sub state actor wanted
to deliver a nuclear device to us they

01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:30.430
to deliver a nuclear device to us they
 

01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:34.340
to deliver a nuclear device to us they
would they wouldn't do it using a

01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:34.350
would they wouldn't do it using a
 

01:26:34.350 --> 01:26:36.870
would they wouldn't do it using a
missile or anything like that but these

01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880
missile or anything like that but these
 

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:38.460
missile or anything like that but these
countries you lookin dirty they would

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:38.470
countries you lookin dirty they would
 

01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:41.520

put in a bale of marijuana which we seem

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:41.530
put in a bale of marijuana which we seem
 

01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:42.900
put in a bale of marijuana which we seem
to be unable to prevent from getting

01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:42.910
to be unable to prevent from getting
 

01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:47.340
to be unable to prevent from getting
into the country I was in Iran in April

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:47.350
into the country I was in Iran in April
 

01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:49.140
into the country I was in Iran in April
in their conference on nuclear issues

01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:49.150
in their conference on nuclear issues
 

01:26:49.150 --> 01:26:51.420
in their conference on nuclear issues
and the head of the country issued a

01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:51.430
and the head of the country issued a
 

01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:53.340
and the head of the country issued a
fatwa their religious leader said that

01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:53.350
fatwa their religious leader said that
 

01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:57.690
fatwa their religious leader said that
nuclear weapons are immoral and so it'll

01:26:57.690 --> 01:26:57.700
nuclear weapons are immoral and so it'll
 

01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.070
nuclear weapons are immoral and so it'll
be very difficult for them to actually

01:26:59.070 --> 01:26:59.080
be very difficult for them to actually
 

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.840
be very difficult for them to actually
develop nuclear weapons they have to

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:00.850
develop nuclear weapons they have to
 

01:27:00.850 --> 01:27:03.210
develop nuclear weapons they have to
really change their whole structure and

01:27:03.210 --> 01:27:03.220
really change their whole structure and
 

01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:05.070
really change their whole structure and
policy and then we'll authority that the

01:27:05.070 --> 01:27:05.080
policy and then we'll authority that the
 

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.800
policy and then we'll authority that the
leadership but they clearly want to be

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:07.810
leadership but they clearly want to be
 

01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:09.450
leadership but they clearly want to be
nuclear weapons capable they want to

01:27:09.450 --> 01:27:09.460
nuclear weapons capable they want to
 

01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.490
nuclear weapons capable they want to
have the same technology that other

01:27:11.490 --> 01:27:11.500
have the same technology that other
 

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:15.000
have the same technology that other
countries like Japan have so what we

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:15.010
countries like Japan have so what we
 

01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:18.030
countries like Japan have so what we
need to do universally because you're

01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.040
need to do universally because you're
 

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:19.470
need to do universally because you're
talking about the crane I call these the

01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:19.480
talking about the crane I call these the
 

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:21.900
talking about the crane I call these the
crisis shore because there could be more

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:21.910
crisis shore because there could be more
 

01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:24.390
crisis shore because there could be more
countries and that goes I usually talk

01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400
countries and that goes I usually talk
 

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:25.890
countries and that goes I usually talk
about the oats factor which I talked

01:27:25.890 --> 01:27:25.900
about the oats factor which I talked
 

01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:28.410
about the oats factor which I talked
about and then the bozo factor the bozo

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:28.420
about and then the bozo factor the bozo
 

01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:30.300
about and then the bozo factor the bozo
factor is that you can have bozos

01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:30.310
factor is that you can have bozos
 

01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:34.290
factor is that you can have bozos
running any country at any time bozos

01:27:34.290 --> 01:27:34.300
running any country at any time bozos
 

01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:36.900
running any country at any time bozos
yeah and so of the fact that we have

01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:36.910
yeah and so of the fact that we have
 

01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:40.170
yeah and so of the fact that we have
bozos running Iran and North Korea right

01:27:40.170 --> 01:27:40.180
bozos running Iran and North Korea right
 

01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:42.270
bozos running Iran and North Korea right
now it doesn't mean that any of any

01:27:42.270 --> 01:27:42.280
now it doesn't mean that any of any
 

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:43.740
now it doesn't mean that any of any
country could have such dangerous

01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:43.750
country could have such dangerous
 

01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:46.800
country could have such dangerous
leadership and that tightens the knee to

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:46.810
leadership and that tightens the knee to
 

01:27:46.810 --> 01:27:49.650
leadership and that tightens the knee to
get control of the nuclear materials

01:27:49.650 --> 01:27:49.660
get control of the nuclear materials
 

01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:53.310
get control of the nuclear materials
globally the technologies out there and

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:53.320
globally the technologies out there and
 

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:58.470
globally the technologies out there and
any bozo country that gets the material

01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:58.480
any bozo country that gets the material
 

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:01.140
any bozo country that gets the material
and produce the bombs and they can do it

01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:01.150
and produce the bombs and they can do it
 

01:28:01.150 --> 01:28:04.200
and produce the bombs and they can do it
surreptitiously South Africa did it if

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:04.210
surreptitiously South Africa did it if
 

01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:05.700
surreptitiously South Africa did it if
they do South Africa didn't run a

01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:05.710
they do South Africa didn't run a
 

01:28:05.710 --> 01:28:08.580
they do South Africa didn't run a
program less than 75 million dollars and

01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:08.590
program less than 75 million dollars and
 

01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:10.570
program less than 75 million dollars and
they did it with technology

01:28:10.570 --> 01:28:10.580
they did it with technology
 

01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:13.450
they did it with technology
radio shack what they didn't have what

01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:13.460
radio shack what they didn't have what
 

01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:14.890
radio shack what they didn't have what
they had to get elsewhere it was the

01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:14.900
they had to get elsewhere it was the
 

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:18.130
they had to get elsewhere it was the
nuclear materials so right now what is

01:28:18.130 --> 01:28:18.140
nuclear materials so right now what is
 

01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:20.710
nuclear materials so right now what is
really needed is an internationalization

01:28:20.710 --> 01:28:20.720
really needed is an internationalization
 

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.070
really needed is an internationalization
of the production of the fuel cycle to

01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:24.080
of the production of the fuel cycle to
 

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:27.400
of the production of the fuel cycle to
control it and we have to rapidly get to

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:27.410
control it and we have to rapidly get to
 

01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:31.240
control it and we have to rapidly get to
a normative regime of verification that

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:31.250
a normative regime of verification that
 

01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:33.850
a normative regime of verification that
locks down all the nuclear materials we

01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:33.860
locks down all the nuclear materials we
 

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:36.130
locks down all the nuclear materials we
never lost an ounce of gold from Fort

01:28:36.130 --> 01:28:36.140
never lost an ounce of gold from Fort
 

01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:39.280
never lost an ounce of gold from Fort
Knox and we've got to treat nuclear

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:39.290
Knox and we've got to treat nuclear
 

01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:43.950
Knox and we've got to treat nuclear
materials the same way Iran accepted

01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:43.960
materials the same way Iran accepted
 

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.810
materials the same way Iran accepted
intrusive safeguards and they were very

01:28:46.810 --> 01:28:46.820
intrusive safeguards and they were very
 

01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:49.570
intrusive safeguards and they were very
upset that what they got for that was

01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:49.580
upset that what they got for that was
 

01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:51.370
upset that what they got for that was
accused of being part of the axis of

North Korea is simply an exam midwifery

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:57.050
North Korea is simply an exam midwifery
 

01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:58.930
North Korea is simply an exam midwifery
is a different situation but North read

01:28:58.930 --> 01:28:58.940
is a different situation but North read
 

01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:01.720
is a different situation but North read
us about the same kind of threat but in

01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:01.730
us about the same kind of threat but in
 

01:29:01.730 --> 01:29:04.000
us about the same kind of threat but in
the long term we have to quickly get

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:04.010
the long term we have to quickly get
 

01:29:04.010 --> 01:29:06.400
the long term we have to quickly get
control of the fuel and make sure

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:06.410
control of the fuel and make sure
 

01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:08.140
control of the fuel and make sure
there's not an ounce of it that's not

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:08.150
there's not an ounce of it that's not

there's not an ounce of it that's not

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:10.370
inspected and clamped down and that's
 

01:29:10.370 --> 01:29:12.760
inspected and clamped down and that's
probably going to need some form of

probably going to need some form of
 

01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:16.300
probably going to need some form of
international fuel bank cuz that's the

01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:16.310
international fuel bank cuz that's the
 

01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:18.610
international fuel bank cuz that's the
issues how do you how do you guard the

01:29:18.610 --> 01:29:18.620
issues how do you how do you guard the
 

01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:27.760
issues how do you how do you guard the

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:27.770
 

01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:30.620
but you know there's also a future

01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:30.630
but you know there's also a future
 

01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:32.689

nuclear that we have a discovery this is
 

01:29:32.699 --> 01:29:35.390
nuclear that we have a discovery this is
a relatively new technology so with

01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:35.400
a relatively new technology so with

California so you generally raises the

01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320
California so you generally raises the
 

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:48.800
California so you generally raises the
question about future technologies and I

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:48.810
question about future technologies and I
 

01:29:48.810 --> 01:29:51.350
question about future technologies and I
think that argues very strongly in favor

01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360
think that argues very strongly in favor
 

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:54.800
think that argues very strongly in favor
of what we're saying which is that I

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:54.810
of what we're saying which is that I
 

01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:56.270
of what we're saying which is that I
would agree with you I think that

01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280
would agree with you I think that
 

01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:58.310
would agree with you I think that
science is going to march forward what

01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320
science is going to march forward what
 

01:29:58.320 --> 01:29:59.930
science is going to march forward what
science is going to do is it's going to

01:29:59.930 --> 01:29:59.940
science is going to do is it's going to
 

01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:01.879
science is going to do is it's going to
