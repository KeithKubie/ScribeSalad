should and you see this if you do

this study but if you look at how much

the average in our study and this is a
 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.090

and so you see the difference in
 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.180

collaborators said we have to put this
 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.750
collaborators said we have to put this
on a questionnaire and the question was

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760
on a questionnaire and the question was
 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.580
on a questionnaire and the question was
what's the lowest grade you could get

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590
what's the lowest grade you could get
 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.410

it's an a-minus right for the white kids
you know it's more like a B and for the

you know it's more like a B and for the
 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.220
you know it's more like a B and for the
black and Latino kids it's somewhere you

black and Latino kids it's somewhere you
 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.830
black and Latino kids it's somewhere you
know around a b-minus or c-plus so

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840
know around a b-minus or c-plus so
 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.870

the Asian kids do well in part because

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299
the Asian kids do well in part because
 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.640
the Asian kids do well in part because
they're really afraid of what the

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650
they're really afraid of what the
 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.470
they're really afraid of what the
consequences of not doing well are and I

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480
consequences of not doing well are and I
 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.599
consequences of not doing well are and I
think that comes back to the standards

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609
think that comes back to the standards
 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.130
think that comes back to the standards
that their parents have set for them at

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140
that their parents have set for them at
 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.149
that their parents have set for them at

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159
 
 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.390
 
I don't know I mean about about

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400
I don't know I mean about about
 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.710
I don't know I mean about about
it's changed attitudes it certainly

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720
it's changed attitudes it certainly
 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.449
it's changed attitudes it certainly
hasn't done anything to kids achievement

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459
hasn't done anything to kids achievement
 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.069
hasn't done anything to kids achievement
which has stayed pretty flat so if you

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079
which has stayed pretty flat so if you
 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.530
which has stayed pretty flat so if you
look at the at these tests that are

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540
look at the at these tests that are
 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.060
look at the at these tests that are
given by the federal government year

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070
given by the federal government year
 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.830
given by the federal government year
after year after year I mean there's a

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840
after year after year I mean there's a
 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.840
after year after year I mean there's a
little bit of fluctuation from year to

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850
little bit of fluctuation from year to
 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.279
little bit of fluctuation from year to
year there's been a little improvement

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289
year there's been a little improvement
 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.710
year there's been a little improvement
and I think 8th grade math something

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720
and I think 8th grade math something
 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.840
and I think 8th grade math something
like that but but across the board I

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850
like that but but across the board I
 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.090
like that but but across the board I
think anybody looking at the data

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100
think anybody looking at the data
 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.460
think anybody looking at the data
objectively would say that none of the

the 1970s and that's what that's partly

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820
the 1970s and that's what that's partly

what prompted us to do this study right
 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.050
what prompted us to do this study right
because we're spent we spend all this

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060
because we're spent we spend all this

money on school reform and we're

money on school reform and we're
 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.400

course they should be well-paid but that

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169
course they should be well-paid but that
 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.010
course they should be well-paid but that
alone is not going to raise achievement

among American students to schools need
resources of course they need resources

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940
resources of course they need resources
 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.120
resources of course they need resources
but lots of research shows that there is

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130
but lots of research shows that there is
 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.279
but lots of research shows that there is
a very small relationship between the

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289
a very small relationship between the
 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.290
a very small relationship between the
resources that a school gets and the

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300
resources that a school gets and the
 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.379
resources that a school gets and the
output that produces in kids and and I

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389
output that produces in kids and and I
 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.230
output that produces in kids and and I
think and I think if you look at

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240
think and I think if you look at
 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.550
think and I think if you look at
projects like the the Harlem Children's

terrific results there so our point in

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960
terrific results there so our point in
 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.990
terrific results there so our point in
this book is that you really need to

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000
this book is that you really need to
 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.969
this book is that you really need to
think about the whole context in which

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979
think about the whole context in which
 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.649
think about the whole context in which
kids grow up and not just what takes

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.600
 
well you know the fact that

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610
well you know the fact that
 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.490
well you know the fact that
underprivileged kids do so poorly in

school financing from property taxes
 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.750
school financing from property taxes
which would allow us to redistribute tax

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760
which would allow us to redistribute tax

that's that's important a second thing

that's that's important a second thing
 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.630
that's that's important a second thing
is this issue of standards we just don't

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:45.640
is this issue of standards we just don't

from school it's often a sham I mean

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350
from school it's often a sham I mean
 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.170
from school it's often a sham I mean
often their diplomas are meaningless I

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180
often their diplomas are meaningless I
 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.310
often their diplomas are meaningless I
mean there are kids with high school

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:03.320

better than at a 5th grade level and so

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:07.880
better than at a 5th grade level and so
 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.430
better than at a 5th grade level and so
we have dismissed that population of

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440
we have dismissed that population of
 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.440
we have dismissed that population of
young people as being not important

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.450
young people as being not important
 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.590
young people as being not important
enough to really care about we also need

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:17.600
enough to really care about we also need
 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.590
enough to really care about we also need
to to do a better job at engaging their

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.600
to to do a better job at engaging their
 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.860
to to do a better job at engaging their
families in in their schooling a lot of

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:23.870
families in in their schooling a lot of
 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.210
families in in their schooling a lot of
their parents of course had their own

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:25.220
their parents of course had their own
 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.580
their parents of course had their own
problems in school and so they are more

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:27.590
problems in school and so they are more
 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.560
problems in school and so they are more
reluctant they're more uncomfortable

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.570
reluctant they're more uncomfortable
 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.280
reluctant they're more uncomfortable
showing up in school because it was a it

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.290
showing up in school because it was a it
 

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.540
showing up in school because it was a it
was an uncomfortable place for them when

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:34.550
was an uncomfortable place for them when
 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.490
