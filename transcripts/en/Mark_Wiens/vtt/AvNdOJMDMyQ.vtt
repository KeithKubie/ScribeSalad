00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:05.730
Kolkata, located in the West Bengal state
of India, is a loud, chaotic, and thought

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.430
provoking city.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.860
Ancient decaying buildings share the streets
with a superabundance of honking yellow taxis,

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.520
a multitude of pedestrians, and roadside vendors
selling everything conceivable.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:30.930
Coming up are eleven of the most memorable
things I did when I visited Kolkata, India.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.590
Number one is the home of mother teresa.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.379
I am here at the entrance of mother teresa's
home, which is just known as mother's home.

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:47.179
Mother Teresa said, intense love is not measured,
it just gives, so she really lived that example,

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:54.229
and we are going to go into her house, there's
a museum, her tomb is there as well as her

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:56.249
room where she stayed when she lived here.

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:01.549
I'm trying to keep my voice low because it's
a really quiet and special place.

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:08.030
But Mother Teresa did a lot of her work here,
and you can actually go in and see the tomb

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.229
of Mother Teresa.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.540
Really an amazing place to visit.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.850
Number two is Kolkata's famous Victoria Memorial,
one of the most important landmarks of the

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.850
city.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.970
I'm here at the Victoria Memorial Hall in
Kolkata, India.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.399
It's a cool morning, and I just paid four
rupees entrance which is to the garden, and

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:41.929
then if you pay one hundred fifty rupees you
can go into 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:49.110
the museum.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.520
Number three is the spooky South Park Street
Cemetery.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.899
And I think this place was set up in the seventeen
hundreds sometime, but these are just giant

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:09.050
tombs, and then the whole place is just eerie
from the vegetarian, and the trees and the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:19.800
flowers, yah, really like ancient looking
tombstones,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.790
Number three is the spooky South Park Street
Cemetery.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:34.530
Khalighat temple, and this is the oldest Hindu
temple, sixteen hundred years old, this is

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.280
the oldest Hindu temple in Kolkata.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.340
Be careful for scammers in this area that
try to guide you around the temple and then

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.380
ask for an absurdly unrealistic donation,
don't be afraid to just walk away.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.849
Coming in at number five is the crazy shopping
district around the New Market.

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.810
I'm standing outside of Sir Stuart Hogg Market
which is also just known as New Market.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.709
It's a chaotic, and busy area of town, lots
of street food and lots of street shopping,

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.099
and just lots of people, it's a crazy chaotic
area, pretty interesting, a lot of things

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.390
to do around here.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:23.300
So the New Market area in Kolkata, India.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.900
Number six is the Indian Museum, which is
also known as the Magic House.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:37.379
I'm standing just outside of the Indian Museum,
in Kolkata, and this is an extremely popular

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:43.090
museum here and I heard that one of the attractions
here is a four thousand year old Egyptian

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.010
mummy.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:04:02.590
Ok, I'm standing just outside of the Belur
Math Temple, which is just down there a little

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.920
ways, but I've already been there and unfortuantely
they do not allow any photography inside or

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.950
even outside of the temple, so this is the
best view I can give you, but it's a really

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:22.910
beautiful sight, this is a nice clean, private,
gated facility, beautiful temple and they

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.550
also have a place where you can put your shoes,
a secure place, a free secure place to put

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.480
your shoes so that you can enter the temple
to walk around for a little bit.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.760
But a really peaceful place right on the river,
you can also walk along the river.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.280
Belur Math temple.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.000
I'm taking the ferry Belur Math to Dakshineswar
temple, a little ferry ride across the river,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.060
and a little bit down the river.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.360
Number eight is the huge temple complex of
Dakshineswar, located north of Kolkata.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.410
Lots of activity happening, and this is right
along the banks of the river, so you can see

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.200
the temple as well as you can go to the river
and you can take a boat there as well as watch,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:24.690
watch along the river as well.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.400
Below the Howrah bridge and adjacent to the
Mullik Ghat is the colorful bustling flower

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.590
market, at number nine.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:38.030
Right below me is the central flower market
for Kolkata, so if you look down there, it's

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:56.380
bustling with flowers and a big market,

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.770
Occupying sun yat sen road, is the early morning
Chinese food terreti market at number ten.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.460
I'm at the morning Terreti bazar market, which
is kind of like a Chinese market.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:23.060
I'm here to just walk around and also to get
some Chinese food, some breakfast dishes,

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.280
Finally at number eleven is the array of marvelous
Kolkata street food.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.400
From the beloved kati rolls to quick snacks
like pani puri, Kolkata will have you licking

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:43.070
your lips.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:57.610
Kolkata, with more than its share of poverty
and hardships, offers a contrasting view into

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.050
the reality of this Indian mega city.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.320
It's not the easiest nor the most convenient
place to visit, but with patience and flexibility,

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.880
it provides fascinating rewards, never ending
energy, and countless experiences to digest.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.880
