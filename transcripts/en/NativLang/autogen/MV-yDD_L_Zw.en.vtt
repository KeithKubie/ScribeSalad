00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.540
You are about to decide the fate of this channel.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.059
Yo, I've been taking you guys seriously lately.

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:11.059
Seriously!

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.600
Hah, that's too many seriouslies!

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.650
Seriously, though...

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:25.140
YouTube data, bootcamps, strategies, big schemes,
bigger dreams.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.680
Hunched over that notebook, tongue hanging
out, got those crazy don't-mess-with-me eyes.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.860
Then you get up too fast and - wham! - split
your head!

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.980
Pookums, we call that "dedication".

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.460
Speaking of splitting, should we stay one
mixed channel or do you want two clearly separated

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.690
channels?

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.760
This is for real, folks.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.770
Be honest now!

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.160
Genuine thanks for your opinion.
