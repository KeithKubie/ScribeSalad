00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.830
- Dude, I can't.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.040
[scoffs] That
ain't gonna cut it.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.210
MAN: No, no winner.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.040
MAN: Nope, no winner.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.380
Story of my life.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.710
You want to come up here?

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.620
I think someone found
your missing teeth.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.830
[laughter]

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.670
[honking]

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.830
MAN: Holy [bleep].

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.040
MAN: Like I said, it's
bright yellow, man.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.920
Yeah, it's a hot bike, man.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.080
MAN: I'm coming to the pawn shop
today to pawn my motorcycle,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.040
because my business is
in the auto industry,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.920
and the auto industry
is doing really poorly.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.170
So I got to ask,
man, why would

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.420
you pawn a bike like this?

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.830
I got to make payroll.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.330
I got employees that
count on me, you know?

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.380
Pawning is basically the
simplest form of credit.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.670
You give us an item that
we take as collateral,

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580
and then we'll give you cash.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.000
You pay us back our
money with interest,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.420
and you get your item
back, simple as that.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.920
So what are you
looking to get out of it?

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.750
I need to get 20
grand to make payroll.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.210
20 grand, that's going to
be rough on it though, man.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.250
I'll be back to get it.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.750
I'll get the money.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.830
It's a nice bike, man,
but we're looking around 8.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.040
8 thou-- dude, I can't.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.750
That ain't gonna cut it.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.460
I'll tell you what, man, I'll
meet you in the middle at 15

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.960
if it helps you out.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.120
How long do I have until
I can get it back out?

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.040
You can get it back
out tomorrow if you want.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.120
But I mean, you've got 120 days.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.620
I mean like, I got 120 days?

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.460
Yeah.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.080
All right.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.290
And what happens after 120
days if I don't come get it?

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.210
You'll see me riding his
bike down the street, man.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.420
All right, I'll do the deal.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.210
I got to make payroll.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.420
All right.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.710
Let's go back inside
and write it up.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.960
So what do we got here?

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.540
An early '30s
antique slot machine.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.120
So if I buy it, do I
get all the nickels in it?

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.620
No, no.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.460
I know at one point, this
used to dispense mints.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.120
That's what they called
it-- a mint dispenser.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.960
When you'd hit the jackpot,
the mints would come down there

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.620
and drop out.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.620
Yeah, they did try and change
a lot of the gaming machines

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.170
around so that it would
win a little prize

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.670
or something like that.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.330
The coins went out, but the
bartender would say, OK,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.670
you won, and pay you in cash.
Give it a pull, pops.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.750
See if it works.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.000
[clattering]

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.500
MAN: No, no winner.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.420
MAN: Nope, no winner.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.830
Yeah, story of my life.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.170
[laughter]

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.330
What are you looking
to do with this, son?

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.620
I'd like to sell it.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.120
What do you
consider a fair price?

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.290
$3,000.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.120
Restored, they're
worth like, $2,500.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.790
Yeah.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.330
And the shape right here,
it's worth right around $1,200.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.670
Which means I can give
you like, $800 for it.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.500
What if I were to pawn it?

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.040
If you want to pawn it, just
want to get a loan against it,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.330
I'd loan you $500, and
you can pick it up later.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.670
Yeah, I'll do that.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.620
All right, deal.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.790
How are you doing?

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.290
- All right.
- What you got here?

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.710
I am looking upon my
collection of shark teeth.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.540
Collection of
shark teeth, huh?

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.460
Hey, Rick, you want
to come up here

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.790
I think someone found
your missing teeth.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.460
So where did you get these?

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.620
Well, when I was 12 years
old, I was on a family vacation,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.330
my mom picked this up for me.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.380
And ever since then, I've
been collecting them.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.210
All right.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.880
Damn, this is a big one.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.830
That's kind of the pride
of the fleet right there.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.710
These were from megalodon,
which was a prehistoric shark.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.210
And from the size of this
tooth, the guy was probably

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.040
bigger than a city bus.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.830
That was a big shark.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.210
And you want to pawn them?

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.500
Yeah, I'd rather
pawn them to sell.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.330
This means too much
to me to sell them.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.170
How much did you
need to borrow?

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.670
I wanted to try and
borrow about $1,000.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.080
These are really cool.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.830
The bigger they are, the
more expensive they are.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.080
I have 3 million year
old rocks in my back yard

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.250
that I can't sell
them, but these I can.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.830
I could 1,000 buck on them.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.080
No problem.
- OK.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.000
Write him up, Chum.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.580
Earlier this week, I got
a call from a guy who

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.330
said he needed upon his truck.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.080
He said it was a
very expensive truck,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.880
we really didn't go into it, so
I told him maybe over Wally's,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.580
and I'll see what I can do.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.830
[honk]

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.580
Holy [bleep].

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.920
MAN: This is probably the top
of the line, one of the top line

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.620
Volvo Trucks.
It's a 780.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.620
It comes with the Cummins
500 horsepower motor.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.790
You get air ride
on both back axles.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.880
This one comes with air ride
on your front axle as well.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.460
It's got the extended cab.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.620
This is about the most
expensive truck I've ever owned.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.880
So why do you want
to get rid of it?

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.120
I don't want to get rid of it.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.540
I just want to get a loan on it.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.040
Got some family business
I need to take care of,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.420
and get back, handle that.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.710
Things do happen.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.290
This in my collateral
I got here.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.710
How much did you
need to borrow?

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.120
I got the truck for,
like, maybe $125,000.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.540
I'm not looking for that, I'm
looking for maybe $20,000.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.460
Take care of what I need, and
hopefully come back, and pick

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.880
her up, and keep on trucking.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.540
[laughter]

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.790
So Wally's going
to check it out,

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.120
make sure there's no problems.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.750
And if there isn't,
we should have deal.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.290
- Sounds like a deal.
- OK.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.790
All right, thanks man.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.790
Went through and did
all the service on it,

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.830
and checked it out.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.460
Everything looks really good.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.170
Thanks so much, Wally,
I really appreciate it.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.290
- We'll get you out of here now.
- OK.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.620
All I got to do now is drive
the truck back to the shop,

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.620
and get the guy his 20 grand.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.170
Breaker, breaker 1-9,
Big Hoss, John Lee?

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.500
Big daddy's coming home.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.500
[laughs]
