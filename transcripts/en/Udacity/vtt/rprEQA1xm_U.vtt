How is semantic networks connected with human cognition?

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.436
Well we can make at least two connections immediately. First,

00:00:08.436 --> 00:00:13.490
semantic networks are kind of knowledge representation. We saw hive knowledge is

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.474
presented as a semantic network. If the results of [UNKNOWN] representation,

00:00:17.474 --> 00:00:20.550
then you can use the knowledge presentation to address the problem.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.580
We can now say similarly for human mind that human mind represents problems.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.880
It represents knowledge. Then it uses that knowledge to address the problem.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.880
So, representation then becomes the key. Second, and most specifically,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.430
semantic networks are related to spreading activation networks,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.180
which is a very popular theory of human memory. Let me give you an example.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.040
Supposing I told you a story consisting of just two sentences. John wanted to

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.800
become rich. He got a gun. And notice that I did not tell you the entire story,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.510
but I'm sure you all made up a story based on what I told you.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.780
John wanted to become rich. He decided to rob a bank.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.180
He got a gun in order to rob the bank. But how did you end this story?

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.250
How did it draw the inferences about robbing a bank which I did not tell you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.360
anything about? Imagine if you have a semantic network that consisted of

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.970
a large number of nodes. So when I gave you the first sentence, John wanted to

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.100
become rich, the nodes corresponding to John and wanted and become and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.560
rich, got activated, and the activation started spreading from those nodes.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.560
And when I said John, he got a gun, then the gun node also got activated and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.000
that activation also started spreading. As this activation spread,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.830
it merged. And a path they could walk on. And all the nodes on that

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.580
pathway now become part of the story, and if you happen to have nodes like,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.960
rob a bank along the pathway, now you have understanding of story.
