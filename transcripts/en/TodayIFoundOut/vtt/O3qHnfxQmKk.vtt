00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.630
The Soldier Who Voluntarily Became a Prisoner
in Auschwitz

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:22.840
Nazi troops invaded Poland on September 1,
1939, despite the best efforts of Captain

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.960
Witold Pilecki and his fellow Polish soldiers.
On November 9th of that same year, Witold

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.300
and Major Wlodarkiewicz founded the Tajna
Armia Polska (TAP or Polish Secret Army),

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.460
an underground organization that eventually
became consolidated with other resistance

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.140
forces into The Home Army.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.440
Not long after the formation of organized
widespread Polish Resistance, its members

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.070
began hearing reports of the conditions within
the newly constructed Auschwitz Concentration

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.390
Camp put into operation in the Spring of 1940.
Those first reports originated with prisoners

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.210
released from the camp and from civilians
such as railroad employees and local residents.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.200
In order to cut through the very troubling
rumors and figure out exactly what was going

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.240
on there, Pilecki came up with a bold plan-
become a prisoner at Auschwitz. With a little

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.700
convincing, his superiors eventually agreed
to allow him to go.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.979
In order to help protect his wife and children
after he was captured, he took on the alias

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.330
Tomasz Serafinski, much to the chagrin of
the real Tomasz Serafinski who was thought

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.320
to be dead at the time (hence why his papers
and identity were chosen), but was not. Later,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.960
the real Tomasz had some trouble because of
Pilecki using his papers and name (more on

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.960
this in the Bonus Facts below).

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.159
According to Eleonora Ostrowska, owner of
an apartment Pilecki was at when he was taken,

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.630
when a Nazi roundup began (lapanka, where
a city block would suddenly be closed off

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.549
and most of the civilians inside would be
rounded up and sent to slave labor camps and

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.240
sometimes even just mass-executed on the spot),
a member of the resistance came to help Pilecki

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.190
hide. Instead, Ostrowska said “Witold rejected
those opportunities and didn’t even try

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.079
to hide in my flat.” She reported that soon,
a German soldier knocked at the door and Pilecki

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.100
whispered to her “Report that I have fulfilled
the order,” and then opened the door and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.110
was taken by the soldier along with about
2,000 other Poles in Warsaw on September 19,

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.110
1940.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.380
It is important to note here that he didn’t
really know if he’d be sent to Auschwitz

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.639
at this point. As Dr. Daniel Paliwoda noted
of Pilecki’s capture, “Since the AB Aktion

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.930
and roundups were still going on, the Nazis
could have tortured and executed him in

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.790
occupied Warsaw’s Pawiak, Mokotów, or any
other Gestapo-run prison. They could have

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.879
taken him to Palmiry to murder him in the
forest. At the very least, they could have

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.819
sent him to a forced labor colony somewhere
in Germany.”

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.939
While he was willingly surrendering with the
hope of being sent to Auschwitz, Pilecki lamented

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.599
the behavior of his fellow countrymen during
the roundup. “What really annoyed me the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.569
most was the passivity of this group of Poles.
All those picked up were already showing signs

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.909
of crowd psychology, the result being that
our whole crowd behaved like a herd of passive

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.930
sheep. A simple thought kept nagging me: stir
up everyone and get this mass of people moving.”

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.480
As he had hoped (perhaps the only person to
ever hope such a thing), he was sent to Auschwitz.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.189
He later described his experience upon arrival:
Pilecki_ausch_f

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.260
We gave everything away into bags, to which
respective numbers were tied. Here our hair

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.389
of head and body were cut off, and we were
slightly sprinkled by cold water. I got a

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.549
blow in my jaw with a heavy rod. I spat out
my two teeth. Bleeding began. From that moment

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.709
we became mere numbers – I wore the number
4859…

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.430
We were struck over the head not only by SS
rifle butts, but by something far greater.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.550
Our concepts of law and order and of what
was normal, all those ideas to which we had

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.930
become accustomed on this Earth, were given
a brutal kicking.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.059
Pilecki also noted that one of the first indications
that he observed that Auschwitz was not just

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:38.290
a normal prison camp was the lack of food
given to prisoners; in his estimate, the rations

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.589
given to prisoners were “calculated in such
a way that people would live for six weeks.”

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:46.510
He also noted that a guard at the camp told
him, “Whoever will live longer — it means

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.510
he steals.”

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.599
Assessing the conditions inside Auschwitz
was only part of Pilecki’s mission. He also

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:59.139
took on responsibility for organizing a resistance
force within the camp, the Zwiazek Organizacji

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:06.409
Wojskowej (ZOW). The goals of ZOW included-
improving inmate morale, distributing any

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.840
extra food and clothing, setting up an intelligence
network within the camp, training prisoners

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.909
to eventually rise up against their guards
and liberate Auschwitz, and getting news in

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.269
and out of Auschwitz. Ensuring secrecy of
the ZOW led Pilecki to create cells within

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.930
the organization. He trusted the leaders of
each cell to withstand interrogation by the

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.110
guards, but even so each leader only knew
the names of the handful of people under his

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.460
command. This limited the risk to the entire
organization should an informant tip off a

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.159
guard or if a member was caught.

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:37.680
Pilecki’s first reports to the Polish government
and Allied forces left the camp with released

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.229
prisoners. But when releases became less common,
passing reports on to the outside world depended

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.129
largely on the success of prisoner escapes,
such as one that occurred on June 20, 1942

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.740
where four Poles managed to dress up as members
of the SS, weapons and all, and steal an SS

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.180
car which they boldly drove out of the main
gate of the camp.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.419
A cobbled-together radio, built over the course
of seven months as parts could be acquired,

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.410
was used for a while in 1942 to transmit reports
until “one of our fellow’s big mouth”

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.139
resulted in the Nazis learning of the radio,
forcing the group to dismantle it before they

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.590
were caught red handed and executed.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.849
Pilecki’s reports were the first to mention
the use of Zyklon B gas, a poisonous hydrogen

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.729
cyanide gas, and gas chambers used at the
camp. He saw the first use of Zyklon B gas

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:26.039
in early September 1941 when the Nazis used
it to kill 850 Soviet POWs and Poles in Block

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:31.550
11 of Auschwitz I. He also learned of the
gas chambers at Auschwitz II, or Auschwitz-Birkenau,

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.909
from other resistance members after construction
of the camp began in October 1941. ZOW also

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.520
managed to keep a pretty good running log
of roughly the number of inmates being brought

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.800
in to the camp and the estimated number of
deaths, noting at one point, “Over a thousand

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.530
a day from the new transports were gassed.
The corpses were burnt in the new crematoria.”

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.090
All of the reports were sent to the Polish
Government in Exile in London, and they in

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.139
turn forwarded the information to other Allied
forces. However, on the whole, the Allies

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.860
thought the reports of mass killings, starvation,
brutal and systemic torture, gas chambers,

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.280
medical experimentation, etc. were wildly
exaggerated and questioned the reliability

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.530
of Pilecki’s reports. (Note: During Pilecki’s
nearly three years there, several hundred

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.110
thousand people were killed at Auschwitz and,
beyond the death and horrific tortures, countless

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.819
others were experimented on in a variety of
ways by such individuals as the “Angel of

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.840
Death,” Dr. Josef Mengele. All total, it
is estimated that somewhere between 1 to 1.5

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.680
million people were killed at the camp.)

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.090
Significant doubt surrounding the accuracy
of his reports meant Pilecki’s plan to bring

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.610
about an uprising inside Auschwitz never came
to fruition. Pilecki had managed to convince

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.749
his network of resistance fighters inside
the camp that they could successfully take

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:42.909
control for a short while and escape if the
Allies and Polish Underground provided support.

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:47.120
He had envisioned airdrops of weapons and
possibly even Allied soldiers invading the

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.590
camp. However, the Allies never had any intention
of such an operation and the local Polish

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.470
resistance in Warsaw refused to attack due
to the large number of German troops stationed

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.470
nearby.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.760
The Nazi guards began systematically eliminating
members of the ZOW resistance in 1943 and

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.560
so, with his reports being ignored, Pilecki
decided he needed to plead his case in person

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.900
for intervention in Auschwitz.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.979
In April of 1943, he got his chance. After
handing over leadership of ZOW to his top

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:16.389
deputies, he and two others were assigned
the night shift at a bakery which was located

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:21.009
outside the camp’s perimeter fence. At an
opportune moment on the night of the 26th,

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.580
they managed to overpower a guard and cut
the phone lines. The three men then made a

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.930
run for it out of the back of the bakery.
As they ran, Pilecki stated, “Shots were

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.400
fired behind us. How fast we were running,
it is hard to describe. We were tearing the

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.439
air into rags by quick movements of our hands.”

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:40.259
It should be noted that anyone caught helping
an Auschwitz escapee would be killed along

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:44.819
with the escaped prisoner, something the local
populace knew well. Further, the 40 square

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:49.000
kilometers around Auschwitz were extremely
heavily patrolled and the escapees’ shaved

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.879
heads, tattered clothes, and gaunt appearance
would give them away in a second to anyone

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:57.240
who saw them. Despite this, all three not
only survived the initial escape, but managed

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.529
to get to safety without being recaptured.

00:07:59.529 --> 00:08:04.779
Unfortunately, Pilecki’s plan to garner
support for liberating Auschwitz never materialized.

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:09.710
After arriving at the headquarters of the
Home Army on August 25, 1943 and desperately

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.940
pleading his case for the Home Army to put
all efforts into liberating Auschwitz, he

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.770
left feeling “bitter and disappointed”
when the idea was discarded as being too risky.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.690
In his final report on Auschwitz, he further
vented his frustration on his superiors “cowardliness.”

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.800
After this, Pilecki continued to fight for
the Home Army, as well as trying to aid ZOW

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.110
in any way he could from the outside. He also
played a role in the Warsaw Uprising that

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:36.090
began in August of 1944, during which he was
captured by German troops in October of that

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.690
year and spent the rest of World War II as
a POW.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.770
Witold Pilecki podczas sk³adania zeznañPilecki
wrote his final version of his report on Auschwitz

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:46.010
(later published in a book titled: The Auschwitz
Volunteer: Beyond Bravery) after the war while

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.380
spending time in Italy under the 2nd Polish
Corps before being ordered back to Poland

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:55.370
by General Wladyslaw Anders to gather intelligence
on communist activities in Poland. You see,

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.420
the invading Germans had been replaced by
another occupying power- the Soviet backed

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.440
Polish Committee of National Liberation. This
was a puppet provisional government setup

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.800
on July 22, 1944 in opposition to the Polish
Government in Exile, the latter of which was

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.240
supported by the majority of Polish people
and the West.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.029
During his two years at this post, he managed
to, among many other things, gather documented

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:20.610
proof that the voting results of the People’s
Referendum of 1946 were heavily falsified

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:25.190
by the communists. Unfortunately, there was
little the Polish Government in Exile could

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.820
do. Even when his cover was blown in July
of 1946, Pilecki soldiered on and refused

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.690
to leave the country, continuing his work
collecting documented evidence of the many

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.510
atrocities against the Polish people being
committed by the Soviets and their puppet

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.740
government in Poland.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:44.449
For this, he was ultimately arrested on May
7, 1947 by the Ministry of Public Security.

00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:48.649
He was extensively tortured for many months
after, including having his fingernails ripped

00:09:48.649 --> 00:09:53.310
off and ribs and nose broken. He later told
his wife of his life in this particular prison,

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.230
“Oświęcim [Auschwitz] compared with them
was just a trifle.”

00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:00.399
Finally, he was given a show trial. When fellow
survivors of Auschwitz pled with then Prime

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:03.769
Minister of Poland, Józef Cyrankiewicz (himself
a survivor of Auschwitz and member of a resistance

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:08.000
in the prison), for the release of Pilecki,
instead he went the other way and wrote to

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.480
the judge, telling him to throw out record
of Pilecki’s time as a prisoner in Auschwitz.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.470
This was a key piece of evidence in Pilecki’s
favor given one of the things he was being

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.399
accused of was being a German collaborator
during the war.

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:22.010
And so it was that as part of a crackdown
by the new Polish government against former

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.630
members of the Home Army resistance, Pilecki
was convicted of being a German collaborator

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:32.350
and a spy for the West, among many other charges,
ultimately sentenced to death via a gunshot

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:38.029
to his head. The sentence was carried out
on May 25, 1948 by Sergeant Piotr Smietanski,

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:42.470
“The Butcher of Mokotow Prison.” From
then on, mention of Pilecki’s name and numerous

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.430
heroic acts were censored in Poland, something
that wasn’t changed until 1989 when the

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.459
communist Polish government was overthrown.

00:10:48.459 --> 00:10:53.279
Witold Pilecki’s last known words were reportedly,
“Long live free Poland.”

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:59.380
You might think it strange that Pilecki frequently,
quite willingly, threw himself into incredibly

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.959
dangerous situations despite the fact that
he had a wife and kids back home. Polish actor

00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:08.560
Marek Probosz, who studied Pilecki extensively
before portraying him in The Death of Captain

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.139
Pilecki, stated of this, “Human beings were
the most precious thing for Pilecki, and especially

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:17.370
those who were oppressed. He would do anything
to liberate them, to help them.” Mirroring

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.600
this sentiment, Pilecki’s son, Andrzej later
said his father “would write that we should

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.940
live worthwhile lives, to respect others and
nature. He wrote to my sister to watch out

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:29.350
for every little ladybug, to not step on it
but place it instead on a leaf because everything

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:34.269
has been created for a reason. ‘Love nature.’
He instructed us like this in his letters.”

00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:38.019
It wasn’t just his children he taught to
respect life at all levels. Two years after

00:11:38.019 --> 00:11:42.020
Pilecki was executed, and at a time when his
family was struggling because of it, a man

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.050
approached Pilecki’s teenage son and stated,
“I was in prison [as a guard] with your

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:50.540
father. I want to help you because your father
was a saint.. Under his influence, I changed

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:57.620
my life. I do not harm anyone anymore.”
As mentioned, the real Tomasz Serafinski was

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.839
not dead, as Pilecki had thought when he took
his papers and assumed Tomasz’ identity

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:04.620
to be captured. After Pilecki’s escape from
Auschwitz, the real Tomasz was arrested on

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.130
December 25, 1943 for having escaped from
Auschwitz. He was then investigated for a

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.810
few weeks, including a fair amount of pretty
brutal strong arming, but was finally released

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:18.110
on January 14, 1944 when it was determined
he was not, in fact, the same individual who

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:22.399
had escaped from Auschwitz. Afterwards, Pilecki
and Tomasz actually became friends, and though

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:26.850
Pilecki was killed, according to Jacek Pawlowicz,
“That friendship is alive to this day, because

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:58.529
Andrzej Pilecki visits their family and is
very welcome there.”
