00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.219
Jacob: Welcome to Crash Course: Economics,
I'm Jacob Clifford.

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:06.620
Adriene: I'm Adriene Hill and today were talking
about monetary policy.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.450
Jacob: So each year, TIME magazine comes out
with a list of the worlds 100 most influential people.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.400
Adriene: It includes heads of state, religious
leaders, entrepreneurs, artists and activists,

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.709
singers and actors of the most famous and
infamous.

00:00:18.709 --> 00:00:24.940
There's one person on that list -- someone who is
arguably the most influential person on earth -- that

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.920
most people don't know. Their decisions, good or
bad, likely impact billions of people: Janet Yellen.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.590
Jacob: She steers the largest economy in the
world. Janet Yellen is a big deal. And she's

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.710
a big deal because of monetary policy.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.020
[Theme Music]

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.700
Adriene: The Federal Reserve is the central
bank of the United States, and it's commonly

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.739
called "The Fed." Europe has the European
Central Bank or ECB, and other countries have

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.280
institutions that play similar roles.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.399
Most central banks have two important jobs.
First, they regulate and oversee the nation's

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.019
commercial banks by making sure that banks have
enough money in their reserve to avoid bank runs.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.200
Their second job, and the job we're gonna
focus on today, is to conduct monetary policy

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.200
which is increasing or decreasing the money
supply to speed up or slow down the overall

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.280
economy. Monetary policy is what makes The
Fed and The Fed Chair so influential.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.100
Jacob: Let's start with interest rates. An
interest rate is the price of borrowing money.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.650
When banks lend money, they expect to be repaid
the amount they lent, which is called the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.810
principle, and a percentage of the principle
to cover inflation and to make some profit.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.800
That percentage is called the interest rate.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.409
The number of car loans, student loans,
home loans, and business loans that get
made depends on interest rates.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.229
When interest rates are low, borrowers will
find it easier to pay back loans so they will

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.480
borrow more and spend more. When interest rates are
high, borrowers borrow less and therefore spend less.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.780
In the U.S., The Fed doesn't have the power
to tell banks what interest rate to charge

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.370
customers. So instead, The Fed manipulates
interest rates by changing the money supply.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.970
If The Fed increases the money supply, there'll
be plenty of money for banks to loan out.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.640
Borrowers will shop around for the best deal
on a loan, and banks will be forced to lower

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.500
interest rates because they're gonna have to compete
or else no one's gonna borrow from them.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.509
A decrease in money supply has the opposite
effect. Less money supply means the banks

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.329
have less money to loan out, so they're gonna
try and get the highest interest rate possible.

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.220
So less money -- higher interest rates.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.959
If the central bank wants to speed up the
economy, they can increase the money supply,

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.219
which will decrease interest rates, and lead
to more borrowing and spending.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.720
That's called Expansionary Monetary Policy.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.080
If the central bank wants to slow down the economy,
they decrease the money supply -- less money

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.780
available will increase interest rates and decrease
spending. That's called Contractionary Monetary Policy.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.300
Adriene: Here's some real life examples.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.170
After the Dot Com bust and then 9-11, the
U.S. economy was in a slump or a recessionary

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.590
gap. Output was low, and unemployment was
high.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.599
To speed up the economy, The Fed boosted the
money supply, which lowered interest rates.

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.959
This made borrowing easier, which increased
spending, and as a result, the economy began

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.319
growing again, albeit slowly.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.239
Here's another example. In the late 1970s,
prices were rising up to 13% per year. Inflation

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.010
is usually more like two to four percent.
The Fed Chairman, Paul Volker, decreased the

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.099
money supply, causing interest rates to shoot
up.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.150
People bought fewer homes and cars, and businesses
invested less. Contractionary Monetary Policy

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.989
drove down inflation, but with the downside
of increasing unemployment.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.980
There are just no easy answers here... sorry.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.730
During The Great Depression though, The Fed
blew it! 73 years later, Fed Chairman, Ben

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.129
Bernanke admitted, "We did it. We're very
sorry. We won't do it again."

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.430
So what did The Fed do wrong?

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.470
Well there are two things that keep the banking
system healthy - confidence and liquidity.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.560
When customers deposit money in a bank, they need
to feel confident they're gonna get their money back.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.200
In the early years of The Great Depression,
The Fed allowed several large bank to fail,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.040
which caused widespread panic and bank runs in other
banks. The result was a third of all banks collapsed.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.459
The banks failed because they didn't have
Liquid Assets, which is a fancypants way of

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.670
saying the banks had stock, bonds, mortgages,
but not cash money. So when depositors rushed

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.819
to take money out, the banks couldn't pay.

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.099
The Fed gets blamed for prolonging The Depression
because it didn't give banks emergency loans,

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.019
which would've increased the liquidity in
banks and the money supply in general.

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.129
But how does a central bank change the money
supply? In the U.S., there are three main

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:17.549
ways. Let's go to the Thought Bubble...

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.969
Jacob: When you deposit money in a bank, the
bank holds a portion of deposits and loans

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.980
the rest out. This is called Fractional Reserve
Banking. The fraction deposits the banks

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.100
are required to hold in reserves is conveniently
called the Reserve Requirement. The first way

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.740
The Fed can change the money supply is by changing
that requirement. Decreasing the Reserve Requirement

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.960
will increase the money supply, and increasing the
Reserve Requirement decreases the money supply.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.720
The Fed is the banker's bank, so if a commercial
bank needs money, they can borrow from The Fed.

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.050
The second thing The Fed can do to change
the money supply is to change the interest

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.889
rate that it charges banks. That interest
rate is called the Discount Rate. Decreasing

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.889
the Discount Rate will make it easier for
banks to borrow, and that'll increase the

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.069
money supply. Increasing that rate will decrease
the money supply.

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.080
The third way to change the money supply is
difficult because it requires Janet Yellen

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.039
to get approval from the Illuminati, the secret
cabal that runs the world.

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.360
Nah, I'm just kidding.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.539
The third method is called Open Market Operations.
This is when The Federal Reserve buys or sells

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.229
short term government bonds.

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.449
Now a government bond, or something called
a treasury bill, is an IOU issued by the government

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.270
that says, "I'll pay you back later." Banks
hold those bonds because they earn interest

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.249
and are generally less risky than stocks.

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:22.749
If The Fed buys these previously issued government
bonds from a bank, it increases that bank's

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:26.639
liquidity and increases the money supply.
If The Fed issues more bonds, the banks will

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.869
have less liquidity and less money to loan
out, and that'll decrease the money supply.

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:34.249
In the U.S., deciding how many bonds to buy and
sell is done by the Federal Open Market Committee.

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:35.580
Adriene: Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.960
With these options at its disposal, The Fed
can increase or decrease the money supply

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.860
pretty darn quick. The option they use most
often is Open Market Operations.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.669
During the 2008 financial crisis, when the
economy was in severe recession, The Fed went

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.550
straight to work, buying massive of bonds.
Boosting the money supply and dropping interest

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.289
rates to practically zero.

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.819
But it wasn't enough - the economy was still
in bad shape, so The Fed did something very

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.520
uncommon in the history of central banks.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.659
It increased its monetary stimulus through
something called Quantitative Easing. We call

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:13.369
it Q.E. at work because Q.E. rolls off the
tongue more easily than Quantitative Easing.

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:15.529
Plus, who knows how to spell quantitative?

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:19.719
Basically it's when central banks buy up longer
term assets from banks. So not only was The

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.320
Fed buying regular treasury bills, it was also buying
things like home loans aka Mortgage Backed Securities.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.600
They did all this with made-up money. This
Q.E. has raised worries about massive inflation.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.899
When you add a lot of made-up money to the
economy, prices can rise.

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:41.270
Milton Friedman observed, "Inflation is always
and everywhere a monetary phenomenon."

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.889
So if The Fed has been increasing the money
supply steadily since 2008, why has the actual

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.339
inflation rate stayed so low?

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:52.309
Of course, as always, the answer is complicated.

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:55.990
Many economists say it's because banks haven't
loaned out the money. Remember, banks have

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.529
to hold about 10% of their deposits in reserve.
The other 90% is called Excess Reserves - pretty

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:05.099
straightforward - which is basically the amount
that banks are free to loan out.

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:08.589
Under normal conditions, banks would prefer
not to hold a lot of excess reserves because

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:14.449
holding money doesn't make money. But since
2008, excess reserves skyrocketed. This means

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.939
that banks held the money, and it never really
got into the system.

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:23.080
Why? Some say it's the stricter lending regulations.
But also, borrowing a bunch of money for a

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.120
house seemed a lot scarier.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.679
Others suggest that low inflation in the U.S.
is the result of uncertainty in Europe, and

00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:34.939
that's caused foreigners to hold dollars. Some
argue that it's because the economy is still sputtering.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.420
One thing's for sure, as the economy continues
to pick up speed, we'll see The Fed clamping

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:42.339
down on the money supply to increase interest
rates.

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:47.599
After all, it's The Fed's job to take away
the punch bowl just as the party's getting started.

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:51.089
Jacob: So now we've talked about the two main
ways economists speed up or slow down the

00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:55.509
economy. Fiscal policy, which is changing
government spending or taxes, and now monetary

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:57.360
policy, which is changing the money supply.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.320
In an ideal world, the economy would always
be perfect, and we wouldn't need these tools.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.560
But the world isn't perfect, so sometimes,
intervention is necessary. So which one is better?

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:09.989
Well, like any clear, unambiguous question
in economics, the answer is... it depends.

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:14.309
It depends on the severity of the slump. Many
economists argue that for your garden variety

00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:18.779
fluctuations, monetary policy is more effective.
It's usually enacted quickly by experts whose

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:20.999
only job is to focus on the state of the economy.

00:08:20.999 --> 00:08:24.739
But in a very severe downturn, fiscal policy
might become much more effective. In 2008,

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.460
the United States did both.

00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:30.089
It also depends on whether your country's
central bank is tangled up in politics. The

00:08:30.089 --> 00:08:33.579
U.S. and many other developed nations have
worked hard to isolate their central banks

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:35.659
from politicians who might be shortsighted.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.500
The result is that monetary policy generally
works and doesn't have a lot of side effects.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:44.120
Adriene: So the next time you see Janet Yellen
in a magazine, listed as one of the most influential

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.019
people, you can shout, "Hey! I know who that
is, and I know what she does!"

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:50.899
The people in your dentist office might freak
out, but maybe not.

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:52.319
Jacob: Maybe they watch Crash Course Economics.

00:08:52.319 --> 00:08:54.319
