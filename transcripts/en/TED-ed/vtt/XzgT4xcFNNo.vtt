00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:18.534
Tap dance:

00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:23.015
one of America's major contributions to the world of percussive dance,

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:33.369
born out of the melding of African and European dance traditions.

00:00:39.816 --> 00:00:43.040
There's so many variations within tap dance,

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:49.406
as many approaches as there have been tap dancers.

00:00:49.406 --> 00:00:51.497
And there have been a lot!

00:00:53.544 --> 00:00:57.438
Since its birth, over 125 years ago,

00:00:57.438 --> 00:00:58.895
tap dance has grown up

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:02.133
in the world of American popular entertainment.

00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:06.693
From minstral shows and vaudeville,

00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:10.737
to night clubs, musical theater, and movie musicals,

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.226
tap dance has held a featured role.

00:01:15.088 --> 00:01:18.191
And your approach depends on when in the history's lineage

00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:21.201
you decide to connect.

00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:26.781
The landscape of American entertainment shifted in the 1950s and 60s.

00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:29.251
Big bands became cost-prohibitive,

00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:32.147
rock and roll was becoming a popular music,

00:01:32.147 --> 00:01:34.077
and American musical theater moved

00:01:34.077 --> 00:01:37.581
towards a format incorporating ballet with narrative

00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:39.863
rather than the extension of variety shows

00:01:39.863 --> 00:01:41.827
that it had been in the past.

00:01:54.106 --> 00:01:56.084
All these factors pushed tap dancing

00:01:56.084 --> 00:01:59.864
to the fringes of the entertainment world.

00:01:59.864 --> 00:02:01.988
Tap dance still existed;

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:03.127
there were dancers,

00:02:03.127 --> 00:02:06.345
but it was outside of the popular discourse.

00:02:06.345 --> 00:02:08.750
There were fewer and fewer places to dance

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.811
and very little need for new tap dancers,

00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:15.911
so those who have been dancing in the 20s, 30s, and 40s,

00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:19.780
really had no one to pass along the art form to.

00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:26.726
In the 1970s, a multifaceted resurgence began.

00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:32.069
Modern dancers became interested in the older tap dancers,

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.282
drawing them out of retirement to teach.

00:02:35.282 --> 00:02:38.900
Grassroots-organized tap festivals began to spring up,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.634
featuring the older tap dancers teaching the technique

00:02:41.634 --> 00:02:43.807
and the history of the craft.

00:02:47.655 --> 00:02:50.992
Older dancers also came out of retirement to perform

00:02:50.992 --> 00:02:56.985
with groups such as The Copasetics and The Original Hoofers, traveling the world.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.450
Even Broadway regained interest in the form,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.758
with Gregory Hines becoming a public figure

00:03:08.758 --> 00:03:12.339
for tap dance on the stage and in feature films.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:47.498
Since then, the resurgence has spawned a more popular interest,

00:03:47.498 --> 00:03:50.802
with Savion Glover at the nexus of the crowd.

00:03:50.802 --> 00:03:53.212
Considered the quintessential tap dancer,

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:56.832
Glover presents the form as a pure musician.

00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:10.665
Since the 1990s,

00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:14.085
and thanks in a large part to the work of Savion Glover,

00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:18.704
we've seen a rise in young people's interest in tap dance.

00:04:18.704 --> 00:04:21.139
I'm part of that generation.

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.028
Today, as we begin to rediscover the craft,

00:04:24.028 --> 00:04:25.338
we continue to look back

00:04:25.338 --> 00:04:29.633
and take examples of what tap dance was from past generations,

00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:34.597
at the same time, discovering our own unique approaches.

00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:50.799
There is so much freedom today.

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:52.484
We can take what exists

00:04:52.484 --> 00:04:56.354
and apply past examples within our own unique context -

00:04:56.354 --> 00:04:59.425
today's perspective on tap dance.

00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:17.695
It all really boils down to

00:05:17.695 --> 00:05:20.866
two pieces of metal on a leather-soled shoe,

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:22.670
the wood to dance on,

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.687
an audience to watch and listen,

00:05:24.687 --> 00:05:27.623
and something to say.

00:05:27.623 --> 00:05:29.935
It's the balancing of these elements

00:05:29.935 --> 00:05:32.960
that is a tap dancer's craft work.
