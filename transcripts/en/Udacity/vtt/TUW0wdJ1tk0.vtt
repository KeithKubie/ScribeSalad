Three to the zero is one.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.370
We already know that three
to the first power is three.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.420
And we know that when we go down
a power, we are dividing by the base.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.300
Three divided by three equals one,
so three to the zero power is one.
