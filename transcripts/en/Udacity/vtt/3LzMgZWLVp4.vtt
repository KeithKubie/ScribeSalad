00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.380
What is everyone think? Is 2 the right answer here? Well,

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.080
let's look at the choices. First note, that both 2 and 4 are legitimate answers.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.640
2 is legitimate because we can think of the transformation from

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.130
A to B as a reflection around the vertical axis. And so

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.090
if we think of the transformation from C to D, again as a reflection of

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.390
the vertical axis, we'll get 2. 4 is also a correct answer, because we

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.430
can think of the transformation from A to B as a rotation of 180 degrees, and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.480
if we rotate C by 180 degrees we'll get 4. However, if we look at our

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.120
weights again, we gave reflection a higher weight than we gave rotation. And

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.970
therefore, David is right, 2 indeed is the correct answer.
