&gt;&gt; Dongfang Shao:
Good afternoon.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.640
My name is Dongfang Shao.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.780
I'm chief of Asian Division.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.240
Welcome to the Library
of Congress.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.250
We have very good privilege
to have so many people

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.970
to come today although
this is a late afternoon.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.730
Asian Division is one

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.810
of the largest Asian collections
outside of Asian countries.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.500
Now we have about four
million physical items

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.730
in 170 different
Asian languages.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.450
And Asian Division
was established

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.190
in 1928 this month
by the US Congress.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.570
So this year marks 90th
anniversary of Asian division.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.500
So this is a good day

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.520
for celebrate our
collection for 90 years.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.410
And Asian Division reading room
is located in Jefferson Hall

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.870
on the first floor,
the room 150.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.340
So after lecture and Hong
Ta-Moore, we'll take some

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.570
of your, some of you to the
reading room to have a tour

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.690
and this walk's about seven

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.970
to eight minutes
from this building.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.580
We have covered the
several 23 countries

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.950
and areas including the
East Asia, Southeast Asia,

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.250
South Asia, Mongolia, and
Tibetan language materials.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.460
So Philippine is one of
the largest collections

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.200
in the Southeast collection.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.340
Hong Ta-Moore later we'll
introduce our Philippine

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.400
collection and particularly
some material unique

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.180
to maybe interesting to you.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.070
And the Library of Congress
now is trying to reach more

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.430
to public for the
outreach program like this

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.240
and I hope today's lecture
will be a successful one.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.780
And now I turn to Hong Ta-Moore

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.510
to introduce our
Philippine collection.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.500
[ Applause ]

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.580
&gt;&gt; Hong Ta-Moore:
Thank you, Dr. Shao.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.000
This thing is way too long.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.330
It's right in my face.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.050
The Asian Division has
nearly 300,000 items

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.880
from Southeast Asia and
many more in other divisions

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.510
in the Library of Congress.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.410
The materials on the Philippines
has been considered one

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.880
of the richest Filipina
collections in the North America

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.240
as a result of the
US involvement

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.840
and the Philippines since 1898.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.270
Materials include books,
journals and newspapers, maps,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.110
photographs, manuscripts,

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.900
government documents,
and much more.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.600
These items are housed in
many divisions in the Library

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.320
of Congress based on formats
but those that are published

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.140
in the US, they are
often acquired

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.480
through copyright deposits.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.420
For those materials
published in the Philippines

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.860
or in Southeast Asia,
they are acquired

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.560
by our overseas office
located in Jakarta, Indonesia.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.240
The Jakarta office is supported
by a [inaudible] office

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.460
in Manila that was
created in the early '90s

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.820
to ensure maximum
efficiency and timeliness

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.040
in acquiring materials
from the Philippines

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.100
such as those written by the
speaker of today's lecture.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.670
We have some of his books on
display in the back of the room.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.930
Please feel free to peruse them

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.420
at the conclusion
of the lecture.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.990
Now for the main
event, we are honored

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.540
to have Mr. Virgilio
Almario here today.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.990
Mr. Almario holds a distinctive
and prominent position

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.030
in Filipino literature.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.130
He is an authoritative
figure and advocate

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.230
of the national language
and language nationalism.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.930
He was proclaimed national
artist for literature in 2003.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.020
Within and outside [inaudible]
journalism, publishing,

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.460
and cultural management,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.020
Mr. Almario exerted
leadership and influence.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.170
His literary vision manifested
not just in his own writing

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.310
but extended to his other
vocations: mentoring,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:42.010
spotting the rough literary
talent, and helping to polish it

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:47.410
by critical motivation,
encouragement, publishing

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.390
and general advocacy
for culture.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.980
Currently he is the chairman
of the National Commission

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.720
for Culture and the Arts,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.030
the Official Arts Council
for the Philippines.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:05.680
He also leads the Komisyon
sa Wikang Filipino.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.120
I'm sorry if it butchered
that, or commissioned

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.160
on the Filipino language

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.400
which is the sole constitutional
authority under the Office

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.150
of the President
charged with developing

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.160
and promoting the
national language

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.620
and overseeing its enrichment
through research publication

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.850
and its continuous development.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.500
Without further ado, please
join me to welcome Mr. Almario.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.300
Thank you.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.500
[ Applause ]

00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:00.910
&gt;&gt; Virgilio S. Almario: Thank
you so much, Mr. Hong Ta-Moore,

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:15.320
Dr. Dongfang Shao, Chief
of the Asian Division,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.530
my friends from the
Philippines headed

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.690
by Director Barnes
[assumed spelling]

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:31.460
of the national museum,
guests, ladies and gentlemen.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:39.200
Let me begin by reading
to you a poem of mine.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.890
It is in Filipino, the national
language, and I'd you to hear

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.280
at least how it sounds
in the original.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.800
I'm providing an English
translation, of course,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.390
which you can see
on the PowerPoint.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:02.220
The title of the poem is
"Ang Bangkay, The Corpse."

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.830
Here is the poem.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:10:46.030
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:53.540
Now you will certainly ask,
what has a corpse got to do

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.840
with Philippine culture.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:01.330
"The Corpse" is not a
symbol of the country

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:07.280
because our country now I would

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.670
like to believe is very
much alive or [inaudible].

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:22.250
"The Corpse" then
represents Filipino culture

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:27.690
because Filipino culture
to me is both nameless

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:33.030
and unrecognizable
to many Filipinos.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.750
It has been stranded somewhere
in the isolated beaches

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:43.420
of memory and no one
remembers how it looks,

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:51.000
much less what it is, its
essence, its form or shape,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.270
how it feels to be touched,

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:02.530
a storm head west
the corpse ashore.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.360
And there has been
several storms that blew

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:12.690
over the Philippines, the storms
of falling cultures imposed

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.060
by its colonizers

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.450
that practically
obliterated any trace

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.780
of what the Filipino has been
before they were intervened

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:28.180
and reconstituted its
consciousness and memory.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:35.330
His consciousness and memory
in its present amorphous,

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.210
if not much adulterated form.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:46.070
If we go by Benedict
Anderson's notion of an Asian

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:51.150
and its culture as, and I
quote, "an imagined community,"

00:12:51.150 --> 00:13:01.260
who will now imagine the
Filipino nation and its culture

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:06.700
if it doesn't even recognize
its remains was [inaudible]

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.090
and isolated shore.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:17.150
I believe that each generation
will somehow re-imagine its own

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:22.310
nation, rebuild it
in its own memory,

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:25.250
and its own likeness as it were.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:32.100
The first persons to imagine
a Filipino nation were the

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:37.400
revolutionists of the
19th century starting

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.490
with the propaganda movement
that demanded reforms

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:46.650
from the Spanish center
of government in Madrid

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.770
and which graduated into
a revolutionary movement

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.620
of the Katipunan that sought

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.940
to overthrow the
colonial government.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.490
While the Katipunan
and the emergence

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:06.960
of nationalism took inspiration
from or was triggered

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.260
by the novels of Jose
Rizal, "Noli Me Tangere"

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.800
and "El Filibusterismo."

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.640
I hope you have copies
of these books

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.590
by Jose Rizal in
your collection.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.850
Andres Bonifacio and es
Katipunan sought deeper roots

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:31.070
in their concept of [foreign
language] or Motherland.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:36.240
The pre-colonial motherland
embodied the ideals

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:43.150
of the movement as proclaimed
in its Kartilya or its charter

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.510
or in the revolutionary essay

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:53.650
of Andres Bonifacio [foreign
language spoken] or in English,

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.420
"What Every Tagalog
Should Know."

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:03.880
In character and spirit, the
Katipunan and its imagining

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:09.770
of our nation was
anti-colonial and anti-feudal.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:14.850
The revolution was aborted
because it was taken

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:22.000
over by the feudal lords or
[inaudible] and educated class

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.050
that rested its leadership
from Bonifacio who wanted it

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:31.290
in Tagalog and not in Spanish.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:35.320
With the assassination
of Andres Bonifacio,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.490
after [inaudible]
trial, the new leaders

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:45.210
of the revolution established
the Malolos Republic,

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:50.900
which in turn was
[inaudible] by the Americans.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:56.920
Even under the leadership of
the learned and educated class,

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.040
the Philippine Revolution
was already on the verge

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.320
of victory over Spain.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:13.690
But Spain sought to save
face, [inaudible] battle

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:18.630
with General Dewey in Manila
Bay so that Spain did not have

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:23.120
to surrender to its
former colonial subjects

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.930
but to the new colonial
power, the Americans.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.150
Through the Treaty of Paris,
Spain sold the Philippines

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:38.480
to the United States
for $20 million.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.330
So what in fact is a
Filipino culture to speak

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.350
of after these colonial storms?

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:52.940
Our generation or even more
preferably the generations

00:16:52.940 --> 00:17:00.510
after us must dare to dream,
to re-imagine our nation.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:05.870
Revolutions are mainly physical
events while colonization

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.480
is cultural.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.650
The task for the
cultural sector especially

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:18.570
under the leadership now of the
National Commission for Culture

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:24.990
and the Arts is to have a
more direct and active role

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:31.680
in the act and process of
national re-imagination.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.480
It must wield its
various educational tools

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:42.500
and cultural instruments
and provide foundations

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:48.720
to the execution of its
mandate to make culture part

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.050
of the mainstream
of nation building.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:57.510
The education of the
Filipino into someone capable

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:04.920
of re-imagining himself and
the nation entails a revisiting

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:10.200
of Philippine history
but, sadly,

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:18.050
the only Philippine history
we know dates back from 1521

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:22.370
when Ferdinand Magellan
supposedly discovered

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.830
the Philippines.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:30.380
But what history is history
from the Western point

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.200
of view, pre-colonial history?

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:44.950
What we need is a native
non-colonial Filipino history.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:53.180
Archeologists, for example,
have discovered the remains

00:18:53.180 --> 00:19:02.640
of an ancient Filipino from
60,000 to 30,000 years ago

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:08.420
in a cave, in Tabon
cave in Palawan.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:14.550
The most recent archeological
diggings in Kalinga Province

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:18.360
in the Cordilleras even
show that humans were

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:25.240
in the Philippines as
early as 709,000 years ago.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:33.550
But even if we record only from
the dating of the Tabon man,

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:38.770
we need to recover
our historical memory

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:42.930
for at least 28,000 years.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:49.440
We must be able to retrace
our steps to the time

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:56.710
when ancient Filipinos
discovered the Philippines,

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.250
not a Portuguese name Magellan.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:09.320
If we must recover this lost
memory, we must study, preserve,

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:16.140
and safeguard our
intangible cultural heritage.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.890
Right now, heritage preservation

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:26.310
in the Philippines focuses
mainly on built heritage,

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.740
the tangible cultural
heritage that comes

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.010
from our colonial past.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:39.060
Surely, the earthquake
broke our Spanish churches,

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:43.920
the area with the sturdy
Antillean architecture

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:51.050
of our [inaudible] to mention
a few, our valuable relics

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:55.400
and repositories of
our colonial past.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:01.960
But again, the memory we
must recover does not reside

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.390
in these relics.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.720
We must rediscover
our lost memory.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.500
And we can only rediscover
our lost memory

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:21.560
in the intangible part of
our heritage: in the legends,

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:27.890
the epics, the folktales, the
[inaudible], the proverbs,

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:33.440
the [inaudible] of the
culture which are all clear

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:41.200
of colonial residue and the
main medium for such items

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.850
of culture is language.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:51.620
Language is the repository of
ancient history and culture,

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:57.180
and the carrier of the special
perspectives of the speakers

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.790
of the language themselves.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:05.670
Ironically, again, the
present and conventional method

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:12.180
of research and recovery is to
translate the recovered epics,

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:17.860
legends, folktales,
proverbs into English and not

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:25.230
into the national language or
in any major Filipino language.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:31.350
Moreover, the interpretation
and analysis must either be

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:37.120
in Filipino or in any
major Filipino language.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.180
Filipinos are the first
and direct beneficiaries

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:47.160
of cultural research,
not the foreigners.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.680
To translate the said
cultural materials

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:58.000
from the vernacular originals
into English is to deny

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.160
or further obscure their essence

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:10.240
and what results is not the
rediscovery of our identity

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.640
but more negation of it.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.330
What we get is not
a re-imagined nation

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:23.840
but often a distorted image,
the illusion of a nation.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:30.580
To fully and properly
recover our lost memory,

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.860
we need to gather, collect,

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:38.800
and document our
intangible cultural heritage

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:44.830
with a firm national and
nationalist orientation.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:49.730
And this is instead
of the usual regional

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:56.070
and parochial orientation
[inaudible] as Filipinos.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:00.900
The target benefit should
be the reconstitution

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:07.720
in the national imagination and
this requires the inward looking

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.360
and internal revolution
which was championed

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:19.780
by our heroes Andres Bonifacio
and Apolinario Mabini.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.840
For example, in introducing his

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:29.290
"The True Decalogue"
[foreign language],

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.550
Apolinario Mabini said,

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:36.800
"To be able to establish
the true structure

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:42.910
of our social regeneration,
it is necessary for us

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:49.380
to change radically, not
only our institutions,

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:54.890
but also our ways of
living and thinking.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:25:03.020
It is important to undergo an
internal and external revolution

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:07.090
at the same time;
it is necessary

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:14.400
to establish a more solid
basis for moral education

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.980
and to foreswear the vices

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.970
that we have inherited
from the Spaniards."

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:30.210
We must look everywhere then
to gather historical as well

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:37.930
as cultural documents that is
a part from internal, social,

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.870
anthropological research.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:47.320
We must even enroll the help
of our former colonizers,

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:52.870
including the Library of
Congress in the United States.

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.550
The United States
holds considerable

00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:01.300
and significant Filipino
historical documents

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.150
and we must seek
their assistance

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.790
in assessing these
documents of our memory.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:15.270
We must speak up where our
earlier scholars left off.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:22.720
Cesar, I don't know if you have
heard of him, Cesar Adib Majul

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.590
who wrote an extensive
history of Muslim Philippines

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:32.910
in the 1960s and
Teodoro Agoncillo

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:38.350
who asserted the nationalist
independent thought

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.890
that was [inaudible]
in the building

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:46.010
of a robust national identity.

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:49.530
Thus, we must keep
revisiting the works

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:54.630
of our outstanding historians
like Renato Constantino,

00:26:54.630 --> 00:27:02.330
our cultural anthropologists
like F. Landa Jocano,

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:06.270
Florentino Hornedo, among others

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:10.500
and including the
pioneers H. Otley Beyer

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.200
and William Henry Scott.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.230
We must look everywhere
for throughout all

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:23.290
of we must look intently inside

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:26.580
for that is the only
way we can recover

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:31.660
from the cultural amnesia
colonization has inflicted

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.890
upon us.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:40.150
Frantz Fanon said that the
worst devastation visited

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:45.300
by colonialism upon the
colonized is not the sapping

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.660
of a nation's natural wealth.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:53.020
Yes, the sapping of
natural wealth is fatal

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.370
and debilitating.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:59.790
But the ultimate crime
for him is the sapping

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.960
of the national memory.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:06.440
And that is done
through the substitution

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:11.620
of the colonizers' culture
over the native one.

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:20.190
Through various devious methods
of education and re-orientation,

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:26.170
the colonizers made to forget
his history and native culture

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:30.860
and learn to love instead
his master's culture.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:37.440
And why? Because a person
without memory is a person

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:43.260
without pride and, thus,
much easier to enslave,

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:49.220
much easier to subjugate, and
would tend to be always owed

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.720
by the superiority of
his master's image.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:58.990
Thus, even when he is freed,

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:03.960
we will continue his
master's education

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.390
and feel inferior to him.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:15.520
A man without memory is a man
with a deep inferiority complex.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:22.470
A nation without memory
is a nation without pride.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:26.990
The Philippines is no different

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:33.760
from all the former colonies
liberated in the 20th century

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:40.340
that suffer from a deep and
miserable cultural amnesia.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:44.920
To overcome this
cultural amnesia,

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:51.840
we must go the same route of
re-education and re-orientation

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.780
through and into our
own culture and history.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:03.140
What we need for the Philippines
now is not a political agenda,

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:08.180
but what we need is a
new cultural agenda.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:12.440
We must orchestrate the
execution of the mandates

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.570
of our cultural agencies
and they're the umbrella

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:20.720
of the national commission
for culture and the arts

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.220
from the National Archives

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:27.080
to the National Historical
Commission, from the Commission

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:32.290
on the Filipino Language
through the National Museum

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:35.930
and the Cultural Center
of the Philippines.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:42.360
You know, the month of May
has been designated National

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.520
Heritage Month

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:52.220
under proclamation number
439 of the year 2003.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:57.550
This year, the National
Heritage Month was launched

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:02.990
in the southern city of Davao,
on the island of Mindanao.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:09.190
In opening the celebrations,
I said we need

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:13.090
to celebrate our
national heritage

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:20.230
in whatever shape it is,
even how small, splintered,

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:28.890
fragmented, or distorted it is
because we want to remember.

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:31.420
And we want to remember
because we want

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:36.680
to recover our memory
of our past.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:42.220
We want to recover our
memory because we want

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:49.810
to rediscover our pride,
our more glorious identity

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:57.670
as Andres Bonifacio [inaudible]
while instigating our national

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:06.280
revolution against colonialism
so that we can chart a clear

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:11.530
and more vigorous
direction for our future,

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:20.850
[inaudible] our national
destination and destiny.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:28.590
And "The Corpse" after
all, tossed up by the sea

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:34.760
in some isolated shore
need not be revived.

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:41.470
It has been consumed and
desiccated by the elements.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:46.350
It might be after
all the remains

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:50.220
of our reconstructed
colonial memory

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:53.900
or un-reconstructed
colonial memory.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:33:02.780
What the corpse needs is a
resurrection and transformation

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:12.390
through the re-infusion of the
lifeblood of national memory.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:19.040
As it is reconstituted with
our true heritage and memory,

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:26.420
we will begin to
understand it's wholeness.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:35.450
We will begin to know again
and assert its name, Filipino.

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:37.550
Maraming salamat po.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.510
Thank you for your time.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:44.500
[ Applause ]

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:03.320
Do I stay up for
[inaudible] or do I stay here?

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.100
&gt;&gt; Hong Ta-Moore: I was going
to ask about or say something.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.740
Thank you, Mr. Shao,
for the wonderful talk.

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.890
This is the time for Q&amp;A.

00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:17.570
Does anybody have any
questions for chairman ?

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.970
Now is the time.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:26.670
&gt;&gt; Dongfang Shao:
There is one there.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:31.710
&gt;&gt; I do not have question
but I'd like to thank you

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.270
for [inaudible] and
referring to Frantz Fanon.

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:37.650
Most of us who study
African civilizations

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:41.950
and African-American history
rely upon him for direction

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:45.710
and much of what you have said
today is the work that is going

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:48.880
on within the African-American
community in trying

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.860
to recover our history as well.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.010
So I thank you very much.

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:54.310
&gt;&gt; Dongfang Shao: Thank you

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:58.380
for appreciating my
citation from Frantz Fanon.

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.680
I love him.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.700
Yes, sir.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.000
&gt;&gt; Would you care to comment

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.220
on how colonial influences have
affected Philippine culture

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.360
over the years you've
had a long period

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:19.010
under Spain, Catholicism -- -

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:20.310
&gt;&gt; Dongfang Shao:
Three centuries.

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:23.800
&gt;&gt; And then you had
the American influence.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.670
&gt;&gt; Dongfang Shao: More
than half a century.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.800
What could be your
question, sir?

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.260
&gt;&gt; The question is how
do you access the impact

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:37.070
of those foreign cultures
on Philippine society:

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:39.540
positive, negative, neutral?

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:43.260
&gt;&gt; Dongfang Shao: I would
not say positive or negative

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:47.320
or neutral but in my
talk now, what I tried

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:52.120
to emphasize is the
more negative impact

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.640
on our consciousness.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:00.000
As I quoted from Frantz Fanon,
any kind of colonization

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.650
that happened from the 18th to
the, from the 17th to the 19th

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:14.070
or event 20th century is a
kind of, it's a very bad kind

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:19.160
of experience because
it does not only result

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:23.440
to the abuse [inaudible]
and economically

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:30.270
of the colonized country
but also in the what he said

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:34.980
as the sapping of national
memory and that's the worst kind

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:41.360
of effect colonization makes
towards all the colonized

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.130
countries of the world,
especially in Asia,

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:46.970
Africa, and South America.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:59.000
But it doesn't also mean that
we did not get some benefits

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.300
from colonization.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.450
&gt;&gt; Hong Ta-Moore:
Any more questions.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:13.500
Thank you very much.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.800
&gt;&gt; Dongfang Shao: Salamat.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.570
Thank you very much.

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:19.040
[ Applause ]

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.660
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
