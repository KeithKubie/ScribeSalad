00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; So good afternoon, everyone.
And welcome to another Outstanding Authors@Google

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.430
talk.
Today, we have the distinct privilege of hosting

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.940
Michael Hanlon to our
podium today.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.150
He's a preeminent science writer currently
serving as the science

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.600
editor for the Daily Mail over in the United
Kingdom.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.020
And he's the author of such super cool books
as "The Science Behind the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.700
Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" and "The
Real Mars."

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.500
Today, he'll be speaking from his most recent
book, which is "Ten

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.940
Questions That Science Can't Answer."
And we also have, you know, copies of his

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.370
penultimate, most recent
book, "The Eternity", if you want to take

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.420
a perusal later on.
As Googlers, we always have our eyes on the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.800
future, and Michael helps
us understand the state of the art and the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.780
state of the future.
So after the talk, we'll have time for some

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.940
brief Q&amp;A.
Please feel free to use the mic to improve

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.359
our recording for YouTube.
Without further ado and please join me in

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.370
welcoming Michael.
Thank you.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.570
MICHAEL HANLON: Good morning, everybody.
Thank you for having me, thank you for coming.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.400
&gt;&gt; Thank you for using Webex.
Visit our website at www.webex.com

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.400
&gt;&gt; Just ignore that.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.410
MICHAEL HANLON: I'll go ahead and ignore that.
I found it amusing that I found it so hard

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.890
to find this building today.
Irony and so forth.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.840
Yes, thank you for having me.
As Cliff said, I'm a science writer.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.260
I'm not a scientist, which is a big difference.
People often get them confused.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.570
You probably won't be confused after you've
heard me wittering on for a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.300
few minutes.
A couple of years ago, three years ago now,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.570
my publisher came to me and
she said, "It would be very good if you could

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.330
write a book about
mysteries," because not being a scientist

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.040
is often a good perspective
to -- to look at the big field, look at the

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.580
big questions, that kind of
fall between the gaps, from the very profound

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.470
to the very ridiculous.
And I said, "Well, how many?"

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.110
And she said, "How many have you got?"
So I thought well, I started thinking and

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.640
I thought well, there's about
26 big ones, you know, time, consciousness,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.590
the usual ones and some
less usual ones as well.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.550
And she said, well, it should really be like
your principles, you know.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.210
Here are my principles.
Here are ten of them and if you don't like

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.850
them, here are ten more.
So only a very foolish author writes himself

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.600
out of a sequel, so I just
picked ten.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.520
I wanted to look at some of the really great
mysteries, the things

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.410
which science seems to be incapable of really
addressing properly.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.410
And there's a great quote from G.K. Chesteron
 -- the poet only asks to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.080
get his head into the heavens, it is the magician,
or the scientist or

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.950
whoever, who seeks to get the heavens into
his head and it is -- and it

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.700
is his head that splits.
I think that's very true.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.540
The more you think about some of these things,
the more your head does

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.190
start to hurt.
It's pretty clear over the last hundred years,

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.800
science alone has all
the interesting questions but, happily, not

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.490
all the answers.
There is still great mystery here.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.370
And as we shall see, this is not the case
a hundred years ago.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.600
People thought that science was just about
to get it all sewn up.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600
And then along came all sorts of troublesome
characters like Einstein

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.500
and the quantum physicists and so on.
Why isn't this working?

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.760
Bridget Bardot is not supposed to be there
nor is that fat person.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.930
It's good to see the Google computers working
so well.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.470
One big, great mystery -- fishy things about
the universe, for example.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.330
I'm not going to be run through the chapters
one by one cause that

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.820
would be dull and predictable.
I'm just going to skittle around the book.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.520
The fact the universe exists -- if you want
to upset a cosmologist, you

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.040
sort of ask them why it's there at all.
It's very fishy indeed.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.630
Why did the universe go to the bother of existing
when clearly not

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.459
existing would have been far easier?
Another very strange thing about the universe

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.000
is it's conscious.
We know that's so.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.270
I know it's so and at least one little bit
of it is conscious -- me.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.819
This is quite staggeringly strange.
Most thing are not self-aware.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.739
But we here on earth are, probably we share
the earth with several

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.400
billion animals, most of them probably are
self-aware too.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.209
This is very, very odd.
These are sort of big -- these are big profound

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.840
questions.
And also I've got a chapter in my book, which

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.730
is maybe slightly less
profound question, which is, why are people

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.390
so fat?
Now, this is a photograph I took last week

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.879
in my country.
We've been having some very warm weather on

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.320
the beach.
And this is more or less a typical person

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.050
now in my country.
This is a fattest person actually I could

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.490
find in Britain last week.
This person was sitting next to me on the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.639
plane from Seattle the other
day.

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.050
So maybe this is typical of the North American
continent.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.430
And a couple weeks ago I went to France, and
I took a picture of this

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.240
person and she as actually the fattest person
I could find in France.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.370
So there are -- there are some differences
which transcend class and

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.760
wealth and are slightly mysterious.
And in fact, there is a doctor working over

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.040
in Maryland who thinks
there are some very odd things about the obesity

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.160
epidemic that we've
seen which has really taken off since 1980.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.890
Odd things include the fact that calorie input
into people like

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.180
Americans, British people, who are getting
fatter and fatter has

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.610
actually gone down since then, and the amount
of calories burned off in

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.050
exercise has actually gone up, and yet we
keep getting fatter.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.110
What's the cause?
Is it something wierd that we're doing like

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.710
eating high fructose corn syrup?
That's been labelled as one thing.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.400
Some people have suggested a virus.
This doctor in Maryland is suggesting there

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.570
might be a viral component
to obesity.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.840
People laughed at him, and then they will
remember the case of the --

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.470
the stomach ulcers which, of course, everyone
knew was caused by

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.430
stress, until somebody won a Nobel Prize for
proving otherwise.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.229
Swallowed some bacteria and got a stomach
ulcer as a result.

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.410
Another question I look at in the book concerns
the sentience of

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.220
animals.
Again, it's very interesting from a sort of

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:57.090
science/history perspective
for several centuries, over millennia, really,

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.650
science and the popular
view of animal sentience were loggerheads.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.199
We tend to think of the old style world as
being very cruel, very

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:08.330
heartless nature, bred in tooth and claw,
and the Middle Ages as being

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.270
very brutal.
But actually people are very surprised to

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.070
hear that in Medieval Europe,
for example, animals were considered sentient.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.720
This was considered to be the, the default
explanation for their

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.870
behavior.
In fact in several countries, in Switzerland

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.660
in 1316, a pig was put on
trial for murder and I think it was acquitted.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.759
In Hamburg in the 15th century, some rats
were put on trial for causing

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.700
the plague.
And actually they were guilty, but they had

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.710
some very good lawyers,
being rats, and they got off too.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.551
[LAUGHTER]
So the idea in the 16th century that an animal

00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:44.890
was sentient, had
rights, had responsibilities and could act

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:50.670
as an independent, sentient
conscious agent was not seen as being at all

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.152
surprising.
And, of course, now we kind of think the same

00:06:53.152 --> 00:06:57.250
thing, but there was a
gap between about the end of the 17th century

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.979
and the middle of the
20th century when the idea is first promulgated

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:04.690
by this man.
This is -- who is this?

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.120
You're all Google, you should all know who
this is.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.380
Anybody?
Nobody knows who this is.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.020
This is René Descartes, he's one of the most
famous people in history.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.600
automata.
He used to do things like put red hot pokers

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.729
up their bottoms and write
about their responses saying, you know, I'm

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:25.270
not being cruel.
This is the just the response of a machine,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.800
effectively, to -- to what
looks like pain, but there's no actual pain

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.000
being -- going on.
And it strangely -- this was an idea that

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.690
took hold in science.
This was seen as the standard enlightenment

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.840
view of animal sentience,
there wasn't any.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.230
And right into the 20th century, we had men
like B.F.Skinner, who's

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.740
actually too boring to show a photograph of.
He was the arch-behaviorist.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.650
And he put pigeons in boxes and rats and taught
them how to peck at

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.040
things in a certain order.
And he said basically the brain was just a

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.530
box.
You had stimulus in and responses out, and

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.370
he actually tried to bring
his daughter up in a skinner box until she

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.890
was taken away by child
welfare.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.810
[LAUGHTER]
Actually, that didn't happen.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.310
This is a photograph of a sentient being.
This is my late dog, who was called Twiglet.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:11.360
She died about three years ago.
And I'm pretty sure she was sentient.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.490
She certainly did funny things like hiding
socks.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:18.150
And she would be able to do things like recognize
certain makes and

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.919
models of car.
Of course, she could have been a completely

00:08:20.919 --> 00:08:24.170
 -- zombie.
She could have been just a machine behaving

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:29.170
as though she was sentient
and intelligent, but I -- I tend to use the

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.800
principle of ducks.
If it walks and quacks and swims and flies

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.969
like a duck, it probably is
a duck.

00:08:33.969 --> 00:08:38.770
And now we're quite happy to accept that creatures
like this -- this

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.420
person was sitting on the other side of me
on the plane from Seattle.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.420
[LAUGHTER]
And even creatures like this are sentient.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.430
And in fact, just a couple of weeks ago, there
was a fascinating

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:53.730
experiment done with this chap.
This is a slime mold, and they gave it a maze

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.240
to find.
They put it so whatever slime molds eat.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.580
I don't know what slime molds eat.
Something even worse than slime molds, I suppose.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.660
[LAUGHTER]
At one end of the maze and the slime mold

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.500
was actually able to find its
way through this maze faster than a rat.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:11.020
And no one has any idea how.
It was even faster than the CEO of most hedge

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.020
funds.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.230
[LAUGHTER]
Another question from slime molds to time.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:20.000
If I knew what time was -- if I knew what
I was supposed to say next I

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.380
would have a Nobel Prize.
What is time?

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.070
No one knows.
I think -- a few awkward facts about time.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:31.830
No one knows what it is why it is or if it
is even there at all.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.339
I'm sure being smart, you've all read lots
of ideas of block time

00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:38.950
versus flowing time, Einstein's view of time,
the past, present, and

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.410
future all being equivalent.
And people like Arthur Eddington viewing that

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:47.399
time is like a river.
Why do we -- why do we remember the past and

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:50.380
not the future?
Why is the past set in stone and the future

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.850
is up for grabs?
I think one of the nicest little explanations

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:59.470
of why time is weird came
from a poet Austin Dobson, who wrote,

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:03.820
"Time goes you say, oh no.
Alas time stays, we go.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.860
Or else were this not so, what need to chain
the hours for youth were

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.430
always ours?
Time goes, you say.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:15.300
Ah, no."
I think this is nice because it kind of suggests

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:20.019
that the way we view
time, the way we view that time is flowing

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:24.610
through us may be wrong.
It may be us that's flowing through time.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:28.560
And increasingly a lot of psychologists speak
to this -- there's stuff

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.110
about this in my book -- think, think that
our perception of time,

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.019
psychological time is probably something quite
distinct from physics

00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:38.350
time.
And I think because we use the same word for

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.420
the two things, we may be
being confused.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.410
Nothing in known physics corresponds to the
passage of time.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.981
Most physical properties like space, for example,
you can go up and

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:51.529
down, you can go backwards and sideways and
forwards and reversible --

00:10:51.529 --> 00:10:55.940
time doesn't work like that.
It goes from states of low to high entropy;

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.050
nothing else works quite like that.
Another question -- I'm rattling through these

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:00.580
 -- can I live forever,
please?

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.700
There's lots of people in this particular
part of the world who make a

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.041
lot of money persuading shareholders to buy
stocks in their companies,

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:14.030
that produces sort of gene therapy, immortality
pills, and so on.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.319
So far, sadly, none of this has worked.
This person who we'd all like to emulate this

00:11:17.319 --> 00:11:20.330
 -- anyone know who this
is?

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.750
This is Jeanne Calment.
She is the world record holder to date for

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.680
longevity.
She died in Arles, in France, in August 1997

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:34.410
at the age of 122 years
and 314 days -- very cross that she missed

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.170
her 123rd birthday.
Now lots of people out there think that in

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.809
a few years, a few decades,
we're all going to be living this long.

00:11:40.809 --> 00:11:43.060
She was actually very fit and healthy towards
the end.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.480
She gave up cycling when she was 116, and
she gave up smoking at 118 on

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.540
the advice of her doctor who said it was bad
for her.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:55.950
[LAUGHTER]
Her response to her doctor was not -- is not

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.110
recorded.
She learned to use e-mail before she died,

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.170
and she knew Vincent Van
Gogh and was actually propositioned by him

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.190
as a child.
That's an extraordinary life, if you think

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.970
about it, to have been -- to
have Vincent Van Gogh ask you to go to bed

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.610
with him while drunk and to
have sent an e-mail.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:15.000
I cannot imagine there's any other human being
that has bridged two

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.140
worlds quite like that.
A really nice story about Jeanne Calment is

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.710
that when she was in her
80s, she did a deal with a family lawyer,

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.984
her husband had died and her
lawyer had said, well, you live in a lovely

00:12:25.984 --> 00:12:29.410
apartment in Arles.
You know, one of these grand old, turn of

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.440
the 18th century, French
buildings -- obviously French -- in Arles,

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.490
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you a lot of money for it and you

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:39.110
can live in it rent free
until you die.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.570
And this, this arrangement was still in place
when the lawyer's

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:43.570
grandson died.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:50.079
[LAUGHTER]
So a very, very nice way to stick two fingers

00:12:50.079 --> 00:12:53.220
up to Mr.Death.
Why did she live so long?

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.029
We don't know.
Why do these things live so long?

00:12:56.029 --> 00:13:01.510
This is a sea anemone, among the stupidest
of creatures on earth.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.290
But they have got one thing right, they have
live a very long time.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:07.610
I spoke with the marine biologist once that's
there's a good chance

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.060
they study sea anemones, that they may be
effectively immortal.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.750
Of course, sea anemones die, they get eaten
by fish, and they get

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.930
knocked off rocks by storms and waves and
things.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.740
But actually if you put a sea anemone in a
nice tank and you give it

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.830
its nutrients and its food, and you don't
freeze it or put sea

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.670
anemone-eating things in there, they don't
seem to age.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.270
Their cells don't age.
They keep on replicating as needs must.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.350
And they might be somewhere, some little crevice
on the Great Barrier

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.980
Reef, there might have well be a 10,000-year
old sea anemone out there.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:43.350
Maybe death is the price we pay for not being
sea anemones.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.019
So far, this isn't coming up on the screen
for some reason --

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:51.310
There are several tricks doctors have come
up with, to live a long time.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:56.200
One is to starve.
I once spent an entertaining evening with

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.880
a professor, Roy Walford.
He was professor at UCLA.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:05.070
He took part in the Biosphere 2 project in
the Arizona desert, I think

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.029
in the 80s.
And he came up with the notion -- he was a

00:14:08.029 --> 00:14:11.519
biologist -- he came up with
the notion of calorific restriction.

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:14.920
And he said that he put a load of rats on
a very restricted calorie

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.870
diet, down to about a third of their normal
intake, but maintaining the

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.260
nutrients and the vitamins and so on.
And they lived quite a lot longer than rats

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.329
fed on a regular diet.
So he started an experiment on himself.

00:14:27.329 --> 00:14:33.019
And I went to see him in his house in Venice
Beach in L. A., and he was

00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:36.390
about -- at the time he was about 70, and
he was eating 900 killer

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.910
calories a day, which really isn't very much.
He looked terrible.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:44.450
He had dinner, which was a bowl of rice and
a glass of water.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:49.170
And sadly, he died a couple of years later.
I don't say that to be nasty and funny, just

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.630
that it didn't seem to do
him any good.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:55.959
And he started a club, on online club, the
calorific restriction club.

00:14:55.959 --> 00:14:58.851
And the sort of devotees of Roy Walford are
starving themselves to long

00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:01.680
life.
And one suspects it's not going to work.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.991
Another one is exercise.
Um, as a journalist, we are bombarded with

00:15:06.991 --> 00:15:10.339
health scares and health
stories and health advice, and you have to

00:15:10.339 --> 00:15:11.760
just write it all and hope
it's all true.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.110
And of course none of it is, really.
But one of the things that does seem to be

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.279
good is -- is exercise,
physical exercise.

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:22.110
Humans are very good at running.
One of the things you're taught as a child

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:26.350
is that homo sapiens was a
weak feeble animal on the African plain, you

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.079
know, we were capable
of being outrun and out-eaten by more or less

00:15:29.079 --> 00:15:30.490
anything, but that's
actually not true.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.310
The one thing humans are better at than any
other large mammal is

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.269
running.
This is not widely appreciated.

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:41.209
Not over short distances, of course, but over
long distances, we're

00:15:41.209 --> 00:15:44.529
better than antelopes, elephants, horses,
you name it.

00:15:44.529 --> 00:15:48.399
And that -- we have tremendous stamina.
And one of the things our bodies seem to be

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:50.470
very, very geared up to do
is running.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.860
And people running a lot is definitely very
good for them.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.110
And it's very hard to have any sort of concrete
evidence on longevity,

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.730
obviously, with humans, because we live so
long anyway.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:03.480
But that seems to be a good thing.
Another thing is to choose your parents carefully.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.899
[LAUGHTER]
Try and find some parents who made a hundred

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:10.589
if you can.
It's excellent and then time travel comes

00:16:10.589 --> 00:16:12.990
into that.
If you go back and become your own mother

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:16.370
or father, you can probably
have more say in the matter.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.830
Another good way of reducing your chance of
dying young is to spend the

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.810
ages of 17 to 22 in a locked room, if you're
a male.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:29.130
This is actually a nasty little death spike
at this age.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.170
Car crashes in the West, violence across a
lot of the world.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:36.160
In some societies, particularly some of the
troubled societies in South

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.170
America, for example, whole digit, single
digit percentages of young

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.360
men are killed between the ages of 15 and
20 through violence,

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.779
through violent acts.
Thinking of some of the tribes in Peru and

00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:49.250
Brazil.
And this is a very dangerous time.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:53.949
It's the testosterone surge.
Young men become very stupid, very aggressive,

00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:55.130
very violent towards
each other.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.829
It's actually quite a good way of getting
mates and getting your DNA

00:16:57.829 --> 00:17:00.970
out in the world, but it's not so great for
longevity.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.079
You can worry about telomeres.
Lots of people talk about telomeres, I think

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.249
partly because they like
the word.

00:17:05.249 --> 00:17:09.649
It sounds kind of sexy and science-y.
The problem with telomeres is that actually

00:17:09.649 --> 00:17:12.279
in some species
the telomeres get longer as they get older.

00:17:12.279 --> 00:17:15.929
Sea gulls.
Sea gulls don't live forever, and we don't

00:17:15.929 --> 00:17:19.350
really know why.
If you see this word or this term on a bottle

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.639
of anything, usually it's
best to ignore it.

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:26.770
Especially if you see the word "quantum" combined
with it on the bottle

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.700
of anything.
I was chatting to Roger Highfield -- not chatting.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.700
I was reading a
letter by Roger Highfield who I know, who's

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:39.120
the editor of New Scientist
a couple weeks ago, and he was saying how

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.210
if they put the word
"quantum" on the cover of New Scientist, they

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:44.070
sell 16 percent more
copies that week.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:49.740
He didn't really know why.
And that led somebody to ask him, well, what

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.859
word can you put on the
cover where you less copies per week?

00:17:51.859 --> 00:17:53.999
And the answer was potato.

00:17:53.999 --> 00:17:57.639
[LAUGHTER]
And they're now going to run a experiment

00:17:57.639 --> 00:18:02.029
where they read a story about
quantum potatoes on the front cover.

00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:04.389
[LAUGHTER]
Another thing you need to live quite a long

00:18:04.389 --> 00:18:07.590
time is luck.
Avoiding falling things, avoiding falling

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.820
objects, avoiding those 17-
to 22-year old men when you're -- when you're

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.780
a bit older.
By the way, the greatest chance of being killed

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.909
by a 17- to 22-year old
man is if you are also a 17- to 22-year old

00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:21.990
man.
The people who are -- have most reason to

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.509
be frightened of these people
-- and they really are terrible human beings,

00:18:23.509 --> 00:18:30.080
most of them -- are
themselves, which is perhaps a consolation.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:37.179
I thought I'd do a chapter on the stupid.
Partly because I -- I feel an affinity with

00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:40.419
them.
And he said, going through his notes, trying

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:43.549
to find where he is --
this isn't really a science question.

00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:46.580
It's a social science question.
As we all know, social science isn't real

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.831
thinking of any kind, really.
But it's a nice little question.

00:18:48.831 --> 00:18:54.759
I wrote -- I wrote a piece in a British political
magazine a few years

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:57.450
ago called just this, "What Are we Going to
Do With the Stupid?"

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.840
And it strikes me that, um, that section of
society which is too bright

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.090
to be basically dysfunctional, but too stupid
to be basically

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:10.479
functional is an important sliver of society
is ignored by politicians,

00:19:10.479 --> 00:19:15.630
the public, the media, everybody.
These are the people who are -- don't fall

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.610
into the category of being
looked after.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:24.700
They're not -- they're not mentally disabled.
And yet increasingly, in a more and more knowledge-based

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:28.629
society, they
fall between the cracks in the paving stones.

00:19:28.629 --> 00:19:33.299
They're not able to keep up.
And the problem is exacerbated by the fact

00:19:33.299 --> 00:19:38.070
that we strive towards a
meritocracy.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:42.529
And a meritocracy is seen to be good.
It's better than having a society run by Dukes

00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:45.429
and Earls and Kings and
Queens, where the people at the top are there

00:19:45.429 --> 00:19:46.429
through accident of
birth.

00:19:46.429 --> 00:19:49.960
That doesn't seem fair.
It doesn't seem fair that the CEOs of companies

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.710
should be the sons of
the last CEOs.

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.739
That doesn't seem fair.
Much fairer, surely, to select through ability

00:19:54.739 --> 00:19:59.860
and hard work.
And you know, this place is probably the shining

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.999
example of it.
I don't suppose there's anyone seriously who

00:20:02.999 --> 00:20:06.450
works here who is dumb.
The problem with a meritocracy, although it

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:11.970
seems very fair, is what
happens to the poor people without any merit?

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.080
We just don't ask this question:
What are we going to do with them?

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.769
The left traditionally pretends they don't
exist, and says all we need

00:20:17.769 --> 00:20:21.129
to do is education and they are all be Einstein
or work at Google or

00:20:21.129 --> 00:20:24.989
whatever.
The right says, well, you know, to hell with

00:20:24.989 --> 00:20:26.159
them.

00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:30.899
[LAUGHTER]
And these aren't satisfactory solutions because,

00:20:30.899 --> 00:20:36.279
um, you know, sorry.
Just said that.

00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:39.509
If we have a society where stupid people don't
count, where people who

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:42.879
-- with all the best will in the world, with
all the education thrown

00:20:42.879 --> 00:20:46.669
at them, with all the good will and with all
the effort made to improve

00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:50.460
their lot -- cannot find a place in society,
you end up with problems.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.210
You end up with crime.
You end up with dissatisfaction.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:58.619
You end up with psychological malaise.
And I argue in my book that a hundred years

00:20:58.619 --> 00:21:01.109
ago, although there was
much wrong with the world a hundred years

00:21:01.109 --> 00:21:04.759
ago and I would far rather
live now than then for millions of reasons,

00:21:04.759 --> 00:21:08.869
we did at least have the
idea then that people of all abilities had

00:21:08.869 --> 00:21:11.990
some merit.
And people who weren't able to contribute

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:15.340
maybe intellectually, we
could find something else for them to do.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:19.360
And particularly in my country, the idea that
children who are not

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.580
academic are worthless is growing.
The exams are set up for people to fail, if

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.649
you think about it.
And we think a lot about what we do with the

00:21:27.649 --> 00:21:30.940
kids who pass these exams;
we don't think too much about what we do with

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.940
the kids who fail these
exams.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:39.420
And I think that's a shame.
This is a rather big jump to one of the chapters

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.669
in my book on dark
energy and dark matter.

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:44.441
Now, this is a photograph I took yesterday
of some dark energy.

00:21:44.441 --> 00:21:49.440
[LAUGHTER]
And this is a photograph I took the day before

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.320
of some dark matter.
I'm sure you all are perfectly familiar with

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.749
these, with these chaps.
Very problematic.

00:21:55.749 --> 00:22:01.210
I was in Geneva a few weeks ago looking at
 -- looking at them trying to

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.690
turn the LHC on for with the ninth time.
I think the last time it was screwed up, some

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:08.979
pigeon dropped a baguette
into one of the transformers, and they had

00:22:08.979 --> 00:22:11.119
to turn it off because they
were worried about it exploding.

00:22:11.119 --> 00:22:13.800
And, of course, this is, of course, the time
travellers from the future

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.090
screwing things up.
So we don't -- so we don't muck around too

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.999
much with causality.
And when I asked this of them, they just gave

00:22:19.999 --> 00:22:24.350
a thin smile.
We don't know what dark matter and dark energy

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.039
yet are.
One of the nicest numbers in science is 10

00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:32.779
to the power of 120, which
is the observed and calculated discrepancy

00:22:32.779 --> 00:22:36.549
between the -- main
parameters of dark energy, what you see and

00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:39.729
what there should be there.
And that is quite a large number, as I'm sure

00:22:39.729 --> 00:22:40.789
you know.
It's even bigger than google.

00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:43.720
It's -- what is it?
Trillion -- quintillion googles.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:51.249
And that's a big discrepancy.
So we're on the case but we're not there yet.

00:22:51.249 --> 00:22:56.309
I have a big chapter on ET -- not just, you
know, where are the aliens?

00:22:56.309 --> 00:23:00.580
But the more fundamental in that, really,
you know, what is life?

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:05.169
Is the universe alive?
I'm sure you all know this is the 50th anniversary

00:23:05.169 --> 00:23:08.519
of SETI, the Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

00:23:08.519 --> 00:23:12.739
And not a million miles from here, there is
an outfit called SETI

00:23:12.739 --> 00:23:20.000
Institute which is working on this.
They would be astrobiologists.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.929
NASA has an astrobiology institute now, which
a cynic would say is the

00:23:22.929 --> 00:23:26.460
30th thing -- it's the 30th things which do
not exist.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.349
To which a astrobiologist I know said, well,
what about history?

00:23:29.349 --> 00:23:32.269
That's the 30th things which did not happen
by people who were not

00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:34.460
there.
And the great thing about academics is they

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:39.100
are often so mature.
So one way to find intelligence if they -- aliens,

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.999
if they're out there
is to use machines like this.

00:23:41.999 --> 00:23:47.419
This is the Arecibo radio dish in Puerto Rico.
It's a rather spectacular thing, actually.

00:23:47.419 --> 00:23:55.619
It's built in a natural bowl in the mountains.
And SETI, the SETI Institute, borrows time

00:23:55.619 --> 00:23:58.019
on this.
When it was publicly funded, partially, by

00:23:58.019 --> 00:24:02.679
NASA until the 1980s, it
used to get more time.

00:24:02.679 --> 00:24:06.849
We don't actually know whether the world,
as in the universe, looks

00:24:06.849 --> 00:24:09.609
like this place on average or whether it looks
more like this place on

00:24:09.609 --> 00:24:13.070
average.
I took this photograph around three weeks

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.879
ago.
Could anybody tell me where I'm standing?

00:24:15.879 --> 00:24:17.080
[PAUSE]
Okay.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:22.529
I was standing on Pluto.
You should be able to tell because that is,

00:24:22.529 --> 00:24:25.419
of course, Pluto's moon
Charon over there, and the very small sun

00:24:25.419 --> 00:24:27.590
over there is a dead
giveaway.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.700
This is not a photograph of Pluto.
This is an artist's rendition of Pluto because,

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.461
of course, no one has
actually been there.

00:24:32.461 --> 00:24:39.409
Pluto is maybe typical of objects in the universe,
more icey-spheres, a

00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:44.429
long way away from their parent stars.
There may be more of these than there are

00:24:44.429 --> 00:24:47.559
grains of sand in all the
beaches of earth.

00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:49.690
We don't know if the universe is like this
 -- this is the Star Wars

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:55.179
cantina, a rather poor rendition of it because
I couldn't get a

00:24:55.179 --> 00:24:59.190
copyright-free version of the original one.
This is a photograph taken on Gliese 581 d,

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:03.649
which is the -- an
exoplanet discovered a few years ago, which

00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:06.460
last year or the year
before last was calculated to have an orbit

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:10.849
around its star which put
it in the so-called habitable zone, which

00:25:10.849 --> 00:25:15.390
is the zone at which liquid
water should be able to exist on its surface.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:20.559
That isn't a star with a hole in it, that's
actually Gliese 581 c

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:22.649
eclipsing -- partially eclipsing the parent
star.

00:25:22.649 --> 00:25:28.190
And we don't know if this just a ball of rock
like Pluto with some ice

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:31.529
on it or indeed some water, and whether there
are rather nice creatures

00:25:31.529 --> 00:25:34.979
like this on the surface.
This is a still taken from a small Canadian

00:25:34.979 --> 00:25:38.749
art house movie which was
released a few weeks ago, I don't know if

00:25:38.749 --> 00:25:42.639
it's come to the U.S. yet.
It's actually got some quite nice special

00:25:42.639 --> 00:25:46.549
effects, so I would advise
you to go and see it.

00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:50.330
I've forgotten the name.
But as you can see, this planet has some rather

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.490
nice, rather cool
scenery, floating islands, which I'm told

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:57.230
were modelled on the scenery
you see around Cape Flattery on the Washington

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:01.710
state coast.
Well, surprising, that there are actually

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.820
fewer than 20 tenured
scientists in the world at the moment working

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.790
on the question of the
origin of life here on earth.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.769
Forget space; we don't even know how life
began on earth.

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:14.429
And I think we have to really sort this one
out before we stand much

00:26:14.429 --> 00:26:21.299
hope of finding out whether there's life elsewhere.
And I've certainly got the word 42 on my screen

00:26:21.299 --> 00:26:22.440
which shouldn't be
there.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:30.789
But never mind, if you try and find out why
it's there.

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:34.619
[LAUGHTER]
Chapter in my book, I'm told here, on life,

00:26:34.619 --> 00:26:35.619
the universe and
everything.

00:26:35.619 --> 00:26:40.090
What is reality, really?
Philosophers and college students have been

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.409
arguing about this with
their coffee late at night for years and decades

00:26:43.409 --> 00:26:45.269
and centuries.
No one has really come up with a answer.

00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:48.360
The only person who has had a go was Douglas
Adams, of course, who said

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:54.159
the answer was 42.
Um, and according to a mutual friend, he just

00:26:54.159 --> 00:26:57.909
thought of it while
sitting in his garden, drinking tea, and he

00:26:57.909 --> 00:27:00.320
just thought the number 42
sounded cool, and it didn't have a seven in

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.229
it , which all kind of
pretentious numbers normally do.

00:27:03.229 --> 00:27:07.440
But it -- what's amazing is Douglas Adams'
fan club have been looking

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.100
for samples of 42 in nature ever since.
It was just a random number.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.269
But the idea that you might be able to boil
down the deep secret of the

00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:18.879
universe to one number is very, very -- very,
very, very nice.

00:27:18.879 --> 00:27:22.940
This is a picture of the universe yesterday.
This is what it looks like.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:28.419
This is the Hubble's deep field which is majestic.
If you think each one of these galaxies is

00:27:28.419 --> 00:27:31.649
around a hundred thousand
light years across -- and a hundred thousand

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:35.549
light years is quite a
long way, even not in traffic.

00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:41.559
And the universe that we see now is seven
orders of magnitude larger

00:27:41.559 --> 00:27:46.219
than the universe we saw 90 years ago, which
is a good stat.

00:27:46.219 --> 00:27:51.989
When Hubble, Edwin Hubble in 1926 realized
that the nebulae, or some of

00:27:51.989 --> 00:27:55.299
the nebulae, were actually island universes,
he called them, galaxies

00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:58.619
outside the Milky Way.
People started racing around trying to measure

00:27:58.619 --> 00:27:59.619
the distances to these
things.

00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:04.529
And it was clear that we had the universe
wrong, in terms of its size

00:28:04.529 --> 00:28:07.269
by seven orders of magnitude, which is a big
leap.

00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:11.320
There hadn't been a leap that big since -- since
the old earth going round

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:16.820
the sun business in the 15th century.
Um, the universe may be even bigger than that.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:22.549
This, of course, is Schrödinger's cat -- actually,
it looks more like

00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:23.789
sort of Schrödinger's cat turning into Schrödinger's
dog.

00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:28.859
I'm sure you'll all aware of the quantum paradoxes.
What happens to a -- in a quantum dictated

00:28:28.859 --> 00:28:32.299
event?
Do you end up with two of the objects acting

00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:35.059
 -- behaving -- existing
simultaneously?

00:28:35.059 --> 00:28:36.779
The cat that walks out is it the original
cat?

00:28:36.779 --> 00:28:39.119
So on and so forth.
And all this, together with some other fun

00:28:39.119 --> 00:28:43.299
stuff, has led to the idea
of the many worlds hypothesis, which has become

00:28:43.299 --> 00:28:46.080
respectable to
cosmology now.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.820
There are actually four levels of multi-verse
which cosmologists talk

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.080
about.
One, this level one, that I like to think

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.609
of as the kind of brute force
multi-verse which is simply the universe we

00:28:58.609 --> 00:29:04.099
see is just a tiny part of
a massively, almost infinitely, inflated super-cosmos.

00:29:04.099 --> 00:29:11.690
Same laws of physics everywhere.
Infinite space.

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:16.460
This means actually that if this holds, which
eminent astronomers,

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:21.440
cosmologists think it does, the mass of inflation
seems to suggest that

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.599
this is inevitable, that 10 to the 10 to -- I
think it's 10 to the 10

00:29:24.599 --> 00:29:28.330
to the 120 light years away, there is an identical
room to this with an

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:31.070
identical me and an identical you all sitting
here, being given this

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:36.509
talk with maybe one word differently.
Level two is the Stanford sort of multi-verse.

00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:40.849
Andrei Linde, who a Russian emigree cosmologist,
very clever chap.

00:29:40.849 --> 00:29:44.779
He's come up with this idea of post-inflationary
bubbles, little

00:29:44.779 --> 00:29:49.460
daughter universes splitting off from ours,
maybe black holes.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:53.679
Level three, the many worlds of quantum physics.
Every time you have a quantum event, you have

00:29:53.679 --> 00:29:56.669
a whole new universe, one
where Hitler won World War II, one where there

00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:58.349
was no World War II at
all.

00:29:58.349 --> 00:30:01.830
And level four, which I think is perhaps the
most interesting one,

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:08.080
which is whole different conceptual universes.
Things like, I'm sure you've all heard of

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:12.540
the matrix universe, the idea
that the world we see around us might be a

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:18.700
simulation.
People maybe not a hundred meters from here

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:23.339
are working with some very
powerful computers, and the big question is,

00:30:23.339 --> 00:30:25.739
is it possible to simulate
consciousness, for example, in a computer?

00:30:25.739 --> 00:30:28.700
If it is, then we shall do it fairly soon,
probably.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.019
And we shall do it more than once.
We shall do it millions of times probably

00:30:31.019 --> 00:30:34.710
billions of times.
And we simulate the weather, when we run weather

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:38.399
forecasts.
If you go NOAA or to the UK Met office, they

00:30:38.399 --> 00:30:43.200
run simulations of 10 to
the 9, 10 to the 15 simulations sometimes,

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.460
over days.
And if it's possible to simulate even a smart

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.859
part of the universe, you
don't need to do the whole thing, in a machine

00:30:49.859 --> 00:30:52.710
including consciousness,
and you do this trillions of times over, the

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:56.110
chances are that we are
living in one of these simulations, so say

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:59.999
some people, which is weird
and disturbing.

00:30:59.999 --> 00:31:04.209
When faced with arguments like this, some
people click their head in

00:31:04.209 --> 00:31:07.129
the sand.
There was a lecture, famous lecture given

00:31:07.129 --> 00:31:11.239
by Carl Sagan once.
And he was talking about cosmology and weird

00:31:11.239 --> 00:31:15.440
things, and a lady put her
hand up at the end of the talk and said, that,

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.700
it's just the earth.
You're completely wrong, Dr. Sagan, the earth

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.210
doesn't float around in
space.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:24.599
It sits on the back of a turtle.
He said, well, you know, what does a turtle

00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:27.950
sit on then?
She said, it's turtles all the way down.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:33.979
And she may have been quoting somebody else.
I think it's all very exciting.

00:31:33.979 --> 00:31:37.500
1900, Lord Kelvin, inventor of the Kelvin
temperature scale, there is

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:41.089
nothing new to be discovered in physics now.
All that remains is more and more precise

00:31:41.089 --> 00:31:46.429
measurement.
Meanwhile, in a patent library in Switzerland,

00:31:46.429 --> 00:31:50.539
a young man who was
rather clever was beavering away and coming

00:31:50.539 --> 00:31:54.970
up with some ideas which
would blow that out of the water.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:58.509
We don't want to retreat into -- into theology,
I think, theism --

00:31:58.509 --> 00:32:04.469
I think there's nothing wrong with deism.
The idea that there might be, ah, there might

00:32:04.469 --> 00:32:07.919
be some -- something
fishy, something about the whole set up.

00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:12.269
But traditional response to the great mysteries
is to invoke this chap

00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:15.090
to which the answer is always well, why not
believe in this chap as

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:24.419
well?
Thank you all very much.

00:32:24.419 --> 00:32:28.539
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:28.539 --> 00:32:32.659
[PAUSE]

00:32:32.659 --> 00:32:54.259
&gt;&gt; There we are.
Now we actually have sound plugged in.

00:32:54.259 --> 00:33:00.249
So, um, my one question was, um, what's the
11th question?

00:33:00.249 --> 00:33:03.729
Were there any ones that were cut from the
book that you'd wanted to

00:33:03.729 --> 00:33:06.129
include in like a bonus director's cut or
 --

00:33:06.129 --> 00:33:09.969
MICHAEL HANLON: No, no.
The 11th question comes in the next book which

00:33:09.969 --> 00:33:14.009
is The Next Ten
Questions Science Can't Answer Yet, which

00:33:14.009 --> 00:33:22.789
I'm -- I'm working on now.
I'm not going to tell you.

00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:23.820
[PAUSE]

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:32.200
&gt;&gt; All right.
I guess that wraps up our questions then.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.509
So thank you very much.
It was a great talk.

00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:34.509
MICHAEL HANLON: Thank you all very much.

00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.659
[APPLAUSE]
