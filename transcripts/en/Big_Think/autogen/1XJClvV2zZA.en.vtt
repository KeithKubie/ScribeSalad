complex food socially and and
 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.430
complex food socially and and
nutritionally and culturally and so it

nutritionally and culturally and so it
 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.859
nutritionally and culturally and so it
requires a little bit that statement

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869
requires a little bit that statement
 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.769

of all kinds the the best dairy products

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640
of all kinds the the best dairy products
 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.880
of all kinds the the best dairy products
are our traditional so they come from

grass-fed cows the milk is on

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600

homogenized the milk is ideally
 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.670
homogenized the milk is ideally
unpasteurized or raw because there are

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680
unpasteurized or raw because there are
 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.450
unpasteurized or raw because there are
many heat sensitive nutrients in milk

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460
many heat sensitive nutrients in milk
 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.460
many heat sensitive nutrients in milk
and and then those dairy products are

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470
and and then those dairy products are
 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.780
and and then those dairy products are
often prepared in traditional ways so

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790
often prepared in traditional ways so
 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.060

cheese or yogurt or butter which is
 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.040
cheese or yogurt or butter which is
really just removing everything but the

really just removing everything but the
 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.500
really just removing everything but the

consuming fresh dairy products in
 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.489
consuming fresh dairy products in
adulthood so it has been suggested that

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499
adulthood so it has been suggested that
 

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:17.980

many people are lactose intolerant this

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990
many people are lactose intolerant this
 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.660
many people are lactose intolerant this
isn't really accurate what what we're

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670
isn't really accurate what what we're
 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.260
isn't really accurate what what we're
actually describing is in adulthood we

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270
actually describing is in adulthood we
 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.959
actually describing is in adulthood we
stop producing lactase the enzyme which

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969
stop producing lactase the enzyme which
 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:27.910
stop producing lactase the enzyme which
helps us break down fresh milk we're all

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920
helps us break down fresh milk we're all
 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.950
helps us break down fresh milk we're all
born producing lots and lots of lactase

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960
born producing lots and lots of lactase
 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.859
born producing lots and lots of lactase
because we are mammals and and we're

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869
because we are mammals and and we're
 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.700
because we are mammals and and we're
breastfed traditionally so in a few

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710
breastfed traditionally so in a few
 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.190
breastfed traditionally so in a few
cultures the adults carry on producing

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200
cultures the adults carry on producing
 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.989
cultures the adults carry on producing
this enzyme which allows them to digest

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999
this enzyme which allows them to digest
 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:43.179
this enzyme which allows them to digest
fresh milk but particularly if they

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189
fresh milk but particularly if they
 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.679
fresh milk but particularly if they
lived in hog cultures they weren't able

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689
lived in hog cultures they weren't able
 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.160
lived in hog cultures they weren't able
to keep fresh milk from spoiling hence

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170
to keep fresh milk from spoiling hence
 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.020
to keep fresh milk from spoiling hence
the the production of yogurt and other

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030
the the production of yogurt and other
 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.840
the the production of yogurt and other
things to keep fresh milk around for

things to keep fresh milk around for
 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.050
things to keep fresh milk around for
more than a day or two so if you have a

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060
more than a day or two so if you have a
 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.779
more than a day or two so if you have a
look you can find actually the the

look you can find actually the the
 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.569
look you can find actually the the
ability to continue to produce lactase

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579
ability to continue to produce lactase
 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.320
