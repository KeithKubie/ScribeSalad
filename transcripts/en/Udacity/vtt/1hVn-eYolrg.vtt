00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.310
This is true, 2 &lt; 3.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.760
On our number line,
the solution set for x &lt; 3 covers 2.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.800
2 is part of the solution set.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.050
So when we plug 2 in for x in x &lt; 3,
we get a true statement.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.590
That should be true for
any number in the solution set.
