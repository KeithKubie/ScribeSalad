00:00:01.584 --> 00:00:02.419
WIL: Up first, the kill test.

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:04.087
Doug?

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:05.839
To see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon will do,

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.257
we'll deliver
slashes and thrusts

00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:09.509
on this ballistics dummy.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:10.301
Collin, you're up first.

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:11.302
You ready?

00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:12.887
Have fun.
Let's do this.

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:15.557
To help me today, I'm
bringing back one of Marcaida

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.183
Kali's chief instructors.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:20.437
Please welcome US Staff
Sergeant Chris Manns.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.147
After the failure
in round two,

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:24.858
I'm hesitant to say that my
sword is going to be awesome.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.609
I want to see what
my sword does.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.404
And only then will I feel better
about my mistakes in round two.

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:56.097
[chuckles]

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:59.726
All right, Collin, your
Kabyle flyssa is very sharp.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:03.480
On the initial thrust, it
penetrated deep and easily

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.398
through this whole
ballistics dummy.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:06.649
The handle is comfortable.

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.402
It's easy to slash
in and thrust out.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.821
Overall, it will kill.

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:13.656
Good job.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:14.991
Thank you, sir.

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:15.992
All right, Daniel, your turn.
You ready?

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:17.994
Yes, sir.
Let's do this.

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:20.288
I'm feeling a little
nervous about the kill test.

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:22.582
Win or lose, I just hope
my sword doesn't break.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:54.322
All right, Daniel, your
weapon is wicked sharp.

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:57.450
On the initial thrust,
it penetrated deep.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.202
And on the way out, with
your belly being forward,

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.913
it lacerates out easily.

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:05.625
Now, because you have such a
very skinny handle right here

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.378
and there is no pummel
with a counterweight,

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.004
all the weight is in front.

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:12.382
The balance just
makes the blade rotate

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:14.342
with a small handle like this.

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:17.220
But in terms of
damage it will kill.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.722
Thank you.
DOUG: Good job.

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:22.183
All right, gentlemen,
now the sharpness test.

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:23.518
To test the sharpness
of that blade

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:25.311
and to see if it
still has an edge,

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.313
I'll be cutting
through these fish.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:30.692
A clean, sharp blade should
pass right through those fish.

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:33.319
A dull blade is going to knock
those fish out of the way

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.488
or give us a jagged, torn cut.

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:36.823
Collin, you ready?
- Yes, sir.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.575
OK.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:39.784
And I'm just thinking, please
just slice through this thing.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.060
All right, Collin, right off,
it's definitely a sharp blade.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.770
It cut very nicely.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.524
Your handle is a
bit on the fat side.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.610
But it's definitely a cutter.
Good job.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.777
Thank you, sir.

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:16.362
- Daniel, are you ready?
- Yes.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:17.864
MAN: OK, great.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.783
I feel that Collin and
I are still neck and neck.

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:22.702
I think that I've got
a good edge on him.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.580
But all you can do is hope
for the best at this point.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.518
All right, Daniel, this
blade is wicked sharp.

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:50.271
And those cuts-- you
can see, they just

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:51.773
blew right through the fish.

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:55.818
My problem is, this
is so small, I had

00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:59.530
to fight to keep it in my hand.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.992
These flyssa often have
a very small handle.

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:05.244
But what saves
that is having that

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:07.038
pummel keeping your
hand from coming

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:10.124
off the back of that blade.

00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:11.376
It's an amazing cutter.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.920
It's just very
difficult to hold onto.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:20.301
WIL: Daniel, Collin, there can
only be one "Forged in Fire"

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:21.427
champion.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:28.977
And that champion is Collin.

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:29.978
Congratulations, you are our
new "Forged in Fire" champion.
