00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.170
Warning! The following video contains spoilers for Rogue One: a Star Wars Story

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.859
Guys, you've seriously got to learn how to spell rogue.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.460
You memba A New Hope.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.740
You memba Darth Vader.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.920
Now prepare to memba the handful of years between the rise of Darth Vader and the start of A New Hope.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.240
We call it the Death Star.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.840
Oh, they're gonna just rehash everything from
 Star Wars aren't they?

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.320
I've got bad feeling about... -K.. - Quiet!

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.880
[Rouge] One: A Star Wars Story

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.440
Get ready for Disney's first Star Wars anthology movie because there's no way in hell

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.620
they'd call it Star Wars prequel number four in what has to be the most money

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.140
anyone's ever spent to fill in a plot hole.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.040
That's the place I've laid my trap.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.140
That answers your most pressing questions.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.280
How exactly did the rebels get 
the plans to the Death Star?

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.520
Did they grab a data tape with a giant claw machine then use a big antenna to beam the data tape to a ship and

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.000
Then did that ship transfer the data 
to another smaller tape and then

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
did princess Leia copy that smaller tape 
on to a tiny droid's hard drive?

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.300
You know, whoever said this one is as good as Empire must be really into file formats.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.240
Meet an all new gang of rebels you, uuhh, how do I put this, shouldn't get too attached to.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.460
Like Jyn Erso, the rebellious rebel who rebels so hard, she does whatever her dad tells her.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.500
It must be destroyed. -I know, we will.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640
Whatever her surrogate dad tells her.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.900
Go with him Jyn. You must go.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.660
And whatever her new co-worker tells her.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.060
I'm coming with you. -No, we can't risk it.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.720
But sometimes she's pretty grumpy about it.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.320
Rebelling alongside Jyn is K-2S0,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.660
a droid with more personality than any of the human characters.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.740
I'll be there for you. Cassian said I had to.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.120
Cassian, a rebel whose most heroic moment comes when he doesn't murder someone for once.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.060
I had every chance to pull the trigger, but did I?

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.760
Saw Gerrera, an extremist cast out of the alliance by extensive reshoots.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.940
Chirrut, the blind guy who's technically not a Jedi, but I mean come on, look at this guy.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.600
And his friend, uh, Gunny McShootface.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.480
I'd add more, but that's pretty much 
all there is to this guy.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.760
Cower before the might of the Empire, as various old dudes squabble over who gets credit for the Death Star.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.000
We stand here amidst my achievement, not yours!

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.620
While down on the battlefield stormtroopers are rolling out in two brand new flavors,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.600
but with the same old incompetence we're used to. Whether they're missing easy shots,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.400
One with the force, the force is with me.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.460
Casually getting taken out,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.600
or setting up their weakness of sticks that the ewoks would take advantage of.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.940
Why do they even bother with the armor at all?

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.980
Enjoy one of the most beautiful Star Wars films to date,

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.940
that feels like the world's biggest budget fan fillm.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.500
Full of Easter eggs It will have die hard 
fans saying:

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.720
Gold leader. Red leader. 
-Awesome!

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.360
The Guardians of the Whills. -I get that reference. Hey its prequel guy. Blue milk, cool.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.660
Why does nobody ever tell me anything R2?

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.420
Okay? I like them.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.200
You just watch yourself

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.440
So that's where those cantina guys were? They were.. walking around.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.680
Yeah, the T15s have been marked obsolete.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.960
T15s, yeah.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.960
Yeah, I'm going to have to look that one up later. Whoa. What an awesome way to put Tarkin in the mo-? Uhg

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.960
Never mind, and this feels wrong somehow.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.400
But nothing will service fans harder and faster than Darth Frickin Vader

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.400
as a much older sounding James Earl Jones,

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.440
tries to give us a new iconic scene.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.960
Be careful not to choke on your aspirations.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.740
Ughh, Who let George Lucas write a line?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.220
But just when you think he's been wasted, extend your lightsabers for

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.320
the most badass Star Wars moment put to film: the hallway scene.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.880
Which makes Vader's next fight in the timeline even sillier than it already was.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.140
Booo, do more tricks

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.820
Not starring:

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.020
The following shots you saw in the trailers 
that weren't in the movie-

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.440
Jyn vs. a tie fighter,

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.900
the group working together,

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.580
actual heisting,

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.120
war-torn Scarif,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.360
this iconic shot of Jyn undercover,

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.100
unused Vader?

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.120
Saw Gerrera's other haircut,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.800
the shot they based 
the whole marketing campaign on,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.980
all these other cool shots,

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.360
and, this line: This is a rebellion, isn't it?

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.400
I rebel.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.500
OK, cutting that one makes sense.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.020
Suicide Squad: an unnecessary Star Wars Story

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.780
I'm one with the force, the force is with me.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.180
'm one with the force, and the force is with me

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.540
That's not how the force works!

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.140
Think the internet has enough Star Wars shows? 
Think again

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.420
We've launched an all-new show with professional. Youngling Jenny 
 Nicholson

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.520
to explore the outer rim of the Star Wars universe.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.480
Watch this week as she tackles 
what Star Wars creatures would you eat?

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.980
Then puts her credits where her mouth is and
 the ultimate galactic taste test.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.860
Why what is this meat? -Oh gross

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.360
it's screen Junkies millennial Falcon weekly, and it's free every Saturday on screen Junkies News.
