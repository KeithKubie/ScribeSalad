00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.694
PROFESSOR: All right, so
for the rest of class,

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:30.360
I'm going to talk
about post-production.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.730
Do you guys want to
take a five minute break

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.000
before I jump into that?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.030
OK.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.100
I will do that when
you guys come back.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.140
All right, so last
lecture-- should I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.380
stand up for this since I
stood for all the other ones?

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.530
OK.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.400
Feel free to interrupt
me at anytime.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.982
So I'm going to start off with
my favorite quote of all time,

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:51.940
at least for this class,
which is, "In writing,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.860
you must kill all
your darlings."

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.230
And that is what today's
lecture is about.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.600
Post-production 101 or
Killing All of Your Darlings.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.567
So when we think of production,
we think of the journey

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.650
that we have taken in the
last week of this class.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.560
We start with
ideation, we script,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.220
we storyboard, shoot,
edit, and then we

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.730
get to this product magically.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.875
And we have these three concrete
steps of pre-production,

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:21.750
production, which is
what you're about to do,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.350
and post-production.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.770
Let me know when I can
go to the next slide.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.890
The reality is that it's
not like that at all.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.060
And maybe you've seen that.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.560
Hopefully, you've seen that in
the course in the last week--

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.810
that you don't do production
in this nice linear, sequential

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.660
format, but you
ideate and you script.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.100
And when you script, you
go back to your idea.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.560
When you're storyboarding, it
affects your original idea.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.250
And that's how I'd like you guys
to approach editing as well.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.930
At least, I used
to think of editing

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.400
as something that happened
after I shot everything.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.000
And once I got to
editing, that was sort of

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.462
equivalent to just throwing
what you have together,

00:02:01.462 --> 00:02:03.170
but that that's not
necessarily the case.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.050
In post-production you're going
to find a lot of things that

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.570
maybe help you re-shoot things.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.220
And thinking about
post-production

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.350
before you've even
started production

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.160
can help you think of ways to
shape what you're going to do.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.880
So that is why I'm talking about
editing before you have even

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.090
started to film.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.590
So when we think of
editing, we think

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.990
of taking or creating something
that is representative

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.930
of continuous time.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.420
We think about putting
together a video that

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.320
has just the bad bits removed.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.960
So has anyone done any
video editing whatsoever?

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.270
Kenneth, you have.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.610
Yeah, so especially
with the webcam videos,

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.500
what you're basically doing is
recording a continuous event

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.320
and taking out the parts
where you mess up your line.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.320
That's what we think of.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.153
And we think of the bad
bits as being things

00:02:53.153 --> 00:02:56.860
that maybe as a take that
was out of focus, maybe

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.560
your light was
overexposed, maybe

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.390
your delivery wasn't so good.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.020
But in this simplest
sense, most people

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.170
think of editing as
presenting something

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.190
that is of continuous time.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.090
But the problem is that
sometimes the bad bits are not

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.680
as obvious as things
like overexposed light,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.070
and sometimes, you're
not necessarily

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.640
creating a product that
represents continuous time.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.920
So I love this book.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.300
It's on the syllabus.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:36.012
It's written by the editor of
Godfather III, Apocalypse Now.

00:03:36.012 --> 00:03:37.470
I think he did The
English Patient.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.350
He did a bunch of movies that
won a lot of Academy Awards,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.680
but he says that
editing is not so much a

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.870
putting together of a path, as
it is the discovery of one--

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.580
or something like that.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.270
So the question is, how do
you best discover this path?

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.930
So the nice thing about
editing right now-- we're

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.170
in the digital age,
so we have the files

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.670
that we shot available to us in
these chunks and it's up to us

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.860
to tape pieces together.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.350
But back when film
was actually on film,

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.980
you would have to
watch the entire reel

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.209
through to know exactly what
was on the physical tape itself,

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.050
which was very time
consuming, but it also

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.610
allowed you to see everything
in your fresh perspective

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.020
after you've shot it.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.520
And I think that's
the first step

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.960
that you need to do when you
edit-- to review the pieces

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.390
that you've shot.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.190
And I've mentioned this before
in one of the earlier lectures

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.090
I think, but after
you shoot, take a day

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.240
or take an afternoon.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.430
Don't look at your
stuff unless you're just

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.616
checking to make sure
that all of the file's OK.

00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:46.740
But when you sit down to
edit, I encourage everyone

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.500
to re-watch the
footage all over again

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.380
because when you're
shooting stuff,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.040
or when you're
really tired and it's

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.320
been an entire day of
shooting, the way you

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.020
look at your footage may
be a little bit different.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.980
So this is one of
the camera reports

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.180
from when we shot Lindsey's
video in D-Lab actually.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.350
And I also encourage you
to do this while you're

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.866
shooting to keep
track of your files,

00:05:10.866 --> 00:05:12.240
keep track of
what's a good take.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.000
But then afterwards,
I would suggest

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.100
that you re-log everything.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.780
And you don't necessarily have
to do it completely like this.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.430
But this was a log that
I did after we shot Snot.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.270
I could not review
the footage the day

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.630
of because I was so
exhausted so I looked

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.332
at it a couple days later.

00:05:30.332 --> 00:05:32.040
And I was able to see
like, oh, you know,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.740
this take wasn't really good
and it's not worth keeping.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.760
And I'm not just saying
that because I'm tired.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.130
So editing is really about
looking at the pieces

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.850
to see which ones
are worth keeping

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.190
and which ones are
not worth keeping.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.640
But as I said, the
bad bits are not

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:54.650
necessarily as obvious as this
scene was really poorly lit.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.500
Bless you.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.500
What you're really
looking for are things

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.015
that don't advance the video.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.069
And that is also not a
super tangible quality,

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:08.360
and I'm going to give you a
bunch of examples that will

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.740
hopefully help you understand
what is worth keeping and what

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.940
isn't.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.050
But to understand
that, you have to ask

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.780
yourself the basic question--
why should I keep this scene?

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.340
And this is a very seemingly
stupid and inane question,

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.070
but I didn't ask myself that
the first couple videos that we

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.780
edited for Science
Out Loud and it

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.660
made for a very painful
editing experience.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.280
So I'm going to
give you an example.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.320
We shot a video on
how engines work--

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.740
and I showed you guys
clips of that earlier.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.600
And we went out to a
horse farm in Acton.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.130
And it was kind of a drive, and
it was a little bit complicated

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.994
to get all that
set up, so I really

00:06:46.994 --> 00:06:49.160
wanted to get great footage
of the farm, and we did.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.450
We got awesome footage of
Luke with one of the horses.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.440
LUKE: We would need 230
horses, like AJ here,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.681
to power our Cessna.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:06.869
But we need 290,000 to
power our Boeing 777.

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:08.660
PROFESSOR: So it was
this really cool shot,

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.950
and it took us an
extra couple hours

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.640
to shoot with this horse, AJ.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.977
And we were talking
about horsepower,

00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:16.310
so that's why we had the visual.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.160
But in the context
of the rough cut,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.520
which I will show you
later on in this lecture--

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.910
it really didn't
make a lot of sense.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.960
It was just like, we're
learning about engines,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.030
and now here's all
this gratuitous B-roll

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.710
of a horse prancing around.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.260
And I think that
I was really set

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.890
on keeping it because
I had remembered

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.306
how much extra time it took
us and how much extra planning

00:07:36.306 --> 00:07:37.410
it took us.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.255
But when you go to the
edit-- when you shoot,

00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:42.630
you're going to
shoot like you're

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.640
going to keep everything.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.848
And what Chris was saying
about take multiple angles,

00:07:45.848 --> 00:07:48.500
take shots, take things that
you think you may not need.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.040
But when you edit, you
have no ties to anything.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.670
They are no longer
your darlings.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.210
You can kill any
of them, and really

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.970
have a discerning eye for that.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.200
So that's just quick
tip number one.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.470
When you edit, try to
see what's on the screen

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.040
and not so much
the circumstances

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.440
in which you got the material.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.420
So if you were really
tired that day,

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.110
don't think about
how much effort it

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:12.970
took for you to get that shot.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.340
And I will admit that
I partially showed you

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.080
that because it broke my
heart to take that out

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.190
and I just feel like it needs
to see the light of day.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.650
So like I said, most
people think about editing

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:30.690
as having a continuous linear
representation of an event.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.070
This is what Slideshow does.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.159
This is what
OpenCourseWare does.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.970
Like these lecture videos--
when you watch them online,

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.340
it's pretty much start
to end, nothing too fancy

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.049
edited in between.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:42.970
But remember that
there are lots of ways

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.180
that you can play with
this, either in the editing,

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.760
or in the scripting
and in the production.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.940
So you have continuous linear.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.980
Josh also talked about
this idea of In Medias

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.660
Res, which is starting
in the middle of things.

00:08:57.405 --> 00:08:59.405
I think it's a hard concept
to really understand

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:01.154
so I'm going to show
you an example of it.

00:09:01.154 --> 00:09:04.060
This is Lindsey's video
that we did in D-Lab.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.280
And the way we start
it is with an opening

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.220
that we revisit halfway
through the video again.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.910
LINDSEY: Corn husks burn
quickly and turn to ash.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.080
These lumps burn hot like
firewood, longer than charcoal,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.780
but are cleaner, greener,
and less expensive than both.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.770
This is actually made from this,
and I'm going to show you how.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.710
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.140
About 3 billion
people in the world

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.130
use charcoal today to heat
their homes and cook their food.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.270
But charcoal can be expensive.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.245
It produces a lot
of smoke when burned

00:09:47.245 --> 00:09:50.740
and it's made from wood, which
contributes to deforestation.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.555
In fact, 98% of Haiti's forests
have been cut down for fuel.

00:09:55.555 --> 00:09:58.160
What we need is an
alternative fuel source.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.395
Let's take a look at
how charcoal is made.

00:10:00.395 --> 00:10:03.070
We have to first cut down
trees for wood, which we then

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.300
place in a closed vessel
and deprive of oxygen.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.260
It carbonizes into charcoal
instead of burning to ash.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.870
We then mix the charcoal
with a binding solution

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.860
and compress that into
lumps called briquettes.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.840
This process creates
a fuel source that

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.322
works, but has its problems.

00:10:20.322 --> 00:10:22.530
So let's hack the charcoal
production process to make

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.370
everything about it better.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.730
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.555
Part of what makes the charcoal
production process so expensive

00:10:32.555 --> 00:10:33.720
is the equipment.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.560
Instead of a fancy
vessel, you can

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.192
make a simple kiln
out of an oil drum

00:10:37.192 --> 00:10:39.650
by cutting a large hole in the
top and several smaller ones

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.500
in the bottom.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.820
Gather a couple large rocks
for the kiln to rest on,

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.200
a lid for the top, and you
have yourself a $15 kiln.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.940
We also need some kind of tool
to mold the charcoal material

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.130
from the kiln into briquettes.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.615
This is one of D Lab's earlier
designs for the hand press.

00:10:56.615 --> 00:11:03.890
We pour a mixture of charcoal
and binder into the spout here,

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:13.120
hammer down the piston, slide
open the panel at the bottom,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.270
and the briquette
pops right out.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.525
This design costs about
$20 to manufacture,

00:11:17.525 --> 00:11:21.154
but the engineers at
D-Lab wanted to do better.

00:11:21.154 --> 00:11:22.570
They changed the
shape of the mold

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.242
into a square to make
it easier to manufacture

00:11:25.242 --> 00:11:28.670
and significantly cut down on
the amount of material used.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:34.870
This time, the mold itself is
used to scoop the charcoal.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.340
Again, we hammer the piston.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.940
And the briquette
pops right out.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.630
This design is easy
to manufacture.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.060
It creates briquettes faster
and it only costs about $2.00

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.439
to make.

00:11:52.439 --> 00:11:54.480
Now that we've made the
equipment less expensive,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.609
what can we do about
making the fuel cleaner?

00:11:56.609 --> 00:11:59.150
If we can get all the smoke to
burn off while the charcoal is

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.960
being made instead
of being used,

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.450
we can decrease
the amount of smoke

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.450
released in people's homes.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.530
Leaving the kiln open
for about five minutes

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.710
at the beginning of the
process will allow the smoke

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.440
to burn off outside.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.820
So that's why we cut a hole
in the top of the oil drum.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.260
All right, final challenge.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.239
What can we do to make
this fuel more sustainable?

00:12:18.239 --> 00:12:20.280
What if we replaced the
wood with something else?

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.150
Something like dried corn
husks, or dried corn puffs,

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.890
dried bean stocks, or
even dried banana peels?

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.380
These agricultural waste
products, or ag waste,

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.470
would normally be
discarded as trash.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.040
But we can use them to
make charcoal-- and poof!

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.130
Your trash becomes
a precious resource.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.160
And that's how you turn
trash into treasure.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.780
Less expensive, cleaner burning,
more sustainable, treasure.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.400
PROFESSOR: So in
watching this, it's

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.430
actually a little more
Bookend than In Medias Res,

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.892
but the concept is that you
open immediately with the thing

00:12:56.892 --> 00:12:58.850
that you're not going to
talk about until later

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.780
on in the video.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.887
And we could have opened
without her doing the,

00:13:04.887 --> 00:13:06.220
this is actually made from this.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.047
We could have just
opened with her at D-Lab

00:13:08.047 --> 00:13:09.130
and it would've been fine.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.075
It would've been the
continuous linear thing,

00:13:11.075 --> 00:13:12.450
but we kind of
used it as a hook.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.991
And I think a lot
of you are actually

00:13:13.991 --> 00:13:16.390
going with this format of
starting in the action.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.580
Julia's is kind of like this.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.260
Let's see, who else
kind of has-- sort

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.570
of in the middle of things?

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.740
I think Paul's is a
little bit like this, too.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.490
Just like you're in
the action immediately

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:32.448
without a bunch set up.

00:13:32.448 --> 00:13:34.890
So that is one
way you can do it.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.300
Again, this was a little
more of an example

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:42.220
of bookending stuff, too, which
is what Joshua's script does.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.450
Kenneth, yours does
this right now, too.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:50.480
Which is also a nice way to
encapsulate a video experience

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.870
in a tidy package.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.650
So sort of opening the
same way you close.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.250
For George's video on farts,
we did this quite literally.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.610
We had him in the
exact same location

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.370
and set that we
opened the video with.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:05.366
And that's how we did
my snot video as well.

00:14:05.366 --> 00:14:06.740
You don't have to
do it that way,

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.040
but it's a very explicit way
of bookending your video.

00:14:15.737 --> 00:14:17.320
GEORGE: You know
what's more like life

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.070
than a box of chocolates?

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:19.980
Farts.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.790
You really never know
what you're going to get.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:23.760
A skunk?

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.210
Rotten eggs?

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.190
PROFESSOR: And then-- oh, shoot.

00:14:29.991 --> 00:14:30.490
Uh-oh.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.700
I wanted to skip to
the end of the video,

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.430
so let me just do
that really quickly.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.370
So he opens in that location.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:55.310
And then--

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:00.940
GEORGE: We're at
the very beginning

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.085
of understanding the incredible,
smellable science in your gut.

00:15:04.085 --> 00:15:06.864
And until we do, happy farting.

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:09.708
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:12.432 --> 00:15:13.890
PROFESSOR: So that's
just something

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.460
to think about if you're
getting ready to film

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.930
and you're deciding on the
location of where you're going

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.290
to open and close your video.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:26.760
The other thing editing does
is it allows you to figure out

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.910
what's best to keep.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.220
So this is an example of
where cutting out the bad bits

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.090
isn't as obvious for us.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.130
In this section, it was
cutting out the bits

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.500
that don't work the best.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.090
So I showed you
guys this before,

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.550
but basically taking stills
of all of your scenes.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.100
And then seeing the shots in
the context of everything else

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.460
can help during editing as well.

00:15:49.334 --> 00:15:51.000
The next concept I
wanted to talk about,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.800
which is also in
Walter Murch's book--

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.850
is the idea of referred pain
when you're at the doctor.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.340
You go to the doctor and
you have shoulder pain--

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.960
or like elbow pain.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.090
And if your doctor
says, OK, we're

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.150
going to go in and
operate on your elbow,

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.490
then you should leave because
maybe this person is not

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.350
very good doctor.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.320
What a good doctor
would do is ask you

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.981
about what kinds of
activities you've been doing.

00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:14.980
He or she would check out
the rest of your body,

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.800
and then maybe find out that
the problem isn't your elbow,

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.270
but the problem is a pinched
nerve somewhere upstream.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.730
So this is the analogy he makes.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:22.970
Same thing with your videos.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.178
If you're finding that
there's a certain scene that's

00:16:25.178 --> 00:16:26.902
not working, most
of the time it will

00:16:26.902 --> 00:16:28.610
be because you need
to change that scene.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.640
But a lot of times, it may
be because you've set it up

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.690
in not the greatest way.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.750
Or maybe the scenes preceding
it don't make a lot of sense.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.520
So I will show you
an example of this.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.550
And this is super,
super nuanced,

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.960
and it might just be because
we were being super nit-picky

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.160
and getting really OCD about it.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:53.170
But this is a scene from the
fifth draft of Jamie's video.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.470
JAMIE: This Digi-Comp
has 31 switches

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.450
and can count up to 127.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.870
But modern computer chips
have over a billion switches.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.400
They're made from wafers,
such as this one, where

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.720
each square represents a chip.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.849
They're made from semiconductor
switches called transistors,

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.420
which have the advantage
of being solid state,

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.300
meaning they have
no moving parts.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.429
This allows engineers, like me,
to make them smaller, faster,

00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:20.440
and more energy efficient.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.359
We can make them
over a billion times

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:25.160
faster than the Digi-Comp.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.040
These semiconductor
switches make

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.420
modern electronics possible.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.460
PROFESSOR: So the whole
video is about how

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.610
big, complicated
machines, like computers,

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.485
are built out of actually very
simple parts, like a switch.

00:17:37.485 --> 00:17:40.449
And so the majority of his
video is with the Digi-Comp.

00:17:40.449 --> 00:17:42.740
And he's talking about how
the switches are calculating

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.781
in binary, and then at
the very end of the video,

00:17:44.781 --> 00:17:48.060
he goes, these switches are
what make modern electronics

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.230
possible, which is
true and it ties it

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:51.680
into the bigger context.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.540
But when we were watching
the rough cut, our editor

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.440
[INAUDIBLE] and
George and I were

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.150
all like-- we felt like
the ending came super

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.950
abruptly and seemed
a little bit random--

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.860
that we're talking about
basic switches the whole video

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.890
and then all of a sudden,
he's like, and that's

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:10.370
what makes things possible.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.000
So we thought about
re-recording the end,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.670
but then we realized--
and again, maybe this

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.760
is a personal taste thing.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.450
Maybe this video isn't actually
super different from the one

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.470
we ended up
publishing, but this is

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.210
an example of us troubleshooting
by looking at previous scenes

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.720
and how we set up
the final shot.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.720
And we felt that the
gap between him talking

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.610
about semiconductors, and
then his final sentence

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:38.080
was a little bit too short.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.750
So we thought maybe we could
make the pause a little bit

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:49.330
longer to signify that his final
shot is the encompassing idea.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.990
So that's what we did.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.650
JAMIE: Big the numbers can be.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:59.156
This Digi-Comp has 31 switches
and can count up to 127.

00:18:59.156 --> 00:19:03.030
But modern computer chips
have over a billion switches.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.540
They're made from wafers,
such as this one where

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.860
each square represents a chip.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.020
They're made from semiconductor
switches called transistors,

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.490
which have the advantage
of being solid state,

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.460
meaning they have
no moving parts.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.720
This allows engineers, like me,
to make them smaller, faster,

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.640
and more energy efficient.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.510
We can make them
over a billion times

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.500
faster than the Digi-Comp.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.400
These semiconductor
switches make

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.280
modern electronics possible.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.680
PROFESSOR: I mean, it's a
super, super nuanced thing.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.840
I'm not sure if you
guys noticed it,

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.020
or even if it was
worth us doing.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.160
But I wanted to show it as an
example of the thought process

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.594
that we had in troubleshooting
the final scene.

00:19:41.594 --> 00:19:43.260
And I think it makes
a little more sense

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.050
in the context of
watching the entire video,

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.591
but in the interest
of time, I didn't

00:19:46.591 --> 00:19:49.600
want to show you 10
minutes of the same video.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.975
Edits can change a
lot more than just

00:19:51.975 --> 00:19:53.100
taking out the bad, though.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.060
They can completely
restructure things.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.420
And I'll show you a little
bit from the rough cut

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.520
of the engines video.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.320
Someone was asking exactly
what a rough cut should be--

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.340
if we need everything
in there, if we don't.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.670
So this is an example of what
the first draft of a video

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:10.320
can look like.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.140
We're missing a couple scenes.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.340
A lot of things change.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.910
ABHI: Hundreds of
years ago, James Watt

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:21.080
decided that my friend, Helga,
could lift 550 pounds a foot

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.800
in the air in one second.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.010
And that's the definition
of a horsepower.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.870
LUKE: This lawn mower
has 6 horsepower.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:31.221
ABHI: This car has
110 horsepower.

00:20:31.221 --> 00:20:34.700
LUKE: This Cessna
has 230 horsepower.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:45.540
ABHI: And this jet
has 85,000 horsepower.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.930
LUKE: But they do it
in different ways.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.826
ABHI: A car uses
a piston engine.

00:20:49.826 --> 00:20:51.950
This is a piston engine
that's been cut into a half

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.502
so you can look into it.

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:55.710
A mixture of fuel and air
enters through these valves

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.740
into this metal cylinder.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.070
It's compressed when the
piston pushes up onto it,

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.000
and then this mixture is
burned through a spark plug,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.620
causing the mixture to expand.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.570
And the piston comes back down,
and this happens over and over

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.170
again.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.892
There are multiple
pistons in a car,

00:21:12.892 --> 00:21:14.975
and they're connected
through a series of linkages

00:21:14.975 --> 00:21:18.869
to the wheel,
causing them to turn.

00:21:18.869 --> 00:21:20.660
PROFESSOR: So I wanted
to show this example

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.330
to highlight that editing is
a super, super collaborative

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:25.020
process.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.210
So after you guys put
together your rough cuts

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.980
and we screen-- for the
second half of that class,

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.837
we'll randomly assign
you editing partners.

00:21:31.837 --> 00:21:33.670
And they're going to
look through your video

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:37.900
and annotate on a live
software that we have at MITx.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.250
The editor who put
together that rough cut

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.650
did not hate that
font as much as I did.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.340
And she did not hate that
music as much as I did.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.390
All right, so if you're the only
person looking at your video--

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:53.100
to this person, maybe they
really liked the style,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.400
they like the pacing of it.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.500
But to me, and to George, and to
the second editor that we had,

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.240
we often have multiple editors
look through our stuff,

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.930
even if one person's the
main one doing the editing.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:08.784
You get feedback that you
otherwise wouldn't have,

00:22:08.784 --> 00:22:10.200
which is a very
obvious statement,

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.500
but I want you to see how
much it changed by the end.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.600
I'll show you the opening again.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.180
ABHI: Hundreds of
years ago, James Watt

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:23.450
decided that my friend, Helga,
could lift 550 pounds a foot

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:26.710
in the air in one second.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.860
And that's the definition
of a horsepower.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.845
LUKE: This lawn mower
has 6 horsepower.

00:22:33.845 --> 00:22:36.888
ABHI: This car has
130 horsepower.

00:22:36.888 --> 00:22:39.233
LUKE: This Cessna
has 230 horsepower.

00:22:42.985 --> 00:22:46.430
ABHI: And this jet
has 85,000 horsepower.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.310
All of these engines
produce power

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.260
by forcing a mixture of fuel
and air into a tight space,

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.950
and then burning it.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.220
LUKE: But they do it
in different ways.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.480
ABHI: A car uses
a piston engine.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.720
This is a piston engine
that's been cut into a half

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.302
so you can look into it.

00:23:02.302 --> 00:23:04.510
A mixture of fuel and air
enters through these valves

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.510
into this metal cylinder.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.840
It's compressed when the
piston pushes up onto it,

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.800
and then mixture is burned
through a spark plug,

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.400
causing the mixture to expand.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.360
And the piston comes back down,
and this happens over and over

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.690
again.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.730
There are multiple
pistons in a car,

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:24.880
and they're connected
through a series of linkages

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.340
to the wheel,
causing them to turn.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.410
PROFESSOR: So we
changed a couple things,

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.440
changed out the music.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.369
I'm still not a huge
fan of it, but I

00:23:34.369 --> 00:23:36.660
thought it was a lot better
than what was there before.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:41.739
We added a couple labels,
put in some stock footage.

00:23:41.739 --> 00:23:43.280
I mean, to me, I
think the feel of it

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.700
changed a lot after having
the collaboration between four

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.830
or five of us.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:50.920
And that happens with
every video, too.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:55.690
I wanted to mention the five
words that you should never

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:58.700
say, which I often say, too--
but the notion of, we'll

00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.670
fix it in post.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.850
Like oh, the sound isn't
super great for this take,

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:03.930
but that's OK.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:06.440
I'll fix it in post-production.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.790
Thinking about
post is really good

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:13.460
to set you up for creating
as high quality materials

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.470
to work with as
you can possible.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:21.440
So really try not to lean on
post-production and editing

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.110
as a space where you will
have a bunch of band-aids

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.710
to cover up material
that isn't as good.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.480
You will save so,
so, so much time

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.450
doing just that extra take to
get the good audio than you

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:38.080
will if you tried to clean
it up in editing afterwards.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.250
So don't say these words.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.840
So we have to kill our darlings.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.240
We have to figure out what
things are worth keeping

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.220
and what aren't.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:55.850
What is the way that we
actually kill the pieces.

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:57.770
And that way is with the cut.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:01.360
So the cut is going to be
the spaces in which we decide

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.330
to break the
footage that we have

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:07.430
and align it with something
new-- a transition.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:11.950
Now this notion of seams
is an interesting one

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.730
when you're editing.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.610
A seam is basically
like when you

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:19.930
notice that the location changes
or that the scene changes.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:21.444
Being aware of
where your cuts are

00:25:21.444 --> 00:25:22.860
and what your
scenes look like are

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.193
going to be important for the
overall feel of the video.

00:25:25.193 --> 00:25:26.640
So in an earlier
lecture, I think

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.830
I'd mentioned storyboarding
is great because it gives you

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.950
a sense of what the visual
pacing of your video

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:33.060
is going to be.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.480
When you're doing
cuts in editing,

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.800
watch through
sections of a portion

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.350
that you've edited--
maybe 30 seconds of it,

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.985
and basically see how
many seams there are

00:25:42.985 --> 00:25:44.360
and if they're
really noticeable.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.430
What I personally
like-- this is my taste,

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.250
and I think it's the
taste of most people--

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.840
is that I think
your seam should be

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.900
as deliberate and
clean as possible

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.486
so that they're not
very noticeable.

00:25:59.486 --> 00:26:01.110
What you don't want
to end up happening

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.430
is someone to watch your video,
and notice every single time

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:05.340
you take a cut.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.770
You don't want their reaction
to be, oh, she cut there.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.760
Oh, she cut there too.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.540
And for that reason, I
favor just clean cuts.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.164
No funky transitions,
no ripple effects.

00:26:17.164 --> 00:26:18.830
Do you guys know what
I'm talking about?

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:19.810
No spins.

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:23.580
I think we did one
push transition

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.450
that I fought against.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.840
But that's my personal taste.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.610
But in general, the cut should
be as hidden as possible,

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:32.460
I think.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.597
Because that's not what
your video is about.

00:26:34.597 --> 00:26:35.930
Your video is about the content.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.138
It's not about the transitions
in between the scenes.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.440
When you do clean cuts, though,
especially for these videos,

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.470
it has to be deliberate enough
to where it makes sense.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.460
And I'll explain this further.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.890
So in this example--

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:56.930
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:01.347
-You can count up to 127.

00:27:01.347 --> 00:27:01.930
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.610
PROFESSOR: That is
the wrong example.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:04.110
Never mind.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.340
I'm not going to talk
about clean cuts.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.298
Apparently I'm going to
talk about transitions.

00:27:07.298 --> 00:27:09.370
So this is one transition
where something

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.040
that wasn't a clean cut
worked for us, I think.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.050
Because we were being a little
tongue-in-cheek about the wipe.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.970
The way we achieved
this is, George actually

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.170
loosened up his tripod.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.860
And when Jamie was in Stata,
at the end of his shot,

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.920
he just flung the tripod up
so that the camera actually

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.460
swung up.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.890
And then we used that to move
into the transition effect that

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.030
was in Final Cut.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.930
It just makes the video
look a little more

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.720
clean and deliberate, I think.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.630
Otherwise, you have
still frame, wipe up,

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:41.930
wipe down, to still frame.

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:45.080
It looks a little bit different.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.680
What was I going to talk about?

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.880
So yes, sometimes it's
OK not to use clean cuts.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.941
This is another example.

00:27:52.941 --> 00:27:53.607
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:53.607 --> 00:27:57.360
[TICKING]

00:28:13.563 --> 00:28:17.469
[BEEPING]

00:28:17.469 --> 00:28:19.510
PROFESSOR: All those were
clean cuts, by the way.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.190
-Radiation is frightening.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:27.330
At least, certain
types of it are.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:30.060
My Geiger counter doesn't
go off near my mobile phone,

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.320
or the Wi-Fi router,
or my microwave.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.880
That's because a
Geiger counter only

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.150
measures ionizing
radiation, that

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:40.090
is, radiation with enough energy
to rip electrons off atoms.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.630
And it's measured in
units called sieverts.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.550
If you're exposed to more
than two sieverts all at once,

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:48.059
you'll probably die
shortly after that.

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:50.350
But we're exposed to low
levels of ionizing radiation--

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.510
[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:51.760
PROFESSOR: So that was a wipe.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.310
But I don't feel like that's
super cheesy, because he only

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.860
uses it very sparingly.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.000
Did you notice how
many cuts there were

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.250
in that 30 seconds of clip?

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.780
He must have cut 20 times.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.320
But as a viewer, I'm not
noticing, oh, he cut there,

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.460
oh, he cut there, oh,
he cut there, right?

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.584
So that's what I mean by
keeping your seams hidden.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.280
Yes.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.317
AUDIENCE: In a way,
it seems intuitive.

00:29:17.317 --> 00:29:19.150
But when you're editing,
and you're looking,

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:21.280
and you're cringing
at your own speech,

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.922
it's a practice that
you might want to do.

00:29:23.922 --> 00:29:26.190
You never cut in the
middle of a phrase,

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.544
or in the middle
of your talking.

00:29:28.544 --> 00:29:30.710
Because that's really
jarring, like seeing your head

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.210
in one place, and
then seeing your head

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:33.250
in a slightly different place.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:34.374
It's always really jarring.

00:29:34.374 --> 00:29:37.070
But whenever he cut,
he cut to something

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.330
that was other than his face.

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.870
When he was walking through
with the Geiger counter,

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:46.880
he was cutting to different
angles of that same shot.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.830
Or when he was just
talking to the camera,

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.980
he cut away from his face,
and then cut back to it.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:55.960
So you don't see a little twitch
where he was saying one phrase

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.860
and he did another take, and
he was in a different spot.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.350
It's something you don't
notice until you actually

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:03.565
get into the editing process.

00:30:03.565 --> 00:30:05.190
And you see, whoa,
that's really weird.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:07.190
But it's something
good to keep in mind.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:12.490
So if you aren't going to
finish a two sentence phrase,

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:14.600
think of a way to
transition between that,

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.654
rather than just doing
a hard cut between them,

00:30:16.654 --> 00:30:17.460
because it won't look clean.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:18.710
PROFESSOR: I have
some examples of that,

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:19.596
that I was going to show you.

00:30:19.596 --> 00:30:21.020
But that's a super,
super important point.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:21.845
Yes, Joshua.

00:30:21.845 --> 00:30:25.310
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to say a sentence,

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:28.280
but I remember the plans video.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.750
What did they have in
common, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:32.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:36.790
So for that, we
are jumping ahead.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:39.311
I have this one slide, and
then I'm going to get to it,

00:30:39.311 --> 00:30:39.810
I promise.

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.930
So this is going
off of the whole

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.810
hide your seams type of thing.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.640
I like to keep
labels really simple.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:49.214
Sometimes you'll have
a need to label things.

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:51.130
Again, this may be a
matter of personal taste.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:55.250
But I think the cleaner the
labels are-- no funky Word Art,

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.520
I think those other things
look a little amateurish.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:04.140
If it's good content, it doesn't
need the frills, necessarily,

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.940
to be engaging.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:11.025
So you were asking, cutting,
how do you do the thing

00:31:11.025 --> 00:31:12.620
that Sari was saying?

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.340
For plants, we had
her really close up

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.440
for the beginning, right?

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.731
And then she goes, what do
all these chemical compounds

00:31:18.731 --> 00:31:19.390
have in common?

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.110
And then we cut out to her
really wide, with her saying,

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.090
plants.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:24.480
Right?

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.930
So that is an example of
making your cuts deliberate.

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:31.500
You want to cut
between two scenes that

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:35.670
look different enough, to where
the cut looks intentional.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:39.174
So this is an example
from Jamie's video,

00:31:39.174 --> 00:31:40.590
and I think this
is the right one.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.970
[VIDEO  PLAYBACK]

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:42.386
-Even though we
think of computers

00:31:42.386 --> 00:31:45.780
as super complicated high-tech
machines with very tiny parts,

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.440
they can also be huge,
wooden, and mechanical,

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.154
just like this computer here.

00:31:50.154 --> 00:31:51.070
And even though they--

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:51.800
[END PLAYBACK]

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.150
PROFESSOR: So right there,
I think in that take,

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:56.360
he messed up.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.222
Or he took too long of a
pause in between the two words

00:31:59.222 --> 00:32:00.180
that he was delivering.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.004
So we wanted to
cut that pause out.

00:32:02.004 --> 00:32:03.420
But it would have
been weird if we

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.270
just cut that
pause out, and then

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:07.540
didn't do anything
else to the footage.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.530
So basically, he would have
been like, computers, blah blah

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:11.357
blah.

00:32:11.357 --> 00:32:13.440
And then he would have
moved slightly to the left.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.140
And then you would have
seen him keep talking.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.450
Do you guys know what I mean?

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.150
I'll show you an example.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:23.000
So to get around that, we had
his first part of the sentence

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.630
delivered the way we filmed it.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.910
And then when we cut, we cut
to a digital zoom of him.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:29.550
So he was a lot more close up.

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.580
And that's what Hank Green
does a lot in SciShow.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.720
He cuts back and forth,
between a wide shot

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.220
and a close up shot, to make
the cuts a little less jarring.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.604
I'll just show you the example.

00:32:41.604 --> 00:32:42.270
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:45.277
-What it is the most
awesome place in the world?

00:32:45.277 --> 00:32:47.610
Seems like that would be
pretty much the most subjective

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:48.670
question ever.

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:51.940
But this week, scientists use
a set of objective criteria

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.310
to come up with a list of
the world's most biologically

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:56.540
important places.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.937
There might be one near you.

00:32:57.937 --> 00:32:58.520
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:03.260
PROFESSOR: He also cuts at the
ends of phrases and sentences.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.010
So it would feel a
little bit more awkward

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:08.120
if he was cutting in
between, this is my sentence.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.710
And then he cut to
a close up, and I'm

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:12.682
going to keep
talking about this.

00:33:12.682 --> 00:33:14.140
And then he didn't
cut, and he just

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.840
kept talking about
the next idea.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.200
And then he cut back
to this wide shot.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.290
So again, when you're filming
and you mess up, keep going.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:27.440
But try to do as many continuous
thought takes as possible.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.950
Because again, don't say,
I'm going to fix it in post.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.366
Because sometimes you're going
to look at it, and be like,

00:33:32.366 --> 00:33:33.820
there's no way around this.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:38.710
It's OK if you can't get
an entire scene perfect.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:40.730
But at least try to get
chunks of sentences,

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.430
or chunks of thoughts
continuously,

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.070
because that'll be a lot
easier to work with in post.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.720
So this is the pitch that
I recorded for you guys.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.540
And I made it this
way because I wanted

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.336
to show you that it does
look weird when you don't cut

00:33:58.336 --> 00:33:59.585
to something different enough.

-When we think of
snot, we usually

00:34:01.276 --> 00:34:02.880
think of the stuff
that oozes out

of us when we're sick, right?

that we seem to excrete
for whatever reason.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.510
But snot is more
than just the stuff

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.690
that hangs out of the noses
of most two-year-olds,

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:17.118
and some 20-year-olds.

from fighting
infection, to keeping

00:34:21.574 --> 00:34:23.449
your esophagus from
ripping up every time you

try to eat something.

And that junk actually can
keep stuff out of your body.

And then it knows what to
keep out, what to let in,

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:34.050
and when to do it all.

That's just kind
of the style of it.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:53.090
You're centered,
which is also breaking

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.250
a rule of framing in thirds.

00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:00.390
So stylistically, I think it's
more acceptable in YouTube

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:02.350
webcam videos.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:04.820
But for these, it will
look out of place.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.320
Because you have like a
very formalized script,

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.670
and it's going to jar with
a very amateurish style

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:11.499
of editing.

00:35:11.499 --> 00:35:12.790
Does that make sense to people?

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:14.690
AUDIENCE: When you did
that, did you actually

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:16.106
have it in your
head that you were

00:35:16.106 --> 00:35:17.851
going to cut to those
spots, or was it

00:35:17.851 --> 00:35:20.740
just what you put together
after you had everything?

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.170
PROFESSOR: So I did that in
one long continuous take.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:27.670
I just hit Photo Booth on Mac
and I said my whole thing.

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:30.610
And there were lots of spots
where I'd messed up in between.

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:33.290
So I did the style of
editing that I first

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:36.860
talked about, which is just
cutting out the bad bits.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.030
So I wasn't
intentionally doing that.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:43.240
But that's why the movements
are just a little off-kilter.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.890
I'm not trying to
move or anything.

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:47.300
It's just that I
move when I talk.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.680
But it reads a little
bit weird and jarring.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.360
AUDIENCE: And you'd
recommend just leaving record

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:56.990
on for however long it takes?

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:59.220
Like in between scenes, maybe?

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.644
PROFESSOR: I personally have
a really hard time remembering

00:36:02.644 --> 00:36:03.560
what I'm going to say.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:07.540
So I would feel better,
when I was shooting,

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:11.770
if I knew that I only have to
say two or three sentences.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:15.360
But when you record, always
record the preceding sentence,

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.280
and the sentence that
comes after the one

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.650
that you're trying to record.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:22.170
Because your intonation
will sound different.

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.830
Otherwise, every single
sentence will sound like this.

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:26.560
It will sound like
you are talking

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.980
in the same style of sentence.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.646
It will sound like
you were just reading

00:36:29.646 --> 00:36:30.760
a bunch of bullet points.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.830
So that's why, if
you're shooting scene 2,

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:37.310
shoot the last
sentence of scene 1,

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:39.700
and the second
sentence of scene 2.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.800
Make sense?

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.870
And so this is also from
Walter Murch's book.

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:47.550
But this is sort of a
tongue-in-cheek thing.

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:51.000
Thing But he talks about what
makes a good cut, and the order

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.850
of priority.

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:56.400
A cut that maintains
the emotion of the scene

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.080
is something that's
really important.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.930
Which sounds very strange.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:05.340
But if you have, say,
a very dramatic scene,

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.940
with two people, like Sari and
I are getting into an argument,

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:08.517
right?

00:37:08.517 --> 00:37:10.350
And we have the camera
that's focused on me,

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:11.808
and a camera that's
focused on her.

00:37:11.808 --> 00:37:13.540
And you want to show both of us.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:17.590
So actually, you would show
Sari getting all mad at me.

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:19.570
And then you'd show me
getting all mad at her.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.350
Maybe you'd show her again.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:24.391
If you did super rapid cuts
of her and me, back and forth,

00:37:24.391 --> 00:37:25.890
back and forth,
back and forth, it's

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:28.290
going to read kind
of funny, right?

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.640
It'll read like Western parody.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.030
You guys know what I mean?

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:37.740
But if you wanted to highlight
the gravitas of the situation,

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.560
you would cut from her
face to maybe a wide shot

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.430
of the two of us.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:44.280
And you wouldn't make
the cuts as rapid.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.944
Does that make sense to people?

00:37:45.944 --> 00:37:47.860
So I think that's what
he means by maintaining

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:49.650
the emotion of a cut.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:52.650
I think for the
purposes of your video,

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:54.640
the main thing will
be just making sure

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:59.610
that the cuts aren't happening
too rapidly, or too slowly.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.000
I think you'll know.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.600
You'll watch the
thing, and you'll

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.830
feel like something's
a little off kilter.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.610
And if that's the
case, I would encourage

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:09.460
you to adjust how long
you're making the clips,

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:14.350
and how much dead space you're
leaving it between the clips.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:15.574
This is a way to inject--

00:38:15.574 --> 00:38:16.240
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.902
-OK, so this might
be we our weak point.

00:38:18.902 --> 00:38:20.264
Or is it?

00:38:20.264 --> 00:38:21.380
[END PLAYBACK]

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.140
PROFESSOR: So that's not a cut.

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.910
But that was a type of
zoom that is emotionally

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:27.580
appropriate for this
scene, because it's

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:28.740
trying to be funny.

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:33.680
But if you did that for you
talking about cargo ships

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.400
not sinking carrying
lots of people,

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:39.570
it would be totally
inappropriate, right?

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:42.740
The other thing he talks about
is, does it advance the story?

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.700
And I will show you
an example of this.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.680
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.506
-And all those bacteria
care about is staying alive.

00:38:49.506 --> 00:38:50.880
Our intestine
actually helps them

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.265
do that, because the temperature
is warm and constant.

00:38:53.265 --> 00:38:54.890
They're sheltered
from the environment.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:58.767
And best of all, we
provide the food.

00:38:58.767 --> 00:38:59.350
[END PLAYBACK]

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:02.620
PROFESSOR: So does
anyone want to guess

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.770
how that particular
cut advanced the story?

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:09.226
Or did you notice
where the cut was?

00:39:09.226 --> 00:39:12.204
AUDIENCE: Can you show it again?

00:39:12.204 --> 00:39:12.870
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:13.920
So try to pay attention
to where the cut happens.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.586
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:14.586 --> 00:39:16.735
-All those bacteria care
about is staying alive.

00:39:16.735 --> 00:39:18.110
Our intestine
actually helps them

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:20.585
do that, because the temperature
is warm and constant.

00:39:20.585 --> 00:39:22.210
They're sheltered
from the environment.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.040
And best of all, we
provide the food.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.360
[END PLAYBACK]

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.443
PROFESSOR: So there are
actually two cuts in this.

00:39:28.443 --> 00:39:30.370
But the first cut
is of him walking.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:31.880
He's like, and best of all.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.250
And then it cuts to him
arriving to the place where

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.420
he was walking.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:39.380
So in those five
seconds or so, the story

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.780
was about George walking
to the hood to do his demo.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.990
That sounds like a dumb
story, but that's essentially

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:48.340
what the story of those
five seconds were.

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.522
So a cut that often
works is, if you're

00:39:50.522 --> 00:39:52.230
doing like a walk and
talk, for instance,

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.840
and you're saying
blah blah blah.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.000
Navy ships, people might sink.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.090
And then you cut to the person
arriving at their station,

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.040
like where the boats
or whatever are.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.400
Does that make sense to people?

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.648
AUDIENCE: So how do you
ensure that your voice doesn't

00:40:07.648 --> 00:40:10.040
sound funny?

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.630
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
like if your delivery

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.732
of the sentence
in one location is

00:40:13.732 --> 00:40:14.940
too different from the other.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.160
AUDIENCE: Do you remember how
you spoke it in the shoot?

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.720
PROFESSOR: So to shoot
that scene, for instance,

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.490
he would say, we shelter them.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:25.392
And best of all--
we didn't cut there.

00:40:25.392 --> 00:40:27.850
We made him finish the line,
when he's saying, best of all,

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:28.750
we provide the food.

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:31.280
And we took a complete cut
of him walking and saying

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.400
the whole line.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:37.730
And then, when we shot the part
of him walking toward the hood,

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:39.885
it wasn't like we
said action, and he

00:40:39.885 --> 00:40:41.690
said, we provide the food.

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:44.500
We said action, and he
says, and best of all

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.970
we provide the food.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:51.750
So that's what I mean by,
say the lines that precede

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:55.727
and follow the line that you're
actually trying to capture.

00:40:55.727 --> 00:40:57.060
AUDIENCE: And do multiple takes.

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:57.685
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:40:57.685 --> 00:40:59.724
AUDIENCE: And say
the line a little bit

00:40:59.724 --> 00:41:00.640
differently each time.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.785
Because maybe you'll
find that your third take

00:41:02.785 --> 00:41:05.062
for the initial shot,
and your second take

00:41:05.062 --> 00:41:07.582
for your second shot,
are the most cohesive.

00:41:07.582 --> 00:41:09.290
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
very good advice.

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:13.710
And as the directing partner
of whoever you're shooting,

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:17.510
this is the thing that you need
to do to help your partner.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:20.840
If you notice that their
delivery in the second location

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.579
is a lot more subdued
and tired, which

00:41:22.579 --> 00:41:25.120
is going to be the tendency for
most people, you can be like,

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.860
you said that the
beginning of that line

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.109
really energetically when
we were in that other place,

00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:31.644
so you need to match that.

00:41:31.644 --> 00:41:35.780
AUDIENCE: Even if you do
the take right, do it again.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.815
It's really easy to say, oh
I did it right this time,

00:41:38.815 --> 00:41:40.480
I'm done.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.480
I memorized my lines.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:44.010
But even if it's that struggle
to remember the last word

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:45.850
in the sentence,
it's worth it to get

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:49.294
another complete usable take
rather than be stuck with one.

00:41:49.294 --> 00:41:51.710
PROFESSOR: And you're going
to have to work within reason.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:54.550
Obviously you're not going
to do 100 takes of each scene

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:56.310
perfectly.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.700
So this is up to your
discretion, and the amount

00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.960
of time that you have.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.795
But I would say, at least
try to get three good takes.

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:09.470
I lost my train of
thought completely,

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:10.970
but that was a very
important point.

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:12.590
Thank you.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:15.520
And then the other
stuff is rhythm.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.260
And this is what I mean by
if your cuts are too rapid.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.010
Oh, I remembered what
I was going to say.

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:23.250
Sorry, I'm going all
over the place today.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:26.390
So in the engines video,
that was the latest night

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:27.250
that we had worked.

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:30.470
I think I got home at 3:00
in the morning that day.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:34.630
And at the end of the night,
obviously the two talents,

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.770
their energy levels
were super depleted.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:38.640
And so that's what we
ended up re-shooting.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.160
And that's what
re-shoots are for.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.750
Even if you end up getting
all the shots that you need,

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:45.999
oftentimes you won't notice that
someone's delivery was really

00:42:45.999 --> 00:42:47.790
different until you're
in the editing room,

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:49.870
and you cut everything together.

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:52.180
So that's why I wanted to
leave some room for you guys

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.950
have time to re-shoot
if you needed to.

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:58.690
I don't anticipate that
you're going to not

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:00.830
get shots that you need to get.

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:03.570
But that buffer room, we
always use it for Science

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:06.236
Out Loud, regardless of
how perfect the host is.

00:43:06.236 --> 00:43:07.777
Just because stuff
like that happens.

00:43:10.384 --> 00:43:11.050
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:14.300
-This rock can absorb heat
from the sun during the day,

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:18.370
and then release that heat hours
later, after the sun has set.

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:20.720
This is fine when you're
dealing with rocks in the sun,

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.060
but unfortunately it also
happens with bodies of water

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.500
and toxins.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.450
Rivers, lakes, streams,
and oceans are still

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.020
releasing contaminants
that we dumped

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.870
into them up to 100 years ago.

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:35.770
From 1947 to 1977, humans
dumped hundreds of thousands

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:37.710
of pounds of
polychlorinated biphenyls

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:40.230
into the Hudson River.

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:43.590
Those PCBs attach themselves to
sediment particles and settle

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:44.280
to the bottom.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.680
[END PLAYBACK]

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.630
PROFESSOR: So for that
video, we had a sense,

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:53.319
when we saw the rough cut, that
it was kind of a frantic video.

00:43:53.319 --> 00:43:55.360
There's a lot of information
being thrown at you.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.110
I'm not really following,
even though I've

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:59.140
helped her edit the script.

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.510
If I'm tuning out,
then the audience

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:03.220
is probably going to tune out.

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:05.510
So rhythmically,
the cuts maybe were

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.520
happening a little too fast.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.320
And she's also, in real life,
a naturally fast talker.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.170
We had to slow her down a lot.

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:15.470
But she's just an
animated person.

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:17.270
So we knew that the
tendency of this video

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.940
is going to just feel
super, super fast.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.880
And if you are
naturally a fast talker,

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.710
this is something
to keep in mind,

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:27.060
that you can help the
pacing, and the franticness,

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:30.500
of maybe how you might read,
with how you cut the scenes.

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:34.400
So what we did instead was,
we allowed for a lot of time

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.920
in between her scenes to
fill with B-roll or music.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.270
We tried to make the cuts not
happen as rapidly, basically.

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:43.890
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:49.580
-This rock can absorb heat

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:53.320
and then release it hours

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.650
This is fine when you're
dealing with rocks in the sun,

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:57.990
but unfortunately it also
happens with bodies of water

00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:59.880
and toxins.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.850
Rivers, lakes, streams,
and oceans are still

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:03.420
releasing contaminants
that we dumped

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.580
into them up to 100 years ago.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:10.470
From 1947 to 1977, humans
dumped hundreds of thousands

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.410
of pounds of
polychlorinated biphenyls

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:13.410
into the Hudson River.

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.730
[END PLAYBACK]

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:17.320
PROFESSOR: So again, it's a
super, super nuanced thing.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.060
I think the music
helped with it a lot.

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:22.460
We tried to use very calm music.

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:26.330
We used a still of that
old photograph of people

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:28.710
cleaning up the Hudson
River, just to break up

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:31.510
how many times we were changing
back and forth between all

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:32.530
the locations.

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:33.841
Is this making sense to people?

00:45:33.841 --> 00:45:35.340
Sometimes I feel
like I'm saying it.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.756
And then I watch it, and I'm
like, that doesn't look super

00:45:37.756 --> 00:45:39.970
different from the rough cut.

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:42.459
But it helped me
sleep that night.

00:45:42.459 --> 00:45:44.250
And this is the other
stuff he talks about,

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:47.970
which is not as important.

00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:49.750
But the eye trace,
like does it make

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:53.360
sense for the audience's focus
of interest within the frame?

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.900
So are you cutting
from something

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.870
where you're in the top
corner, to all of a sudden,

00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:59.780
you're cutting to
something in the middle,

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.430
centered, to all of a sudden,
you're cutting to something

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:02.840
where you're on the left side?

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.635
Are you cutting so rapidly,
and changing your position,

00:46:05.635 --> 00:46:08.850
to where it's not making
sense to the viewer?

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.690
The 2D plan on screen,
are you are you

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:13.110
consistent with the
stage line, basically?

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:16.700
So I don't think this is going
to be as relevant for you guys.

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.424
But if someone's
walking, for example,

00:46:18.424 --> 00:46:20.590
and then you cut to a scene
where they're continuing

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:23.750
to walk, but they're in
the corner of the screen,

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:25.950
then it doesn't
make as much sense.

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:27.850
And then the 3D space of action.

00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:31.330
If you have multiple
people in the same room,

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:34.180
or multiple objects, and
you cut from one angle

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.780
to another angle, make
sure the objects are still

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:40.760
the same relationship
to each other.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.360
And the reason why
he lists this out

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:49.290
is, Walter Murch's theory
is, you should never

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:51.745
compromise emotion before
you would compromise

00:46:51.745 --> 00:46:53.750
the eye trace with a cut.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:56.207
So if a cut satisfies
the eye trace,

00:46:56.207 --> 00:46:57.790
but it doesn't make
sense emotionally,

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.430
then you shouldn't do it.

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:03.540
Practically speaking, I
think what this translates

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:06.380
for you guys, is that
if something feels weird

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:09.550
when you see the rough cut of
your video, most of the time,

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:12.620
it will be because you
cut it in a weird place.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:16.040
You either cut your
speech too short,

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:20.750
or you didn't cut to a wide
enough shot from a close up.

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:25.510
You are cutting too much, too
quickly, or not cutting enough.

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:26.720
Does that make sense?

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.660
I'm going to talk a
little bit about music,

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:36.480
and some of the Creative
Commons resources

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.820
that will be available to you,
if you want to use footage

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.900
that you don't have access to.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.404
Before I go into
that, does anyone

00:47:43.404 --> 00:47:44.945
have further questions
about editing?

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:50.540
Sari is good with Adobe, right?

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:51.411
You use Premier?

00:47:51.411 --> 00:47:52.702
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I used Premier.

00:47:52.702 --> 00:47:57.121
I used iMovie before that,
so just give them those.

00:47:57.121 --> 00:48:00.346
Final Cut Pro, I
haven't looked at it,

00:48:00.346 --> 00:48:03.334
but professional editing
softwares usually

00:48:03.334 --> 00:48:05.279
have some weird rules.

00:48:05.279 --> 00:48:06.820
So, if that's what
you choose to use,

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.808
I can definitely go and
work in the computer lab

00:48:09.808 --> 00:48:10.820
and figure it out.

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:13.770
PROFESSOR: So Building
26, I'll show you

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:15.295
at the end of class the website.

00:48:15.295 --> 00:48:18.400
But I've reserved it for the
rest of this class period,

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.870
and it has all the software
on it if you want to use it.

00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:25.620
I have used Final Cut Pro
and Final Cut Express.

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.910
I'm not super, super
good at it, though.

00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:31.590
But in the remaining class
time, when you basically

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:33.560
have time to work
on your projects,

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:36.630
we will be around if you want to
schedule a certain time to work

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:38.619
on a particular problem
that you're having

00:48:38.619 --> 00:48:39.660
in your editing software.

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:40.880
Just come talk to us.

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:44.140
All the tutorials for a
bunch of these software,

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:46.890
they're all listed
on the syllabus.

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:51.860
So when it comes to music,
it's a bit like lighting,

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:52.580
as Chris said.

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:54.120
First, do no harm.

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:58.720
So I would much prefer a
video that does not have music

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:02.660
to a video that has music
that is super distracting,

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:07.110
or an entirely different tone
from the video that you're

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:08.820
trying to convey.

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:10.150
So be careful with music.

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:12.150
But music is a really,
really great tool,

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:15.560
because I think it
establishes emotion

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:20.090
better than any other tool that
you have in your video kit.

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:21.629
That's my opinion.

00:49:21.629 --> 00:49:22.920
I'll show you an example of it.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:25.862
Do you guys remember the
video of Neil deGrasse Tyson

00:49:25.862 --> 00:49:27.320
that I showed you
on the first day?

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:27.670
The 10 questions?

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:28.370
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:31.249
-What is the most astounding
fact you can share with us

00:49:31.249 --> 00:49:32.040
about the universe?

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:38.570
-The most astounding fact,
the most astounding fact,

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:43.880
is the knowledge
that the atoms that

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:48.250
comprise life on earth,
the atoms that make up

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:54.480
the human body, are traceable
to the crucibles that

00:49:54.480 --> 00:50:00.930
cooked light elements into
heavy elements in their core.

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:03.070
Under extreme temperatures
and pressures,

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:06.980
these stars, the high
mass ones among them,

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:10.460
went unstable in
their later years.

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.160
They collapsed,
and then exploded,

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.640
scattering their enriched
guts across the galaxy.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:23.200
Guts made of carbon
nitrogen, oxygen,

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.240
and all the fundamental
ingredients of life itself.

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.390
These ingredients become
part of gas clouds

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:33.650
that condense, collapse,
form the next generation

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:36.660
of solar systems, stars
with orbiting planets.

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:40.490
And those planets now have the
ingredients for life itself.

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:45.830
So that when I look
up at the night sky,

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:50.870
and I know that yes, we
are part of this universe,

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:53.890
we are in this universe.

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:57.850
But perhaps more important
than both of those facts,

00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:01.470
is that the universe is in us.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:05.350
When I reflect on
that fact, I look up.

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:07.280
Many people feel small,
because they're small,

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.280
and the universe is big.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:14.730
But I feel big, because my
atoms came from those stars.

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:17.570
[END PLAYBACK]

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:21.980
PROFESSOR: So this video
is effective for a couple

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:22.970
of different reasons.

00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:24.540
You feel like you're
sitting there with him.

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.081
You feel like you're
the person who's

00:51:26.081 --> 00:51:29.620
sitting in the third chair,
watching an interview happen.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.230
Say what you will about
Neil deGrasse Tyson,

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:34.450
but he's a very
engaging speaker.

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:38.330
And I think that this video
encapsulates the wonder

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:41.200
that he has for astrophysics.

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.140
I'm going to show you
another video that took

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:45.530
the audio from this interview.

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:50.680
And this user Max
Schlickenmeyer put together

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:56.149
a fan video that
highlights certain elements

00:51:56.149 --> 00:51:57.940
of this experience in
a very different way.

00:52:00.664 --> 00:52:01.330
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:04.309
-What is the most astounding
fact you can share with us

00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:05.100
about the universe?

00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:10.390
-The most astounding fact.

00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:15.520
The most astounding
fact is the knowledge

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:21.210
that the atoms that comprise
life on earth, the atoms that

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:27.790
make up the human body, are
traceable to the crucibles that

00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:34.190
cooked light elements into
heavy elements in their core.

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:36.330
Under extreme temperatures
and pressures,

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:40.260
these stars, the high
mass ones among them,

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:43.730
went unstable in
their later years.

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:45.420
They collapsed,
and then exploded,

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:50.930
scattering their enriched
guts across the galaxy.

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:56.520
Guts made of carbon,
nitrogen, oxygen,

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.500
and all the fundamental
ingredients of life itself.

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.670
These ingredients become
part of gas clouds

00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:06.990
that condense, collapse,
form the next generation

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:09.930
of solar systems, stars
with orbiting planets.

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:13.442
And those planets now have the
ingredients for life itself.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.100
So that when I look
up at the night sky,

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:24.150
and I know that yes, we
are part of this universe,

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:27.170
we are in this universe.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:29.750
But perhaps more important
than both of those

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:34.750
facts is that the
universe is in us.

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:38.516
When I reflect on
that fact, I look up.

00:53:38.516 --> 00:53:40.390
Many people feel small,
because they're small

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:43.470
and the universe is big.

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:49.450
Because my atoms came
from those stars.

00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:51.690
There's a level of connectivity.

00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:53.190
That's really what
you want in life.

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:55.335
You want to feel connected,
want to feel relevant.

00:53:55.335 --> 00:53:59.982
You want to feel like
you're a participant

00:53:59.982 --> 00:54:03.720
in the goings-on of activities
and events around you.

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.817
That's precisely what we
are, just by being alive.

00:54:05.817 --> 00:54:06.400
[END PLAYBACK]

00:54:08.477 --> 00:54:10.560
PROFESSOR: So, a very
different experience, right?

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.450
And did you recognize that song?

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:15.070
AUDIENCE: I don't,
but I thought it

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:16.570
was particularly
terrible when there

00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:18.660
was a different set of words.

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:19.500
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.580
So we won't question
the scientific accuracy

00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:23.340
of the video that he made.

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:24.360
And my mom watched it.

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.540
And she was like, Elizabeth,
this is super cheesy.

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:29.650
But it elicits emotion, right?

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:31.620
It's a very
different experience.

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:33.640
I also wanted to
point out, how would

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:37.450
it have felt if all
the images Max used

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:43.130
were bombarding you with
cut, cut, cut, cut, universe,

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:46.840
microbes, a tree of life, right?

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.340
Would that have been emotionally
appropriate for this video?

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:49.850
No.

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:50.766
So that's what I mean.

00:54:50.766 --> 00:54:54.010
Visual pacing can change
the emotion of a video.

00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:01.480
Music, when intentionally
done, can be very effective.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:06.930
And when I look at seven or
eight Science Out Loud videos,

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:09.612
it usually takes me about a
week to get the music for it.

00:55:09.612 --> 00:55:11.070
It's actually super
time-consuming.

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:17.330
I'll basically take you through
two or three episodes where

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:20.230
I looked for music, and
did a soundtrack for it,

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:22.620
and sort of the
workflow that I had,

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:25.070
and the reasoning behind
why I chose what I did.

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.720
Any comments so far, questions?

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:34.760
Everyone's OK?

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:38.790
So, the farts video.

00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:41.110
George was very adamant
that he didn't want

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:43.490
this to read like dad humor.

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:45.850
So I wanted to put a
bunch of fart jokes in it.

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:47.837
He was like, Elizabeth,
I'm not doing that.

00:55:47.837 --> 00:55:48.670
That's not who I am.

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:49.759
That's not me.

00:55:49.759 --> 00:55:51.300
And I was like, OK,
I recognize that.

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:52.966
I recognize that I'm
a different person.

00:55:55.090 --> 00:55:57.460
So he gave his
delivery very straight.

00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.370
He gave it very dry.

00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:01.060
He didn't make it
very outrageous.

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:02.295
This is farts, without music.

00:56:02.295 --> 00:56:02.961
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:56:02.961 --> 00:56:05.450
-You know what's more like
life than a box of chocolates?

00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:06.360
Farts.

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.702
You really never know
what you're going to get.

00:56:08.702 --> 00:56:13.120
Skunk, rotten eggs, garbage
dumpster-- the possibilities

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.140
are, unfortunately, endless.

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:17.590
But why do we fart, and how
does your body make so many

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:18.790
different smells?

00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:20.060
The answer is fermentation.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.320
This is a giant bioreactor.

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.690
It's also called a fermenter.

00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:38.770
And in here, a fungus
known as brewer's yeast

00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:41.720
is transforming water and
dead plants into beer.

00:56:45.927 --> 00:56:46.510
[END PLAYBACK]

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:48.301
PROFESSOR: So it feels
really weird, right?

00:56:48.301 --> 00:56:51.750
And part of it is that
you don't necessarily

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:53.860
use the audio that you
record with the B-roll.

00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:57.000
You usually put
music underneath.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.410
So we didn't want it
to read as dad humor.

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:02.340
So we use a couple of
more serious tracks

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.620
at the beginning.

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:07.120
But it was a little bit weird,
because he is inherently

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:09.570
talking about a subject
that most sixth grade

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:12.414
boys, and myself, laugh at.

00:57:12.414 --> 00:57:14.830
So the fact that we weren't
acknowledging the humor at all

00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:17.610
whatsoever, and we're being
totally straight and deadpan

00:57:17.610 --> 00:57:22.330
about it, it was a little
funny, unintentionally.

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:26.389
So we wanted to introduce
the humor through the music

00:57:26.389 --> 00:57:26.930
that we used.

00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:35.229
So I will play
you the rough cut.

00:57:35.229 --> 00:57:36.020
Let me mirror this.

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.160
And this was a personal
decision of mine.

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.630
I'm sure that there are
people out there who would

00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:49.640
have done it very differently.

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:50.330
And that's OK.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.210
But let's play this.

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.870
Let's see.

00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:06.590
I will show you a track
that went a little overboard

00:58:06.590 --> 00:58:07.330
with the humor.

00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.440
This is a track that
the editor found, called

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:24.090
Grandpa Is Scheming Again.

00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:25.340
Oh, sorry, it's the wrong one.

00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:28.850
Let me show you the
one before it, Ukulele.

00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:35.634
This is ukulele comedy swing.

00:58:35.634 --> 00:58:36.300

[END PLAYBACK]

00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:55.179
PROFESSOR: But when I told
[INAUDIBLE], the editor,

00:58:55.179 --> 00:58:57.220
I think we've got to inject
a little bit of humor

00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:58.699
into it with the music.

00:58:58.699 --> 00:59:01.657
I'm sorry.

00:59:01.657 --> 00:59:05.625
There's too much tuba.

00:59:05.625 --> 00:59:07.720
I think the comment
I wrote was, it

00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:11.390
was in all caps, "LOL TOO MUCH."

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:22.329
But that's an example
of music. [LAUGHS]

00:59:22.329 --> 00:59:23.870
So this is Grandpa
Is Scheming Again.

00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:24.536
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:30.645
-You know what's more like

Farts.

00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:32.866
PROFESSOR: I felt that
this one had little bit

00:59:32.866 --> 00:59:34.347
of potential, right?

00:59:34.347 --> 00:59:35.747
-Skunk, rotten eggs.

00:59:35.747 --> 00:59:37.580
PROFESSOR: But I thought
it was a little too

00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:39.030
frantic for the beginning.

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:40.988
-The possibilities are,
unfortunately, endless.

00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:50.552

one more, Sharp Mind.

00:59:59.965 --> 01:00:02.340
-You know what's more like
life than a box of chocolates?

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.173
PROFESSOR: We wanted
to highlight the wonder

01:00:04.173 --> 01:00:06.230
of your digestive system.

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:09.820
So I said, [INAUDIBLE], find
me something that evokes

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.312
amazing wonder, curiosity.

01:00:11.312 --> 01:00:13.270
-The possibilities are,
unfortunately, endless.

01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:14.137
But why do we fart?

[END PLAYBACK]

01:00:16.085 --> 01:00:18.210
PROFESSOR: But it reminded
me a little bit too much

01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:22.270
of Willy Wonka and Harry Potter,
which is why we ultimately

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:25.395
settled on--

01:00:25.395 --> 01:00:26.061
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:30.380
-You know what's more like a
life than a box of chocolates?

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:31.290
Farts.

01:00:31.290 --> 01:00:34.090
You really never know
what you're going to get.

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:38.060
Skunk, rotten eggs, garbage
dumpster-- the possibilities

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.140
are, unfortunately, endless.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.190
But why do we fart?

01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:43.695
And how does your body make
so many different smells?

01:00:43.695 --> 01:00:46.050
The answer is fermentation.

01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:47.460
This is a giant bioreactor.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.700
It's also called a fermenter.

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:51.270
And in here, a fungus
known as brewers yeast--

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:54.860
PROFESSOR: So it's
casual enough.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.700
A super, super important
part about music

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.190
is that you don't want
it to be too distracting

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:01.399
from your audio.

01:01:01.399 --> 01:01:03.190
-So you know that thing
where you eat food?

01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.420
[END PLAYBACK]

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.169
PROFESSOR: You should
stay away from music

01:01:05.169 --> 01:01:09.380
that is super high
tempo, a lot of noise.

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.670
You want something
that's more uniform.

01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:13.999
So there are a couple of
tracks where it was OK.

01:01:13.999 --> 01:01:15.540
But then, every now
and then, there'd

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:18.370
be this random cymbal
hit, or a guitar riff

01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:19.770
that would come out of nowhere.

01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:21.353
And it would be
really, really evident

01:01:21.353 --> 01:01:22.610
while the person was talking.

01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:23.810
So that's very distracting.

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:27.050
Music, like everything
in post, I think,

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.431
should be as hidden as possible.

01:01:28.431 --> 01:01:29.930
And by hidden, I
don't mean that you

01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:32.240
shouldn't be able to hear it.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:35.616
But you shouldn't be able
to notice it too much.

01:01:35.616 --> 01:01:36.116
Yes?

01:01:36.116 --> 01:01:37.991
AUDIENCE: Do you cut
the scenes in accordance

01:01:37.991 --> 01:01:41.040
with the beat of the song, or
can it be right in between?

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:41.820
PROFESSOR: No.

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:42.730
It can be in between.

01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:44.620
And I was going to
talk about this later.

01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:48.990
But all the examples I'm
going to show you do this.

01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:54.900
Sometimes, if you want to end a
track before your actual video

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:56.540
ends-- say you're
talking and you want

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.430
some music in the background.

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:58.850
But then you cut
to a scene where

01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:02.220
it's OK not to have music, or
you want to change the track,

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.540
you can do what's
called ducking.

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.530
Which is when you
take the audio,

01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:11.710
and instead of just cutting
the audio cleanly and just

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:13.680
making the music
end all of a sudden,

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.240
in the editing software,
you can pull this cursor

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.200
down to where the
music slowly fades.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.760
And it slowly becomes quiet.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.410
You can duck in
and out of scenes.

01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:25.750
So, go ahead.

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:28.180
AUDIENCE: If you have
music and B-roll,

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:31.030
that's a good way to help
with the pacing of B-roll,

01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:33.140
because otherwise it's
kind of ambiguous.

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:36.560
Or it can kind of
ambiguous, how long you've

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.790
spent on a single object.

01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:42.474
But music can help you,
if you're having trouble

01:02:42.474 --> 01:02:43.598
finding the pacing of that.

01:02:43.598 --> 01:02:45.223
Because then if you
have a music track,

01:02:45.223 --> 01:02:47.424
you can time with the
beats. [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:47.424 --> 01:02:49.840
PROFESSOR: I'll show you an
example where we intentionally

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.620
lined up the beats of the music
to the visuals with B-roll,

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:53.120
actually.

01:02:58.850 --> 01:02:59.516
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:03:16.937 --> 01:03:19.020
PROFESSOR: Like when he
does this thing like this.

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.278
The editor did that
one [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:32.367 --> 01:03:32.950
[END PLAYBACK]

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:35.320
PROFESSOR: So that was
more of a stylistic thing.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:38.095
We wanted it to read like
bad-ass, like these skydivers

01:03:38.095 --> 01:03:39.510
are going to go.

01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:42.970
Yeah, that was a day
where we were getting

01:03:42.970 --> 01:03:48.120
as much footage as possible, and
didn't end up using half of it.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.470
Yeah, go big or go home, if
you have a skydiving license.

01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:53.485
Go film, and go skydiving.

01:03:53.485 --> 01:03:54.410
And shoot that.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.850
This is an interesting example.

01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:04.006
Because the computers one,
when I first saw the script--

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:06.380
I thought this is going to be
the hardest one to produce.

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.605
Because computer science
videos inherently

01:04:08.605 --> 01:04:10.730
are just really hard to
do, because of the visuals.

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:13.820
And that's why there
aren't that many of them.

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:16.860
But this explanation, for
lack of a better term,

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.170
it just kept reading
incredibly boring.

01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:21.850
Because it's essentially about
how you add in binary, right?

01:04:21.850 --> 01:04:23.835
Which is not the most
riveting material.

01:04:23.835 --> 01:04:24.501
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:28.070
-Just like a light switch,
these switches have two states.

01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:33.170
Either left and right, off
and on, or zero and one.

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:35.420
What's really cool here is
that instead of programming

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:37.930
this computer by writing
code, we program it

01:04:37.930 --> 01:04:39.590
by physically
setting the position

01:04:39.590 --> 01:04:43.180
of several different switches.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.580
I'll set this computer to
count the number of balls

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:48.890
on the top tray by setting
the count switch to on.

01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:51.810
The sum is given by this
bank of switches here.

01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:56.039
We'll set the sum to zero
before we start counting.

01:04:56.039 --> 01:04:58.330
PROFESSOR: I think Jamie's
doing a good job of hosting,

01:04:58.330 --> 01:05:01.050
but it just gets
tedious, a little bit.

01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:03.300
Because it's the same
thing over and over again.

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.338
You count the balls,
you set the switches.

01:05:09.395 --> 01:05:09.978
[END PLAYBACK]

01:05:10.301 --> 01:05:12.050
PROFESSOR: So my initial
thought with this

01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:15.410
was, I had a list of
brainstormed tracks.

01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:17.130
And I was like, let's
go with something

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:22.067
boopy, sort of robotic
and electronic-y.

01:05:22.067 --> 01:05:23.900
And this is what I mean
by be careful of how

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.524
distracting your music could be,
because this is what happened.

01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:33.300
Universal Fluff Theory.

01:05:36.086 --> 01:05:36.752
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:41.804
-Just like a light switch,
these switches have two states.

01:05:41.804 --> 01:05:46.870
Either left and right, off
and on, or zero and one.

01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:49.225
What's really cool here is
that instead of programming

01:05:49.225 --> 01:05:49.980
this computer by writing code--

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.890
PROFESSOR: It's just
a little much, right?

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:54.369
-by physically
setting the position--

01:05:54.369 --> 01:05:54.952
[END PLAYBACK]

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.640
PROFESSOR: And we fell into
a stereotype a little bit,

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:03.400
that a video about computers
has to be with electronic music.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.582
And everything has
to be very robotic.

01:06:05.582 --> 01:06:07.290
And the track that
[INAUDIBLE] ultimately

01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:14.150
found, I really loved, because
it was very Zen, actually.

01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:19.640
Which wasn't the
initial response

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:20.670
that I had to the video.

01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:21.336
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:06:21.336 --> 01:06:25.280
-has switches with a mechanical
input and mechanical output.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:28.420
Just like a light switch,
these switches have two states.

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:33.410
Either left and right, off
and on, or zero and one.

01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:35.660
What's really cool here is
that instead of programming

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:38.110
this computer by writing
code, we program it

01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:39.830
by physically
setting the position

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:42.976
of several different switches.

01:06:42.976 --> 01:06:45.020
I'll now set this
computer to count

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:46.840
the number of balls
in the top trade

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.140
by setting the
count switch to on.

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:52.040
The sum is given by this
bank of switches here.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:55.750
We'll set the sum to zero
before we start counting.

01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:58.020
Now let's start counting
by pressing this lever.

01:07:12.567 --> 01:07:13.150
[END PLAYBACK]

01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:15.920
PROFESSOR: So I actually
personally like that track,

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.020
because there's
something about it that

01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:20.280
makes the scene very inviting.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.710
He seems really friendly.

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:25.090
You have something that's
as scary as programming

01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:27.880
a computer, but then the
person is super friendly.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:31.570
Jamie's just a really
friendly person in real life.

01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:36.450
We were trying to make
computer programming as not

01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:37.850
scary as possible.

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:41.120
And I think that having a track
that was a little more Zen,

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.230
it was a little quieter.

01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:46.362
Someone was saying that
it's like a very mesmerizing

01:07:46.362 --> 01:07:47.320
experience to watch it.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:47.820
Yeah?

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:55.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] how do you
know if the volume of the song

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:55.620
is too much?

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:59.400
Or the beats themselves
are too much?

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.810
PROFESSOR: Again, a lot
of this is personal taste,

01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:04.410
which is not the answer that
you guys probably want to hear.

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:06.540
But I would choose
what you like.

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:09.480
And hopefully I'm giving you
some pointers as to maybe

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.400
what works, and what
doesn't, as well.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.810
But that's also where the
other three people that you'll

01:08:13.810 --> 01:08:16.136
have looking at
your rough cuts will

01:08:16.136 --> 01:08:17.260
come in handy, quite a bit.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:20.960
You'll have the opinions of
at least five or six people.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.790
Which, ideally you'd have more.

01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:26.210
But that would give
you some sense.

01:08:26.210 --> 01:08:28.899
And this sounds dumb,
but if you can't clearly

01:08:28.899 --> 01:08:30.889
make out what the
person is saying

01:08:30.889 --> 01:08:32.930
because the music is too
loud or too distracting,

01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:34.144
then don't use it.

01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:35.810
But sometimes you
don't know, and that's

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:37.460
why you ask other people.

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:39.300
The last example I
wanted to show you--

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:43.137
did anyone have
questions besides that?

01:08:43.137 --> 01:08:45.319
Everyone's good?

01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:48.399
So the last example I wanted
to show you was of Anastasia.

01:08:48.399 --> 01:08:52.510
Now, I was very conscious
of who she was as a person

01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:55.040
when we were making this
video, because she was just

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.350
this very bubbly, blonde girl.

01:08:57.350 --> 01:09:00.310
But she does intense,
legit systems biology.

01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:04.359
And I didn't want to undermine
her intelligence or her persona

01:09:04.359 --> 01:09:07.779
as this very
inspiring STEM figure

01:09:07.779 --> 01:09:10.910
by playing into the ditzy trope.

01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:14.569
So at first, I was putting
really hard rock music

01:09:14.569 --> 01:09:17.380
into her video to fight this.

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:22.399
She's doing intense
science, give that vibe.

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:26.029
It did not work for
obvious reasons, now.

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:28.745
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:51.560
[END PLAYBACK]

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:55.480
PROFESSOR: And what I realized
was that Anastasia as a person

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.570
is super bubbly.

01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:58.020
And she loves science.

01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:01.090
And that doesn't
undermine her abilities

01:10:01.090 --> 01:10:04.990
as a scientist, or
her authority at all.

01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:06.490
And that if we
fought that too much,

01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:08.864
it read really weird, because
that's just not who she is.

01:10:08.864 --> 01:10:13.760
So we did go with a track that
was more capturing the wonder

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.024
that she had for plants.

01:10:15.024 --> 01:10:15.690
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:20.950
-Paclitaxel is a compound
that can treat cancer.

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:23.600
Salicylic acid reduces
headaches and fevers.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:26.140
Carotenoids can turn
your skin orange.

01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:29.020
And miraculin changes
your sense of taste.

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:32.380
What do all of these awesome
compounds have in common?

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:34.250
They all come from plants.

01:10:41.267 --> 01:10:41.850
[END PLAYBACK]

01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:44.570
PROFESSOR: So music is really
good for evoking emotion,

01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:48.940
establishing things
like wonder, creepiness.

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.780
This is an example of one.

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:54.880
And it can also help if you just
have some really funky audio

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.110
going on from the environment
that you're filming in.

01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:58.970
I hate to say this,
but sometimes it

01:10:58.970 --> 01:11:02.350
can be a little bit of
a Band-Aid to cover up

01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:03.570
weird background noise.

01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:06.760
When we were shooting in the
brewery for George's video

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.270
with all the vats, it was
just super noisy in there.

01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:11.560
And there's nothing that
we could do about it.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.470
So he just talked really
loud, and we put in the track.

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:17.800
And I think it helps distract
from that a little bit.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:21.890
But again, don't say
we'll fix it in post.

01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:24.194
Last example, I lied
about the other one.

01:11:24.194 --> 01:11:24.860
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:26.730
-These patterns can
seem pretty complicated.

01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:29.645
Some people even think octopuses
use patterns like these

01:11:29.645 --> 01:11:31.440
to mesmerize their prey.

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.940
But these intricate displays
emerge on the squid skin

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:36.400
even after it's been
disconnected from the brain.

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:39.360
So what's going on?

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.517
First I wanted to measure
how the chromatophores--

01:11:41.517 --> 01:11:42.100
[END PLAYBACK]

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.310
PROFESSOR: So when
the music changes,

01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:46.070
we ducked from the
previous track.

01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:48.520
This is what I
was talking about.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:51.102
Hopefully it's not super
jarring or obvious to you

01:11:51.102 --> 01:11:53.310
that we were changing music
tracks in the background,

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:56.470
because we ducked one
out and ducked one in.

01:11:56.470 --> 01:12:00.140
But the second track, where
the question mark comes,

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.960
I liked it because
it was sort of eerie.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.650
And it emphasizes,
this is super weird

01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:06.150
that the squid skin does that.

01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:08.900
How exactly does it do it?

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:11.610
And it's a way that we implied
that without her explicitly

01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:13.160
saying it in the script.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.380
So, when a lot of you
guys end your scripts,

01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:17.970
or have a line in there
that's like, this is awesome.

01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:21.227
Or, and that's how you do that.

01:12:21.227 --> 01:12:22.810
You don't have to
say that explicitly.

01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:25.184
Because a lot of the time,
the music can do that for you.

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:29.050
All right.

01:12:29.050 --> 01:12:31.950
So I talked a lot about what
kind of music you should use,

01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:33.700
and you are probably
wondering, well,

01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.200
where am I going
to get this music?

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:41.020
So I wanted to talk a little bit
about Creative Commons, which

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:44.850
is the license that
MIT usually uses.

01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:46.490
It's what OpenCourseWare uses.

01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:48.810
It's what Science Out Loud uses.

01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:51.900
And basically, it's a type
of license or copyright.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:59.600
And in particular, we use CC
BY-NC-SA, which I will explain,

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:05.070
which allows you to freely
share and adapt materials.

01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:08.690
So because this class,
and this lecture,

01:13:08.690 --> 01:13:10.650
is being recorded
under Creative Commons,

01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:13.465
under this license if someone
watches this video later on,

01:13:13.465 --> 01:13:16.770
and they want to take a
portion of this lecture,

01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:21.610
and remix it into a video
about best practices of music,

01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:22.530
they can do it.

01:13:22.530 --> 01:13:24.052
And I won't sue them.

01:13:24.052 --> 01:13:25.260
Because it's totally allowed.

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:27.343
And I want them to take
the material and remix it,

01:13:27.343 --> 01:13:30.100
as long as they attribute.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:35.550
And this is true of any music
that you use for your videos.

01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:38.430
So if you go and search
for Creative Commons music,

01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:40.770
you will find a
ton of resources.

01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:43.690
I've listed the websites
that we have personally

01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:50.090
used in the day 7
lecture on the syllabus.

01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:54.310
Things like ccMixter,
Jamendo-- thanks to Billy,

01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:58.360
we know about that one
now-- Free Music Archive.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.110
Unfortunately music is
not organized online

01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:02.230
in the best way possible.

01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:05.490
So a lot of it is sitting
and wading through tracks,

01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:08.950
and just listening
to a bunch of them.

01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:12.780
And that's why it's
so time consuming.

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:14.530
But a quick note about
Creative Commons.

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:17.230
So your videos will be
released under this license,

01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:20.150
meaning that the
music that you use,

01:14:20.150 --> 01:14:24.100
and any stock footage or
video that you find online,

01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.645
has to also be Creative Commons.

01:14:26.645 --> 01:14:28.380
And if you have
trouble with this,

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:30.860
let me know,
because I have dealt

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:34.187
with issues like that a lot.

01:14:34.187 --> 01:14:36.270
But basically, when you
upload your final projects

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:39.610
onto YouTube, it's totally fine
for you to use other music,

01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:44.050
as long as, in the description,
you say we used this track.

01:14:44.050 --> 01:14:45.940
Here's a link to
the original site.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.310
This is the person who made it.

01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:49.650
That's just best
practices in general.

01:14:49.650 --> 01:14:54.060
Ideally, you would cite images
that you use in your video

01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:54.560
itself.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:59.440
You'll notice that Science
Out Loud doesn't annotate

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.410
with citations on the
actual videos themselves,

01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:05.650
because that was a
stylistic decision of ours.

01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:10.070
But we put all the citations
in our YouTube descriptions.

01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:11.910
And everywhere the
video is online for us,

01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:13.250
we put all of the citations.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.160
So for our license,
it means that

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:23.020
is free to share and adapt, as
long as you attribute, and it's

01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:24.570
not used for
commercial purposes,

01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:27.760
and that you're releasing your
work under the same terms.

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:31.900
So if someone took this lecture
and then used a portion of it

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.490
to record a lecture
for The Great Courses,

01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:36.710
for instance, which
you have to pay to use,

01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:38.960
because it's a commercial
company, that's not allowed.

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:48.440
On the syllabus, you'll also
find links to stock music.

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:52.980
Good music costs usually
around $30 to $40 per track.

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:56.110
So sometimes, we use
things like PremiumBeat,

01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:59.320
which was where all the
tracks for the examples

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.192
I showed you were found.

01:16:02.192 --> 01:16:03.650
And so sometimes,
if you just can't

01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:05.610
find something that's
free, it's really worth,

01:16:05.610 --> 01:16:10.020
I think, the money to
do music the right way.

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:15.020
And then one more
note about video.

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:18.840
So maybe you have the
Hudson River, for example.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:21.260
We obviously couldn't
film at the Hudson River.

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:23.760
So I found a picture of it
on the Internet Archive,

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:28.400
which is where you can find
a lot of videos, music.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.980
They're all under
Creative Commons.

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:32.560
I'll put links to all
this in the syllabus,

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:35.360
and I'll post something
on Tumblr later today

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.850
that consolidates
all these resources.

01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:41.440
For biology videos, the
NIH has a lot, actually,

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.570
under Creative Commons.

01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:45.650
A lot of open
source publications,

01:16:45.650 --> 01:16:51.010
you can use their figures,
as long as you cite.

01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:52.880
And Wikipedia, all
of those images

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:57.160
are released under
Creative Commons.

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.119
The US government websites
are actually really,

01:16:59.119 --> 01:17:01.410
really great resources,
because they release everything

01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:02.400
under public domain.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.816
So it's not even
Creative Commons.

01:17:03.816 --> 01:17:05.440
You can just use
whatever you want.

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:08.310
NASA has awesome footage.

01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:11.600
NIH, I'm trying to
think of others.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.270
But that's actually
a go-to place for me

01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:16.893
if I'm searching for footage
that we just can't shoot.

01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:22.770
So that's all I had
planned for today.

01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:25.190
Does anyone have
questions off the bat?

01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:25.690
Yes.

01:17:25.690 --> 01:17:28.035
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about working with the music

01:17:28.035 --> 01:17:28.973
that you had.

01:17:28.973 --> 01:17:33.125
I've been doing
stock music before.

01:17:33.125 --> 01:17:36.789
Some of them are like a
one [INAUDIBLE] thing,

01:17:36.789 --> 01:17:40.070
and some are
repetitive [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:42.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it loops
the same tune over and over.

01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:44.140
AUDIENCE: Do you use those?

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:45.100
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:50.610
The looped ones are nice for
us, because sometimes the longer

01:17:50.610 --> 01:17:54.740
ones are like big orchestral
arrangements that take awhile

01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:59.090
to get to the point of the song.

01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:01.240
Whereas, for a lot of
the music, you just

01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:02.870
want something
that's present, that

01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:06.140
establishes a general
sound and atmosphere.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:09.870
But you're not looking for
a Mozart composition, right?

01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:12.520
You just want something to fill
in the background a little bit.

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.020
So having something
that's looped

01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:17.390
is actually preferred for us.

01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:22.604
AUDIENCE: Have you done a video
where there was [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:26.249 --> 01:18:28.040
PROFESSOR: Yeah, some
of our earlier videos

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.230
don't have as much music.

01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:34.400
And part of it was that I
wasn't savvy enough to do it.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.610
And I watch some of them now.

01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:38.685
I'm like, man, this video
just feels super long.

01:18:38.685 --> 01:18:40.768
And it seems like they're
talking for a long time.

01:18:40.768 --> 01:18:44.430
And I think part of it's
because of the music.

01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:46.470
You don't need music
everywhere, though.

01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:50.630
And like I said, during the
presentation, first do no harm.

01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:53.230
So sometimes, if you just
can't find music for it,

01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:54.410
leave it out.

01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:55.870
I'm trying to
think of an example

01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:59.850
where we said we specifically
do not want music here.

01:18:59.850 --> 01:19:02.210
And I can't come up with
any off the top of my head.

01:19:02.210 --> 01:19:04.518
But maybe after class, I
can look for something.

01:19:08.908 --> 01:19:10.824
AUDIENCE: Elizabeth, can
you talk a little bit

01:19:10.824 --> 01:19:12.865
about how the next couple
days are going to work?

01:19:12.865 --> 01:19:14.160
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.460
Thank you for the reminder.

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:21.480
So this is it for formal
lectures between now

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.250
and next Thursday, which is when
the final presentations will

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:24.750
be.

01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:26.830
You will have
class time to work.

01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:31.330
So we are going to pair you
up, or put you into groups

01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:32.920
for filming partners.

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.240
And you will have class
time tomorrow, the day

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.610
after, and Friday to work.

01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:42.600
We will have a screening of
the rough cuts next Tuesday.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:46.110
So that gives you the weekend
to edit together the footage

01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:49.010
that you shoot this week.

01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:50.520
We'll screen
everyone's rough cuts.

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.812
We'll also assign
you editing partners.

01:19:53.812 --> 01:19:56.020
And I'll tell you more about
this on Tuesday as well.

01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:57.275
But you'll watch the videos.

01:19:57.275 --> 01:19:59.650
And we have a video annotation
software that you can use.

01:19:59.650 --> 01:20:02.480
So you'll make comments
on at least two

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:05.150
or three other people's
videos during class time.

01:20:05.150 --> 01:20:10.460
And then you'll have
until Thursday, where we

01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:12.350
don't have normal class time.

01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:16.250
Our final screening is going
to be in Simmons Hall at 6:30

01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:17.880
instead of at 1:00 PM.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:21.740
It'll be like a
red carpet event.

01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:26.100
But you'll have all day that
day to finish whatever you need.

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:29.750
I wouldn't wait until 6:00 PM
to have your video finished.

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:32.670
But if it comes down to that,
it's not like we have to know.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.970
Yeah, so it's pretty
much work time from here.

01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:41.290
The teaching staff will
be available to help you.

01:20:41.290 --> 01:20:43.490
So it's basically like
office hours from here

01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:48.140
on out, except for the rough
cut screening next Tuesday.

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:50.710
And if you have specific
questions on editing,

01:20:50.710 --> 01:20:52.365
we'll send out a
Google spreadsheet

01:20:52.365 --> 01:20:54.970
so you can sign up
for specific people,

01:20:54.970 --> 01:20:59.475
or if you have certain
requests to go over things.

01:20:59.475 --> 01:21:02.160
AUDIENCE: Or, if it's in the
evening and you're editing,

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:07.930
and you find a problem that you
just don't know how to solve,

01:21:07.930 --> 01:21:09.520
feel free to email us.

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:12.200
Shoot out an email before
you start tackling it

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.340
for two to four hours.

01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:14.714
Because if it's
a simple solution

01:21:14.714 --> 01:21:17.800
that we can relate over email,
that'll save you so much

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:20.760
time and frustration.

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.740
PROFESSOR: And I'll send
out an email to where

01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:25.140
everyone's emails are CC'd.

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:27.690
You can ask your peers
questions as well,

01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:31.180
because I'm sure you're going to
run into very similar problems

01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:33.150
once you start
editing and shooting.

01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:36.850
So use each other as
a resource as well.

01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:41.990
And honestly, I can't feign
expertise over any of this.

01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:45.010
So oftentimes, I just Google.

01:21:45.010 --> 01:21:50.850
Why won't my clip snap
to the previous one?

01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:54.750
But, I will send out
shooting assignments.

01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:58.210
Actually, I have them with me.

01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:01.150
AUDIENCE: Elizabeth,
we'll be in here

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:02.620
during class time
as a home base.

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:07.030
So if you have any
questions, and you need help,

01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:12.420
we'll be physically in this
room for you to swing by.

01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:14.740
You don't have to come
into this room physically.

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:18.170
You can use the entire class
time to be out and about.

01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:20.252
But just so that you
know that you can,

01:22:20.252 --> 01:22:23.964
at any point, during that
1:00 to 4:00 time frame.

01:22:23.964 --> 01:22:27.970
If you need help with anything,
I will as much as I physically

01:22:27.970 --> 01:22:28.470
can be--

01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:30.300
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I will
definitely be here.

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:33.990
AUDIENCE: They will
definitely be in this room,

01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:37.120
to be here if you want
physical help with anything.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.160
And if you want to,
just to make sure,

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:42.680
you can feel free to email a
specific point person to say,

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:45.000
I am coming in at
this time for sure.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.035
If you know ahead of time that
you need help with something,

01:22:48.035 --> 01:22:52.640
just so that we know
we should reserve time

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.344
to deal with this
issue with you.

01:22:55.344 --> 01:22:56.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:22:56.010 --> 01:23:00.230
And if you need Chris's help
or Natalie's help on anything,

01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:02.650
just email them directly.

01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:05.440
Because they are available,
although they're a little bit

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:05.940
busy.

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:08.534
So as long as they have
enough of a heads up,

01:23:08.534 --> 01:23:09.450
we can make that work.

01:23:09.450 --> 01:23:13.680
I did want to let you
guys know about 26 139.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:17.540
Do guys know where the
801 TEAL classrooms are?

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:20.100
Oh, I guess you guys would know.

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:24.250
It is basically in that
building on the first floor,

01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:27.610
actually, right next to us.

01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:28.540
It says Building 26.

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:29.960
It's on the first floor.

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:31.350
You need key card access.

01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:32.860
You just swipe your MIT ID.

01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:35.310
And I have that room reserved
every day during class time

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:36.730
until the final day.

01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:40.190
So if you want to use
their software, you can.

01:23:40.190 --> 01:23:44.310
I also have nicer headphones if
anyone needs to borrow those.

01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:46.759
I think everyone has a kit.

01:23:46.759 --> 01:23:48.300
I feel like I'm
forgetting something.

01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:52.030
Oh, I'm forgetting to tell
you the shooting assignments.

01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:55.780
So David and Joshua, we'll
put you guys together.

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:58.780
[? Yulia, ?] Kenneth, and
Paul, you guys will be a group.

01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:02.760
And then Andrea and Nathan, you
guys will be shooting partners.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.550
AUDIENCE: That wasn't random.

01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:06.620
We really tried
to think about who

01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:09.940
you are, and your
scripts, and all of that.

01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:12.080
Because sometimes, if
you have a great partner

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.968
that can really
complement you, that

01:24:13.968 --> 01:24:15.176
can really help your project.

01:24:15.176 --> 01:24:17.586
We really did put a
fair amount of thought

01:24:17.586 --> 01:24:19.032
into those partnerships.

01:24:19.032 --> 01:24:23.080
It's not just like a
random division of labor.

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:25.080
PROFESSOR: If you have
any issues during filming

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:28.610
whatsoever, about anything, if
you can't get into a location,

01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:31.310
if you need help
clearing something,

01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:33.920
if you're not sure something
is allowed to be filmed,

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.390
if things are just
not going well,

01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:40.470
if Murphy's Law is
happening, email me.

01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:41.740
Or come find me during class.

01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:42.790
Or email any of us.

01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:47.174
We are definitely here to help
you guys for the home stretch.

01:24:47.174 --> 01:24:49.090
AUDIENCE: And I think
I've showed this to you,

01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:53.120
but when you're walking
to the bathroom,

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.120
there's a big sign that
says communication lab.

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.620
That's my office.

01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:59.925
So if ever during
normal business hours,

01:24:59.925 --> 01:25:01.538
outside from class
time, you literally

01:25:01.538 --> 01:25:03.915
need help with anything,
that is where I am.

01:25:03.915 --> 01:25:07.880
So you can always knock and
interrupt anything, and just

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:10.340
say, I need help with
something, and it'll be fine.

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:13.236
PROFESSOR: And my office is a
little far away from campus.

01:25:13.236 --> 01:25:14.860
But if you want to
meet in the morning,

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:17.590
or sometime outside of class,
if you just email me ahead

01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:21.370
of time, I can definitely
meet with you guys.

01:25:21.370 --> 01:25:25.095
AUDIENCE: And one last thing is
the "kill your darlings" thing.

01:25:25.095 --> 01:25:28.784
As someone who has been
writing for quite a long time,

01:25:28.784 --> 01:25:33.690
and who has edited
people professionally,

01:25:33.690 --> 01:25:35.830
it's really hard.

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.555
The more you get
invested in this,

01:25:37.555 --> 01:25:40.216
the harder it is to
be able to do that.

01:25:40.216 --> 01:25:42.830
And that's when as
a partner, that's

01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:45.830
a great point, when you're
not emotionally connected

01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:46.650
to the work.

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:50.910
This is just advice.

01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:53.995
Instead of pointing out
that it's not working,

01:25:53.995 --> 01:25:56.830
maybe think about framing some
questions for your partner,

01:25:56.830 --> 01:26:01.600
to help them realize
that this isn't working.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.950
And that's a really great job
you have as a partner, to help

01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:08.740
your colleague realize
that this piece is awesome,

01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:11.600
it's really cool,
but it doesn't work.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:14.460
And that can be really,
really hard feedback.

01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:17.960
So thinking about how
to help your partner

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:21.296
see that sometimes is a
really important task.

01:26:21.296 --> 01:26:22.670
PROFESSOR: And
part of your grade

01:26:22.670 --> 01:26:25.030
will come from how great
of a partner you are.

01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:28.345
So ha ha, you have to do it.

01:26:28.345 --> 01:26:29.970
I don't remember the
exact percentages,

01:26:29.970 --> 01:26:33.540
but 60% of the grade comes
from your writing and hosting.

01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:35.420
40% of it comes
from the producing

01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:36.889
that you do for your partner.

01:26:36.889 --> 01:26:39.180
And for the group of three,
figure it out how you want.

01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.400
But I was thinking
one person does

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.049
for person 2 which
does for person 3 which

01:26:44.049 --> 01:26:47.450
does for person 1.

01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:49.600
Does anyone have
questions, concerns?

01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:54.920
AUDIENCE: You say the
assignment's on the quality.

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:59.352
So what is that [INAUDIBLE].

01:26:59.352 --> 01:27:01.560
AUDIENCE: She means just
that these are your partners

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:02.400
to do the project.

01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:07.608
The people that
she just mentioned

01:27:07.608 --> 01:27:09.496
are your partners for
producing your project.

01:27:12.630 --> 01:27:15.410
It's a phrase that I'm
sure you use [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:16.750
PROFESSOR: Yeah, sorry.

01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:19.570
And also, don't feel limited to
only working during class time,

01:27:19.570 --> 01:27:22.456
if you and your partner would
rather meet in the morning.

01:27:22.456 --> 01:27:24.080
Or if you want to
just shoot some stuff

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:27.230
on your own, like B-roll,
that's totally fine.

01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:29.160
I will put this link
up on the Tumblr.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.460
And I'll email it out
to you guys today, too.

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:35.930
I would love it if sometime,
before the end of the weekend,

01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:38.250
you filled out this super,
super short midpoint survey,

01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:40.850
just to give us a
good idea of what

01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:42.160
is working best for you all.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.743
What type of feedback
is working best?

01:27:43.743 --> 01:27:46.245
Because I want to make sure
that for the last week,

01:27:46.245 --> 01:27:47.870
it's going to be a
lot of project time.

01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:49.765
So I just want to make
sure that the time is

01:27:49.765 --> 01:27:51.260
as valuable to you as possible.

01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:53.200
So it's really quick.

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:54.565
It's super painless.

01:27:54.565 --> 01:27:58.710
It's just telling me what your
favorite day was, basically.

01:27:58.710 --> 01:28:00.210
So I'll send out a
link to you guys.

01:28:00.210 --> 01:28:03.540
Just any time between now and
the weekend would be awesome.

01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:04.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:28:11.562 --> 01:28:13.270
PROFESSOR: No, for
most of the videos, we

01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:15.100
have at least two or three.

01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:17.410
I think we have around
three in all of them.

01:28:17.410 --> 01:28:18.338
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:28:22.686 --> 01:28:24.560
PROFESSOR: I don't have
an algorithm for you,

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.260
unfortunately.

01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:28.150
A lot of it is just
what feels right to me.

01:28:35.194 --> 01:28:37.140
AUDIENCE: And you can
ask for second opinions.

01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:37.630
PROFESSOR: Of course.

01:28:37.630 --> 01:28:39.118
AUDIENCE: This is a great
time to ask your group,

01:28:39.118 --> 01:28:40.326
or other people in the class.

01:28:40.326 --> 01:28:41.598
Or come in and ask us, too.

01:28:41.598 --> 01:28:43.086
If it's like, I
found this music,

01:28:43.086 --> 01:28:44.620
I'm not sure how
I feel about it.

01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:45.610
How do you guys feel about it?

01:28:45.610 --> 01:28:46.276
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:28:46.276 --> 01:28:49.150
And if you're in the
editing room on Friday

01:28:49.150 --> 01:28:51.426
during class time, and
you want us to look at it,

01:28:51.426 --> 01:28:53.050
just send me an email
and be like, hey,

01:28:53.050 --> 01:28:57.200
can you meet me in 26 at 2
o'clock to help me with this?

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:57.960
And I will do it.

01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:59.525
So, at the beginning it's funny.

01:28:59.525 --> 01:29:00.191
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:05.450
-A skunk, rotten eggs, garbage
dumpster-- the possibilities

01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:07.250
are, unfortunately, endless.

01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:09.830
PROFESSOR: And he's talking
about how funny it is.

01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:11.690
-Break food down to get energy.

01:29:11.690 --> 01:29:15.430
But your main byproducts are
carbon dioxide and water,

01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:18.600
and yeast's main byproducts
are carbon dioxide and alcohol.

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.320
That's how this stuff
gets to be beer.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.090
And here's where
things get weird.

01:29:25.090 --> 01:29:25.673
[END PLAYBACK]

01:29:25.673 --> 01:29:28.300
PROFESSOR: So that's a
new break in thought.

01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:33.490
It was a logical
transition point for us,

01:29:33.490 --> 01:29:38.450
because he opens with farts
are like a box of chocolates.

01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:40.200
But this is the part
where you're starting

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.491
to really get into the science.

01:29:41.491 --> 01:29:44.720
And he wants to highlight
the misconception of,

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.240
the thing that you thought
was funny is actually really

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:49.090
weird and super interesting.

01:29:49.090 --> 01:29:55.950
So we introduced this track that
I felt conveyed that sense of,

01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:56.880
this is weird.

01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:00.590
There's something
interesting about this.

01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:03.370
But yeah, unfortunately,
I don't have a recipe.

01:30:03.370 --> 01:30:05.270
I think once you start
doing it on your own,

01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:06.730
you're going to
get a sense of it.

01:30:06.730 --> 01:30:08.870
And once you start seeing
other people's projects,

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:10.160
you'll get a sense of it.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.920
AUDIENCE: There's
always the mom test.

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:15.520
My mom, I feel like she's
so like that-- oh, I

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.942
don't understand, what
are you doing with this?

01:30:17.942 --> 01:30:18.580
I can't hear.

01:30:21.409 --> 01:30:23.575
I feel like my mom is like,
if I can show it to her,

01:30:23.575 --> 01:30:25.491
and she'll be like, oh,
I can hear everything,

01:30:25.491 --> 01:30:27.060
and your music's
not distracting me.

01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:31.450
Or, can you make it louder,
honey, I can't hear that part.

01:30:31.450 --> 01:30:34.110
If you have someone in your
life who plays that role,

01:30:34.110 --> 01:30:36.080
that's a great person
to check in with.

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:41.550
PROFESSOR: I'm happy to be
that person for you guys.

01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:45.660
AUDIENCE: Can you talk
louder on this part?

01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:48.290
PROFESSOR: But that's why audio
is so important to get right

01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:50.630
when you're producing.

01:30:50.630 --> 01:30:53.870
Because if you record too
soft, there's only so much

01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:55.250
you can do in the editing.

01:30:55.250 --> 01:30:57.080
And if you record
too loud, you're

01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:58.820
going to peak the microphone.

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:01.320
And it's going to
sound really scratchy.

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:05.630
So when you're filming someone,
watch a take or two, just

01:31:05.630 --> 01:31:08.058
to make sure that the audio's
sounding clean and OK.

01:31:13.382 --> 01:31:15.207
AUDIENCE: Do you
have the GoPros here,

01:31:15.207 --> 01:31:16.290
or is that somewhere else?

01:31:16.290 --> 01:31:18.660
PROFESSOR: Oh, I have
them in my office.

01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:20.409
I can actually go
there after class

01:31:20.409 --> 01:31:22.200
right now, if you're
planning on using them

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.330
before tomorrow's class.

01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:25.627
AUDIENCE: Probably Thursday.

01:31:25.627 --> 01:31:26.460
PROFESSOR: Thursday?

01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:29.130
OK, then I'll just bring them
with me to class tomorrow,

01:31:29.130 --> 01:31:31.160
and I'll leave them
in Jamie's office.

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.704
They've never been
opened before.

01:31:32.704 --> 01:31:33.620
AUDIENCE: What's that?

01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:35.453
PROFESSOR: They've never
been opened before.

01:31:35.453 --> 01:31:37.514
They're brand new,
just for you guys.

01:31:37.514 --> 01:31:39.680
AUDIENCE: And if you need
access to something that's

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:43.350
In my office, and there's a
code, and if you email me,

01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:47.380
and I'm not there, don't
steal anything, obviously.

01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:50.421
But if you need access
and I'm not around,

01:31:50.421 --> 01:31:52.770
I can give you the code
to get into that room.

01:31:52.770 --> 01:31:54.520
PROFESSOR: You guys
can come to my office,

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:56.186
but it's all the way
out in Tech Square.

01:31:56.186 --> 01:31:59.210
So I would imagine most
people wouldn't want to.

01:31:59.210 --> 01:32:02.120
AUDIENCE: And if you see lots of
strange students in my office,

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.060
that's just probably my fellows.

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:05.982
So, say hey.

01:32:05.982 --> 01:32:07.690
PROFESSOR: Does anyone
have certain props

01:32:07.690 --> 01:32:09.490
that they want to use?

01:32:09.490 --> 01:32:11.740
Does anyone need a hand cart?

01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:12.990
Yes.

01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:15.370
AUDIENCE: I'll
need simple things,

01:32:15.370 --> 01:32:17.340
like a wire that I can bend.

01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:21.450
So maybe a couple, if it
doesn't work out the first time.

01:32:21.450 --> 01:32:22.950
PROFESSOR: So for
those props, I'm

01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:25.560
going to have you guys get them.

01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:28.940
For bigger things,
like a hand cart,

01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:32.310
or if you need another tripod,
or if you need a light kit,

01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:34.183
or something.

01:32:34.183 --> 01:32:36.550
AUDIENCE: I think that
may be [INAUDIBLE].

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:37.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:40.860
If it's simple,
like under $20, I'm

01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:43.727
going to have you guys go ahead
and coordinate that, though.

01:32:46.541 --> 01:32:47.900
AUDIENCE: Just a quick question.

01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:48.805
What font is that?

01:32:48.805 --> 01:32:49.930
PROFESSOR: What font is it?

01:32:49.930 --> 01:32:51.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:32:51.370 --> 01:32:55.780
PROFESSOR: Actually, that font
was very, very intentional.

01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:58.360
For a while, I tried
to make my own font.

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:00.969
But then I was
like, that's silly,

01:33:00.969 --> 01:33:02.010
just use an existing one.

01:33:02.010 --> 01:33:03.577
I can't remember
what the name of it

01:33:03.577 --> 01:33:04.660
is off the top of my head.

01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:07.750
But we use it to brand
Science Out Loud.

01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:10.810
But I can send it to
you once I find out.

01:33:10.810 --> 01:33:13.344
I think it's a Google
Font, actually.

01:33:13.344 --> 01:33:16.210
AUDIENCE: The O's are different,
and the H's are different.

01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:18.420
PROFESSOR: Oh, no,
that's just stuff I drew.

01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:21.462
But I think he's talking
about for the text font.

01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:24.496
I think it's actually Amatic SC.

01:33:24.496 --> 01:33:25.428
It's a Google font.

01:33:28.690 --> 01:33:31.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:34.226
PROFESSOR: I will
put it on the Tumblr.

01:33:34.226 --> 01:33:36.964
I've got to remember
to do that, though.

01:33:36.964 --> 01:33:39.070
AUDIENCE: So how
exactly do you do

01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:42.112
that, like draw something on the
computer or would [INAUDIBLE].

01:33:45.014 --> 01:33:47.180
PROFESSOR: I don't have any
of the examples with me,

01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:50.960
but I just draw on a piece
of paper with Sharpie.

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:55.940
And that's how I do all
these presentations, too.

01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:05.680
So for day 9, I did
this at the airport.

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:07.450
This is basically all it is.

01:34:07.450 --> 01:34:09.600
And then I take a
picture with my iPhone.

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.680
And then I blow out the
exposure in Keynote.

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:13.990
It's nothing fancy.

01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:18.560
And Sari knows how to animate
the things in After Effects.

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:20.800
But basically you
take a still image,

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:22.870
and you draw a path
for the computer

01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:24.420
to wiggle it around for you.

01:34:28.159 --> 01:34:30.492
AUDIENCE: Before I knew how
to animate in After Effects,

01:34:30.492 --> 01:34:33.964
you can just use Illustrator,
which is a really good vector

01:34:33.964 --> 01:34:34.956
art program.

01:34:34.956 --> 01:34:36.950
Do you have a tablet?

01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:40.126
PROFESSOR: I have
10 Wacom tablets,

01:34:40.126 --> 01:34:41.500
in case anyone
wants to use them.

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:44.480
AUDIENCE: The best way to
translate your handwriting

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:46.466
to digitally, so if you
want your handwriting

01:34:46.466 --> 01:34:47.990
to just be digital,
then you open up

01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:52.840
a file in Illustrator that's
the same size of your screen,

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:56.222
or your video, so, 1928 by 800.

01:34:56.222 --> 01:34:57.180
Or something like that.

01:34:57.180 --> 01:34:59.760
And you just draw
in it, and you can

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:02.690
change the width of your lines.

01:35:02.690 --> 01:35:04.830
You can redo the
shapes that you do,

01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:06.860
because it's just a
readable document.

01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:09.550
And then you can export
that as an image file.

01:35:09.550 --> 01:35:12.482
It'll be the exact same
size as your video clips,

01:35:12.482 --> 01:35:15.040
when you've edited it.

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.819
And you can make backgrounds
transparent then too.

01:35:17.819 --> 01:35:20.212
So you can just have
your vector art.

01:35:20.212 --> 01:35:22.420
PROFESSOR: You don't have
to make it black and white.

01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:24.420
I just tend to do it
because it's easier for me.

01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:29.680
But if you're trying to
draw the PDL or something,

01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:30.964
she's much better at that.

01:35:30.964 --> 01:35:31.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:32.060
PROFESSOR: You what?

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:32.905
AUDIENCE: I thought
that was your font.

01:35:32.905 --> 01:35:33.780
PROFESSOR: Oh really?

01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:36.035
No, I made it at the airport.

01:35:39.751 --> 01:35:44.200
AUDIENCE: So how can you
avoid giving [INAUDIBLE]?

01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.880
PROFESSOR: Well, I will
show you exactly what

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.180
I did for this slide.

01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:58.040
So I said, I'm going
to insert this image.

01:35:58.040 --> 01:35:58.940
And this is Keynote.

01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:00.315
I think you can
do in PowerPoint.

01:36:00.315 --> 01:36:03.450
You can definitely
do it in Photoshop.

01:36:03.450 --> 01:36:05.255
This is me just being
newb extraordinaire.

01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:11.484
I went to Image, and
first I flipped it.

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:18.220
And I basically
adjusted the levels,

01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:20.040
so I blew out the
background first.

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:21.892
And then I inverted it.

01:36:24.670 --> 01:36:27.372
I'm basically taking all
the whites to the extreme.

01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:36.310
Of course it's not working now.

01:36:44.038 --> 01:36:47.440
I promise it does work.

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:50.690
OK, let's try this again.

01:36:50.690 --> 01:36:52.160
Sometimes it's finicky.

01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:58.360
Does anyone have other
questions while I

01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.770
try to get this to work?

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:09.025
I'm going to try a
different picture.

01:37:09.025 --> 01:37:11.150
AUDIENCE: It makes us all
feel better that it's not

01:37:11.150 --> 01:37:12.097
[INAUDIBLE].

01:37:12.097 --> 01:37:13.430
For me, it makes me feel better.

01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:14.730
PROFESSOR: No, it is.

01:37:14.730 --> 01:37:16.760
I'll go with this one.

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:20.130
And I'm sure there is a
very streamlined way that

01:37:20.130 --> 01:37:22.090
kills fewer trees.

01:37:22.090 --> 01:37:24.260
Oh my goodness, I don't
know why it's not working.

01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:28.130
So if you're doing a black
image on a white background,

01:37:28.130 --> 01:37:30.640
this is all you would do.

01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:32.376
This is not clearing
the background,

01:37:32.376 --> 01:37:34.000
so the background is
going to be black.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.870
So you would have to do
what Sari's talking about

01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:40.810
as far as basically
creating a vector art that

01:37:40.810 --> 01:37:42.918
has a transparent background.

01:37:42.918 --> 01:37:44.262
AUDIENCE: And it's really easy.

01:37:44.262 --> 01:37:46.530
The hardest part is
getting used to the tablet,

01:37:46.530 --> 01:37:51.090
because it's weird writing, and
seeing your writing up here,

01:37:51.090 --> 01:37:52.951
somewhere else than
what's on the page.

01:37:52.951 --> 01:37:53.950
PROFESSOR: Ha, I got it.

01:38:00.670 --> 01:38:01.820
That is all I did.

01:38:04.670 --> 01:38:07.216
And I cropped it.

01:38:07.216 --> 01:38:11.152
AUDIENCE: I've done stuff
like this in PowerPoint.

01:38:11.152 --> 01:38:15.088
You could do it just as
easily in PowerPoint, yeah.

01:38:15.088 --> 01:38:18.532
They give you cool stuff
to make it look like teeth,

01:38:18.532 --> 01:38:22.300
or there's all these cool--
and then just black and white.

01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:23.234
They're really easy.

01:38:23.234 --> 01:38:25.170
But that looks really cool.

01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:30.080
PROFESSOR: But for animations,
labels, overlay in general,

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:33.270
I think simple is
better because clarity

01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:35.720
is most important for
graphics, and anything

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:37.360
that's not the video.

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:39.720
The video itself also
needs to be clear too.

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:41.149
Clarity is very important.

01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:43.065
AUDIENCE: Can we use the
Wacoms in your office

01:38:43.065 --> 01:38:45.523
on our own computers, or do we
have to use that in the lab?

01:38:45.523 --> 01:38:47.750
PROFESSOR: No,
they're are my office.

01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:48.724
It's a USB hookup.

01:38:48.724 --> 01:38:49.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:50.900
PROFESSOR: And
they're kind of old.

01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:52.316
Yeah, they're not
the newest kind.

01:38:52.316 --> 01:38:53.905
I think they're five
or six years old.

01:38:53.905 --> 01:38:55.030
But I have a bunch of them.

01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:56.680
I didn't bring them with
me because I wasn't sure

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:57.970
if people would be
interested in them.

01:38:57.970 --> 01:39:00.430
But yes, please take them,
because they're just sitting

01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:01.950
in a cabinet in my office.

01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:04.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:05.020
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:07.460
If you guys want
them tonight, I'm

01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:09.010
happy to go over
and get them now.

01:39:09.010 --> 01:39:11.432
But I can also just bring
them to class tomorrow.

01:39:14.890 --> 01:39:18.842
AUDIENCE: Can you
overlay the video

01:39:18.842 --> 01:39:22.810
with animations in iMovie
so I can [INAUDIBLE]?

01:39:22.810 --> 01:39:24.230
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
iMovie is great,

01:39:24.230 --> 01:39:26.849
because there's a very
low learning curve.

01:39:26.849 --> 01:39:29.140
And so, if you're doing
simpler things like cutting out

01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:34.450
the bad bits, people might say
iMovie is a newb thing to use.

01:39:34.450 --> 01:39:36.299
But I use it for
really simple videos

01:39:36.299 --> 01:39:38.340
that I don't need to do
a whole lot of work with.

01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:39.756
Unfortunately, for
the animations,

01:39:39.756 --> 01:39:41.625
I don't think it's
possible, and that you

01:39:41.625 --> 01:39:44.655
would need to use something
like After Effects.

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:50.110
Or you would need to use
Final Cut to incorporate it.

01:39:50.110 --> 01:39:51.610
AUDIENCE: So the
problem with iMovie

01:39:51.610 --> 01:39:53.406
is because it's
so simple, it only

01:39:53.406 --> 01:39:55.459
has one video track
and one audio track.

01:39:55.459 --> 01:39:57.000
And in order to
overlay an animation,

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.940
you need at least two
video tracks, which

01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:02.880
comes in Final Cut or Premier.

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:06.311
PROFESSOR: Something that
you can do with iMovie,

01:40:06.311 --> 01:40:08.310
I'm not sure if some of
you guys would do this--

01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:14.190
but say you are standing in the
side of the frame like this.

01:40:14.190 --> 01:40:19.740
And you want another movie
to play on the inside.

01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:21.210
You can do that in iMovie.

01:40:21.210 --> 01:40:23.350
You can do an inset.

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:29.582
And that's something that's
pretty straightforward to do.

01:40:29.582 --> 01:40:31.950
AUDIENCE: And you can have
words show up over you.

01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:33.724
It's very easy to do in iMovie.

01:40:33.724 --> 01:40:35.272
If it's not an
animation, but just

01:40:35.272 --> 01:40:36.646
a word that you
want next to you,

01:40:36.646 --> 01:40:40.874
that's really easy to do,
and have text show up.

01:40:40.874 --> 01:40:41.790
AUDIENCE: Or an image.

01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:43.377
That would be [INAUDIBLE].

01:40:43.377 --> 01:40:44.002
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.260
PROFESSOR: I'll show
you the video later

01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:11.550
because I can't
find it right now.

01:41:11.550 --> 01:41:14.900
You can do insets, really
basic things on iMovie.

01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:16.170
But animations, you can't.

01:41:16.170 --> 01:41:22.110
What you could do, is you could
work with Sari in After Effects

01:41:22.110 --> 01:41:25.500
to get the video clip where
you want the animation,

01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:28.000
and export it as its own file.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.860
And then import it into iMovie.

01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:33.209
So you're basically using
a polished animation.

01:41:33.209 --> 01:41:34.750
That way, if you
want to keep working

01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:37.325
in iMovie for the rest of
your project, you can do that.

01:41:37.325 --> 01:41:39.408
AUDIENCE: And we need to
go to the [INAUDIBLE] lab

01:41:39.408 --> 01:41:41.630
to use the After Effects?

01:41:41.630 --> 01:41:43.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
because they only

01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:45.880
are in installed
computers on campus.

01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:48.571
And it's literally
in that building.

01:41:48.571 --> 01:41:50.737
AUDIENCE: And if you end
up wanting to work at home,

01:41:50.737 --> 01:41:54.421
it takes usually an hour, but
you can install all the Adobe

01:41:54.421 --> 01:41:55.894
software for free for a month.

01:41:55.894 --> 01:41:57.693
And they don't
automatically charge you,

01:41:57.693 --> 01:41:59.822
because you don't put in credit
card information, or anything.

01:41:59.822 --> 01:42:01.447
You just sign up with
an email address.

01:42:01.447 --> 01:42:04.185
And then you can download
them for a month trial.

01:42:10.490 --> 01:42:13.932
Did teams want to spend the
last little bit on a little game

01:42:13.932 --> 01:42:15.201
plan time?

01:42:15.201 --> 01:42:17.200
PROFESSOR: Don't forget,
a daily blog for today.

01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:21.570
I think I put this in the email.

01:42:21.570 --> 01:42:24.590
The syllabus is updated
with all the assignments.

01:42:24.590 --> 01:42:26.630
Basically, from
now until the end,

01:42:26.630 --> 01:42:30.520
it's just the video
itself that's due.

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:36.960
And daily blogs are just for
today and the rough screening

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:38.860
day.

01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:41.340
But if you take behind
the scenes pictures, which

01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:43.660
I love to do, behind
the scenes stuff,

01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:46.460
feel free to upload
that to the Tumblr.

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:49.690
AUDIENCE: So there's no shot
list, or anything like that?

01:42:49.690 --> 01:42:51.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:55.040
The scripts, I think everyone
has sent me, for the most

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:56.695
part, updated scripts.

01:42:56.695 --> 01:42:59.070
The shot list and all that,
it's really for your benefit.

01:42:59.070 --> 01:43:03.470
I want you to feel as
ready as possible to shoot.

01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:09.080
Actually, I would like you
to upload the shot list.

01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.360
But I won't set a
due date for it.

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:15.220
I'll change the
syllabus with that.

01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:18.590
But do upload your shot list.

01:43:18.590 --> 01:43:21.520
I would like to see it up
there by Thursday, at least.

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:26.210
Because if you're not thinking
about shooting by then--

01:43:26.210 --> 01:43:28.162
does that sound OK to everyone?

01:43:34.030 --> 01:43:35.380
Break, go team.

01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:36.540
Yay, people.

01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:37.550
It'll be awesome.

01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:39.900
I can't wait to see your videos.
