00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.910
It shouldn't really be news to anyone that a lot of our favorite movies have alternate endings that didn't quite make the cut.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.519
The reasons for these decisions are varied.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.920
But it turns out that a lot of the time it comes down to the fact that the original ending that the director had planned

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.180
Was just too dark for general audiences. For this video

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.920
we're taking a look at some darker movie endings that ended up getting cut. Let us know what you think of these endings and be

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.540
Before we start, can you name this movie by looking at these emojis?

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.019
Hang on to your answer until the end. Here are 10 movie endings that would have been too dark for viewers.

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.009
"It's a cold sore never had one before, so, uh, started to cry"

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.149
Pineapple Express

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.179
When you think of great Seth Rogen comedies,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.230
2008's Pineapple Express probably isn't the first one that comes to mind. The movie is hilarious, but truthfully

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.930
it's forgettable and doesn't hold up to some of Rogan's better films. However, Pineapple Express may have been much more

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.359
memorable if the filmmakers had stuck with the original

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.189
ending that they had planned; as it stands the movie ends with Seth Rogen and James Franco

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.240
surviving the big shootout and

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.900
Recapping the whole thing over some breakfast. In the original

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.739
script, however, Rogen and Franco were going to stay in the warehouse get high and then ends up getting shot by a remaining bad guy

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.830
that they had forgotten about. It's a much darker way to end things

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.340
but who knows it may have made this comedy a little more memorable

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.660
"You're wrong. Soon i'll be dead, and you with me."

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.180
Star Wars episode six return of the Jedi

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.659
"Don't mess with the original trilogy" screamed every Star Wars fan watching this video. Alright, alright,

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.490
we won't but Producer Gary Kurtz

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.780
nearly did, as the first version of the script for episode five actually included the death of a major character.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.880
Kurtz actually wanted to kill off Han Solo in the movie during a raid on the imperial base.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.340
But George Lucas shut down this idea according to Kurt, Lucas liked the idea

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.610
but he was worried that it would hurt the sales of Star Wars merchandise

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.749
so he opted to keep Han Solo alive and well. Kurtz was pissed and ended up severing ties with George Lucas over this dispute.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.959
We have to wonder what his reaction was like when he saw Han Solo killed in 2015's The Force Awakens

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.960
Do you think he was happy to see the character finally offed? or was he upset

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.220
that lucas snatched his idea and used it many years later?

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.960
American Sniper

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.940
American Sniper is one of the more

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.100
divisive movies to come out in recent years as fans are split on how they feel about Clint Eastwood's

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.999
interpretation of Chris Kyle's Story. The movie definitely isn't a comedy,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.289
but it turns out that it was almost a hell of a lot darker than it ended up being. In the original

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.909
script the movie was going to show Bradley cooper actually taking a bullet at the shooting range,

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.929
but when Chris Kyle's actual widow called and asked to keep that moment out, the filmmakers obliged. She told the creators that this movie would

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.410
be how her children remembered their father and that they had to get it right, so

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.949
Eastwood opted to fade to black as cooper headed off to the shooting range.

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.759
The movie has definitely taken some heat for some of the things it showed

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.640
But we have to give it kudos for making this decision.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.600
"Nah, he used to look up in the sky and wonder

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.260
at our place in the stars."

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.660
Interstellar

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.780
After winning over the entire world with his Batman trilogy,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.310
Christopher Nolan divided the world with his confusing but impressive film Interstellar.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.680
Wherever you stand on the film as a whole, you have to acknowledge that there are a lot of good things in there and that

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.819
the ending is pretty cool and uplifting. Well, if writer Jonathan Nolan had gotten his way we would have seen a much different, much bleaker

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.660
ending. Fans got to see

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.329
McConaughey's coups succeed in sending messages back from the fifth dimension to help save humanity

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.410
But Jonathan Nolan's original crips had pooped dying when he entered the black hole Christopher is the director

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.100
So he had final stage and decided to go with the happier and more inspirational conclusion. "We just let the snowman be."

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.740
"Great. Well oh come on!

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.130
Disney Struck gold with

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.120
2013's frozen and we're guessing that they would like us to believe that everything we know and love about the movie was planned right from

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.789
the Get-go. Well that definitely isn't the case as

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:16.410
Frozen was almost a very different movie and Anna and Elsa were almost very different characters from the ones that fans now adore. The original

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.499
Script featured a much darker version of Elsa where she was actually slated to be the villain of the film. On top of that

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:29.489
Kristen Bell who voices Anna in the film revealed that her character nearly had a much more reductive and prissy princess role.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.659
Apparently after an entire year of working on frozen these characters were reworked to be the more fun and full princesses

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.600
We got to see the creators definitely made the right call as frozen has reached incredible levels of success.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.369
"You said on our very first date that you don't like flowers if they're a waste of money"

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.089
"Every girl likes flowers, Gary." The break-up

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.390
Vince vaughn and Jennifer Aniston did a great job of showcasing the trials and tribulations of a serious split in their

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.130
2006 comedy the break-up.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.700
But it turns out that the ending was almost quite different. The movie the public got to see wrapped up with a nice scene showing

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.319
exes vaughn and Aniston randomly running into each other on the streets and sharing a pleasant moment.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:17.879
The original Script didn't have this scene at all and the movie just ended with the two characters parting ways. The producers decided to add

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.880
The final scene because at the time

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.760
Aniston was going through a very public breakup with Brad Pitt in real life

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.429
and they didn't want it to seem like they were just telling her real world story they decided to add in the final scene to

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.540
Add some hope to the movie instead of ending on a grim note clerks clerks

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.859
Is one of the most beloved cult movies of all time and it's one of the only

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.799
reasons that everyone still put up with Kevin Smith's

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.949
Ridiculousness the movie does a great job of finding interesting

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.690
Moments in a mundane world and the ending the fans got to see seems to fit that mold

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.040
dante closes up shop

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.869
And then spend some time thinking about how he ended working as a clerk in a quick stop

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:00.748
However clerks almost wrapped up in a much more dramatic way as the original ending was much much darker

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:05.819
Kevin Smith actually filmed a different ending where the movie concludes with dante getting gunned down

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:11.878
By a burglar this would have left audiences with a very different taste in their mouth and we have to wonder if the film would

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.560
Have achieved as much success as it

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.359
Did what do you think do you like the ending the way it is or would you have gone [to] the darker routes?

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.169
If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball nice

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.349
Dodge ball one of the greatest underdog stories of all time

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.860
Dodgeball is a

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.099
Must-see for anyone who likes to laugh and enjoy?

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:39.778
Seeing the little guy triumph over the villain the movie ends with Vince vaughn's team of misted feeding ben stiller squad of mutants and everyone

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:41.729
Gets to feel good about themselves however

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:49.318
It almost didn't go that way as the original ending sauce [fillers] globo gym winning the tournament this ending apparently tested terribly

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:56.908
Everywhere except for Russia weirdly enough so the filmmakers decided to go [back] and reshoot a new ending that would leave audiences with a good

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:02.818
Feeling it might be a bit cliched, but sometimes it's nice [to] see the cinderella story completed clark

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:06.779
yre National Lampoon's vacation

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:10.829
one of the great comedy classics of all time the Chedi Chase

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:17.430
Led Family Comedy National Lampoon's vacation is jam-packed with ridiculous moments that are still funny today [chase] is

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:19.649
Amazing in the movie and his over-the-top

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:25.679
Character is so adamant about getting his family to Walley world that he actually seems somewhat insane. That's probably why?

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:33.749
Director Howald [ramos] actually shot another ending to the film that was much darker the alternate ending featured chases clark bringing his family to

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.849
Wally's home and forcing the creator of the part to entertain his family at Wally world at gunpoint

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:42.179
This dark ending tested Terribly with audiences

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.139
So it was dropped

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:49.948
But it honestly makes quite a bit of sense when you consider how insane clark Griswold really? Is that was a pretty good plan?

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.509
guardians of the Galaxy

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:59.068
Praised as being one of the most fun movies in the entire McU it's somewhat surprising to find out that guardians of the Galaxy

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:04.199
almost featured a darker and more emotional ending the movie concludes with fun scenes all

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:09.450
Main characters set to the classic song ain't no mountain high enough the montage is a hoot

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:16.140
but it almost included a few other characters that would have totally shifted the tone originally director James gunn wanted to check in with

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.649
Nebula and the Collector, but he decided against it in the end

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:25.920
That's not all though gun also revealed that there was originally going to be a very somber moment showing Peter quills grandfather

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.480
Reflecting on the abduction of his grandson while this would have been a nice character building moment

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.729
It totally would have killed the vibe of the happy ending. So it makes sense. Why they decided to leave it out

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.169
Well there you have it folks

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:43.439
There's our look at 10 movies that almost gave us much much darker ending would you have preferred any of these darker?
