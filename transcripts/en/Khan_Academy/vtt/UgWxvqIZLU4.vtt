00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
- [Voiceover] The sector
of a circle shown at left,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.888
I pasted it up here, has center point O.

00:00:06.888 --> 00:00:08.327
The radius of the circle is five,

00:00:08.327 --> 00:00:11.090
so we see we have part of
a circle right over here,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.954
so we have the arc AB,
and you see the radius

00:00:13.954 --> 00:00:16.218
from the center to any
point on that circle,

00:00:16.218 --> 00:00:21.129
so OB is five and the
length of chord AB is six,

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:26.041
and they've labeled that from
A to B, the length is six.

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:30.550
Line segment CO, this is CO, is

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.386
perpendicular to line segment AB,

00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:35.906
and they've labeled that for us as well.

00:00:35.906 --> 00:00:40.336
What is the length, L, of line segment CO?

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:43.175
What is the length, L, of line segment CO?

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:44.905
One thing that might
immediately jump out at you

00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:49.905
is we are dealing with a
right triangle up here.

00:00:50.858 --> 00:00:53.008
If you have a right
triangle, if you know two of

00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:54.227
the sides of a right triangle you can

00:00:54.227 --> 00:00:56.050
use the Pythagoreum Theorem to figure

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.365
out the third side of the right triangle.

00:00:59.718 --> 00:01:01.772
If we knew what CB was, if we knew the

00:01:01.772 --> 00:01:05.070
length of segment CB,
so let me pick out an

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.408
appropriate color, I'll do blue.

00:01:07.408 --> 00:01:11.748
Pythagoreum Theorem would tell
us that the length of segment

00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:16.747
CB squared plus L squared...

00:01:16.747 --> 00:01:21.498
Plus L squared...

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.884
I'll just do it all on
this. plus L squared

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:26.102
is going to be equal to
the hypotenuse squared,

00:01:26.102 --> 00:01:29.964
is going to be equal to 25.

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:34.377
But we don't exactly know the
length of segment CB just yet.

00:01:34.377 --> 00:01:36.537
It's tempting to say that
it's three, it looks like it's

00:01:36.537 --> 00:01:41.264
half of the six, but we don't
know that for sure just yet.

00:01:41.264 --> 00:01:44.608
What we do know for sure, is
look, if this is a right angle,

00:01:44.608 --> 00:01:47.069
then this is going to be
a right angle as well.

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.017
These two things are
supplementary to each other,

00:01:50.017 --> 00:01:51.480
they're gonna add up to
180, so this is going to

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.437
be a right angle, and if this
side right over here that

00:01:56.437 --> 00:01:58.711
has length L, it's common
to both of these triangles,

00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:03.365
so this triangle up here and
to this triangle down here.

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:05.873
Now the other thing that we
know about this triangle down

00:02:05.873 --> 00:02:09.727
here is that AO is also going
to be a radius of the circle.

00:02:09.727 --> 00:02:13.443
It goes from the center of
our circle to the, it actually

00:02:13.443 --> 00:02:17.610
sits on the circle, kind of
on the outside of the circle.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.209
If this is a radius, this
is also going to be five.

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.912
So what's the length of AC?

00:02:24.912 --> 00:02:26.746
Well we could use the same idea.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:29.114
We could relate A, C, L, and five,

00:02:29.114 --> 00:02:32.307
so we can say just by the
Pythagoreum Theorem, the length

00:02:32.307 --> 00:02:37.307
of segment AC squared plus
L squared is equal to 25.

00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:41.979
When you see it in these
terms, you see very clearly

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.720
that AC is going to be equal to CB.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.047
In fact, let me make that
a little bit clearer,

00:02:47.047 --> 00:02:51.145
so we could say if we subtract
L squared from both sides

00:02:51.145 --> 00:02:56.079
that CB squared is equal
to 25 minus L squared,

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.386
and we could write that AC squared is

00:03:00.386 --> 00:03:04.321
equal to 25 minus L squared, and so these

00:03:04.321 --> 00:03:07.886
two things are going to be equivalent,

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:12.886
so this is going to be equivalent
to that, right over there.

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:16.366
Now that is useful
because now we know that

00:03:16.366 --> 00:03:19.525
the point C is at the midpoint of AB,

00:03:19.525 --> 00:03:22.450
and so AC is going to be half of the six

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.552
and CB is going to be half of the six,

00:03:24.552 --> 00:03:26.768
and now we can say with
certainty this is going

00:03:26.768 --> 00:03:30.437
to be three and this is going
to be three right over there.

00:03:30.437 --> 00:03:32.213
Now once again, you might
have immediately jumped

00:03:32.213 --> 00:03:34.280
to that conclusion and
you would have gotten the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.240
question right, or you could
have jumped to it a little

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.402
bit faster without having to
write all this math and say,

00:03:39.402 --> 00:03:41.791
Hey, look, you know what,
I have two right triangles.

00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:44.112
I know that two of their
sides are the same,

00:03:44.112 --> 00:03:46.654
so the third side has
to be the same as well,

00:03:46.654 --> 00:03:48.837
so this is going to be the same as that,

00:03:48.837 --> 00:03:51.473
and so they're each going
to be half of the six.

00:03:51.473 --> 00:03:54.572
That's all you need now
to actually solve for L.

00:03:54.572 --> 00:03:59.541
We can say that three
squared plus L squared

00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:04.474
is equal to five squared, or we could say

00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:07.968
nine plus L squared is equal to 25.

00:04:07.968 --> 00:04:11.439
Subtract nine from both
sides, L squared is equal to

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.980
16, take the principal root of both sides.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.813
L is equal to the square root of 16.

00:04:17.813 --> 00:04:21.520
The principal root of 16, L
is going to be equal to four,

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.065
and we see that choice right over there.
