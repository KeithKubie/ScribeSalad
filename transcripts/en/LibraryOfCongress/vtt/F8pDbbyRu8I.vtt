congress in Washington DC.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.280
&gt;&gt; James Sweany: On
behalf of the Researcher

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.210

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.680
we welcome to this talk
featuring Sarah Cowan,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.290
who will discuss
textured abstractions,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.910
Howardena Pindell's
Cut and Sewn Paintings.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.210
We thank you for joining us.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.600
I'm James Sweany, assistant
chief of the Research

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.420

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.450
I would like to take a
moment and express those

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.320
who made this event possible.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.570
Particularly to May Metcalf,
reference specialist for women's

Howardena Pindell's paintings

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.310
with us.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.240
The Researcher and reference
Services Division provides

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.720
reference services and
collection development

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.380
for subjects that encompass
information and all formats

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.260
for the arts, humanities,
social sciences, local history

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.930
and genealogy in the
main reading room

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.820
of the Thomas Jefferson
Building.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.980
We ask that you please check

interrupt today's program.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.880
Also note that this presentation
is being filmed to be available

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.620
as a web cast on the
library's website.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.200
We will at the end
have time for questions

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.500
after the presentation,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.980
so if you ask a question you
are giving consent to be filmed.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.290
And now to introduce
Sarah Cowan,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.510
Meg Metcalf of the Research and
Reference Services Division.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.370
[ Applause ]

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.090
&gt;&gt;Meg Metcalf: Today I
am very excited to share

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.620
with you the work of a truly
interdisciplinary scholar,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.920
Sarah Cowan.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.840
Cowan, we just talked
about that.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.140
Oh, my goodness.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.250
Sarah is a doctoral candidate
in the History of Art Department

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.640
at the University of
California, Berkley.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.290
Her dissertation,
"Mending Abstraction,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.570
Howardena Pindell's
Non-Representation

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.800
of Black Feminisms,
19667 to 1986,"

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.580
examines how the artist
multimedia practice critically

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.440
inflects discourses of
advanced art and relates

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.780
to black women's
cultural traditions.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.090
This year she is also
a pre-doctoral fellow

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.470
at the Smithsonian
American Art Museum.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.280
After the presentation today we
will have time for questions,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.850
so please hold those to the end.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.420
So, without further ado, please
join me in giving a warm welcome

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.510
to our esteemed presenter,
Sarah Cowan.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.180
[ Applause ]

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.480
&gt;&gt; Sarah Cowan: Thank you.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.780
Good afternoon.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.080
Thank you all very
much for being here.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.060
I really love the work that I
get to do and I'm very grateful

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.450
for the opportunity to
share it with you today.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.010
In addition to thanking you
all for taking your time

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.970
for being here, I'd like
to thank Meg Metcalf

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.370
for inviting me to speak today
and thank you to the rest

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.620
of the staff at the
Library of Congress

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.540
who make public programming
like this possible.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.630
As Meg mentioned in
her introduction,

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.630
I'm a doctoral candidate
in the History of Arts,

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.250
which means that I spend most

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.050
of my days preparing
my dissertation,

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.260
which looks at the
first two decades

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.240
of the extraordinary currier
of US artist Howardena Pindell.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.160
That career started
in New York in 1967

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.300
and continues to the present.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.600
So, she's still alive
and making work.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.690
Today I'll be presenting
material adapted from one

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.780
of the chapters of
my dissertation.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.910
I think it's very apt that we
discuss Pindell's work today

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.680
in the context of a lecture that
honors women's history month.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.320
Not only is she a woman who has
made a profound contribution

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.470
to her field of modern art,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.360
but she has also
really devoted herself

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.040
to making the art
world more equitable

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.220
through her activism research

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.630
and advocacy she has shown
a light on the gender

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.600
and racial discriminations
that have persisted

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.020
in the culturally elite
sphere of contemporary art.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.590
And I think one of her more
important insights has been

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.280
to point out that the art world,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.310
including publicly
funded institutionism,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.760
has been shielded from some
of the kind of social change

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.150
that the public has demanded
of other institutions,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.130
such as our education system
or the corporate world.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.550
And she is both expanded what
is possible within modern

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.540
and contemporary art
through her artistic practice

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.650
and she's also worked to
assure that other women,

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.850
especially other women of color,

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.720
have opportunities
to do the same.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.190
S o, I'd like to start my
discussion today with a brief

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.530
and informal overview of
Pindell's 50 year career,

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.310
then I'll share my paper,
which looks at a small number,

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.020
it looks more closely
at a small number

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.910
of works she made
in the late 1970s.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.250
And then there should be a few
minutes for Q and A at the end.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.550
Excuse me.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.170
So, Pindell was born in
Philadelphia in 1943 at a time

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.060
when that city was
fairly segregated.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.610
She was raised an only child
in what she has called a

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.330
"Very middle class household."

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.080
Meaning for her that she
was constantly being dragged

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.710
around to various enrichment
classes, music lessons,

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.270
dance lessons, but she really
took to the visual arts

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.350
and started weekend
lessons in grade school.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.850
So, fast forward a few years.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.180
In 1961 she starts
as an undergraduate

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.800
at Boston University
as a fine arts major.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.350
She encounters a lot of
racist discrimination

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.100
in the university
and in the city.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.860
Her classes at BU
are very traditional.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.660
The emphasis is on how
to create the illusion

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.180
of three dimensional shapes on
flat surfaces through modeling

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.810
and linear perspectives,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.240
so concerns that had really
dominated academic art

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.710
since the renaissance
and issues like color

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.700
and composition are hardly
discussed in these courses.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.530
So, it was really a revelation

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.310
when in 1963 she made the
short trip to Cambridge

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.220
to see an exhibition at
Harvard's Fog Art Museum,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.890
called "Three American
Painters."

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.030
She encounters a totally
different way to think

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.470
about painting that ends
up being very impactful.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.470
Work by Frank Stella, including
this painting was on view

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.690
and this helps to inspire
her to apply for the Master

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.170
of Fine Arts Program at Yale,

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.420
where she knows she can get a
more sort of modern education.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.490
So, she -- excuse me --

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.860
enters the MFA program and
painting at Yale in 1965.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.160
And the focus there is much
more on form and color.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.270
She continues to
work figuratively,

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.110
but starts abstracting from
recognizable subject matter

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.640
in works like these,
where we can still kind

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.880
of see a relationship between
the objects or idea represented

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.610
in the titles and the
painting, but there's not

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.220
such a tight relationship,

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.460
sort of representational
relationship.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.840
So, in 1967 Pindell
graduates and moves

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.610
to New York City
to look for a job.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:46.020
After several months of a
very discouraging search,

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.810
as she tells it, she
fortuitously walks

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.940
into the lobby of the Museum
of Modern Art in Midtown

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.190
to use the restroom and she
figures while she's there she

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.270
may as well ask at
the front desk

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.450
if there are any positions
available and she ends

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.470
up getting interviewed
on the spot.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.930
In what starts as an
assistant position

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.840
in a traveling exhibitions
department,

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.480
turns into a 12 year
long territorial career,

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.540
one of the most prestigious
institutions

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.030
of modern art in the country.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.090
This has an enormous impact

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.710
on Pindell's life
and artistic career.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.280
It means that she is
seeing lots of art and lots

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.220
of different kinds of art,
she's meeting tons of people,

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.940
including other artists,

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.700
and she's developing what
she's a called duel identity

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.760
as an artist and a curator.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.510
So, she's learning how things
operate from the inside

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.980
of art institutions and
she's also experiencing them

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.440
as an artist who's trying to get
access to those institutions.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.830
Eventually becomes the
associate curator of Prince,

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.300
an illustrated books at MOMA.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.400
In the first decade of living
and working in New York,

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.950
Pindell drops figuration almost
entirely from her practice.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.310
She makes artworks that
are concerned with color,

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.390
like in these spray
painted compositions.

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:18.460
Two shapes, the circle and the
grid appear in the majority

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.240
of her works for
an entire decade.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.470
Can you all see the image on
the left, it seems really blown

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.900
out from here, but I can't tell.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.930
Okay, well, it will just
have to work anyway.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.210
So, the work on the
left is covered

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.750
in whole punch scraps or chads.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.790
These become really
emblematic of her work.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.860
They are collaged onto a matt
board, along with sewing thread

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.740
and powder and we see these
materials appear again

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.430
and again in her work.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.060
She also becomes through these
works very interested in texture

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.900
in these years and I'll discuss

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.410
that in greater detail
in my paper.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.610
So, these artistic concerns
situate Pindell in discourses

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.470
around conceptual and
feminist part practices

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.150
and also post-minimalist
art through her concern

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:15.490
for artistic labor and the
physical materials of art.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.800
In 1972 Pindell is invited

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.140
to cofound the first all
women's cooperative gallery

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.950
in New York City,
which was call A.I.R.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.040
And it is still running today.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.870
This gives her new
opportunities to show her work

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.460
and her conversations with other
women artists emboldens her

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.500
to work with feminine
coated materials

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.280
and processes for
the first time.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.630
But she also begins
to notice at A.I.R.,

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.190
as well as in her
fulltime job at MOMA,

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.170
that the predominantly
white feminist circles

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:52.300
that she was being invited
into are very reluctant to deal

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.330
with issues of racism.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.820
And for her, as a woman of
color, it seemed really natural

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.000
that feminism as a political
project aimed at the liberation

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.540
of all women, would have to
necessarily concern itself

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.410
with the intersection
oppressions of race and gender.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.190
But this expectation
isn't met and, in fact,

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.970
she encounters racism in
those feminist circles.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:25.020
Throughout the 1970s and 80s
Pindell travels internationally

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.870
several times visiting
Africa, Japan, Europe,

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.560
India and Brazil, to name a few.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.680
And this travel impacts her
art as she draws explicitly

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.270
from imagery and
cultural illusions gleaned

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.140
from these experience.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:46.810
Then in 1979 two traumatic
events cause a rupture

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.980
in Pindell's life and career.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.990
The first begins with a SoHo
gallery holds an exhibition

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:59.370
that uses a racial
slur in its title.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:03.420
The show presents abstract
charcoal drawings and black

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.350
and white photographs by
a young white male artist.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.920
And Pindell and other
artists, critics

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.470
and curators protest the
show for its provocative

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:17.530
and breezy use of
an anti-black slur.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.490
While Pindell had
participated in some

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:24.860
of the wide spread art world
activism throughout the 1970s,

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.380
this is the first time she takes

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.180
on such a public
leadership role.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.550
And the exhibition and protest
result in art world debate

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.160
around racism and censorship.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.170
And in the ensuing rancor that
this causes, Pindell resigns

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:45.470
from her post at MOMA as she
feels more alienated than ever

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:50.710
from colleagues who are
defending the exhibition.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.270
Within a couple of months

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.920
of leaving MOMA Pindell starts
teaching in the art department

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.590
at Stony Brook University
on Long Island.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.960
She actually still
teaches there.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.550
But at the start of her
first semester there she's

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.720
in a near fatal car accident

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.300
that leaves her physically
debilitated and with severe,

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.090
though temporary, memory loss.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.730
Pindell's work after 1979
starts incorporating figurative

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:23.080
elements, such as her silhouette
and photo transfer material.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.260
Oh, no, silhouette
photo transfer material.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.470
So, she uses the figurative
elements taken from magazines

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.790
and post-cards as
pneumonic devices

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:38.630
to help restore her memory
function after this accident.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:42.180
And she begins to talk about
her art as part of her attempts

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.030
to heal herself from
the accident,

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:49.250
as well as from the racism
and sexism she's experienced.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:55.240
In 1980 she makes perhaps her
most well-known work, the video,

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.110
"Free, White and 21," which
explores the hypocrisy

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:03.890
of white feminists who
refuse to see racism.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.020
And over the course of the
1980s and into the 90s,

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.720
the content of her work
becomes more overtly political

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.080
and her activism becomes
increasingly visible.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.900
She publishes documents
and statistics that attest

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.420
to the racial and gender
biases that are rampant

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.400
in the New York art world.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:28.440
She shares this work in many
formats, including it's believed

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.060
through the publications
of an anonymous woman

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.070
of color artist group
known as PESTS,

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.350
which promises to
bug the art world.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.420
Which I love.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.240
And essentially sets out
to remake the art world,

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:49.730
including her own work into an
intentionally politicized zone.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:54.140
In recent years Pindell has
returned to working abstractly.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.110
The last few years have
been really remarkable

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.080
for exposing her work to
new and larger audiences.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.080
She currently has a
retrospective on view

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.740
at the Museum of
Contemporary Art Chicago

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.800
that has over 130 works in it.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.290
If you have a chance to go
to Chicago in the next couple

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.180
of months, I hope you'll see it.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.390
and within the last
year examples

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.410
of her works have been
included in major exhibitions

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:24.020
at the Brooklyn Museum, the Tate
Modern, a show that traveled

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:28.390
to the National Museum of
Women in the Arts here in DC

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.820
and there's an example of
a cut and sewn painting

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.560
in up Outliers, an
American Vanguard Arts,

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.190
the National Gallery of Arts,

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.980
so I hope you'll get
a chance to see that.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.450
It's a little closer
than Chicago.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:46.470
So, this is a very exciting,
if somewhat urgently busy time

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.050
to be thinking about
Pindell's work.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:52.780
I hope this overview has given
you a little bit of a sense

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.080
of the shape of her career

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.640
if you weren't familiar
with it yet.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.560
And I will launch
into my paper now.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.890
Again, we should have a few
minutes at the end for Q

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.830
and A. These are
very washed out.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:10.080
I apologize that you won't
actually be able to see some

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.720
of the details that
I'm describing.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.570
You'll just have to hang
onto my words, I guess.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:19.370
So, in 1976 Howardena
Pindell began making cut

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:23.190
and sewn paintings by
cutting strips of canvas,

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:26.850
sewing them together into
a large rectangular grid

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.090
and covering them with
collaged and painted materials

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.790
to form an abstract field.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.420
Pale, pastel hues dominate
these all over compositions,

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:41.080
though there are specks
of more colorful color.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.390
There are specks of color
that model their surfaces

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.840
and a closer work,
which is solicited

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:53.980
by these colorful irregularities
reveals a dense nubby texture.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.960
Small pieces of paper,
which are chads produced

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.800
by a hole punch are ossified,
in gesso and acrylic paint

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.290
and countless of these
extend from the works.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.300
These protuberant
surfaces invite the viewer

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.220
to move around the paintings.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.520
And with different
views we catch glimpses

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.620
of the small shadows and
valleys cast by collaged chads,

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.720
the seams of canvas
strips and the sparkle

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.110
of a large quantity
of dust and glitter.

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:29.060
And even with the best
slides, not all of this,

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.900
like the glitter,
really translates

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.940
to digital photography.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.970
Viewed from up close the
paintings elicit a sense

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.270
of wonderment.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:42.860
Opening up questions about their
facture and the artist's labors.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.280
How did Pindell manage to apply
this massive material fragments

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.560
to the surface of the canvas?

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.690
How much time did such an
intricate technique require?

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.840
But the more pressing
question raised by cut

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.320
and sewn paintings arises from
the viewer's tactile curiosity.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.510
What does it feel like?

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.160
Modernist arts prohibition

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.320
against touch frustrates
direct response

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.760
to the edge of our fingertips.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.570
Rather our experience
of the paintings shovels

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.260
between the words textural,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.480
feel and the conventions
of viewership.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.430
Suggesting that something
could take root in the tension

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.490
between these ways
of knowing the world.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:32.260
Between 1977 and 1981 Pindell
completed six abstract cut

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.780
and sew paintings.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.560
On average each of the
paintings took 12 months to make

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.760
and measures around 7
by 8 and a half feet.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.620
So, they're very large.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.890
Five of the works
hang horizontally,

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.690
evoking landscapes.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.510
While a single example
is vertically oriented,

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.810
like portraiture.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.370
And the artist created them
in the hours you could squeeze

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.450
out of her work week, which
-- during which, as we know,

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:00.910
she was working fulltime
at MOMA.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.550
I argue that the dense
surfaces of the cut

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.580
and sew paintings mark an
understudy turning point

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.650
in Pindell's artistic career.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.840
The cut and sew canvases
mark the culmination

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.350
of her increasing
concern for an aspect

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.090
of painting beyond
the strictly visual.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:21.100
Texture, or what she has
called surface tension.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.240
I argue that largely
inspired by her exposure

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.160
to African textiles earlier in
the 1970s, Pindell used texture

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.010
as a vehicle to enmesh
illusions to forms --

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:37.510
to these forms with
administrative and craft labor,

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.190
feminist aesthetics and
modernist structures,

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:45.160
which are all kind of part of
the vocabulary of discourses

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.740
of so called advanced
art at this moment.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.720
With a surprising
combination of valiances,

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.270
some of which are
covertly conveyed,

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:58.830
she adapted abstraction
to a historically specific

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.370
and personal material culture.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:05.570
The paintings made use of
the openness of abstraction,

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:09.270
to dogmatize the
ambiguities and contradictions

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:13.900
that subtend social identities,
ministering specifically

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.990
to her multiple positions

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:20.970
as a white collar black
woman artist and curator.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.530
On July 24, 1973 Pindell
addressed a post-card

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.900
from Nairobi Kenya to her
friends, the art critic,

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.860
Lucy Lippard, and
artist Charles Simmons.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.380
Quote, "I will return
forever changed,

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.750
we are so ignorant of Africa.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.560
Kenya is full of
contradictions."

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.130
End quote.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.080
Written on the artists
second day in Africa,

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.440
the text captures her earliest
impressions of the continent.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.910
Over the course of
the following two

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:59.240
and a half decades Pindell
would publish four articles

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.750
on African art and culture and
speak on numerous occasions

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.040
about the relationship between
her work and African art.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.750
Her extended engagement
with African art,

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:13.010
textiles in particular,
led to a change

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.250
in the way she approached
texture

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.680
and the canvas in her paintings.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.390
A shift that for grounded the
pertinence of African textiles

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:24.130
to the aesthetics of modern art.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.980
These specific uses of
African art intervened

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.020
in the rigorous generally
figurative protocols espoused

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.570
by proponents of the black
arts movements in these years.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.150
Which I'll discuss in
greater detail in a moment.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:42.000
Pindell and Lowry
Stoke sense an educator

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.980
at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art and now a well known curator

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.230
and art historian, spent
two months traveling Africa

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.810
in the number of 1973,
under the auspices

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.340
of MOMA's overseas
books program.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.170
They visited Nigeria,
Senegal, Kenya,

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.130
Ghana, and the Ivory Coast.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:05.040
In workshops and studios they
saw artists make pottery,

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.180
starch died cloth,
petique, Kente cloth,

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.330
as we see here, and jewelry.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.900
While formative in the breadth

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.190
of artistic material
it introduced her to,

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.220
the visit to Africa was not
Pindell's first extended

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.090
encounter with African art.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:27.020
In the fall of 1972 MOMA
hosted the exhibition,

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.510
"African Textiles
and Decorative Arts."

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.920
Guest curator by Roy Sieber,

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.190
an African a space
Indiana University.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:41.480
The exhibition presented 250
examples of textiles, jewelry

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.990
and other objects
of bodily adornment

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.570
from sub-Saharan Africa.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:50.720
For the four month run
of the show in New York,

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.660
Pindell visited the
exhibition several times a week,

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.250
so you can do the math.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:59.500
She saw it many times.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.840
There was a -- she saw a
panoply of objects there.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.990
the vast majority of which
were designed to be warn,

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:10.640
held or applied to the body,
including, and I'm paraphrasing

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.220
from the press release, East
African bark cloth, woven cotton

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.760
and silk from Ghana and
Nigeria, body ornaments

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.420
and cosmetic accoutrements,
such as combs,

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.900
hair pins, wigs and tweezers.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.540
The exhibition was very timely.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.140
Since the late 1960s artists,
archivist groups in New York,

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.860
such as the Art Workers
Coalition

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:36.640
and the Black Emergency Cultural
Coalition had been organizing

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.440
to place pressure on the city's
public art museums to attend

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.510
to glaring inequities,
including around issues

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:46.080
of racial and gender inclusion.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.630
Whether or not the exhibition
directly fulfilled the demands

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.550
of these groups, it
was well received,

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:56.170
with one reviewer arguing
that it presented quote,

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.880
"Evidence of a self-reliant
creative powers

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.180
of the ancestors."

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.670
End quote.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.170
The exhibition appealed
to growing public interest

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:08.330
in Pan-African culture, which
had been spurred in part

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.210
by the efforts of leaders
of the black arts movement

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:14.700
to promote black
cultural heritage.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.660
Although Pindell did not
subscribe to the tenants

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.470
of the black arts movement,

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:23.590
African textiles peaked her
appetite for African art

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:27.640
and motivated her
to travel to Africa.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.730
This exposure to African art

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:33.170
and culture profoundly impacted
her art making practice,

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.860
with particular consequence
for the development

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.070
of the cut and some paintings.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:43.390
Most markedly she never again
stretched her canvases, instead,

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:46.840
allowing them to hang free
like the flowing garments

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.500
from South Africa, Senegal and
Nigeria on display in the museum

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.850
and she also left many of
the edges of her paintings,

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:58.270
of the unstretched
paintings sort of loose.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:03.030
The study of African
arts also inspired her

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:05.720
to incorporate a new way
of handling materials

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:10.020
into the production of the cut
and sewn paintings specifically.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.270
Weaving, several
of the canvases,

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.420
including untitled number 19,

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.550
partially comprised
interwoven strips of canvas,

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.840
and you can just make this
out some evidence of this

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.060
in the horizontal
scene on the right.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.090
Right there should
be a little bit

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.050
of green paint that
shows through.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.150
But again, I'm not
sure how much --

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:35.300
oh, you can see it, okay, great.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.140
So, Pindell fabricated
the cut and sewn paintings

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.990
through an elaborate
series of steps

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:42.280
that underscored her labor.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.620
And so bear with
me I'm going to try

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.950
to explain how these were made.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.850
Notably the paintings are not
painted in the traditional sense

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:54.770
of applying brush to
canvas, but fashioned

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:58.760
through an elaborate process of
accumulation that actually ends

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.970
up obscuring elements
of their construction.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:05.360
So, although they're
woven, you can only see this

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.390
in these little glimmers.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:13.690
She began by painting sheets
of thick paper in rainbow hues

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.370
and then excised
small dots from these

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.360
with a hole punch
creating those chads.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.780
These chads set aside
for later use,

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.510
she would fabricate her canvas.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:29.740
In some instances she folded six
to eight inch wide canvas strips

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.550
over and under one
another in a woven pattern,

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:38.060
sort of like a basket and
the intersecting vertical

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.370
and horizontal lines
formed a grid.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.720
And there's also a
grid in the works

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.540
where she's not folding them.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.170
So, sometimes it's just
little squares or rectangles

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.500
that they form a grid
or a partial grid.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:56.830
And this is very much visible
when you're standing in front

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.030
of one of the works in person.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:02.210
Pindell then hand sewed
the pieces of fabric

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.590
to form a seam ridden and
slightly irregular field

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:10.920
and you can see the thread in
some portions of the canvas.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.280
And at this stage she would
apply thick layers of paint

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.480
and then extrude them
through a hole punch stencil,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.350
so they're like these
tiny little plateaus

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.100
of encrusted paint
on the surface.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.920
And next the delicate work

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.450
of collaging the previously
painted chads began.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.840
So, she took those bags of chads

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:35.140
and she individually lodged
thousands of them into globs

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:40.660
of paint, layering them atop
one another, on their sides

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.620
and in the seams of canvas,
using tweezers and photo --

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.530
and dry photo matt spray.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:50.430
More layers of paint, a
careful application of glitter,

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:55.560
sequence, sometimes also cat
hair swept from her studio

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.930
and a final dousing of
what she has called, quote,

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:04.820
"All kinds of cheap perfume,"
completed the paintings.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.870
Whose finished surfaces,
although they would seem

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.390
to be really friable, are
actually pretty stable.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:16.310
The basic structure of
the woven paintings,

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.490
long strips of canvas,
and interlaced

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.720
into a horizontal/vertical
relationship,

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.940
resembles Kente cloth.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:27.900
The most recognizable of
African textiles, which can dull

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.160
and sense be woven on narrow
looms in Kumasi, Ghana.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:36.780
And can dull herself has
remarked on this resemblance.

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:40.340
Though the term Kente can
be applied to a wide variety

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.150
of textiles, patterns
and techniques,

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:46.730
it traditionally refers to
a strip woven textile used

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:49.820
as festive dress
and royal regalia

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.240
by the Asante people
of Ghana and Ewe.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:56.340
I'm sorry, of Ghana and Ewe
people of Ghana and Toga.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:00.490
So, this cloth consists of
three to four inch wide strips

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:03.280
of cotton or silk sewn together

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.710
in an alternating
over/under pattern

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:09.330
to create textiles
of various sizes.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:13.980
In her decision to interfold
portions of her canvases,

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.700
Pindell advanced a
fiber based approach

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.770
to the medium of painting.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:23.040
But she did so while mostly
maintaining rectilinear format

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:27.270
points to the facts that
the material support of much

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:30.830
of modernist art is, of
course, a textile canvas.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:34.840
She was aided in
seeing the residences

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.050
between African textiles
and modernist painting

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:42.630
by the exhibition at MOMA, where
the cloths were hung in ways

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.740
that made them immediately
visually accessible.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.000
Which is a convention
of modern art display.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.820
Rather than conveying their
bodily use and African context.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:56.640
And, in fact, the exhibition
traveled to Los Angeles

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.160
and there some of the textiles
were draped on mannequins,

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.440
so they were displayed in a
way that emphasized their use

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.090
in African context more.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:10.930
But not here at New York, in
New York where Pindell saw it.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.870
Give Pindell's relish for
African art, it is notable

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.520
that throughout the 1970s her
paintings conveyed her interest

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.350
exclusively through
material means.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:27.390
Particularly through their dense
and loose hanging textures.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:31.010
This tactic contrasted with
ideologies of black art

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:33.610
that were being generated
at the time.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.730
Beginning in the late 1960s,

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:39.020
agents of the black arts
movement, the cultural arm

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:44.240
of the broader nationalist
black power movement called

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.060
for art forms that would, quote,

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.760
stand for the spiritual
helpmate of the black nation.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.060
The urgent need

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.650
for revolutionary
cultural consciousness,

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:56.730
required black artists
to work collectively

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:00.530
to supplant the images,
values and associations

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.860
of a dominant white
American culture

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.370
with capital B black culture.

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:10.310
African imagery, such as
the outline of the continent

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:14.850
against Pan-African colors in
Nelson Stevens, "Jihad Nation,"

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.110
which we see on the right,
played an important role

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:23.350
in these efforts at artistic
and political consolidation.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:28.110
For a black artist to explicitly
evoke Africa in her work

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:32.840
at the beginning of the decade
of the 1970s, was to bring

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.250
or to risk bringing the
politics of black power

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:38.160
to the reading of her work.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.740
In this same discourse
abstract art came

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.500
to be coded as racially white.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.080
Poet and imminent black
arts promoter, Amiri Baraka,

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.850
for instance, argued
that, quote,

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.610
"Non-political black artists,

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:56.490
those who did not generate
overtly political content,

00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:01.100
did not exist in the black world
at all, but belonged entirely

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.780
in the tradition of white art."

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:07.240
An abstract artist with very
few exceptions were assigned

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.060
to this category of
the non-political.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.840
Art historian Darby English,

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.790
has noted that frequent
characterizations of abstraction

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:20.180
as irrelevant to black
experience, limited the range

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:23.080
of officially legitimated
artistic means

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.500
that were available
to black artists

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.430
and thereby established
a very exclusionary basis

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.030
for black art.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:35.960
Black artists working abstractly
were admonished b y spokespeople

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.850
for the black arts movement as
lacking political sophistication

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.470
or castigated as capitulating

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:47.330
to their oppressor's
cultural taste.

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.770
So, this characterization

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:52.100
of abstraction probably
feels overly constraining

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.430
to the present day audience.

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:59.180
But we do well to remember
that as conceptual artist,

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.960
Charles Gaines, has
reflected, quote,

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.790
"Part of the black
experience of modernism was

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:07.290
that historically
it was an ideology

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.600
that helped discriminate
against minority inclusion

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.450
in the art world of the
1960s and the 1970s."

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:18.440
the abstract art on view
in New York's museums

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.170
and gallery was overwhelmingly
produced by white artists

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:26.570
and it was only thanks to the
militant activism of artists,

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:30.850
writers and critics that
museums began in the late 1960s

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:34.660
to devote significant
gallery space to artists

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.920
such as Alma Thomas,
Sam Loving and Al Lux --

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.220
Sam Gilliam and Al Loving.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:51.860
So, given this context,
what was an abstract artist

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:56.240
with an affinity for
African culture to do?

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.550
Despite frustrations with her
reception, Pindell continued

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:04.610
to make paintings that
offered no apparent commentary

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:06.710
on black experience.

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:09.270
Producing unstretched
collage canvases

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:11.880
and later the cotton sewn works.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:16.150
However, over the course of the
1970s she began increasingly

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.710
to turn to texture as a
non-figurative technique,

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.920
for conveying both a conscious

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.100
and what she has called an
unconscious ancestral connection

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.650
to Africa and its
visual art, visual arts.

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:34.130
This extra visual strategy
I argued allowed her

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:36.640
to intertwine her
ongoing development

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.620
of a modernist painting practice
and growing artistic concern

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:45.540
for aspects of her social
identity that did not conform

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.480
to the normative category
of abstract artist.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.680
Which as I've indicated
by default was white

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.530
and white male subject positon.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:59.880
According to Pindell, her
encounter in African textiles

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.730
with a charm and emulate
encrusted batakari,

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:07.000
or war tunic, spurred
her to experiment

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.940
with dense accumulative
textures.

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:14.670
Small works on map or made
shortly after the exhibition,

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.190
display her first efforts

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:21.310
at lifting collage elements off
the two dimensional surface.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:26.820
Clusters of chads pile on top of
sewing thread that forms a grid.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.250
Some of the hole punched
scraps even balance improbably

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:35.390
on their paper thin edges, kind
of sticking out from the board.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:39.950
The accreted surface of
these works evokes though

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:43.200
on a smaller scale the
adherence of packets,

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.220
horns and shells
to the batakari.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.910
And with the cut
and sewn paintings,

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:51.270
Pindell first applied this
laboriously achieved lifted

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:55.010
collage technique on a
large scale at dimensions

00:35:55.010 --> 00:36:00.840
that would evoke both modernist
paintings and African textiles.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.700
But it was the psychic
resonances

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.870
of the accumulative
textures in African objects,

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:09.960
as much as their visual affects,
that drew Pindell to them.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.870
In African context, including
the Ghanaian culture of Akan,

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:17.610
which produced the batakari,
accumulations on the surface

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:19.710
of the objects have apotropaic

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.800
and empowering functions
for the wearer.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.660
Pindell adapted this concept
to her own work using the term,

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:30.430
"Surface tension," to describe
what she understood as the,

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:34.460
quote, "empowering function
of her collaged paintings,

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:38.680
whose textural qualities offered
a non-dominating orientation

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.480
toward the viewer."

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.540
The unintuitive connection
Pindell has drawn

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:48.720
between texture and empowering
affects is probably best

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.240
illustrated through a negative
example that she provides.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:57.370
Surface tension contrasts
with the manufactured finish

00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:00.650
of works, such as Richard
Serra's Cor-ten steel

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:05.280
sculptures, whose vast surfaces,
although they are textured

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.610
by the metal's protective
weathered layer,

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.780
lack traces of the
artist's hand.

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.290
Pindell believes that
through their scale,

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:19.050
which is quite large, and
repudiation of human labor,

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:21.430
such works propose a dominate

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:24.420
or disempowering
orientation toward the viewer.

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.550
The artist has removed
himself in some significant way

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:31.500
from the surface
of his sculpture.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.310
Surface tension, by contrast,

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:38.540
is capable of ensuring
viewers instant recognition

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.700
of the artwork as
a human creation,

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.320
by indirectly placing
the artist herself

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.870
on the surface of her works.

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:49.850
By awakening our
tactile curiosity

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.780
with their dense textures,
Pindell thought to make artworks

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.290
that did not alienate or
diminish their viewers.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.950
As clear theorist, Eve
Kosofsky Sedgwick writes,

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:03.880
"The sense of touch,"
quote, "makes nonsense

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:07.030
out of any dualistic
understanding of agency

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:10.530
and passivity, because
to touch is," quote,

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:14.250
"also to understand other
people or natural forces

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:17.970
as having effectually
done so before oneself,

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:21.750
if only in the making
of the textured object."

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:23.310
End quote.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:28.140
Each chad on a cut and sewn
painting indexes a squeeze

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.350
of Pindell's hand
against a hole punch,

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:35.580
and a subsequent meticulous
application of tweezers.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:39.250
A direct textural recording
of these past moments

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.470
of creation further
communicates to the viewer

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:47.600
that someone was here before
us, someone left these traces.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.680
Further, black feminist
art historians have noticed

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.770
that the tactile and haptic
have played important roles

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:59.150
in the cultural production of
women of the African Diaspora.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.300
And Pindell has herself
identified surface tension

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:06.980
as a common feature of works
by African diasporic artists.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:11.190
Huey Copeland argues that
black women have long, quote,

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:14.740
"turned to the haptic as a
resource for self fashioning

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.060
and for the preservation

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.860
of memories otherwise
lost to history."

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.160
End quote.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:25.280
A haptic can serve at once
as a supplement to the visual

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.050
and a refuge from it,
providing a sight of personal

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:31.500
and communal self-fashioning.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.720
In this light we night
understand Pindell's turn toward

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:39.470
texture as participating in a
black women's cultural tradition

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:42.350
that addresses the
denigrating terms imposed

00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:46.390
by euro American scopic
regimes or what cultural critic,

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.970
Michelle Wallace, has called
the, quote, "Negative --

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:54.190
excuse me -- negative scene of
instruction out of the visual,"

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:58.070
which traditionally cast
black women in stereotype.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:02.510
Pindell's theory of surface
tension implicated her own

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:05.690
bodily relationship to
the surface of her works,

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:07.730
in addition to her viewers.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:11.660
She has remarked that the
extensive handiwork involved

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:15.140
in the painting's fabrication,
punching, the cutting,

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:19.560
stitching, helped her weather
the constant disapproval she

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.420
encountered as a black
woman artist and curator.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.750
This disapproval
included the sense

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:30.140
that to the larger art world
she, quote, "Didn't exist."

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:35.140
The cumulative traumatic
stress of these conditions led

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:39.880
to experiences of what Pindell
has described as dissociation,

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:43.660
during which she felt,
quote, "Out of her body."

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:47.490
Tactile intensive work
in particular the process

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:51.490
of punching, of hole
punching intervened,

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.750
serving as a process the rough
which the artist could, quote,

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:58.990
"Connect with her body when it
no longer cohered as a result

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:01.730
of fractious social pressures."

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:04.580
Pindell's textural
engagement with the surface

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:09.210
of her works became, in her
estimation, a tool for, quote,

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:13.130
"Healing, that gave her the
energy to continue to make art

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:15.430
and show up at her day job."

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:22.420
Repetitive labor may strike
us as an unlikely strategy

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.220
for combating isolation.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:29.170
The hand cramping work of hole
punching a curious practice

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.180
for bodily restoration.

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:35.880
Pindell's use of physically
intensive processes,

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.820
in particular her extensive
use of an instrument associated

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:44.750
with bureaucratic procedure,
the hole punch, placed her work

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.590
in the leading discussions
of conceptual arts

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:51.930
and referenced her post at
MOMA as a white collar worker.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:54.470
Unlike many of the artists
who turn to an aesthetic

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:59.480
of administration in the
late 1960s and early 1970s,

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.940
Pindell was herself a
practicing bureaucrat.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:06.680
In fact, she punched some of
her chads from manila folders

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:11.720
that she pilfered from MOMA.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:16.300
There's also the matt boards
that we see, that is the ground

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.630
for the work on the left.

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:21.320
She got out of the
dumpster at MOMA.

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:27.730
They were cut out of mats that
were used to frame artworks.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:30.600
So, Pindell's intimate knowledge

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:34.990
of administrative labor throws
new light on the idea expressed

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:39.890
by artist Sol LeWitt in
1967 and who's an example

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.260
of whose work we see here.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.560
That under the logic of
conceptual art, quote,

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:49.470
"The aim of the artist would be
to give the viewer information.

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:51.530
He would follow his
predetermined premise

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:55.140
to its conclusion,
avoiding subjectivity.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:59.440
Chance, taste or unconsciously
remembered forms would play no

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.300
part in the outcome."

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.570
End quote.

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:07.200
Pindell's premise with the
cut and sewn paintings was not

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.590
that of the cataloging
clerk, as Lewitt suggests.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:16.070
By endowing administrative
materials with aesthetic intent

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.690
and more radically
the possibility

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:22.640
for psychic redemption or
healing, she put pressure

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.910
on a model of the
bureaucratic artistic laborer

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:28.420
as lacking subjectivity.

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:31.870
Rather she submitted
the administrative tools

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:36.190
of the hole punch and file
folder to a process or set

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:38.970
of rules of her own devising.

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:40.690
Perhaps as a black woman,

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:43.810
Pindell felt she could not
afford to forsake her claims

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:48.370
to a general authority, as
some conceptual artists did.

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:51.830
For in rarified fields
of cultural production,

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:54.540
black women, in the
words of Wallace, quote,

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:59.000
"Are systematically denied the
most visible forms of discursive

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.160
and intellectual subjectivity."

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.460
End quote.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:06.490
In Pindell's paintings the
durational and physical aspects

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:11.090
of handiwork could function as
an erasure gesture through which

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:16.250
to assert, rather than
renounce her authorship.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.140
Just want to check time.

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:21.840
Okay. The cut and sew
paintings do not hue closely

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.750
to a bureaucratic
aesthetic however.

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:28.850
Rather, they couch industrial
materials, such as paper

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:31.600
and string in the
craft processes

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.530
of collage, sewing and weaving.

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:38.630
The tension between the body
and machine captured by the cut

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:40.550
and sewn paintings didn't --

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:44.550
textures, speak to those
forms ongoing entanglements

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:46.860
under late capitalism.

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.010
And it does so against
the heralding

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:50.970
of technological innovations

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:58.430
that would putatively reduce
the role of labor in daily life.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:02.190
Perhaps unsurprisingly,
given this skepticism

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:05.770
about modern labor,
Pindell's primary interlockers

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:08.480
as she developed the
techniques used in the cut

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:13.380
and sew paintings were
fellow feminist artists.

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:17.470
In 1972, as you'll recall,
from my introduction,

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:22.220
she cofounded A.I.R. Here
Pindell could share her ideas

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:26.990
about abstraction, situate
herself in an artistic discourse

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:30.410
and garner opportunities
to show her work.

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:33.200
Significantly for the later
development of the cut

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.840
and sewn paintings,
her formal entry

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.520
into this feminist art
circle emboldened her

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:43.920
to embrace feminine coded
aesthetics for the first time.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.030
The cut and sewn paintings
are strikingly feminine.

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:52.950
Pindell's use of materials and
craft processes, such as sewing

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:57.420
and weaving, which create a
surface that resembles piecework

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:02.230
or a quilt, can be situated
in broader feminist efforts

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:06.790
to reclaim a cultural practices
historically associated

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:09.950
with women, which
had been disparaged

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:12.740
in modernist criticism.

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:16.530
The cut and sewn canvases
convey femininity in ways

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:20.350
that evoke feminine
bodily adornment.

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:25.250
In Carnival at Ostende,
areas of opalescent sheen,

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:26.550
which are reminiscent

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.700
of cartographically
masses are distributed

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.900
across a pale pink field.

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:36.360
I realize this probably doesn't
register, but you'll have

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.160
to take my word for it.

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:42.660
And in each of the hues,
sorry, each of the canvasses,

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:46.610
pastel hues, like peach,
pink, lavender, baby blue

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.470
or buttercream, are
the first color we see.

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:50.770
It's only when we get closer

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:53.360
that we see those
more saturated colors.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.940
And their surfaces are collaged

00:46:55.940 --> 00:47:00.180
with cheerfully colorful
confetti like chads and dusted

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:03.970
with glitter and sequence
that catch ambient light,

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:07.190
creating the impression as
one commentator has noted

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:11.500
that the paintings wink at
you as you walk by them.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.400
Originally feminine odors
bolstered these visual cues,

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.770
as I mentioned, Pindell
spritzed the canvasses

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:20.850
with cheap perfume,
which carried class,

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:23.310
as well as gender associations.

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:27.380
The scent created an
atmosphere around the works,

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:31.350
where viewers could take them
in a kind of literal sense,

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:34.560
because smell entails
the incorporation

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.350
of visible particles
into the body.

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:42.380
Scent amplified the feminine
presents of the paintings

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:45.890
and activated them
as surrogate bodies.

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:48.380
The perfume brought
another haptic residence

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:53.300
to the paintings, reaching
out and touching the viewer.

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:57.350
The conspicuous artificiality of
the paintings glitter sequence

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:02.400
and perfume proposed a
femininity that is put,

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.210
self-made and exaggerat4ed.

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:07.680
Even though those
markers are also subdued

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.570
and this abstract composition

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:15.500
that muffles their
flirtation with camp.

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:18.600
This sidelong approach
to femininity contrasts

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.030
with the more literal searches
for viable feminists --

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:25.550
feminine aesthetics
undertaken by feminist artists,

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:28.830
such as Miriam Schapiro
in these years.

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:30.230
Pindell's presentation

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:34.320
of bedazzled surfaces also
reminds us that for her

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.850
and other women of color
artists working in the context

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:42.780
of 1970s feminisms, notions
of femininity were complicated

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:46.140
by the implicit racialization
of womanhood

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:49.440
by voluble white feminists,
who took their experiences

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.070
as women to be representative.

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:57.630
And, again, really disavowed
the idea that women of color,

00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:01.400
the experiences of the women of
color around racism had anything

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.930
to do with what it
meant to be a woman.

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:06.960
With this in view,
the paintings tongue

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:11.270
in cheek feminine aesthetic
might signal a covert black

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:15.790
feminist politics, and not
only modernist criticism,

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:18.870
but also at accounts of
femininity that appealed

00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:21.570
to gender nature
and thereby served

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:26.710
to uphold racially exclusionary
notions of womanhood.

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:29.560
Finally, one of the
more provocative aspects

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.860
of Pindell's approach

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:34.650
to feminist art was her
adamant use of modernist forms.

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:36.970
Such as all over
abstraction and the grid.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:43.010
At the end of the 1970s Lupard
famously voiced the widespread

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:47.360
view that feminism was
antithetical to modernism

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:51.220
and her reflection that quote,
"Feminisms greatest contribution

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:55.190
to the future of art has
probably been precisely its lack

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:57.870
of contribution to modernism."

00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.950
End quote.

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:03.890
Without an easily identifiable
and unequivocal message,

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:06.100
abstract art was viewed at times

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:11.220
as a masculinist modernist
holdover by feminist artist.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.890
Black women artists then
were addressed by the demands

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:18.020
of black arts leaders
and feminists to work

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.900
in figuratively and
expressly political modes.

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:25.940
Artists Adrian Piper's remarks
that she made abstract work,

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:29.320
quote, "In the Garden
of Eden before she found

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:34.330
out she was a black woman," end
quote, suggests both a naiveté

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:37.680
that these cultural
discourses imposed

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:41.820
on black women abstractionists
and also the sobering reality

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:44.890
that their decisions to
work abstractly could result

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:49.610
in dismissal or other
forms of artistic exile.

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:54.940
To conclude, the cut and sew
paintings bring together what

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:59.230
we've often thought of as
irreconcilable forms of labor.

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:04.030
The paperwork of bureaucracy,
craft procedures, the routines

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:07.870
of feminine bodily
adornment, and the seclusion

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:10.550
of modernist studio painting.

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:11.870
But each of these speaks

00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:16.550
to Pindell's effortful
movement through the world.

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:20.250
They give us no clear,
singular or fixed sense of where

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:23.370
to place them or the artist.

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:26.720
Rather through their use of
texture and their overlaying

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.000
of the modernist grid can
take cloth and the quilt.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.750
The cuttings from paintings
surface the tensions

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:35.050
that Pindell encountered

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:38.620
in artistic discourses
of the 1970s.

00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:42.270
They knot and make less
comfortable supposed antinomies

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:46.090
of late 20th century
art, so as those posited

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:48.220
between African cultural
affinities,

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:51.750
feminist commitments
and modernist things.

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:53.520
Looking at them 40 years

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.720
after they were made they
ask us what possibilities

00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:00.530
and constraints we
continue to assign to art

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:01.830
and how these are mapped

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:04.430
onto the variously
bodied people who make it.

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:06.900
We have a lot to learn
from their questions.

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.700
Thank you.

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:16.360
[ Applause ]

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.790
Great, thank you all so much.

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:21.870
So, we do have a few
minutes for questions.

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:26.530
I will have to repeat the
question, so just so you know

00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:28.860
for the microphone, but yeah.

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:34.000
&gt;&gt; You said after the
accident she was doing --

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.050
using the art to
improve her memory,

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:42.550
help her improve her memory
or recall her memories.

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:43.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:47.300
&gt;&gt; Was that a known therapy
recommended by the doctor

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.850
or some person [inaudible]
on their own?

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:52.150
&gt;&gt; Good question.

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:56.540
So, the question was about after
Pindell had her car accident she

00:52:56.540 --> 00:53:01.640
was using post cards and
other materials to sort

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.270
of restore memory
function, was that something

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:07.630
that doctors had recommended
or something she pioneered?

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:11.960
My understanding is this was
something she was grappling

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:14.780
through herself and
was kind of intuiting

00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:20.610
that she could make connections
between people and places

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:23.150
and past events using images.

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:26.480
I haven't heard her talk
about being something

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:32.720
that was specifically
advised to her by a doctor

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.920
or someone else,
but I'm not sure.

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.810
It's really interesting
that this is --

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:40.670
basically she adapts
this therapeutic process,

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:43.410
something that she's not doing
into the context of her art

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:47.030
and introduces it
into the paintings.

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:50.350
And something I'm kind
of interested in thinking

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:51.980
through with the dissertation

00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:57.230
as a whole is how actually
the abstract works are also --

00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:00.340
she's also thinking
about these as being --

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.800
and the labor involved
in them as being sort

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.940
of therapeutic on some level.

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:09.310
Though that's less about
imagery and memory per se.

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:11.280
Yeah, right here.

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:15.780
&gt;&gt; Do you know anything about
whether relationships were

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:19.330
like with other black
female artists were working

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:20.630
at that time?

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:21.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:25.110
&gt;&gt; Because her position at MOMA
would have seemingly removed her

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:26.610
to a certain extent?

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:27.910
&gt;&gt; Right, great.

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:29.210
Excellent questions.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:30.510
So, the question
was about if I --

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:33.790
what kinds of relationships
Pindell had

00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:37.550
with other black women
artists at this time.

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:41.010
Yeah, so, it's interesting

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:44.740
because there other black
women artists obviously working

00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:46.580
in New York in the 1970s

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:50.470
and including black women
artists working in abstraction.

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:54.040
She does become friends
with Beverly Buchanan.

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.830
They are in conversation.

00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:59.040
She's good friends with Ari
Stooksoms [phonetic spelling]

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:02.800
who is a curator, not an artist.

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:09.420
She seems not to have formed
a real artistic community

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:13.430
with someone like Faith
Ringgold or Dindga McCannon

00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:16.990
or other women who are in
where we at who are sort

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:21.280
of adapting a black arts
movement, sort of format

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.260
to their experiences
as black women

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:30.790
in her working figuratively and
are less interested, I think,

00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:35.500
in the modernist inflected
work that Pindell's doing.

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.710
But, yeah, it's very --

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:39.400
the question of the sort

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.080
of different artistic
communities she moves

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:49.540
through in the 1970s is
complex, because she gets shown

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:53.830
in so many different
kinds of context.

00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:58.430
Largely through feminist shows
and she's often the only woman

00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:01.890
of color in those groups,
including in A.I.R.

00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:05.350
for the first several years,
she was the only black woman

00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:07.250
in that group and
she starts to feel

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:10.490
like she's really
being tokenized

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:12.310
by the feminist movement.

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:15.730
But it's also -- this
is also the context

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:19.450
in which she's getting the most
opportunities to show her work.

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:23.020
But, yes, absolutely she
was aware of and talking to

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:26.160
and thinking about the work
of other black women artists.

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.910
I think that she
was probably looking

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:33.530
at Betty Blayton's round
paintings and kind of interested

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:35.390
in exploring that more.

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:36.690
Thank you.

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:37.990
Yes, right here.

00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:40.680
&gt;&gt; You didn't mention
Jackson Pollock exclusively,

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:43.310
but you did have an
image of Pollock in it.

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:44.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:46.220
&gt;&gt; And I'm wondering to
what extent would her work

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:50.090
with surface tension be
seen as an implicit critique

00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:52.880
or [inaudible] to Pollock
or maybe even to Koenig,

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:55.320
who I also think of
as having a lot of --

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.800
because it's almost
like she's saying,

00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.990
"You can't just spill paint
on a canvas, first you have

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:01.340
to sew the canvas
and then you have

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.440
to carefully elaborate
[inaudible].

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.240
I know you have to
repeat that, sorry.

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, it's okay.

00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:08.690
I'll paraphrase.

00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:13.800
The question was about Jackson
Pollock, because I had an image

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:18.620
of his work up and if and how
Pindell's was maybe thinking

00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:22.630
through the drip -- if I
can paraphrase so much.

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:27.940
I included that installation
view because that exhibition was

00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:33.390
on view when Pindell started
at MOMA and she has talked

00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:37.970
about that feeling like she
had really like been immersed

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:39.590
in the center of the art world,

00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:41.810
that she was basically
being asked

00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:44.370
to be a gopher for those shows.

00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:47.960
It was being de-installed
when she started.

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:53.930
I think that compositionally
the drip paintings are one sort

00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:59.730
of important touchstone in
thinking about how Pindell gets

00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:04.620
to the all -- what's called --
known as "All Over Abstraction,"

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:06.580
that she's doing in the
cut and sewn painting.

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:10.200
Where there is not a sort of
pictorial center of gravity,

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.440
it's sort of an even
treatment all over.

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:16.620
She certainly thinking
about that legacy

00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:20.240
and she's certainly having a
very different relationship

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:23.580
to her canvas than
someone like Pollock

00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:28.100
who isn't touching the actual
canvas, for the, you know,

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:30.700
the majority of the process
is kind of at this remove

00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:33.840
and above it and she's
really getting involved

00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:37.530
in this very detailed way.

00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:39.880
Which, of course, is
also gendered, right,

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:42.150
detailed work is
gendered feminine

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:44.800
and I think that's
important for part

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.370
of the critique she
is offering here.

00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:52.440
Do we have time for
-- should we cut it?

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:53.740
Okay.

00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:58.270
&gt;&gt; You can do one more.

00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:00.500
&gt;&gt; Okay, Hannah.

00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.120
&gt;&gt; Thanks, that was great.

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:08.270
My question was,
in your discussion

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:13.840
of administrative paperwork,
[inaudible] the byproducts

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.320
of administrative paperwork.

00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:22.910
So, I was just wondering what
you think the stakes are of --

00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:27.760
as compared to conceptualized,
that really is using

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.840
like the true administrative
form, she's using the material

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:38.490
and not only the material, but
the byproduct material with it.

00:59:38.490 --> 00:59:41.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think this comes --

00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:45.910
I think my argument probably
comes more in to view

00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:47.210
in the more extended --

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:52.250
oh, sorry, I was supposed
to repeat the question.

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:56.470
It was about -- the question
was about administrative labor

00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:58.760
and specifically how the
chads are the byproduct

00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.840
of administrative labor, rather
than the actual kind of form

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:10.810
that a lot of conceptual artists
were using in the early 1970s.

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:13.030
So, I think in the
context of the fuller scope

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:17.860
of her body this actually
comes into view more,

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.880
because she first
starts working with chads

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:26.320
when she is numbering them with
ink and then collaging them

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:31.970
onto graph paper in this
very orderly fashion.

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:36.670
And I think in that
instance she is actually kind

01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:40.240
of like replicating make riffing

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:46.930
on making her own
kind of cataloguing.

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:49.900
If an illogical cataloging
process.

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.650
And, so, I'm trying to think

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:57.580
about how she develops
this different kind

01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.350
of relationship to the chad.

01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:01.470
I think that it sticks
around because

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:03.450
that was a really formative
practice and I think

01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:05.280
that the sort of stakes and
questions are on materiality

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.630
and bureaucratic labor are
really interesting to her,

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:08.130
even as she continues to make
the cut and sewn painting.

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:09.430
But your point is well taken.

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:10.730
It is very kind of abstracted

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:12.030
from that context
in these works.

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:13.690
Okay. That's it, thank you
all so much for being here.
