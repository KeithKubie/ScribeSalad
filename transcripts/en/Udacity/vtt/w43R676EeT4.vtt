00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.131
So here's the Folk Theorem. Any feasible payoff

00:00:03.131 --> 00:00:06.562
profile that strictly dominates the minmax or security

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:08.898
level profile can be realized as a Nash

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:13.690
equilibrium payoff profile, with a sufficiently large discount factor.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.380
&gt;&gt; Prove it.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.740
&gt;&gt; What we're going to do is we're going to construct a

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.277
way of behaving where both players are going to play

00:00:19.277 --> 00:00:22.980
so that they achieve this feasible profile. And the reason

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.730
to make that a Nash equilibrium, what we need to do

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.800
is make it so that it's a best response. And the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.350
way that we are going to make it a best response is

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.090
we're going to say do what you're told. Follow, follow your instructions

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.990
to achieve that feasible payoff. And if you don't, then the

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.810
other player is going to attack you, is going to adopt

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.640
a strategy that forces you down to your minmax or security

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.090
level, and that's your threat. So the best response to that

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.770
threat is to just go along and, and and do what

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.506
you're told to achieve that feasible payoff. The only

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:56.570
way that that's going to be stable though is if the

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.570
thing that you're asked to do, the feasible payoff, is

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.960
better than the minmax, right? Because that has to be

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.970
a threat. You can't threaten somebody and say, you know,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.519
do this or I'm going to give you candy. It's gotta

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.380
be do this or I'm going to do, give you something

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.170
that's less pleasant than what I've asked you to do.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.600
&gt;&gt; Okay, that actually makes sense.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is, this is a really cool idea.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.210
&gt;&gt; I like it. Hey, could you try saying that again,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.060
but with a Southern accent, just the Folk Theorem part?

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.940
&gt;&gt; Any feasible payoff profile that

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.640
strictly dominates the minmax/security level profile can

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.630
be realized as a Nash equilibrium

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.810
payoff profile with sufficiently large discount factor.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.343
&gt;&gt; I like that because now it's a folksey theorem. [LAUGH]
