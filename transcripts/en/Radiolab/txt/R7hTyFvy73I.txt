Speaker 2:          00:22          It's good to hear this. I'm like, I'm Jad Roberts, Radiolab and this

Speaker 3:          00:28          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:29          Oh, I can die. A happy man. So that was perfect. So here we go.

Speaker 4:          00:35          This is radio lab. I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich and this

Speaker 2:          00:41          sound of 700 people who have come to bear witness to the recording of our show today. We are in the Fitzgerald Theater at Saint Paul, Minnesota talking about these strange phenomenon that is the war of the worlds.

Speaker 4:          00:52          Know I, it's very great that everybody's here, of course. But this, there is one guy I really wish had been here. Who? That the Ecuadorian Guy Leonardo. Well, let's just, yeah, yeah, because he's the guy I want to ask. Like, what were you thinking? That's what I want. Well, he's dead. He's dead. Yeah. Well, but how Orson Welles, I would say to him, what, what were you thinking? I would say dead. Yeah. Yeah. How about the guy in Buffalo Buffalo? A missing retired? I don't know. That's ask somebody. So I found a guy who I think is definitely alive. I am Daniel Myrick, Cole writer, Co Director of the Blair witch project before making the Blair witch project and my Rick heard a recording of the war of the worlds, which he was pretty young at the time. He was a teenager. I just thought it was brilliant. I absolutely the coolest thing and more than anything else, he was impressed by the technique of the thing.

Speaker 4:          01:44          There's a couple of moments in particular where they cut to the kind of onsite reporter return you to call fill ups that drover's. Yeah, it's almost like cut in a second or two early and you hear the reporters saying, so are we on my arm? Are we, are we going to ladies and gentlemen? And then he goes into his into character. Here I am back with stone wall and it's those little beats, those little moments that really make it convincing. I get this kind of guilty excitement when I, when I know how it affected people. Myrick never forgot that sense of guilty, uh, excitement. He was fascinated by the idea that scary stories get even scarier if you think they're true. So years later, fresh out of film school, he and his friend Eduardo Sanchez decided to develop their own, uh, wells like product. It's your basic scary, which story three a kids go into the woods.

Speaker 4:          02:29          Okay, okay, okay, we're leaving right now. They get lost. They bump into the witch and then they die. Or they think they die. You'll just, you never see them again. But when you entered the theater to see the Blair witch project, the first thing that you'd see on the screen are these two sentences. It would read in October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary. A year later, their footage was found. So the suggestion here is that what we see is not a movie within our mind that you are in a movie theater, right?

Speaker 4:          03:07          And you're paid $10 and have some popcorn. Yeah. Yeah. But when you went, when you went sat down, what you saw was something called the found footage shot by three kids who have gone missing. And so these kids, you're not sure, but they might be real. Well, we picked a subject matter that was difficult to disprove to the Casual Observer Martians invading from outer space is you turn the channel to the next network and if no one's reporting about it, it's pretty well assured. It's probably fiction, but three missing students in the woods, you know, that's something that is a little harder to disprove without a fair amount of scrutiny. And it worked. We were getting calls from police wondering where these three kids were and how come they never heard of this case? You're kidding. Oh yeah. I mean it was constant. Oh people, we saw the whole thing and thought they saw something real.

Speaker 4:          03:56          Still do. I still getting emails occasionally on what part of the story is real, you know, is there still any phenomena out in Burkittsville and [inaudible]? It's all fiction and is all made up. And I think it reinforces what I think Ed and I suspected that so much of us wants to believe. Some people told Dan Myrick that after watching the sweet campers go in the woods, they themselves would never go camping again. And he thought that was fabulous. He loved [inaudible], blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Well, why would you not want people to go camping? I mean, we know honestly, why would you do that to people? I asked him. Well, I think that's the goal of any filmmaker. When you make a movie, whether you want people to laugh or cry or be scared, you're trying to affect people so viscerally and so emotionally that it has a resonating effect on them long after they've seen your movie. And I mean, that's why you're doing it. You know, we're not making this movie to kind of scare people. We were making the film to really scare people.

Speaker 5:          04:58          Okay.

Speaker 4:          05:00          No regrets on people not wanting to go camping afterwards. So the question is, is that what Orson Welles was up to back in 1938? Was he just trying to give people a good old fashion show business scare, make them scream away, up in the balcony? Because remember at the time, that is what he claimed, that this was simply an entertainment.

Speaker 6:          05:20          This is awesome. Well, ladies and gentleman out of character to assure you that the war of the worlds has no further significance, but as the holiday offering, it was intended to be the mercury theater, his own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a Bush and saying boom.

Speaker 4:          05:38          16 years later, Orson wells changed the story. Here he is on the BBC. The year is 1955 in fact, we weren't as innocent as we meant to be. When we did the motion broadcast, we were fed up with a way in which everything that came over, new magic

Speaker 7:          05:58          box, the radio was being swallowed. So in a way, our broadcast was an assault on the, uh, credibility of that machine. We wanted people to understand that they shouldn't swallow everything that came through the tap.

Speaker 4:          06:13          So here are two ways to think about the war of the worlds. One, it was a smashing entertainment using every trick they could think of including inventing some new ones to scare you. Silly master storytelling or or, and it was, we're trying to send you a warning. Don't trust everything you hear on the radio. It's not always true to which one was it. You think, well, I asked the professor Jason Lavilla [inaudible] me. Yeah, you, Jason m, he's a radio historian at the University of Maryland. He says that what Welles understood was that a newscast is often two things at once in a newscast. You hear something scary or disturbing sometimes, but it's going to be told to you in a way that's sues you, meaning the authority of the voice, the newscasters, steady voice coming through the radio. It will calm you like President Roosevelt's famous fireside chat.

Speaker 7:          07:08          Hi Friend. I want to prop for a few minutes with the people of the United States about banking. He's so calm, so in charge. He says, Professor Olivia, when you study the rhetoric that Roosevelt used, he really did convey two messages. One we're in terrible danger. And two, I've got it covered. And that is the sort of the, the authoritative voice coming out of the darkness. This sort of invisible, disembodied voice of the powerful man. Um, the news anchor timber 22nd, 1940 and we'll see this with Moreau on the rooftops.

Speaker 8:          07:44          Britain standing on a roof top during the plane looking out over London, straight in front of the, now it was your two sounds and Justin Mama are they on?

Speaker 7:          07:55          He's giving us a story of an unfolding emergency,

Speaker 8:          07:59          I should think in a few minutes. There may be a bit of shrapnel around here,

Speaker 7:          08:02          but his mastery of the information, his mastery of his own voice, his bravery on the scene,

Speaker 8:          08:09          you may be able to hear the sound of guns off in the distance. Very thankfully. Like someone kicking a tub.

Speaker 7:          08:14          This was the beginning of the formatting of fear, the formatting of crisis. It's sort of a ritual where we're sort of evoking a terrible danger and then somehow assuaging those fears through the performance of the news. And so people go to the news not to be afraid, but to be afraid. And then to be reassured.

Speaker 4:          08:37          Robert [inaudible], you file things for the news. Yeah. Do you buy this? That a news reporter does these two things simultaneously scares and then reassures and then scale. You never go, you know, go cover the governor and say, first I'm going to scare them, but then I'm going to assuage them. You. No one would do that. Why else would you talk that way? I mean, not you. Oh, but I mean

Speaker 2:          08:56          the, the, the, the anchors. Well, sometimes you actually,

Speaker 4:          08:59          th th the form in of the news is a, because the guy is always there because he's an anchor. That's what the word means. It is a reassuring thing to see them night after night to telling and telling. But Loving Leo says that the real genius of the war of the worlds was that wells put you into a newscast where you expect anchors to anchor and you expect reporters to report. And then he kills the reporter and the anchor, and suddenly you're left all by yourself in your own living room all alone.

Speaker 9:          09:31          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:31          That is exactly right. The moment of the war of the worlds broadcast, which still frankly terrifies me. It's this moment, right? Yeah.

Speaker 10:         09:39          It's like some head on the tell you to play by the woods running every way coming this way down by 20 yards by, right.

Speaker 2:          09:52          It's like that silence is terrifying. No anchor, no reporter, no one to reassure you. Okay, but forgetting that for a moment. What about his second lesson that he had to teach us the thing about don't believe the radio. What about that? Did it work?

Speaker 4:          10:07          Well, professor at Leo says, if that is really what wells was trying to do, if you believe that, well then he failed. Actually, he worse than failed the war of the worlds. Not once, not twice. We've shown you three broadcast tonight. It was so good at grabbing an audience and sucking them in that the wills formula, you might call it, the newscast that scares you enough to keep you listening has been adopted by of all folks. News

Speaker 9:          10:32          right now at 11 at night of shopping during the to a night of fear, swarming over boardrooms, flooding, cities and towns, Muslim immigrants, teens, texting and driving. It's a deadly mint terror in the toilet and sink holes and landslides, python in the clot, a rabid baby go terrorists working at one of our airports.

Speaker 4:          10:52          So many newscasts tease you with things that aren't quite true. Terror in the toilet. Pythons in the potty mean it may be, there will be true snake somewhere near a toilet tree facility of some kind. But it probably wasn't the python and it probably wasn't your toilet, but you don't know that. You want to hear that it belongs to Mrs. James C McGillicuddy of 2114 beauday boulevard and not you. So you, you want to be reassured and so you listen and so you fall in. And if Orson Welles retelling a Martian invasion story by hg wells at most people already knew if he could grab us

Speaker 9:          11:29          and then if they could do it again in Ecuador and then if they can do it again in Buffalo, what does that tell you? It tells you that we can't help ourselves, even if the headline is slightly preposterous, even if it's slightly scary, even if it's slightly false, we will listen. The fear that these broadcasts generate now suck us in and you'd think that 70 years later we'd be more sophisticated and critical. When the local newscaster tells us that there's something we're feeding our children that could kill them in, they'll tell us after the news the way I still listen. I'm a media critic and I still wait through the commercials to see what is it that I'm doing to kill my child. Even if it's really implausible, your shoelaces will kill you after this beat method. I somehow it gets me every time. Yeah, and wells knew.
