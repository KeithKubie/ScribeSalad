we've been sharing with the community

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
we've been sharing with the community
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.300
we've been sharing with the community
here some of the major insights that

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310
here some of the major insights that
 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.910
here some of the major insights that
we've been working on and in practical

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920
we've been working on and in practical
 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.709
we've been working on and in practical
advice that we are working to spread

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719
advice that we are working to spread
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.569
advice that we are working to spread
around the world in terms of how to make

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579
around the world in terms of how to make
 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.790
around the world in terms of how to make
our world a safer place and I think this

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800
our world a safer place and I think this
 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.130
our world a safer place and I think this
is really important information to be

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
is really important information to be
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.410
is really important information to be
share and basically one year ago the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
share and basically one year ago the
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.479
share and basically one year ago the
world had very little sense of the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
world had very little sense of the
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.600
world had very little sense of the
impending global economic crisis and

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610
impending global economic crisis and
 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.250
impending global economic crisis and
there's consensus among many within the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260
there's consensus among many within the
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.750
there's consensus among many within the
international security realm at least

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
international security realm at least
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.939
international security realm at least
some that there's another incipient

some that there's another incipient
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.830
some that there's another incipient
crisis right around right around the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
crisis right around right around the
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.889
crisis right around right around the
corner and that is the crisis of

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899
corner and that is the crisis of
 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.240
corner and that is the crisis of
international security how do we keep

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
international security how do we keep
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.750
international security how do we keep
ourselves safe from terrorism from from

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
ourselves safe from terrorism from from
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.810
ourselves safe from terrorism from from
nuclear proliferation and from violent

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
nuclear proliferation and from violent
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.480
nuclear proliferation and from violent
conflict and what we've realized is that

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
conflict and what we've realized is that
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.550
conflict and what we've realized is that
the nature of conflict has changed

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560
the nature of conflict has changed
 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.730
the nature of conflict has changed
significantly over the past 15 20 years

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
significantly over the past 15 20 years
 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.800
significantly over the past 15 20 years
and indeed we found that there's a lot

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
and indeed we found that there's a lot
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.780
and indeed we found that there's a lot
more interesting conflict conflict

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790
more interesting conflict conflict
 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.210
more interesting conflict conflict
within States regional conflict than

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220
within States regional conflict than
 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.399
within States regional conflict than
interstate conflict additionally there's

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
interstate conflict additionally there's
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.859
interstate conflict additionally there's
been more fragmentation so we're finding

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869
been more fragmentation so we're finding
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.810
been more fragmentation so we're finding
increasing divisions within rebel

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820
increasing divisions within rebel
 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.940
increasing divisions within rebel
movements governments for example in the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
movements governments for example in the
 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.450
movements governments for example in the
DRC and elsewhere and on and on a number

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
DRC and elsewhere and on and on a number
 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.999
DRC and elsewhere and on and on a number
of different ways that conflict has

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
of different ways that conflict has
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.440
of different ways that conflict has
changed in our world the question though

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
changed in our world the question though
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.539
changed in our world the question though
is ultimately how are we going to deal

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
is ultimately how are we going to deal
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.429
is ultimately how are we going to deal
with conflict large-scale violent

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
with conflict large-scale violent
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.109
with conflict large-scale violent
conflict in our world most effectively

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119
conflict in our world most effectively
 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.780
conflict in our world most effectively
and this is a tough question there are a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
and this is a tough question there are a
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.609
and this is a tough question there are a
tremendous number of people working hard

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619
tremendous number of people working hard
 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.679
tremendous number of people working hard
to deal with the situation around the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
to deal with the situation around the
 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.380

a couple of key points come out first of
 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.710
a couple of key points come out first of
all there's something we call the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
all there's something we call the
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.870
all there's something we call the
prevention principle it's incredibly

prevention principle it's incredibly
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.130
prevention principle it's incredibly
important for the international

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140
important for the international
 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.749
important for the international

what can we be doing today to prevent
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.080

the emergence of violent
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.540
the emergence of violent
conflict in the future I mean who can be

doing what now we should be pressuring
 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.410

now yes the economy is critically

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489
now yes the economy is critically
 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.460
now yes the economy is critically
important but if we only focus on the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470
important but if we only focus on the
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.500
important but if we only focus on the
economy then we are leaving a very

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
economy then we are leaving a very
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.330
economy then we are leaving a very
fragile world where fragile states are

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
fragile world where fragile states are
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.940
fragile world where fragile states are
going to become very chaotic States and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950
going to become very chaotic States and
 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.280
going to become very chaotic States and
in this borderless world we will all be

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290
in this borderless world we will all be
 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.250
in this borderless world we will all be
victim to those kinds of complexities of

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260
victim to those kinds of complexities of
 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.920
victim to those kinds of complexities of
our world secondly we've been talking

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930
our world secondly we've been talking
 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.210
our world secondly we've been talking
about the importance of talk of

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220
about the importance of talk of
 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.350
about the importance of talk of
negotiation and it's in many ways

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360
negotiation and it's in many ways
 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.670
negotiation and it's in many ways
obviously important when people have

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680
obviously important when people have
 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.350
obviously important when people have
differences to talk about those

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360
differences to talk about those
 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.360
differences to talk about those
differences yet it doesn't always happen

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370
differences yet it doesn't always happen
 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.280

in the international spectrum especially

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290
in the international spectrum especially
 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.259
in the international spectrum especially
with so many different kinds of actors

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269
with so many different kinds of actors
 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.420

non-state actors and it's our belief

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430
non-state actors and it's our belief
 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.490
non-state actors and it's our belief
I'll speak personally it's my belief

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500
I'll speak personally it's my belief
 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.520
I'll speak personally it's my belief
that that is extremely important to talk

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530
that that is extremely important to talk
 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.650
that that is extremely important to talk
especially to those we consider your

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660
especially to those we consider your
 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.110
especially to those we consider your
enemy if your goal is ultimately peace

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
enemy if your goal is ultimately peace
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.080
enemy if your goal is ultimately peace
and talking in today's world we've also

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090
and talking in today's world we've also
 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.970
and talking in today's world we've also
realized has its great complexities

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980
realized has its great complexities
 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.160
