00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.870
Movie trailers are made to entice you to go
to the theater and buy that outrageously large

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.630
bucket of popcorn.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.420
Trailers help studios to decide if the film
is going to be a hit or not and that’s why

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.840
studios pay attention to the number of views
a trailer gets when it hits the Internet.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.580
We are able to find hidden details that hint
at what the film is about or what will happen

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:30.089
to a favorite character just by watching a
trailer.

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.050
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Hidden
Details in Popular Movie Trailers That Went

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.050
Unnoticed.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:43.530
Stick around to learn more about the upcoming
Justice League film and don’t forget to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.820

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.820
LOGAN

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.220
Weapon X is one of the greatest X-Men out
there and since 2017’s Logan will be Hugh

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.840
Jackman’s last outing as the mutant.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.910
We are excited to see how they end his characters
story.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.090
Some items we learned from the Logan trailer
doesn’t give us much hope for a happy ending

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.090
though.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.239
Mutants are dying left and right and Wolverine
and Professor X are aging drastically.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.290
We can also see that Wolverine is no longer
healing without the presence of scares, so

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.330
what is going on with mutants?

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:19.700
We hope they figure out what is taking out
the Mutants and Logan finds happiness.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.840
GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY Vol. 2

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.020
Before Guardians of the Galaxy was even released
Marvel already announced their plans to make

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.020
a sequel.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.670
The writer and director, Peter Gunn vows to
keep as much of the plot of the sequel out

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.240
of the trailers as possible.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.910
Still, we can learn a lot from the trailers.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.830
For instance we see a smaller and now immature
Groot but if we look closely at a prison breakout

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.970
scene we notice he is wearing a Ravagers outfit
and symbol.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:51.860
It looks like he teamed up with Yondu Udonta
and the new mix tape is going to kill.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.910
THE FATE OF THE FURIOUS

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.740
The newest Fast and Furious film being released
in 2017 is the eighth film and this time the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.810
variation of the name is The Fate of the Furious.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.930
Not only is there a wrecking ball scene, which
we hope isn’t accompanied by a Miley Cyrus

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.789
song but joining the cast is the Oscar winning
actress Charlize Theron.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.590
Theron plays bad girl, Cipher and we see from
the trailer that Vin Diesel later uses the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.500
mask behind her on the wall.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.549
How far will Diesel betray his friends in
this newest installment and does he actually

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:22.870
know what he is doing?

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.500
If we don’t find out in this film maybe
we’ll find out in Furious 27 scheduled for

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.599
release when Diesel is in his eighties.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.599
SPIDER-MAN HOMECOMING

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.019
Last time we saw Peter Parker he was taking
down a giant Ant-Man in 2016’s Captain America:

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.019
Civil War.

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.430
Fans of Spider-Man were excited to see a pair
of eyes that react and a Parker that actually

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.110
looks like he’s in high school.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.670
In the trailer for Spider-Man Homecoming we
actually see a few hidden gems about the MCU.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.129
Not only did we see a bad guy in a Hulk mask,
but in Parker’s science class we also see

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.840
a photo of Banner.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.209
If you didn’t get enough Stark in the trailer,
Tony’s dad Howard is featured in a mural

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.700
in a hallway too.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.719
BLADE RUNNER 2049

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:12.129
Harrison Ford will be reprising his role in
Blade Runner 2049, which is sure to be an

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.239
awesome film.

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.319
Ryan Gosling joins him this time around and
with the short one-and-a-half-minute trailer

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.700
we can pick up a thing or two about the film.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.150
When Gosling walks into a building, which
we can see it is called, “Vintage Building”

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.590
by the rug on the floor.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.499
There are also Korean words in the window,
which translates to “Lucky or Fortunate”

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.829
in English, and we hope the film is both.

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.730
CARS 3

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:42.499
In the second sequel of the Cars franchise,
Cars 3, the team gets back together for more

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:44.069
laughs and racing excitement.

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.701
During the newest trailer we see Lightning
McQueen in a dramatic, slow motion crash.

00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:50.920
In the beginning of the trailer we see McQueen
in a crash than later on in the trailer we

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.540
see him in a crash again.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.329
But there are big differences between the
two, the first one is during the day and the

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.810
second is at night.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.180
Looks like the first one is a dream or back
flash sequence because the colors are diluted

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.170
and the characters are not defined also.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.170
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.359
The upcoming Beauty and the Beast live-action
film is a remake of the 1991 classic animated

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.659
film with the same name.

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.360
With the original film the Beast was transformed
as an adult into a beast because of his cold-hearted

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.790
and selfish ways.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.851
In the animated film he slashes a painting
of himself as an adult but in the trailer

00:04:25.851 --> 00:04:29.470
for the upcoming film he slashes one of a
young boy.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.430
Is the Beast transformed as a boy in this
remake and grew into an adult beast?

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.190
We’ll find out soon along side Emma Watson.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.320
JUSTICE LEAGUE

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.660
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice teased
us with the Justice League team by introducing

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.820
the characters in an email attachment.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.000
One character was Cyborg, who is played by
Ray Fisher and will be in the upcoming Justice

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
League film.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.930
In the trailer we see we’re going to get
a back flash scene with Victor Stone.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.550
Traditionally he should be in high school
but since he doesn’t look under eighteen

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.910
they put him in college.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.570
Check out that lettermen jacket, who knew
Gotham City had a University and why didn’t

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.190
I apply for that school?

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.630
PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MEN TELL NO
TALES

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.030
Since the release of 2003’s first Pirates
of the Caribbean film, the world wanted more

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.040
films with the eccentric pirate Captain Jack
Sparrow.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.480
Johnny Depps played this Oscar nominated character
in every film and we can’t imagine anyone

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.480
else doing it.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.260
In the trailer we are introduced to a character
named Henry that is behind bars.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.110
We can presume this is Orlando Bloom and Kiera
Knightley’s son because Henry is Bloom’s

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.360
characters middle name.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.520
Not to mention he looks like their child.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.520
WONDER WOMAN

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.680
Ever since 2016’s Batman v Superman: Dawn
of Justice the Internet has been a buzz about

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.890
Gal Gadot starring in her own film.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.620
When watching the trailer for 2017’s Wonder
Woman we learned that even though the DC superhero

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.540
could take hits from a genetically-engineered
monster she can’t take a bullet.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.150
In numerous shots from the trailer she deflects
bullets in slow motion to protect others from

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.800
death but then deflects one aimed at her.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.860
Also was there a reference to Doctor Poison
in the trailer?

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:18.610
There you have it ten hidden details in popular
movie trailers that went unnoticed and don’t
