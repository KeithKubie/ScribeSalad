Ray Kurzweil has argued that we're on

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049
Ray Kurzweil has argued that we're on
 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.800
Ray Kurzweil has argued that we're on
our way to a singularity that is that if

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810
our way to a singularity that is that if
 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.900
our way to a singularity that is that if
you look at the change and the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
you look at the change and the
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.799
you look at the change and the
interaction of scientific fields over

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809
interaction of scientific fields over
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.259
interaction of scientific fields over
the course of the last century or so and

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269
the course of the last century or so and
 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.269
the course of the last century or so and
you project it forward what you see is

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279
you project it forward what you see is
 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.950
you project it forward what you see is
not a linear progression but an

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
not a linear progression but an
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.260
not a linear progression but an
exponential progression which means that

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
exponential progression which means that
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.060
exponential progression which means that
as things change they're going to change

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
as things change they're going to change
 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.779
as things change they're going to change
more rapidly so that the curve will mean

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789
more rapidly so that the curve will mean
 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.240
more rapidly so that the curve will mean
that over a very short period of time we

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250
that over a very short period of time we
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.160
that over a very short period of time we
will make giant leaps in scientific

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170
will make giant leaps in scientific
 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.069
will make giant leaps in scientific

sophistication what he's argued about
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.170
sophistication what he's argued about
that is that that is going to reach the

that is that that is going to reach the
 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.660
that is that that is going to reach the
kind of critical mass which will mean

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
kind of critical mass which will mean
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.100
kind of critical mass which will mean
that at some point and there are

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
that at some point and there are
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.510
that at some point and there are
different dates that have been projected

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520
different dates that have been projected
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.590
different dates that have been projected
but it's not that far in the future

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
but it's not that far in the future

so change the nature of life that it's

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
so change the nature of life that it's
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.119
so change the nature of life that it's
impossible on this side of that moment

of that singularity I happen to think

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
of that singularity I happen to think
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.850
of that singularity I happen to think
he's wrong I think that things will

change I think things will change
 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.460
change I think things will change
dramatically but I don't think that

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470
dramatically but I don't think that
 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.469

our interactions with different
 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.640
our interactions with different
scientific fields look one of the things

scientific fields look one of the things
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.770
scientific fields look one of the things
that we have found out over and over and

that we have found out over and over and
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.530
that we have found out over and over and
over again in when we talk about biology

over again in when we talk about biology

over again in when we talk about biology
and biotechnology is that things are

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
and biotechnology is that things are
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880
and biotechnology is that things are
much more complex than we think they are

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
much more complex than we think they are
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.130
much more complex than we think they are
first we were going to decode the human

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140
first we were going to decode the human
 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.600
first we were going to decode the human
genome and that was going to open up

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610
genome and that was going to open up
 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.580
genome and that was going to open up
everything we needed to know about the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590
everything we needed to know about the
 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.380
everything we needed to know about the
nature of life and then we said oh no we

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390
nature of life and then we said oh no we
 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.179
nature of life and then we said oh no we
just finished the human genome but we

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
just finished the human genome but we
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.800
just finished the human genome but we
don't really understand the proteins

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
don't really understand the proteins
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.539
don't really understand the proteins
that these genome that disease genes

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
that these genome that disease genes
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.060
that these genome that disease genes
code for so we have to map the proteome

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070
code for so we have to map the proteome
 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.710
code for so we have to map the proteome
and we have to get all of these proteins

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
and we have to get all of these proteins
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.289
and we have to get all of these proteins
together and then people said oh no

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299
together and then people said oh no
 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.280
together and then people said oh no
that's not going to be enough because

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290
that's not going to be enough because
 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.200
that's not going to be enough because
now we've kind of discovered epigenetics

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
now we've kind of discovered epigenetics
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.300
now we've kind of discovered epigenetics
and we realize that the the genome is

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310
and we realize that the the genome is
 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.590
and we realize that the the genome is
mediated by all kinds of cellular

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600
mediated by all kinds of cellular
 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.359
mediated by all kinds of cellular
mechanisms that decide what gets

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
mechanisms that decide what gets
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.070
mechanisms that decide what gets
expressed and how it gets expressed and

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
expressed and how it gets expressed and
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.620
expressed and how it gets expressed and
what and that's how things go

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630
what and that's how things go
 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.610
what and that's how things go
the same things happen in the brain

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620
the same things happen in the brain
 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.340
the same things happen in the brain
sciences where a lot of our assumptions

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350
sciences where a lot of our assumptions
 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.080
sciences where a lot of our assumptions
about the way the brain work and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090
about the way the brain work and
 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.350
about the way the brain work and
synaptic relationships and and mid-level

brain organization turned out to be much

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670
brain organization turned out to be much
 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.250
brain organization turned out to be much
more simplistic than we thought it was

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260
more simplistic than we thought it was
 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.990
more simplistic than we thought it was
and we still don't really understand how

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000
and we still don't really understand how
 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.080
and we still don't really understand how
the brain works and I think what we're

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090
the brain works and I think what we're
 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.890
the brain works and I think what we're
going to find over time is that rather

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900
going to find over time is that rather
 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.740

than convergence leading us to some sort

than convergence leading us to some sort
of unified idea is that there will

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209
of unified idea is that there will

of unified idea is that there will
constantly be this kind of complexity

constantly be this kind of complexity

constantly be this kind of complexity
fall out as we learn about things deep

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810
fall out as we learn about things deep
 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.710
fall out as we learn about things deep
more deeply and and and more deeply we

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720
more deeply and and and more deeply we
 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.990
more deeply and and and more deeply we
will discover that in fact there's all

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000
will discover that in fact there's all
 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.880
will discover that in fact there's all
kinds of peripheral work to be done that

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890
kinds of peripheral work to be done that
 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.820
kinds of peripheral work to be done that
we couldn't even imagine looking forward

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830
we couldn't even imagine looking forward
 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.410
we couldn't even imagine looking forward
and what that means is you're not going

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420
and what that means is you're not going
 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.910
and what that means is you're not going
to have a convergence towards a

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920
to have a convergence towards a
 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.410
to have a convergence towards a
singularity but you're going to have a

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420
singularity but you're going to have a
 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.680
singularity but you're going to have a
very complex set of guide of moments

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690
very complex set of guide of moments
 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.809
very complex set of guide of moments
where things will change in a lot of

where things will change in a lot of
 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.890
where things will change in a lot of
different ways and I think these things

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900
different ways and I think these things
 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.400
different ways and I think these things
singularity is actually a very

singularity is actually a very
 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.620
singularity is actually a very
simplistic idea and it misunderstands

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630
simplistic idea and it misunderstands
 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.789
simplistic idea and it misunderstands
the complex nature of biological life

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799
the complex nature of biological life
 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.699
the complex nature of biological life
and physical life and you know physics
