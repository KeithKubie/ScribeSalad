00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.399
Science is everywhere. In nature’s beauty,
in a laugh between friends, the buildings

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:13.880
we build, and the communities we form. It’s
constantly wondering...asking, why things

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.580
are the way they are. How can we make things
better? What are we in the grand scheme of

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.369
the universe? It spans from the depths of
space to the device you’re watching this

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.099
video on, right now.

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.519
During the Enlightenment era, scientific revolution
brought ideas around calculus, atomic theory,

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:37.390
and gravity to our world; the Industrial Revolution,
saw significant technological and manufacturing

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.410
developments including the first cars; and
in the Digital Age, scientists helped spur

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.450
the formation of the internet as we know it,
as a means to share research and ideas. Today,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.420
advances in medicine and agriculture have
saved more lives than have been lost in all

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.969
the wars in history.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:01.520
But, despite these achievements, science and
society are often at odds. Scientific discoveries

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.369
like the Earth is round, that our planet revolves
around the sun, or that diseases are spread

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.979
through germs were all once ideas that were
rejected by society. So much so that Giordano

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.080
Bruno was burned at the stake for suggesting
the Earth wasn’t the centre of the universe,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.430
and even Galileo was sentenced to house arrest
for supporting the theory. Today we see the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.939
rejection of scientific evidence for vaccinations
- leading to preventable disease like measles

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.020
coming back, after being wiped out in the
year 2000; or the rejection of scientific

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.780
evidence for climate change, despite the vast
consensus among scientists.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.930
As put by Carl Sagan “We live in a society
exquisitely dependent on science and technology,

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.040
in which hardly anyone knows anything about
science and technology”.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.070
And yet when we look to history, we see that
ignoring science has lead to the crumbling

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.200
of societies. Ancient Greece was a time of
great learning around ideas of space, time

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.619
and light and during the subsequent Roman
Empire these ideas were mostly embraced. However,

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.800
the Romans were complacent with the learnings
of the Greeks, and little innovation or exploration

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.209
of new ideas around science and knowledge
took place during this era. With shifting

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.459
governments and values, emphasis on reason
and science slipped away and Rome eventually

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.110
fell into the Dark Ages.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.610
Today, despite the voices of many supporting
logic and reason, this war on science continues.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:35.239
In the UK, investment in publicly funded research
has dropped to less than 0.5% of the GDP - the

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.459
lowest it has been in two decades. This year,
the US has cut at least 300 million dollars

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.780
from NASA’s earth-science budget - which
just happens to include climate science. Not

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.860
only does this mean that existing climate
studies will be ignored, but useful data won’t

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.590
even be collected in the future, all to serve
ideological agendas.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.819
But for what? The bank bailout in America
cost more money than NASA’s entire 50 year

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.319
running budget - a budget that stirs imagination
and visions for the future of our world and

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.180
universe. And the military budget? One month
of spending is equivalent to NASA’s entire

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.080
annual budget.
Here in our home of Canada, the War on Science

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.790
is in full effect under Stephen Harper’s
Conservative Government. Our science libraries

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.700
dedicated to health, environment, fisheries
and oceans are being shut down. Laws that

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.049
were once in place to ensure the protection
of endangered species have been gutted, with

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:38.799
80% of Canada’s 71 freshwater fish species
currently at risk of extinction. And not only

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.750
has Prime Minister Stephen Harper eliminated
the National Science Adviser role, but some

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.819
2500 federal scientists have lost their jobs.
In a recent survey, 90% of government scientists

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.450
felt they could not speak freely about their
research and roughly 25% say they have been

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.849
forced by the government to change their research
for non scientific reasons.

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.450
We’re told that the remaining funds are
geared towards science that has a clear commercial

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.299
output. Which at first glance may seem fair
- research that isn’t a ‘waste of money’

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:15.319
so to speak. But, when Einstein constructed
the theory of relativity, did he know that

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:21.000
it would lead to the development of GPS, nuclear
energy, or the original television? These

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.620
industries are worth billions, but focusing
on commercial output is shortsighted, as science

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.500
is often a slow, evolving, iterative process.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.240
Science is much more than a body of knowledge
and applications; it’s a way of thinking.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.750
A way to unravel the world’s mysteries,
see it’s beauty - where we can look at all

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.270
the facts to make informed decisions, instead
of relying on preconceived notions and bias’.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.720
Science doesn’t choose a political party
- it simply adheres to evidence. But just

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.930
like good policy is supported by science,
science is supported by funding and advocacy

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.250
from our governments. So when you head to
the polls to vote, wherever you may be, remember

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.509
that a vote for science, is a vote for knowledge
and progress based in reality. Look at your

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.470
parties policies on science, and take a stand.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.259
If you believe in the message of integrating
science successfully into our societies, please

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:20.330
share this video - on facebook, on twitter,
through email and in person - to remind the

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.289
world how important science is.
