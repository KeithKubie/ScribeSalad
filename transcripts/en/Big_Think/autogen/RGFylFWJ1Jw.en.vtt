00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.160
in in creating some new utopia from
scratch than I am in really reckoning

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170
scratch than I am in really reckoning
 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.660
scratch than I am in really reckoning
with the world that we live in today and

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670
with the world that we live in today and
 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.289
with the world that we live in today and
how each of us can take ownership of

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299
how each of us can take ownership of
 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.249
how each of us can take ownership of
what we've created for ourselves and to

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259
what we've created for ourselves and to
 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.960
what we've created for ourselves and to
live in it in a more humane and

live in it in a more humane and
 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.870
live in it in a more humane and
thoughtful way mm-hmm so I tend not to

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880
thoughtful way mm-hmm so I tend not to
 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.920
thoughtful way mm-hmm so I tend not to
thing in in in big grand gestures of

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930
thing in in in big grand gestures of
 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.770
thing in in in big grand gestures of
remaking new cities what is our new city

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780
remaking new cities what is our new city
 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.449
remaking new cities what is our new city
look like because we we don't have the

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459
look like because we we don't have the
 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.030
look like because we we don't have the
opportunity

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040
opportunity
 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.830
opportunity
to make new cities anymore and we don't

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840
to make new cities anymore and we don't
 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.990
to make new cities anymore and we don't
make them overnight and the ones that we

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000
make them overnight and the ones that we
 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.030
make them overnight and the ones that we
do tend to be miserable disasters

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040
do tend to be miserable disasters
 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.130
do tend to be miserable disasters
because they're created by one or two or

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140
because they're created by one or two or
 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.250
because they're created by one or two or
a handful of people for the masses

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260
a handful of people for the masses
 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.289
a handful of people for the masses
imposing our will upon you know people

that will never meet so I tend to be
 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.059
that will never meet so I tend to be
much more interested in movements in

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069
much more interested in movements in
 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.949
much more interested in movements in
ways of taking back control of what
