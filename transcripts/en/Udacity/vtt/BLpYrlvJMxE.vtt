00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.570
So here is our stage manager approval process. And

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.800
if I scroll down, so I've got these initial

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.100
submission actions, approval steps, final approval actions, final rejection

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.930
actions, all these different things. What's, what's going on here?

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.360
&gt;&gt; So actions and approvals are the same thing as they are in work flows,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.000
you know, creating an email, or sending

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.040
an email, creating a task, updating a field.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.590
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.770
&gt;&gt; But the great thing about approval processes, you can add

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.050
in actions throughout all the steps of the process.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.310
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.630
&gt;&gt; So initial submission actions are the actions that

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.440
are fired immediately after someone submits a record for approval.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.580
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.270
&gt;&gt; The approval steps are the pieces of the flow that,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.620
you know, happen as it's going down the line of approvers.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.650
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.610
&gt;&gt; Cause you could have one approver, just one manager. Or, you could send it

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.250
down a list of managers if you wanted a bunch of people to approve it.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.960
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.620
&gt;&gt; Then there's the final approval actions, which

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.980
is after either the last person approves it.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.450
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.440
&gt;&gt; Rejects it, or maybe somewhere along the way, someone

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.390
was like, recall this approval, like, I want to take it back.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.610
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.800
&gt;&gt; And so you can set up.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.440
&gt;&gt; all your actions.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.810
&gt;&gt; Actions for all the parts of the flow.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.630
&gt;&gt; Very cool. Okay, that makes sense.
