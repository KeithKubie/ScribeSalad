00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.060
This season on Direct From

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.280
We're in the Palestinian town of Nabi Saleh

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.460
We travel to the occupied West Bank

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.120
Right across the road over there is the illegal Israeli settlement of Halamish

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.480
to meet the teenage girl who's become an icon for Palestinian resistance

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.120
and we go to Canada,
where indigenous activists and water

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.700
protectors are fighting for their land

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.160
These protesters have taken over one of the busiest intersections in Vancouver.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.300
How far are you willing to go stop this pipeline?
–It's in my blood not to stop.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.840
This is unceded traditional territory. You’re not welcome here!

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.460
And fighting for their safety.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.320
It flashed through my mind that it could be a body that we were trying to pull up.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.780
They come across remains and you don't know if they're human or not, or if they're your sister.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.480
The march is to send a message to

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.260
the men who prey on them that they're
being watched by the community.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.900
They feel like they don't deserve it. But they do.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.940
Put the camera down. Okay, okay!

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.740
This is total chaos right now…

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.220
