inside the Milky Way and every other

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:04.720
inside the Milky Way and every other
 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.679
inside the Milky Way and every other
galaxy there is a giant black hole at

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:07.689
galaxy there is a giant black hole at
 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.320
galaxy there is a giant black hole at
the center and it's hard to explain

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330
the center and it's hard to explain
 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.810
the center and it's hard to explain
where these came from but even more

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820
where these came from but even more
 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.040
where these came from but even more
peculiar is the fact that at already at

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050
peculiar is the fact that at already at
 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.220
peculiar is the fact that at already at
early times there are billion solar mass

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230
early times there are billion solar mass
 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.840
early times there are billion solar mass
black holes that these weigh a billion

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850
black holes that these weigh a billion
 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.050
black holes that these weigh a billion
times as much as the Sun and this is at

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060
times as much as the Sun and this is at
 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.970
times as much as the Sun and this is at
a redshift of six Red chief tells you

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980
a redshift of six Red chief tells you
 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.220
a redshift of six Red chief tells you
how much more dense the universe was at

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230
how much more dense the universe was at
 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.389
how much more dense the universe was at
that time and so you have to in very

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399
that time and so you have to in very
 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.389
that time and so you have to in very
rapid fire do something from forming

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399
rapid fire do something from forming
 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.189
rapid fire do something from forming
these foes first pro two stellar objects

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199
these foes first pro two stellar objects
 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.399
these foes first pro two stellar objects
collapsing them probably to make in it

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:41.409
collapsing them probably to make in it
 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:42.930
collapsing them probably to make in it
before my work people thought you made

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940
before my work people thought you made
 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.119
before my work people thought you made
relatively small stars and how you're

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129
relatively small stars and how you're
 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.489
relatively small stars and how you're
going to grow those up to making million

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:47.499
going to grow those up to making million
 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:49.200
going to grow those up to making million
and billion solar mass black holes is a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210
and billion solar mass black holes is a
 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.189
and billion solar mass black holes is a
is a puzzle and so one of the

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199
is a puzzle and so one of the
 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.139
is a puzzle and so one of the
contributions we made was to say hey but

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149
contributions we made was to say hey but
 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.119
contributions we made was to say hey but
we think that the first stars can be

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129
we think that the first stars can be
 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.279
we think that the first stars can be
quite a bit larger and then it would

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289
quite a bit larger and then it would
 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.770
quite a bit larger and then it would
make sense for the large black holes to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780
make sense for the large black holes to
 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.619
make sense for the large black holes to
be able to form we think that these

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629
be able to form we think that these
 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.249
be able to form we think that these
these black holes grow by accretion but

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259
these black holes grow by accretion but
 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.080
these black holes grow by accretion but
the accretion is in a disk so it's a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090
the accretion is in a disk so it's a
 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.969
the accretion is in a disk so it's a
it's a flat ring around the black hole

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979
it's a flat ring around the black hole
 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.370
it's a flat ring around the black hole
so the stuff is swirling around in the

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380
so the stuff is swirling around in the
 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.260
so the stuff is swirling around in the
accretion disk and it's moving pretty

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270
accretion disk and it's moving pretty
 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.929
accretion disk and it's moving pretty
rapidly and in do and before it falls

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939
rapidly and in do and before it falls
 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.819
rapidly and in do and before it falls
into the black hole it's giving off

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829
into the black hole it's giving off
 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.760
into the black hole it's giving off
radiation so what you're looking for is

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770
radiation so what you're looking for is
 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.670
radiation so what you're looking for is
the radiation of this stuff that's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680
the radiation of this stuff that's
 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.230
the radiation of this stuff that's
falling into the black hole and from

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240
falling into the black hole and from
 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.560
falling into the black hole and from
studying that in addition to what you

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570
studying that in addition to what you
 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.910
studying that in addition to what you
are already saying about the motions of

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920
are already saying about the motions of
 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.620
are already saying about the motions of
other things around the black hole you

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630
other things around the black hole you
 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.450
other things around the black hole you
can you can infer that the black hole

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460
can you can infer that the black hole
 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.020
can you can infer that the black hole
should be there

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030
 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.719
the galaxy is a galaxies and in fact the

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729
the galaxy is a galaxies and in fact the
 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.920
the galaxy is a galaxies and in fact the
universe as a whole have the they're

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930
universe as a whole have the they're
 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.780
universe as a whole have the they're
made of different pieces in the atomic

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790
made of different pieces in the atomic
 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.340
made of different pieces in the atomic
matter actually is only very small

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350
matter actually is only very small
 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.050
matter actually is only very small
portion so the the rest being the dark

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060
portion so the the rest being the dark
 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.270
portion so the the rest being the dark
matter and in fact this is it's kind of

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280
matter and in fact this is it's kind of
 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.219

its revolutionary over the past decade
 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.020
its revolutionary over the past decade
that this has become clear that if you

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030
that this has become clear that if you
 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.340
that this has become clear that if you
add up everything that we're familiar

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350
add up everything that we're familiar
 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.070
add up everything that we're familiar
with on a daily basis such as your body

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080
with on a daily basis such as your body
 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.100
with on a daily basis such as your body
that walls the planets all these things

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110
that walls the planets all these things
 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.229
that walls the planets all these things
all that atomic matter only adds up to

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239
all that atomic matter only adds up to
 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.199
all that atomic matter only adds up to
four percent of the total content of the

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209
four percent of the total content of the
 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.430
four percent of the total content of the
universe and the the other breakdown is

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440
universe and the the other breakdown is
 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.199
universe and the the other breakdown is
in terms of dark matter and dark energy

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209
in terms of dark matter and dark energy
 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.479
in terms of dark matter and dark energy
and right now we're talking about the

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489
and right now we're talking about the
 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.920
and right now we're talking about the
dark matter which is the predominant

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930
dark matter which is the predominant
 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.590
dark matter which is the predominant
bulk of the mass in the in the galaxies

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600
bulk of the mass in the in the galaxies
 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.949
bulk of the mass in the in the galaxies
and clusters and so on so when people

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959
and clusters and so on so when people
 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.559
and clusters and so on so when people
study these first stars they were aware

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569
study these first stars they were aware
 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.350
study these first stars they were aware
that they form inside these big globes

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360
that they form inside these big globes
 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.340
that they form inside these big globes
of dark matter and at the center of this

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350
of dark matter and at the center of this
 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.660
of dark matter and at the center of this
of the dark matter you have a

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670
of the dark matter you have a
 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.030
of the dark matter you have a
protostellar cloud of hydrogen and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040
protostellar cloud of hydrogen and
 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.610
protostellar cloud of hydrogen and
helium that's that starts to collapse so

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620
helium that's that starts to collapse so
 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.440
helium that's that starts to collapse so
our contribution was to say well but

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450
our contribution was to say well but
 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.620
our contribution was to say well but
what about that huge bulk of material

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630
what about that huge bulk of material
 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.780
what about that huge bulk of material
that's out there doesn't it play a role

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790
that's out there doesn't it play a role
 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.690
that's out there doesn't it play a role
in in this star formation process

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700
in in this star formation process
 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.729
in in this star formation process
especially because these first stars are

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739
especially because these first stars are
 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.740
especially because these first stars are
forming smack in the middle of these of

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750
forming smack in the middle of these of
 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.690
forming smack in the middle of these of
these these spherical regions are called

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700
these these spherical regions are called
 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.840
these these spherical regions are called
halos so these halos of dark matter

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850
halos so these halos of dark matter
 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.039
halos so these halos of dark matter
especially near the Centers is where a

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049
especially near the Centers is where a
 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.840
especially near the Centers is where a
lot there's a huge amount of dark matter

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850
lot there's a huge amount of dark matter
 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.220
lot there's a huge amount of dark matter
in there and that's where your stars for

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230
in there and that's where your stars for
 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.340
in there and that's where your stars for
me so what we think happens is that the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350
me so what we think happens is that the
 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.680
me so what we think happens is that the
there is a a kind of dark matter power

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690
there is a a kind of dark matter power
 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.069
there is a a kind of dark matter power
basically the dark matter particles and

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079
basically the dark matter particles and
 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.420
basically the dark matter particles and
the ones that we believe there's a lot

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430
the ones that we believe there's a lot
 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.309
the ones that we believe there's a lot
of experiments going on right now to try

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319
of experiments going on right now to try
 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.470
of experiments going on right now to try
to detect these particles and I think

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480
to detect these particles and I think
 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.880
to detect these particles and I think
that it's going to be resolved in the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890
that it's going to be resolved in the
 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.170
that it's going to be resolved in the
next five years ten years at most and

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180
next five years ten years at most and
 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.140
next five years ten years at most and
the most likely candidate they're called

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150
the most likely candidate they're called
 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.520
the most likely candidate they're called
wimps which stands for weakly

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530
wimps which stands for weakly
 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.879
wimps which stands for weakly
interacting massive particles so and

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889
interacting massive particles so and
 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.979
interacting massive particles so and
these wimps whenever there's two of them

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989
these wimps whenever there's two of them
 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.160
these wimps whenever there's two of them
that that find each other they interact

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170
that that find each other they interact
 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.220
that that find each other they interact
among themselves and they actually

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230
among themselves and they actually
 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.229
among themselves and they actually
annihilate so they lose their original

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239
annihilate so they lose their original
 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:53.830
annihilate so they lose their original
identity and

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840
identity and
 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.930
identity and
they turn into something else but in

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940
they turn into something else but in
 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.130
they turn into something else but in
that annihilate that annihilation

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140
that annihilate that annihilation
 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.949
that annihilate that annihilation
process dumps a lot of heat into this

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959
process dumps a lot of heat into this
 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.589
process dumps a lot of heat into this
protostellar material so you've got this

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599
protostellar material so you've got this
 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.119
protostellar material so you've got this
protostellar cloud that's trying to

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129
protostellar cloud that's trying to
 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.309
protostellar cloud that's trying to
collapse to make a small star but all of

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319
collapse to make a small star but all of
 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.860
collapse to make a small star but all of
a sudden boom you're stopped because you

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870
a sudden boom you're stopped because you
 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.170
a sudden boom you're stopped because you
have this heat source that stabilizes

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180
have this heat source that stabilizes
 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.330
have this heat source that stabilizes
the cloud and prevents it from

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340
the cloud and prevents it from
 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.270
the cloud and prevents it from
collapsing anymore so yeah it's actually

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280
collapsing anymore so yeah it's actually
 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.699
collapsing anymore so yeah it's actually
really a star that then the nomenclature

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709
really a star that then the nomenclature
 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.259
really a star that then the nomenclature
Dark Star could be a little misleading

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269
Dark Star could be a little misleading
 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.840
Dark Star could be a little misleading
in the sense of people think well it's

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850
in the sense of people think well it's
 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.400
in the sense of people think well it's
probably made of dark matter but it

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410
probably made of dark matter but it
 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.260
probably made of dark matter but it
really isn't it's really made of

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270
really isn't it's really made of
 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.610
really isn't it's really made of
hydrogen and helium and just a

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620
hydrogen and helium and just a
 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.890
hydrogen and helium and just a
smattering of dark matter is it's it's a

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900
smattering of dark matter is it's it's a
 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.629
smattering of dark matter is it's it's a
very powerful heat source and less than

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639
very powerful heat source and less than
 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.320
very powerful heat source and less than
1% of the masses dark matter and the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330
1% of the masses dark matter and the
 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.210
1% of the masses dark matter and the
annihilation process gives a heat source

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220
annihilation process gives a heat source
 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.670
annihilation process gives a heat source
that powers the star and it shines very

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680
that powers the star and it shines very
 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.460
that powers the star and it shines very
bright objects they really are stars so

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470
bright objects they really are stars so
 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.230
bright objects they really are stars so
they're their atomic objects that shine

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240
they're their atomic objects that shine
 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.410
they're their atomic objects that shine
due to the Dark Matter power
