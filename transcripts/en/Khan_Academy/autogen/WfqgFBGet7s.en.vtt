00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.530
 . 

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.570
 Let's begin to solve the issue of descent 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.280
 Then we can deal with tougher issues. If I have 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:15.750
 Ratio 13/6 = 5 / x 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.740
 I do not prefer having this x in the denominator, so let us 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.420
 Multiply the two ends of this equation by x 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.150
 If both sides hit x, what would happen? 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.810
 On the right side, this x is deleted with that x 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.300
 Then the left side becomes our 13 / 6x 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.910
 = - We will get 5 here 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.650
 Then, until we find the value of x, we have to multiply both ends 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.010
 Inverted 13/6 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.670
 Ie 6/13 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.320
 These are clearly deleted 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.940
 That's why I hit him in the reverse 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.320
 We get x = 5 x 6, which equals 30/13 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.220
 Now the way you go until you finish this issue - it's about 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.470
 Jump for a step - called cross-strike 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.150
 Look at the ratio so, and directly say 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.430
 Rugs in this aspect x placed in that side 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.690
 = Rugs in this aspect × 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.520
 In that aspect 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.710
 Let me write it down 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.380
 Maybe sometimes you see people moving directly to - call me 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.680
 Re-write the current issue - if 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.750
 The original issue is 13/6 = 5 / x 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.700
 Maybe you sometimes see people moving directly to 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.950
 13 x x = 5 x 6 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.550
 It may seem like a charm 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.470
 How can he succeed? 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.520
 Why is it true? 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.610
 In fact, what is being done to get to this point is 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.430
 They strike both ends of the equation 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.620
 Both houses 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.550
 Let me explain what I mean 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.150
 If both ends of the equation are multiplied by 6 and x 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.245
 What will happen? 

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:52.490
 If both ends of the equation are multiplied by 6x 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.700
 Where did you get the 6? 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.190
 from here 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.030
 Where did you get x? 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.460
 from here 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.850
 Of both 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.040
 What will happen? 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.470
 On this side of the equation, the 6 will be deleted 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.890
 With this place 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.580
 On the right side of the equation, x will be 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.600
 Delete it with this title 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.870
 If we have 13 × x 

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.210
 = 5 x 6 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.290
 There is nothing imaginary here 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.570
 We hit the two sides 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.000
 The equation 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.060
 This seems to be a reciprocal hit 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.090
 13x = 5 x 6 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.600
 Then here, of course, we divide both sides on 13 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.950
 We get x = 30/13 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.910
 Now that we've solved the warm-up exercise, let's tackle some 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.740
 Actual issues 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.990
 We have the highest mount in 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.800
 Canada is Mount Yukon 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.990
 It is 298/67 the size of Mount Ben Nevis 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:55.470
 Let's put Y ratio for Yukon equal to 298/67 of size - let's say that 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.630
 N ratio to Nevis 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.990
 This is what tells us what is written in green 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.800
 Top Summit in Scotland 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.840
 Mount Elbert is in Colorado is the highest peak 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.680
 In the Rocky Mountains 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.790
 Mount Elbert - if we have this other information here - Mt. 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.450
 Elbert is 220/67 from the height of Ben Nevis 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.850
 So let's put E as a shortcut to Elbert 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.720
 E = 22/67 × Nevis 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.290
 × Ben Nevis, here 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.420
 He gave us more information 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.230
 It is 44/48 of the size of Mount Blanc 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.950
 If Elbert = 44/48 the size of Blanc 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.890
 Let's write B relative to Mount Blanc 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.300
 We also gave Mount Blanc a 4,800 meter height 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.090
 The height of Mount Blanc equals 4,800 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.700
 meter 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.860
 If B = 4,800 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.120
 What is required of us is, how high is Mount Yukon? 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.900
 If we have to find Y 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.190
 So let's do the opposite, and find all 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.230
 Existing variables 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.810
 Let's start with this information 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.560
 B = 4,800 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.140
 E = 44/48 × B 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:14.490
 If E-Elbert - equals 44/48 × Mount Blanc, it is 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.279
 4,800 m 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:23.690
 Now if we divide it by 48-4800 = 48 = 100-- 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.210
 If Elbert's incidence is equal to 44 x 100 meters 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.870
 Which equals 4,400 meters 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.730
 that's enough 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.960
 Now we can use this information and 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.650
 We make it up here 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.360
 We get Elbert, whose height is 4,400 meters, = 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.510
 220/67 × Ben Nevis 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.850
 N Abbreviation for Nevis 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.340
 To find Nevis rise, we hit both ends 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.440
 Inverted this coefficient 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.740
 If we hit both sides with 67/220 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:05.750
 X 67/220 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.810
 67 Delete with 67 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.920
 220 Delete with 220 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.870
 And then we get - let us see, if you take 4,400. 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.480
 220 - 440 220 220 = 2 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.350
 If this equals 20 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.640
 4,400 220 220 = 20 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.360
 We got the Nevis rise and equal - change sides - 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.770
 If height Ben Nevis = 67 × 20 meters 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.930
 Now how much is this? 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.420
 1,340 m 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.620
 Is this true? 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.250
 Well, let's leave him like that, because we can 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.570
 - In fact it looks like 67 - I'll leave Nevis 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.530
 So 67 x 20 meters 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.800
 We make it up here 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.940
 If Yukon - I will come down here, because I have 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:58.050
 Larger space - Yukon = 298/67 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.280
 Ø Nevis height 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.120
 Nevis = 67 × 20 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.340
 If × 67 × 20 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.180
 Well I can divide 67 on 67, and get Yukon up 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.430
 298 x 20 meters 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.380
 If Yukon = 298 × 20 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.430
 How much is this? 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.580
 This equals - let us see 2 × 298 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.510
 = 396 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.380
 Oh sorry, it's worth 596 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.290
 It's almost 300, if it should be close to 600 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.820
 2 less than 300, so must 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.730
 To be 4 less than 300 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.340
 And then I have 0 here 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.200
 If it equals 5,960 meters 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.650
 We're done 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.920
 Let's solve another issue. this is good 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.390
 In a big big high school, he was rated 2 out of every 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.630
 3 students have a mobile phone 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:05.790
 And 1 in 5 of all students have a mobile phone 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.140
 Its production year ranges from one year or less 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.550
 this is good 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.940
 Let's think about it 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:16.915
 Let's assume that x = the total number of students 

00:07:16.915 --> 00:07:20.930
 x = total number of students 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.670
 This first line, 2 out of 3 students have a mobile phone 

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:30.640
 We can say that 2/3 x have a mobile phone 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.340
 They have a mobile phone 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.630
 This is what the sentence written in green says 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.810
 Then the sentence is written in violet-1 color of 5 out of all 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.080
 Students have a mobile phone of one year or less 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:48.136
 If 1/5 x have less than 1/5 years 

00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:50.970
 . 

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.720
 If we need to know how many students they have 

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.950
 Mobile phone - it's the outside of this - that's the place 

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.340
 Let me write it down 

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.440
 That is the place 

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.420
 Find students who have a mobile phone - this 

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.770
 Here - we need to know what percentage they have 

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.160
 Mobile phone year produced more than a year 

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.280
 So how many students have one year of mobile phone production 

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.540
 From one year? 

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.090
 Well, we can take the total number of students who have a mobile phone 

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.500
 Which is 2/3 x 

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.620
 2/3 of all students have a mobile phone 

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.430
 We can ask all students who have 

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.560
 A new mobile phone - a mobile phone whose production year is less than a year - 

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.420
 Remember that we were told more than a year here 

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.630
 If we want to ask all the students who have 

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.919
 A modern mobile phone, ie 1/5 x, so we will get a percentage 

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.700
 The students who have this 

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.590
 This is here 

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:49.600
 This has a mobile phone greater than 1/5 years 

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.470
 They have a phone, but the year of production is more than 1/5 years 

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.230
 This is for all who own a mobile phone 

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.780
 We ask the new 

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.470
 So this is all students who have 

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.510
 Mobile phone year was produced before the year of Akbar 

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.300
 To find this, we offer fractions 

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.140
 If this equals, let's see, 2/3 is equivalent 

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.080
 10/15 

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.170
 This is 2/3 - 1/5 

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.960
 Equivalent to 3/15 x 

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.900
 Which equals 10 - 3 = 7/15 x 

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.830
 It's the total proportion of students 

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.450
 Written in orange - what percentage of those who own a phone 

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:27.160
 The year of its production was before the end of the year? 

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.590
 It's 7/15 x 

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.090
 This is the actual number 

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.810
 If you want to know how many students have a mobile phone 

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.230
 - Number of students who have a mobile phone 

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.560
 Here - 2/3 x, what percentage of those who have a phone year of production was more 

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.800
 From one year? 

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.870
 This is the number of students who have a mobile phone a year earlier 

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.700
 One year 

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.820
 This total value is the proportion of students 

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.330
 Who have a mobile phone 

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.270
 Fortunately, the x is deleted 

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:56.300
 And we have this = 7/15 x 

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.950
 Upside down 

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:58.980
 Divide on 2/3 

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.000
 This is equivalent to multiplying by 3/2 

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.940
 How much is this? 

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.250
 Divide on 3 

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.750
 Divide on 3 

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.740
 Our remaining 7/10 

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.840
 Of the students who have a mobile phone, here are 7 out of 10 

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.080
 Students who have a mobile phone have a mobile phone that was a year old 

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.730
 More than one year 

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.110
 We're done 

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.466
 .
