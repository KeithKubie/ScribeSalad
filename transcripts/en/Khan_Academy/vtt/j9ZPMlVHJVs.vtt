00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.720
In the last video, we
were able to calculate

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.530
the total sum of squares
for these nine data points

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.030
right here.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.230
And these nine data
points are grouped

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.220
into three different groups, or
if we want to speak generally,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.904
into m different groups.

00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:14.320
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.890
to figure out how much of
this total sum of squares

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.670
is due to variation within
each group versus variation

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.440
between the actual groups.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.740
So first, let's figure
out the total variation

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.050
within the group.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.010
So let's call that the
sum of squares within.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.330
So let's calculate the
sum of squares within.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.610
I'll do that in yellow.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.330
Actually, I already used
yellow, so let me do blue.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.905
So the sum of squares within.

00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:47.050
Let me make it clear.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.350
That stands for within.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.230
So we want to see how
much of the variation

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.650
is due to how far each
of these data points

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.446
are from their central tendency,
from their respective mean.

00:00:59.446 --> 00:01:01.070
So this is going to
be equal to-- let's

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.680
start with these guys.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.510
So instead of taking the
distance between each data

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.550
point and the mean
of means, I'm going

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.190
to find the distance
between each data

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.790
point and that group's
mean, because we

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.800
want to square the total sum
of squares between each data

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.852
point and their respective mean.

00:01:19.852 --> 00:01:20.560
So let's do that.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.960
So it's 3 minus-- the mean here
is 2-- squared, plus 2 minus 2

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.720
squared, plus 2 minus 2
squared, plus 1 minus 2 squared.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.175
1 minus 2 squared
plus-- I'm going

00:01:35.175 --> 00:01:36.550
to do this for
all of the groups,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.883
but for each group, the
distance between each data point

00:01:38.883 --> 00:01:39.470
and its mean.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.790
So plus 5 minus 4,
plus 5 minus 4 squared,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.650
plus 4 minus 4 squared--
sorry, the next point was

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.740
3-- plus 3 minus 4 squared,
plus 4 minus 4 squared.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.015
And then finally, we
have the third group.

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:02.550
But we're finding that
all of the sum of squares

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.510
from each point to its
central tendency within that,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.190
but we're going to
add them all up.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.729
And then we find
the third group.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.560
So we have 5 minus-- oh, its
mean is 6-- 5 minus 6 squared,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.415
plus 6 minus 6 squared,
plus 7 minus 6 squared.

00:02:20.415 --> 00:02:22.560
And what is this going to equal?

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.040
So this is going to
be equal to-- up here,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.530
it's going to be
1 plus 0 plus 1.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.860
So that's going to
be equal to 2 plus.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.590
And then this is going to be
equal to 1, 1 plus 1 plus 0--

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.040
so another 2--
plus this is going

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.795
to be equal to 1 plus 0 plus 1.

00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:46.370
7 minus 6 is 1 squared is 1.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.660
So plus.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.050
So that's 2 over here.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.500
So this is going to be
equal to our sum of squares

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.680
within, I should say, is 6.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.050
So one way to think about it--
our total variation was 30.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.040
And based on this
calculation, 6 of that 30

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.782
comes from a variation
within these samples.

00:03:08.782 --> 00:03:10.490
Now, the next thing
I want to think about

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.660
is how many degrees of freedom
do we have in this calculation?

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.670
How many independent data
points do we actually have?

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.800
Well, for each of
these-- so over here,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.390
we have n data points in one.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.280
In particular, n is 3 here.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.950
But if you know n
minus 1 of them,

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.860
you can always figure
out the nth one

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.250
if you know the
actual sample mean.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.410
So in this case, for
any of these groups,

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.961
if you know two of
these data points,

00:03:41.961 --> 00:03:43.460
you can always
figure out the third.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.876
If you know these two, you can
always figure out the third

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:47.290
if you know the sample mean.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.130
So in general, let's figure out
the degrees of freedom here.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.250
For each group,
when you did this,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.480
you had n minus 1
degrees of freedom.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.050
Remember, n is the
number of data points

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.160
you had in each group.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.390
So you have n minus
1 degrees of freedom

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.490
for each of these groups.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.440
So it's n minus 1, n
minus 1, n minus 1.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.270
Or let me put it this
way-- you have n minus 1

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.819
for each of these groups,
and there are m groups.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.835
So there's m times n minus
1 degrees of freedom.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.840
And in this case in particular,
each group-- n minus 1 is 2.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.130
Or in each case, you had
2 degrees of freedom,

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.070
and there's three
groups of that.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.670
So there are 6
degrees of freedom.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.120
And in the future, we might
do a more detailed discussion

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.050
of what degrees of
freedom mean, and how

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.984
to mathematically
think about it.

00:04:53.984 --> 00:04:56.025
But the best-- the simplest
way to think about it

00:04:56.025 --> 00:04:58.010
is really, truly
independent data

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.070
points, assuming you
knew, in this case,

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.633
the central statistic
that we used

00:05:01.633 --> 00:05:03.716
to calculate the squared
distance in each of them.

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:05.770
If you know them already,
the third data point

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.300
could actually be calculated
from the other two.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.900
So we have 6 degrees
of freedom over here.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.250
Now, that was how much
of the total variation

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.242
is due to variation
within each sample.

00:05:18.242 --> 00:05:20.200
Now let's think about
how much of the variation

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.450
is due to variation
between the samples.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.720
And to do that, we're
going to calculate.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.280
Let me get a nice color here.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.780
I think I've run
out all the colors.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.690
We'll call this sum
of squares between.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.325
The B stands for between.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.690
So another way to
think about it--

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.790
how much of this
total variation is

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.650
due to the variation
between the means,

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.670
between the central
tendency-- that's

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.378
what we're going to
calculate right now--

00:05:51.378 --> 00:05:54.460
and how much is due to
variation from each data

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.880
point to its mean?

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.000
So let's figure out how
much is due to variation

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.140
between these guys over here.

00:06:07.457 --> 00:06:09.540
Actually, let's think about
just this first group.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.630
For this first group,
how much variation

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.560
for each of these guys is due to
the variation between this mean

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.760
and the mean of means?

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.660
Well, so for this
first guy up here--

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.670
I'll just write it
all out explicitly--

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.050
the variation is going
to be its sample mean.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.995
So it's going to be 2 minus
the mean of means squared.

00:06:30.995 --> 00:06:32.370
And then for this
guy, it's going

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.630
to be the same thing--
his sample mean,

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.590
2 minus the mean
of mean squared.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.880
Plus same thing for this guy, 2
minus the mean of mean squared.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.620
Or another way to
think about it--

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.340
this is equal to-- I'll
write it over here--

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.580
this is equal to 3
times 2 minus 4 squared,

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.850
which is the same thing as 3.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:00.480
This is equal to 3 times 4.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.252
Three times 4 is equal to 12.

00:07:02.252 --> 00:07:03.960
And then we could do
it for each of them.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.950
And actually, I want
to find the total sum.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.150
So let me just write
it all out, actually.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.691
I think that might
be an easier thing

00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:13.250
to do, because I want to find,
for all of these guys combined,

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.350
the sum of squares
due to the differences

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.180
between the samples.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.530
So that's from the contribution
from the first sample.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.880
And then from the second sample,
you have this guy over here.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.270
Oh, sorry.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.740
You don't want to calculate him.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.315
For this data point,
the amount of variation

00:07:31.315 --> 00:07:32.940
due to the difference
between the means

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.871
is going to be 4
minus 4 squared.

00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:38.870
Same thing for this guy.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.180
It's going to be
4 minus 4 squared.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.990
And we're not taking
it into consideration.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.080
We're only taking its sample
mean into consideration.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.230
And then finally, plus
4 minus 4 squared.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.900
We're taking this
minus this squared

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.630
for each of these data points.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.270
And then finally, we'll do
that with the last group.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.770
With the last group,
sample mean is 6.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.970
So it's going to be
6 minus 4 squared,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:09.530
plus 6 minus 4 squared, plus
6 minus 4, plus 6 minus 4

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.640
squared.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.050
Now, let's think about how
many degrees of freedom

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.470
we had in this calculation
right over here.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.310
Well, in general, I
guess the easiest way

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.020
to think about is, how
much information did we

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.340
have, assuming that we
knew the mean of means?

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.140
If we know the mean
of means, how much

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.059
here is new information?

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:35.390
Well, if you know
the mean of the mean,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.040
and you know two of
these sample means,

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.539
you can always
figure out the third.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:39.510
If you know this
one and this one,

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.730
you can figure out that one.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:41.843
And if you know that
one and that one,

00:08:41.843 --> 00:08:43.009
you can figure out that one.

00:08:43.009 --> 00:08:46.540
And that's because this is the
mean of these means over here.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:51.750
So in general, if you have m
groups, or if you have m means,

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.240
there are m minus 1
degrees of freedom here.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.480
Let me write that.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.950
But with that said, well,
and in this case, m is 3.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:13.040
So we could say there's
two degrees of freedom

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.080
for this exact example.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.700
Let's actually, let's calculate
the sum of squares between.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.484
So what is this going to be?

00:09:20.484 --> 00:09:21.400
I'll just scroll down.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.790
Running out of space.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:27.170
This is going to be equal to--
this right here is 2 minus 4

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.420
is negative 2 squared is 4.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.510
And then we have
three 4's over here.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:37.760
So it's 3 times 4, plus
3 times-- what is this?

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:43.380
3 times 0 plus-- what is this?

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.380
The difference between
each of these-- 6 minus 4

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.810
is 2 squared is 4-- so
that means we have 3 times

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.320
4, plus 3 times 4.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:59.870
And we get 3 times 4 is 12,
plus 0, plus 12 is equal to 24.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.800
So the sum of
squares, or we could

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.720
say, the variation due
to what's the difference

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.099
between the groups,
between the means, is 24.

00:10:09.099 --> 00:10:10.390
Now, let's put it all together.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:14.450
We said that the
total variation,

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.790
that if you looked at
all 9 data points, is 30.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.950
Let me write that over here.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:25.980
So the total sum of
squares is equal to 30.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.980
We figured out
the sum of squares

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.060
between each data point
and its central tendency,

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.440
its sample mean--
we figured out,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.050
and when you totaled
it all up, we got 6.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:43.670
So the sum of squares
within was equal to 6.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.770
And in this case, it was
6 degrees of freedom.

00:10:48.827 --> 00:10:50.410
Or if we wanted to
write it generally,

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:54.549
there were m times n minus
1 degrees of freedom.

00:10:54.549 --> 00:10:56.340
And actually, for the
total, we figured out

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.010
we have m times n minus
1 degrees of freedom.

00:11:02.964 --> 00:11:04.880
Actually, let me just
write degrees of freedom

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.320
in this column right over here.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.410
In this case, the number
turned out to be 8.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.750
And then just now we
calculated the sum

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.250
of squares between the samples.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.400
The sum of squares between
the samples is equal to 24.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.670
And we figured out that it had
m minus 1 degrees of freedom,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.620
which ended up being 2.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.050
Now, the interesting
thing here-- and this

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.360
is why this analysis of variance
all fits nicely together,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.180
and in future videos we'll
think about how we can actually

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.630
test hypotheses using
some of the tools

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.390
that we're thinking
about right now--

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.990
is that the sum
of squares within,

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.950
plus the sum of
squares between, is

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.220
equal to the total
sum of squares.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.140
So a way to think about is
that the total variation

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.250
in this data right
here can be described

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.090
as the sum of the
variation within each

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.060
of these groups, when
you take that total,

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:03.820
plus the sum of the
variation between the groups.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.510
And even the degrees
of freedom work out.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.090
The sum of squares between
had 2 degrees of freedom.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.420
The sum of squares
within each of the groups

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.700
had 6 degrees of freedom.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.370
2 plus 6 is 8.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.260
That's the total
degrees of freedom

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.120
we had for all of
the data combined.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.670
It even works if you
look at the more general.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.500
So our sum of
squares between had

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.100
m minus 1 degrees of freedom.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.270
Our sum of squares
within had m times n

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.440
minus 1 degrees of freedom.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.310
So this is equal to m
minus 1, plus mn minus m.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.620
These guys cancel out.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:44.080
This is equal to mn minus
1 degrees of freedom, which

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.110
is exactly the total
degrees of freedom we

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.230
had for the total
sum of squares.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.620
So the whole point
of the calculations

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.690
that we did in the last
video and in this video

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:58.844
is just to appreciate that
this total variation over here,

00:12:58.844 --> 00:13:00.760
this total variation
that we first calculated,

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.700
can be viewed as the sum
of these two component

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:10.370
variations-- how much
variation is there

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.070
within each of the samples plus
how much variation is there

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.020
between the means
of the samples?

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.530
Hopefully that's
not too confusing.
