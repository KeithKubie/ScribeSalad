00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.920
Up until this point we've been computing
statistics about individual stocks.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.258
We're going to shift now to
computing statistics on portfolios.

00:00:09.258 --> 00:00:12.860
We're going to focus on some of the most
important statistics that are used to

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.950
evaluate the performance of portfolios
and accordingly portfolio managers.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.590
We'll define a portfolio as an
allocation of funds to a set of stocks.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.025
For the moment, we're going to follow a
buy-and-hold strategy where we invest in

00:00:27.025 --> 00:00:29.335
a set of stocks with
a certain allocation and

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:32.320
then observe how things
go moving forward.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.234
We'll assume the allocations sum to 1.0.
