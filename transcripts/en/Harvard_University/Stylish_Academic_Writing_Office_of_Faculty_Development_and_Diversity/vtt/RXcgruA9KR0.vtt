ELIZABETH KNOLL: I'm here
to speak as an editor,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.300
as a book editor, for the
editors and about the editors.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.520
This is partly obviously sheer
self-indulgence on my part.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.782
But it's also because an
editor whom you deal with,

00:00:22.782 --> 00:00:24.490
if you're thinking
about writing a book--

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.115
and I live in the
book world, so that's

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:28.330
what I'm talking about--
an editor you deal with

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.250
or an agent whom you deal
with-- and your agent used

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.510
to be an editor before she
lost her job-- your editor

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.840
or your agent is sort of
emblematic of all those readers

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.070
you want to have
whom you don't know.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.550
So when you're writing
the manuscript,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.160
or writing the proposal
for the manuscript,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.150
or writing the letter that
describes the proposal that you

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.270
hope that the agent or
the editor will read,

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.470
it's going to be a
lot easier to write

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.020
if you think of that editor or
agent as an actual human being.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.610
The person is probably
an actual human being.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.120
The person I'm going to call
her she, because lots of us are.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.470
The editor of the
agent is a person

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.800
who is very busy, very stressed,
necessarily very pragmatic,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.370
and she says no a lot
more than she says yes.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.280
At least once in
the last month, she

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.120
has woken up and worried about
the weakness of the publishing

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.170
industry at 3 o'clock
in the morning.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.270
But it's very important to
say that editors as a class,

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.490
as a type of person, are
not sour, are not petty,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.200
are not hostile, and not bad
tempered and not cynical.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.940
Because if we were any of those
things we wouldn't last a week.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.520
Your editor-- this future
editor whom you don't know--

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.660
is basically an optimistic,
enthusiastic, outgoing,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.350
sympathetic person.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.000
Even the ones who seem most
prickly are secret romantics.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.370
The scariest agent
whom I ever met

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.740
has now retired and is
spending her retirement

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.800
taking beautiful
photographs of flowers.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.780
Just as nobody in
their right mind

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.800
sets out to write
a book to get rich,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.390
nobody goes into
publishing to get rich.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.060
We go into publishing
because we love ideas.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.710
We love new ways of
thinking about things.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.060
We love to be
interested in things.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.775
And we'd love to get
other people interested

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:44.790
in and excited about things.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.240
So as the guy said
in the old movie

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.380
Jerry Maguire, help
us to help you.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.500
Meet us halfway.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.690
Help the agent or the editor,
or the entity and then

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.960
the editors colleagues,
and then through them

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.090
that world of readers
you're going to have,

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.000
to understand the
argument you want to make,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.770
or the story we want to tell,
or the idea that you have.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.070
Now, Helen and Steve can't talk.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.060
Helen already has
talked very, very well

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.540
about how to express that,
how to avoid the clunky

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.800
language, how to avoid the
abstractions how to avoid

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.040
the almost autistic self
referential kind of quality

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.270
that many disciplines kind
of do tend to fall into.

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:38.390
But what I want to
talk about is thinking

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.170
about who's on the other side.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.690
It's not enough to
talk about whatever

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.090
it is you have to say in
a clear and lively way.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.460
You have to think
about why it matters.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.330
The question that
we always ask--

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.200
and I say this all the time--
is that any proposal or any kind

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.460
of book has to answer
the Seder question,

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.590
how is this book different
from all other books?

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.800
That's an important question.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.140
But an even more important
question is, who cares?

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.540
So what?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.940
Why does it matter?

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.870
Many things compete as we
all know for people's time

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.959
and attention.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.990
If you've got a
TV and a computer

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.880
you have access to
an unlimited stream

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.280
of entertainment, quasi
entertainment, information,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.170
quasi information.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.250
And it's all basically free.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.840
So what is it that you have
to say to somebody else

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.570
that that very busy
person with a computer

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.730
is going to want to
plunk down $30 for,

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.000
and almost even more
important, commit three hours

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.830
of their busy life for.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.340
It sounds daunting.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.630
But since editors are
optimistic and encouraging,

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.030
let me offer you a way out.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.367
It's not enough that you
know more about something

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:06.450
than anybody in the world.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.520
You probably do.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.800
And it's not enough that
it's really interesting.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.220
You need to think about
and make it clear why it's

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.480
interesting to somebody else.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.180
And what it is in
what you have to say,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.330
the story you want to tell,
the argument you want to make,

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.440
that really answers a need
that most people have.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.750
And what most people
are looking for,

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.156
and what they will
buy books for,

00:05:32.156 --> 00:05:33.530
is something that
helps them make

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.820
sense of the world,
something that helps them

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.420
not necessarily get rich, get
beautiful-- although that's

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.050
nice too-- but something
that helps them find

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.630
a thread through the
labyrinth, through all

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.660
this blooming and bulging
confusion that we live in.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.090
How did the recession happen
and when will we ever get out

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.750
of it?

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.860
Why are we in Afghanistan?

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.060
Those are questions that are
topical and on the front pages

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.650
of the paper.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.483
But there's many other
questions that people

00:06:06.483 --> 00:06:08.130
care about quite a lot.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.270
And if you can answer
those questions,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.340
can think about how the problem
that you are preoccupied with,

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.940
that you really care
about, can be something

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.140
that someone else can care
about, you're already halfway

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.360
there to writing a
letter, a book proposal,

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.370
a book that someone
will care about.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.540
Now, if it's many
academics, if you're

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.140
interested in writing a book for
people outside your discipline,

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.600
outside your subdiscipline, if
you're interested in writing

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.280
a book for nonacademic
readers, it's

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:47.000
really, really a good idea to
know some nonacademic readers.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.600
And you think I'm joking,
but I'm actually not joking.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.260
You're probably aware that most
of us do not live in America.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.220
Most of us are not
really too typical.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.200
And most of us
have as our friends

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.310
people who are probably
kind of like ourselves.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:10.060
So know some people
who aren't like you.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.350
Talk to them about the
stuff you care about.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.630
See what gives a
glint in their eye.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.640
Your best friend
from high school,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.490
the president of your
high school class,

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.620
your college roommate,
your dentist,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.040
your brother-in-law
from Western Nebraska

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.920
who runs a company that sells
heavy duty plastic fencing,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.760
and can only fall asleep while
watching a football game on TV,

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.800
but who also always, always
has American political history

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.740
books on his Kindle.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.100
You have to know these people.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.410
You have to like them.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.260
And you have to respect them.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.570
You have to respect
the things that they

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:56.910
care about and worry about, and
the worldview that they have.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:02.400
The all important question
is who are you talking to?

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.080
Are they real to you?

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.740
And what do you
have to give them?

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.760
It's not just what
you want to say.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.320
It's what you want to say
that they can want to hear.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.550
A few years ago
after my father died,

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.810
my mother gave me the
assignment of going

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.730
through his study and all
his papers and organizing

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.140
everything.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.700
And among the things
I found in there

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.430
were the voluminous
records of a trip

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.090
to Europe that
he'd taken when he

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.390
was a graduate student in 1948.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.320
I read them, obviously,
with great interest,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.010
partly because post-war Europe
was interesting to read about,

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.260
but also as you can
understand, it's

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:50.460
extremely touching for a middle
aged person to meet her father

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.400
when he was young
enough to be her son.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.100
There were two kinds
of records there.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.380
They were his diary
and the letters

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.930
that he wrote to his
parents along the way.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.140
The diary was very clear.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:07.900
It was interesting,
full of description,

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.010
but it was a little flat.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.690
It was sort of
lugubrious sometimes.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.500
It was clear he was lonely.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.620
The letters to his
parents sparkled.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.790
They conveyed the enthusiasm
of the conversations

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.280
he was having with people.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.480
He was trying to
describe things he

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.690
was seeing in ways that would
make sense to his parents

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.410
back in Nebraska.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.770
The letters had life.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.260
And I thought not only as a
daughter but as an editor, aha,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.264
this is the key.

00:09:41.264 --> 00:09:44.280
A book is not a diary.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.840
A book is a letter.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.170
A book is written from
you to somebody else.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.460
And if you can think
about everything

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.100
that you write in your book
as your letter to the world,

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.260
it's going to have the kind of
life that you wanted to have,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.370
and it's going to make
your editor love you.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.820
[APPLAUSE]
