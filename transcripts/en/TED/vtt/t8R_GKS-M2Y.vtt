00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:17.150
I was six when I had the first chance
to learn what patience means.

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.461
My grandmother gave me a magic box
as a birthday present,

00:00:21.485 --> 00:00:24.770
which neither of us knew
would become a gift for life.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:28.294
I became obsessed with magic,

00:00:28.318 --> 00:00:31.889
and at 20, I became
an amateur dove magician.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:36.594
This act of magic
requires that I train my doves

00:00:36.618 --> 00:00:38.839
to sit and wait inside my clothing.

00:00:39.738 --> 00:00:44.461
As a young magician, I was always
in a rush to make them appear,

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:46.032
but my teacher told me

00:00:46.056 --> 00:00:49.444
the secret to the success
of this magical act

00:00:49.468 --> 00:00:53.691
is to make my doves appear
only after they've waited patiently

00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:54.948
in my tuxedo.

00:00:55.797 --> 00:00:58.817
It has to be a mindful kind of patience,

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:01.829
the kind that took me
some years to master.

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.904
When life took me to Shanghai
seven years ago,

00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:11.393
the mindful patience I learned
became almost impossible to practice.

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:16.388
In China, where everyone
and everything is in a hurry,

00:01:16.412 --> 00:01:19.864
you need to outperform
over 1.3 billion other people

00:01:19.888 --> 00:01:21.197
to build a better life.

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:25.015
You hack the system, bend the rules,

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.546
circumvent the boundaries.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.561
It is the same when it comes to food ...

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.514
except that when it comes to food,

00:01:33.538 --> 00:01:36.593
impatience can have dire consequences.

00:01:37.618 --> 00:01:40.357
In the haste to grow more, sell more,

00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:45.364
4,000 years of agriculture
in a country of rich natural resources

00:01:45.388 --> 00:01:48.768
is spoiled by the overuse
of chemicals and pesticides.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.603
In 2016, the Chinese government revealed

00:01:52.627 --> 00:01:56.919
half a million food safety violations
in just nine months.

00:01:58.125 --> 00:02:01.856
Alarmingly, one in every four
diabetics in the world

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.426
now comes from China.

00:02:04.742 --> 00:02:06.455
The stories around food

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.941
are scary and somewhat overwhelming,

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:15.361
and I told myself it's time to bring
a mindful patience into the impatience.

00:02:16.352 --> 00:02:18.170
When I say mindful patience,

00:02:18.194 --> 00:02:20.201
I don't mean the ability to wait.

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:23.799
I mean knowing how to act while waiting.

00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:28.336
And so, while I wait for the day

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.328
when a sustainable food system
becomes a reality in China,

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:35.662
I launched one of China's first
online farmers market

00:02:35.686 --> 00:02:39.161
to bring local, organically grown
produce to families.

00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:42.661
When we went live, 18 months ago,

00:02:42.685 --> 00:02:45.273
the food we could sell then
was somewhat dismal.

00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:49.046
We had no fruit
and hardly any meat to sell,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.062
as none that was sent to the lab
passed our zero tolerance test

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:57.088
towards pesticides, chemicals,
antibiotics and hormones.

00:02:57.572 --> 00:02:59.668
I told our very anxious employees

00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:04.144
that we would not give up until we've met
every local farmer in China.

00:03:05.882 --> 00:03:09.724
Today, we supply 240 types of produce

00:03:09.748 --> 00:03:11.826
from 57 local farmers.

00:03:12.732 --> 00:03:15.306
After almost one year of searching,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.177
we finally found chemical-free bananas

00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:21.391
grown in the backyards
of villagers on Hainan Island.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.352
And only two hours away from Shanghai,

00:03:25.376 --> 00:03:29.447
on an island that even Google Maps
does not have coordinates for,

00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:32.241
we found a place where cows eat grass

00:03:32.265 --> 00:03:34.431
and roam free under the blue sky.

00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:38.124
We also work hard on logistics.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.111
We deliver our customers' orders
in as fast as three hours

00:03:42.135 --> 00:03:44.079
on electric vehicles,

00:03:44.103 --> 00:03:46.802
and we use biodegradable, reusable boxes

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:49.380
to minimize our environmental footprint.

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:54.917
I have no doubt that our offerings
will continue to grow,

00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:56.854
but it will take time,

00:03:56.878 --> 00:04:01.473
and I know a lot more people are needed
to shape the future of good food.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.859
So last year, I founded China's first
food tech accelerator and VC platform

00:04:07.883 --> 00:04:10.844
to help start-ups to shape
the future of good food

00:04:10.868 --> 00:04:12.431
the way they want,

00:04:12.455 --> 00:04:17.400
be that through using edible insects
as a more sustainable source of protein

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:21.177
or using essential oils
to keep food fresh for longer.

00:04:22.514 --> 00:04:24.594
So, you may still ask:

00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:27.935
Why are you trying to build
a sustainable food system

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:29.942
by driving a patient movement

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:33.212
in a country where it's almost
a crime to take it slow?

00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:35.686
Because, for me,

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.266
the real secret to success is patience --

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.099
a mindful kind of patience

00:04:41.123 --> 00:04:44.925
that requires knowing
how to act while waiting,

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.668
the kind of patience I learned
with my grandmother's magic box.

00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:54.460
After all, we do not inherit
the earth from our ancestors.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.175
We borrow it from our children.

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.350
Thank you.

00:04:58.374 --> 00:05:03.230
(Applause)
