00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.320
MAX DESYATYKH: We
started in 2008.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.050
Since that time, we've
made more than 100 apps

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.800
for start-ups or large
enterprise companies.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.690
While working on
all those apps, I

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.950
guess we've done pretty
much every mistake possible.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.670
So we know all the dos and
don'ts in mobile developments.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.130
ARTHUR SAKHAROV: The
primary goal of our company

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.160
is to have the best
engineers possible in Russia.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.780
We work within
Android platforms.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.940
We use Google
products every day.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.190
And it's great for us
to be in connection

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.850
with the engineers that actually
develop the products that we

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.780
use every day.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.700
To work with the
Google agency program

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.220
was important because it
helps us to make secure apps.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.280
It helps us make beautiful apps.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.450
It helps us make
reliable apps that suits

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.810
a client's business needs.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.490
MAX DESYATYKH: Being
a leading company

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.030
is very hard because you
have to run fast just to stay

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.140
in your current position.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.260
As for Russia, we are
very well-known agency,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.560
but overseas we're
not very well-known.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.040
And the agency program
helps us prove that we

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.679
can build great products.

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:10.220
ARTHUR SAKHAROV:
[? Promsvyazbank, ?]

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.980
when it was first released, it
was one of the first banking

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.820
apps to have material
design in it.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.720
We also used Firebase
and the recent releases

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.060
to get the analytics,
send messages, control

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.360
the response of the
app, which can be shown

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.010
and which can be turned off.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.680
We actually were on
the training in London

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.090
with all the Firebase stuff.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.930
It's quicker to get all the
answers in a personal way.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.690
IGOR VOLOSHIN: Being a
certified company in Russia

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.030
means a lot to our
clients because we

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.850
can share with them the
long-term strategies

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.690
of the platforms and offer them
great features that are only

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.610
coming to the platform.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.620
MAX DESYATYKH: When
we build useful apps,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.640
we want not to change the
entire life of a person,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.200
we just want to make it slightly
better, to save some time,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.080
to be more productive
in a large scale

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.920
when we build apps for
millions of users that would

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.480
make an impact in the world.
