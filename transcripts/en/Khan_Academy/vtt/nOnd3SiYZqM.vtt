00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.180
So if we were to
ask ourselves, what

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.860
is the value of our
function approaching--

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.870
as we approach x equals 2 from
values less than x equals 2.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.330
So as you imagine, as
we approach x equals 2--

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.860
So x equals 1, x equals 1.5,
x equals 1.9, x equals 1.999,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.520
x equals 1.99999999.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.540
What is f of x approaching?

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.390
And we see that f of x
seems to be approaching

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.780
this value right over here.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.860
It seems to be approaching 5.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.160
And so the way we
would denote that is

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.510
the limit of f of x,
as x approaches 2--

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.660
and we're going to specify the
direction-- as x approaches 2

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.500
from the negative
direction-- we put

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.462
the negative as a
superscript after the 2

00:00:53.462 --> 00:00:55.420
to denote the direction
that we're approaching.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.700
This is not a negative 2.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.510
We're approaching 2 from
the negative direction.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.960
We're approaching 2
from values less than 2.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.640
We're getting closer and closer
to 2, but from below-- 1.9,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.180
1.99, 1.99999 .

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.850
As x gets closer and
closer from those values,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.590
what is f of x approaching?

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.460
And we see here that
it is approaching 5.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.490
But what if we were asked the
natural other question-- What

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.320
is the limit of f of
x as x approaches 2

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.590
from values greater than 2?

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.510
So this is a little superscript
positive right over here.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.484
So now we're going to
approach x equals 2,

00:01:38.484 --> 00:01:40.650
but we're going to approach
it from this direction--

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.550
x equals 3, x equals 2.5, x
equals 2.1, x equals 2.01,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.194
x equals 2.0001.

00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:49.110
And we're going to get
closer and closer to 2,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.690
but we're coming from values
that are larger than 2.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.290
So here, when x equals
3, f of x is here.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.310
When x equals 2.5,
f of x is here.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.650
When x equals 2.01, f of x
looks like it's right over here.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.400
So in this situation, we're
getting closer and closer

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.100
to f of x equaling 1.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.717
It never does quite equal that.

00:02:12.717 --> 00:02:14.675
It actually then just
has a jump discontinuity.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.680
This seems to be the limiting
value when we approach when

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.820
we approach 2 from
values greater than 2.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.470
So this right over
here is equal to 1.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.660
And so when we think
about limits in general,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.880
the only way that a limit
at 2 will actually exist

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.410
is if both of these
one-sided limits

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.040
are actually the same thing.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.430
In this situation, they aren't.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.200
As we approach 2
from values below 2,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.400
the function seems
to be approaching 5.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.130
And as we approach 2
from values above 2,

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.580
the function seems
to be approaching 1.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.150
So in this case, the limit--
let me write this down--

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.140
the limit of f of
x, as x approaches 2

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.260
from the negative
direction, does not

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.850
equal the limit of f
of x, as x approaches 2

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.280
from the positive direction.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.570
And since this is the case--
that they're not equal--

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.880
the limit does not exist.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.650
The limit as x
approaches 2 in general

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.930
of f of x-- so the limit of
f of x, as x approaches 2,

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.310
does not exist.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.310
In order for it to have
existed, these two things

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.030
would have had to have
been equal to each other.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.930
For example, if
someone were to say,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.760
what is the limit of f
of x as x approaches 4?

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.100
Well, then we could think about
the two one-sided limits--

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.340
the one-sided limit from
below and the one-sided limit

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.230
from above.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.605
So we could say,
well, let's see.

00:03:55.605 --> 00:04:00.780
The limit of f of x, as x
approaches 4 from below-- so

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.610
let me draw that.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.380
So what we care
about-- x equals 4.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.280
As x equals 4 from below--

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.660
So when x equals 3,
we're here where f of 3

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.850
is negative 2. f of 3.5
seems to be right over here.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.170
f of 3.9 seems to be right
over here. f of 3.999--

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.360
we're getting closer and
closer to our function equaling

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.050
negative 5.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.760
So the limit as we
approach 4 from below--

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.640
this one-sided
limit from the left,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.320
we could say-- this is going
to be equal to negative 5.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.740
And if we were to ask
ourselves the limit of f

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.470
of x, as x approaches
4 from the right,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.330
from values larger than
4, well, same exercise.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.060
f of 5 gets us here.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.600
f of 4.5 seems
right around here.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.950
f of 4.1 seems right
about here. f of 4.01

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.000
seems right around here.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.499
And even f of 4 is
actually defined,

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:02.370
but we're getting
closer and closer to it.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.670
And we see, once again,
we are approaching 5.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.590
Even if f of 4 was not
defined on either side,

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.480
we would be
approaching negative 5.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.800
So this is also
approaching negative 5.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.720
And since the limit
from the left-hand side

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.130
is equal to the limit
from the right-hand side,

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.880
we can say-- so these
two things are equal.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.870
And because these
two things are equal,

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.830
we know that the limit of
f of x, as x approaches 4,

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.300
is equal to 5.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.690
Let's look at a
few more examples.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:41.920
So let's ask ourselves
the limit of f of x-- now,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.600
this is our new f of x depicted
here-- as x approaches 8.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.360
And let's approach
8 from the left.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.583
As x approaches 8 from
values less than 8.

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:56.083
So what's this going
to be equal to?

00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:58.666
And I encourage you to pause the
video to try to figure it out

00:05:58.666 --> 00:05:59.220
yourself.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.210
So x is getting closer
and closer to 8.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.050
So if x is 7, f of 7 is here.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.840
If x is 7.5, f of 7.5 is here.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.920
So it looks like
our value of f of x

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.740
is getting closer and
closer and closer to 3.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.430
So it looks like the limit
of f of x, as x approaches 8

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.290
from the negative
side, is equal to 3.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.910
What about from
the positive side?

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.500
What about the
limit of f of x as x

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.790
approaches 8 from the
positive direction

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.220
or from the right side?

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.130
Well, here we see as x
is 9, this is our f of x.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.950
As x is 8.5, this
is our f of 8.5.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.960
It seems like we're
approaching f of x equaling 1.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.620
So notice, these two
limits are different.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.400
So the non-one-sided limit,
or the two-sided limit,

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.677
does not exist at f of
x or as we approach 8.

00:06:55.677 --> 00:06:56.760
So let me write that down.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.330
The limit of f of x,
as x approaches 8--

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.370
because these two things
are not the same value--

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.875
this does not exist.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.870
Let's do one more example.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.120
And here they're actually
asking us a question.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.290
The function f is graphed below.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.420
What appears to be the value of
the one-sided limit, the limit

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:26.900
of f of x-- this is f of x--
as x approaches negative 2

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.120
from the negative direction?

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.500
So this is the negative 2
from the negative direction.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.900
So we care what happens as
x approaches negative 2.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.542
We see f of x is actually
undefined right over there.

00:07:35.542 --> 00:07:37.250
But let's see what
happens as we approach

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.166
from the negative
direction, or as we approach

00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:40.870
from values less
than negative 2,

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.080
or as we approach from the left.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.450
As we approach from the
left, f of negative 4

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.560
is right over here.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.330
So this is f of negative 4.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.900
f of negative 3 is
right over here.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.930
f of negative 2.5 seems
to be right over here.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.770
We seem to be getting
closer and closer

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.840
to f of x being equal
to 4, at least visually.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.550
So I would say that
it looks-- at least,

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.470
graphically-- the limit of
f of x, as x approaches 2

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:14.670
from the negative
direction, is equal to 4.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.210
Now, if we also asked
ourselves the limit

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.680
of f of x, as x
approaches negative 2

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.267
from the positive direction,
we would get a similar result.

00:08:24.267 --> 00:08:25.850
Now, we're going to
approach from when

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.470
x is 0, f of x seems
to be right over here.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.330
When x is 1, f of x
is right over here.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.350
When x is negative
1, f of x is there.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.809
When x is negative 1.9, f of
x seems to be right over here.

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:47.400
So once again, we seem to be
getting closer and closer to 4.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.240
Because the left-handed limit
and the right-handed limit

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.040
are the same value.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.180
Because both one-sided limits
are approaching the same thing,

00:08:54.180 --> 00:09:01.240
we can say that the limit
of f of x, as x approaches

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.375
negative 2-- and this
is from both directions.

00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:06.090
Since from both directions, we
get the same limiting value,

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.770
we can say that the
limit exists there.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.710
And it is equal to 4.
