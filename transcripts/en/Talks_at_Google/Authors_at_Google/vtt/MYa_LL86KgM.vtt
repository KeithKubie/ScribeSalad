00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.170
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Welcome to the Authors@Google
series.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.080
Our guest today is Brooke Gladstone.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.120
She's probably best known as the co-host and
managing editor of WNYC's "On the Media,"

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.950
distributed by NPR.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.290
And if I may add, it is available as a downloadable
podcast for free, if you can believe it, on

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.160
OnTheMedia.org.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.660
And Ms. Gladstone has served as NPR's media
correspondent, Russian reporter, and senior

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.090
editor of both "Weekend Edition" and "All
Things Considered."

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.630
She has two Peabody awards, a few Murrow awards,
the National Press Club's Press Criticism

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.600
Award, and was the recipient of a Knight Fellowship
at Stanford University.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.400
She is also most recently the author of the
edifying and entertaining book, "The Influencing

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.530
Machine," illustrated by Josh Neufeld.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.620
Please join me in welcoming Brooke Gladstone.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.180
[applause]

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.860
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Thank you.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.860
I am mic'ed up.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.860
Does this sound OK?

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.150
I love these.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.660
It makes me feel like I have to go out into
the audience Phil Donahue style, which I don't

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.290
intend to do.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.070
But I was trying to figure out--.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.000
I've done a lot of talks on this book and
I was trying to figure out what would make

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.860
the best sense for people at Google.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:27.350
And it struck me that it made sense to focus
on the parts that have to do with the history

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.460
of communications technology, how we perceive
it, and how we've reacted to it through the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.940
years and why the general panic that has ensued
in the last decade or so is completely predictable

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.860
and has happened many, many times before.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.140
I also wanna talk about the notion of the
quality of information, the fear of echo chambers,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.650
the notion of objectivity--these kinds of
things.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.530
One thing I said at the start of the book
was that "we all hunger for objectivity, but

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.350
increasingly, we swallow news like Jell-O
shots in ad hoc cyber saloons.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.259
We love to marinate in the punditry of people
with whom we agree, with people whose facts

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.450
we can digest without cognitive distress.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.780
And sometimes, we feel a little bit queasy
about just consuming the media that agrees

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.440
with us, but we don't blame ourselves for
that.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.430
We tend to project that nausea back onto the
media and blame 'it' or 'them.'

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.240
We don't really get truly agitated, however,
until we uncover the other guy's media.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.220
Those guys are consuming lies.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.650
Those guys are getting juiced up.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.650
Their media diet is making them stupid.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.360
So, what if our choices are making us stupid?"

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.320
And, of course, there was that famous question
you may have heard in an Atlantic article

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.410
a few years back, "What if Google is making
us stupid?"

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.940
I'm not going to address that too much.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.730
I think it's been pretty refuted, but I will
get back to it because we need to consider

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.349
first of all, our history.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:15.000
And after every new technology, panic has
always ensued.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.070
Back when there was the creation of radio,
people said it was creating nightmares in

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.070
kids.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.690
Now, we think radio is the good technology.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.530
The one that forced us to use our imaginations.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.101
Of course, there's tremendous panic over what
television has done to us.

00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:37.530
And there's actually a fair amount of decent
data to suggest that too much TV-watching

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.459
causes obesity.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.349
And that's a serious problem.

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.450
So, I'm not gonna dispute that every single
technological advance comes with unvarnished

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.160
wonderfulness attached to it, but the fact
is you get something and you--there's this

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.390
bug that's really after me.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.970
You get something and you lose something at
the same time.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.280
Socrates disdained writing because he said
it hurt the memory.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.940
There are lots of people who talked about
information overload practically the moment

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.959
that movable type was invented.

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.729
There's this guy named Conrad Gessner, who
tried to put together a list of all published

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:21.729
books.

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.949
And he talked about the harmful and confusing
abundance of books.

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:31.099
So, he decided to leave out anything that
wasn't published in Greek, Latin, or Hebrew.

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.860
So, Dante and Chaucer didn't make the cut.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.199
This was the only way he could assemble a
library of rational proportions.

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.159
This goes on and on and on all the way through,
which then brings me to one of my favorite

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.669
quotes, which is by Douglas Adams.

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.150
I'm gonna make sure I get it absolutely right.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:03.400
He said, "Anything that is in the world when
you were born is normal and ordinary and is

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.629
just a natural part of the way the world works.

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:13.770
Anything that's invented between when you're
15 and 35 is new and exciting and revolutionary.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.759
Anything that is invented after you're 35
is against the natural order of things."

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.129
[audience chuckles lightly]
This is what we see over and over again.

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:28.210
And to continue with the wisdom of Douglas
Adams, of course, he offered the best advice

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:35.749
for these terrifying times in 1979, when he
described his then imaginary Hitchhiker's

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:37.789
Guide to the Galaxy.

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:43.740
He said, "It had about a hundred tiny flat
press buttons and a screen about four inches

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.719
square on which any one of a million 'pages'
could be summoned at a moment's notice.

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.460
It looked insanely complicated.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.979
And this is one of the reasons why it had
the words 'Don't Panic' written on it in large,

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.430
friendly letters."

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.520
And so, I think a lot of the thesis of my
book involves we've been here--at least the

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.539
really bad parts of here-- a lot of times
before.

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.159
Don't panic.

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:21.169
The difference is the new responsibility that's
placed on the news consumer.

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:28.099
Up until the mid-Century, mid-20th Century,
every new development in technology made it

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:33.940
cheaper and more democratic, even though it
was still insanely expensive and not very

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.309
democratic.

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:44.409
But there was one development that made it
enormously expensive and reversed the trend.

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:50.740
And so, while all of our technology, starting
from the Penny Press and so forth, made it

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:58.499
cheaper and cheaper and really directed itself
towards more and more fragmented audiences.

00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:09.560
By the time we got to mid-20th Century America,
we had a revolution because there was the

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.169
invention of television.

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:16.689
And never has there been a medium more expensive,
more demanding of enormous audiences.

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:19.770
And, of course, that became the norm.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.960
We had a peculiar period in American politics,
which was the Cold War.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.650
A time where no fragmentation could be tolerated
and we're all outliers.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.550
We're marginalized.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:39.690
This is what we have come to call the Golden
Age of Objectivity.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.229
And I just wanna see if---.

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:45.160
I meant to put all of these numbers in the
book and I didn't.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:51.270
So however, I can probably do it from memory
at this point.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:57.679
When we had the telegraph and the steam rotary
presses, they were serving an exploding population

00:07:57.679 --> 00:08:02.869
of immigrants at the very moment the fractured
political culture was engaged in a furious

00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:06.999
argument over what America stood for.

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:14.349
When TV came along, the networks had to rely
on broadcast licenses and for most of the

00:08:14.349 --> 00:08:15.349
news.

00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:20.199
Also, they had to comply with a new regulation
that was enacted in 1949 that required them

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:27.770
to set aside time to present all sides of
the controversial issues they covered.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:28.860
This is called the Fairness Doctrine.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.499
A lot of people miss it.

00:08:30.499 --> 00:08:37.500
But the fact is, is what that did has caused
television not to cover controversial issues.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.870
Controversy was bad for the TV biz.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.610
And that, of course, was very good for government.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.550
The result was symbiosis.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:50.110
To wage the Cold War, the government needed
political consensus and ideological conformity.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:56.530
To be profitable, TV needed appeal to the
American mainstream.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:02.360
Both thrived by narrowing debate and bottling
up cultural and political outliers.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.260
So, you have the 1950s.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:10.690
The nation's living rooms had a TV set, which
served as a kind of national mirror.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:16.320
And what it presented was a populace that
was white, Christian, middle class, no accents,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.740
no vowels at the end of the name.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.470
It defined normal.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.660
It defined America.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:33.020
When Walter Cronkite used to end his CBS newscast
with the rock solid assertion that "that's

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:39.410
the way it is"--for those of you who are too
young to remember, that is how Walter Cronkite

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.510
ended his newscast.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.380
"And that's the way it is."

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.930
It sounds astonishingly arrogant today.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:53.090
Then, he was regarded, at least in one poll
in the 70s, as the most trusted man in America.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:10:01.370
His nightly suppertime slice of reality, facts,
unseasoned and served deadpan, was the standard.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.810
Now, a lot of people miss this period of objectivity.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:13.270
They think all this emotion roiling the media
landscape is coarsening the culture, is making

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.780
us stupid.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.840
It's not the emotion that's doing that.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:24.470
It's the lack of respect for facts.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.540
And that's an issue we can get to.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:32.310
But it never seemed to me, looking at the
history of American letters and literature

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:39.600
and especially journalism, that you needed
to be in an order of passionless priests in

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.850
order to do good journalism.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:47.240
Some of the nation's best journalism was done
by activists in the time, say, of the muckrakers.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.120
Some of the best columns, some of the best
reporting is done in columns today by people

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.610
like Nick Kristof, who frequently ends his
columns with calls to action.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:01.890
Here's a place where you can support this
charity, for instance.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.750
That doesn't mean his reporting is bad.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.000
It simply means we know who this person is.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.970
We know who he cares about.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.250
We still trust him to good information.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:18.490
It doesn't mean because he cares about something
that he's going to edit to win the argument

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.080
and that he's gonna ply you with lies.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.750
That's not what happens.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:28.150
And another thing is when you say you're objective,
how do you know?

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.800
It doesn't really exist.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:37.160
My favorite discovery, probably, in the course
of writing this incredibly dense two millennia

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:47.250
of media of history in 160 pages, is when
I looked the famous editorial in 1896, when

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.670
Adolph Ochs bought the New York Times.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:12:00.610
He wrote what is regarded as the single best
statement of journalism's highest ideals.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:08.560
He wrote, "It will be my earnest aim that
the New York Times give the news impartially,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:16.430
without fear or favor, regardless of party,
sect, or interest involved to invite intelligent

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.160
discussion from all shades of opinion."

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:25.660
Well, that without fear or favor cut, is probably
something many of you are familiar with, that

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.380
you've heard before.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.120
And that is where people usually end the quote.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.640
But he wrote a whole editorial.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:39.000
And he went on to say, "Nor will there be
a departure from the general tone, unless

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.980
it be to intensify its devotion to the cause
of sound money and tariff reform and advocacy

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.080
of the lowest tax consistent with good government.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.750
And no more government that is necessary--."

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:54.340
[audience laughs]
In other words, what he regarded as absolute

00:12:54.340 --> 00:13:05.740
fact, after impartially reviewing the evidence,
was a kind of bedrock belief in a very limited

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.590
role for government in local affairs.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:16.590
And yet all around him, there was grinding
dehumanizing poverty at the end of the 19th

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:17.760
Century.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.760
There were--.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.810
You could see it in the eyes of the people
who were selling his paper.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:27.000
Those boys were really miserable.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.950
There are pictures and pictures of them I
saw online.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:36.320
And it was stunning that he could come to
that conclusion and yet, that was his conclusion.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:44.380
His grandson, who in a recent commencement
speech, bemoaned the fact that our social

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:49.790
safety net is shredding, that we aren't taking
care of global warming, that women's right

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.029
to choose is being threatened.

00:13:52.029 --> 00:13:58.310
The whole litany of liberal issues was a sorry
state of affairs for this graduating class

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.610
to be inheriting.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:07.260
I think he would be in profound disagreement
over what the true facts are with his own

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.650
great grandfather.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:09.650
Or maybe grandfather.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.740
I can't guess.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:16.280
So, let us assume then that objectivity is
impossible.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.320
What are we left with?

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.610
Well, we're left with fairness.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.000
We're left with transparency.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.650
We blame the media for hobbling our judgment.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.510
We project that out.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:33.610
But is it really, purely the problem of media?

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.350
I mean, media in this country is run by money.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:40.440
I was recently on a panel at the Brooklyn
Book Fair.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.230
And I found myself in a really weird situation.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:50.650
I was on a panel with people at Fair and Democracy
Now, among others, who--.

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:58.230
And one of the women there had written a book
about reality television and she said that--.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:06.180
She basically called out corporations for
the nefarious agenda of generating and reinforcing

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:12.730
negative racial and gender stereotypes through
these reality TV shows.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:18.690
And I certainly wouldn't get up there and
defend these shows as being paragons of good

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:24.090
social, progressive social ideas.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:29.590
My question was simply about the agenda of
the corporations.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:33.470
These corporations have an agenda to make
money.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:39.279
If it doesn't pay to make women look like
idiots or to "keep the black man down," if

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:42.300
that's what they're doing, then they wouldn't
do it.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:49.070
Another thing is that she had the idea that
things were getting worse.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.300
And Amos and Andy was raised.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:56.460
Amos and Andy, of course, was at one time
the number one radio show in America.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:01.610
They would stop fights in Madison Square Garden
when it was on just to play it, or delay the

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.610
start.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:09.490
There is no single image of anything today
that conveys--.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:15.980
I mean, we don't have a Cosby Show that's
overturning a lot of popular notions 'cause

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:20.360
we don't have that kind of mainstream media
anymore.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.030
That mainstream media no longer exists to
set the agenda.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:29.100
I think that's where I really ran into problems
at the Brooklyn Book Fair.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:38.960
My feeling was that, and is, that increasingly
with every passing day, that agenda is our

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.770
own as news consumers.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:50.980
And that is where Google comes in because
as Clay Shirky said in response to all of

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:55.920
those people who say we're suffering from
information overload, what we really have

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.880
is filter failure.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.650
We all know how to negotiate a bookstore.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:07.900
But if somebody took the contents of a bookstore
and dumped it out onto the street and you

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.449
went there, you wouldn't be able to find anything.

00:17:10.449 --> 00:17:12.260
Same thing with a library.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.769
If you didn't understand how a library worked,
you wouldn't be able to find anything.

00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:23.519
Well, there is an unbounded universe of information
out there online, obviously.

00:17:23.519 --> 00:17:29.450
And the problem for many of us is we don't
know how to find what we want, except through

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.509
Google--most of the time.

00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:40.460
Google--always regarded as the demographic
way to sort information.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.789
You have a question, figure out how to answer
it, put it in there.

00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:50.659
And whatever other people thought was the
best answer over time, comes to the top.

00:17:50.659 --> 00:17:53.490
At least, that's the simple way of understanding
Google.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:18:05.480
I know you have all dealt with Eli Pariser's
concerns that Google may be reinforcing the

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:12.600
media echo chamber by using our own behavior
to serve us better.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.629
That's appalling.

00:18:14.629 --> 00:18:16.350
How can you do that?

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:23.210
Using our own behavior to serve us better
eliminates the possibility of serendipity.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:31.379
The more and more we get answers based on
our past behavior, the less likely we are

00:18:31.379 --> 00:18:34.960
to encounter information we otherwise might
not encounter.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:41.600
And if people are paying less attention to
newspapers, certainly paper newspapers, where

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.299
you might see an article on Zimbabwe and you
thought, "Well, I never was particularly interested

00:18:46.299 --> 00:18:49.070
in Zimbabwe, but this looks interesting."

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:55.710
And then suddenly, you're reading Zimbabwe--accidental
encounters with information, serendipity.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:19:01.179
What happens in a world where you can tailor
all your information precisely to where you've

00:19:01.179 --> 00:19:02.649
been before?

00:19:02.649 --> 00:19:06.712
This is a problem that concerns me as a news
producer because a lot of times I get asked

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:13.429
the question, "Why don't you just poll people
on what they wanna know about and then give

00:19:13.429 --> 00:19:14.590
that to them?"

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:21.200
And I thought, "Well, because I felt part
of my job was to give people stuff that they

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.830
didn't know about, that maybe they ought to
know about."

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:31.679
And so, the need to preserve serendipity in
not just my production, but also in all news

00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:34.799
production, is something I'm very concerned
about.

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:43.999
I do think, however, that people need to be
responsible for their own behavior more than

00:19:43.999 --> 00:19:46.049
they ever have before.

00:19:46.049 --> 00:19:49.240
This is a caveat and mature world.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.710
Our parents didn't have to pick their own
health care.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.210
They didn't have to pick their own pension
plan.

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:58.340
They didn't have to pick paper or plastic.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:02.659
And they only had three networks.

00:20:02.659 --> 00:20:04.710
We are used to choosing.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:12.890
And we choose in weird ways because we have
to function according to our biases.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:17.700
There's a really fascinating study that was
done.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:25.860
There was somebody whose brain--who had some
injury that affected the part of the brain

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.150
that dealt with emotion.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:33.440
So, what you had was a kind of de facto Mr.
Spock, you would think.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.210
Somebody who could function entirely according
to logic.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:44.739
But what happened with that disabled emotional
center is that he couldn't function at all.

00:20:44.739 --> 00:20:48.500
When asked, "Do you want the black pen or
the blue pen?"

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.799
He went down a rabbit hole of "Well, the black
pen is good for this.

00:20:51.799 --> 00:20:53.100
The blue pen is good for that.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:58.440
The black pen--" When faced with the choice
of a mate or even a breakfast cereal, forget

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.440
it.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:05.720
The person was incapable of making a decision
because there was always a countervailing

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.369
bit of information to take into consideration.

00:21:09.369 --> 00:21:18.220
And that is why we rely on our emotions, our
biases, to help us order the world.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.789
We order the world with our emotions and our
biases.

00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:24.889
Otherwise, it's way too complicated.

00:21:24.889 --> 00:21:32.220
And we use our media consumption to help us
solidify some kind of rational notion of how

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.899
the world works.

00:21:35.899 --> 00:21:40.220
Back before World War I, when everybody was
reading Horatio Alger novels, they really

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:44.610
believed that it was a level playing field
and that if you worked hard enough, you could

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:49.970
pull yourself up by the bootstraps and be
a successful American.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:54.590
Later on, that view was mediated by subsequent
events.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.970
Nevertheless, it was a comforting view.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:58.519
It seemed like a fair view.

00:21:58.519 --> 00:22:05.740
It was a view that you could certainly anecdotally
draw from what you saw around you.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:12.770
Well, now we live in a world of data--data
that is presented visually, data that Google

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:16.139
has become better and better at presenting
to us.

00:22:16.139 --> 00:22:26.710
But what is your responsibility, if any, to
ensure that people get--since Google is run

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:32.210
by an algorithm--you don't have to build our
biases into those search results.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.570
We may like it, but you don't have to do that.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:40.159
Do you serve us better by--?

00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:51.679
Eli Pariser offered in his book the example
of somebody, two different people, searching

00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:53.769
BP.

00:22:53.769 --> 00:22:59.809
And one of them found all sorts of stuff about
the environmental damage of the BP oil spill.

00:22:59.809 --> 00:23:05.889
And another person found its stock ranking,
its balance sheet, and this kind of thing.

00:23:05.889 --> 00:23:10.580
Supposedly, in a purely democratic Google
world, [chuckles] they would've gotten the

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.639
same results based on results that other people
found useful.

00:23:14.639 --> 00:23:21.399
Later on, Jacob Weisberg of Slate tried to
reproduce this experiment and found that there

00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:23.010
weren't differences in the searches.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.049
So, I don't know what's true and what isn't.

00:23:26.049 --> 00:23:28.119
And Google doesn't really wanna talk about
it.

00:23:28.119 --> 00:23:33.940
I don't know whether it's part of the secret
sauce that Google doesn't want anybody to

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:40.039
reproduce, but it would be interesting to
know how much our behavior is getting built

00:23:40.039 --> 00:23:41.500
into those searches.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.780
We know that it helps us with our spelling.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:51.880
And we also know that Google Translate is
able to correct for things.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.630
The more a language is translated online,
the better Google translate becomes.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:01.000
If you're speaking in a less-spoken language,
then you're out of luck.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.600
But, and that's a kind of democracy, too.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:11.980
Fundamentally, and that was the final analysis
of this book, "The Influencing Machine."

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:15.080
Let me hold it up for all those people on
YouTube.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:21.970
"The Influencing Machine's" final conclusion
is that ultimately, we get the media that

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.350
we deserve.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:33.509
I just wonder whether Google, given our built-in
biases and our desire to stay in groups with

00:24:33.509 --> 00:24:39.419
which we agree--what they call homophily--birds
of a feather flocking together--whether you

00:24:39.419 --> 00:24:42.690
can give us better than we deserve.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.869
Anyway, I think I'll stop there.

00:24:44.869 --> 00:24:46.139
Thank you.

00:24:46.139 --> 00:24:47.409
[applause]

00:24:47.409 --> 00:24:53.809
I have no idea how long I talked.

00:24:53.809 --> 00:24:57.330
Alex, do you know?

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:03.070
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: If anybody has questions,
you can--.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.379
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Yes, thank you.

00:25:04.379 --> 00:25:06.359
&gt;&gt;male #1: Fifty thousand dollar question.

00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:07.359
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Oh, good.

00:25:07.359 --> 00:25:08.950
&gt;&gt;male #1: The number 50,000.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:09.950
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Oh, yeah.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.100
&gt;&gt;male #1: Which is like a threshold, I guess,
in current media.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.100
Is that--.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.200
Do you have any evidence that that's scaled
over time back when you were reaching audiences

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.269
of hundreds of thousands with newspapers?

00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:25.230
Did it take less ridiculous numbers to get
people's attention to make you panic?

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:26.230
[Brooke laughs]

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:29.809
In the future, is it gonna be 30 billion people
died in car crash?

00:25:29.809 --> 00:25:36.700
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Well, you're referring to the chapter
in the book where I trace, I talk about the

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:41.919
odd use of numbers by people in the press
and how somebody can come up with a weird

00:25:41.919 --> 00:25:48.649
number, it's on a TV show, it gets picked
up by Congress, then it bounces back.

00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:54.239
And we found that 50 thousand was a number
that was particularly durable and used because

00:25:54.239 --> 00:26:01.850
it was what one FBI agent--former FBI operative--called
Goldilock's number, neither too big nor too

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:02.850
small.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:04.210
It was just right.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:09.629
And so, at one point, somebody came up with
the idea that there were 50 thousand predators

00:26:09.629 --> 00:26:13.720
online, trolling for kids.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:21.320
In the 80s, somebody said--and it got bounced
all over the place--that there were 50 thousand

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.899
human sacrifices a year in satanic rites.

00:26:24.899 --> 00:26:25.899
[laughter]

00:26:25.899 --> 00:26:29.279
&gt;&gt;male #1: Actually, I encountered this number
once, which is why it stuck in my head.

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:33.289
I had a house fire and I remember the police
telling me, "There are 50 thousand private

00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:35.269
insurance adjusters just waiting for your
business."

00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:36.840
[laughs] Wow, really?

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.990
In a city of a million?

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.090
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Yeah, you know.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:43.090
That sounds like a fair number.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:46.549
The only way you can fight these numbers,
obviously, is with data.

00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:52.119
The FBI guy didn't know about the predators
online number because they don't do data for

00:26:52.119 --> 00:26:54.359
that, but they do for homicides.

00:26:54.359 --> 00:27:00.690
And in the particular year in which this 50
thousand human sacrifice number was cited,

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:08.169
the FBI had only counted up 25 thousand homicides,
which meant that there were more than twice

00:27:08.169 --> 00:27:14.140
as many homicides of any kind just in the
human sacrifice vein.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.659
So clearly, it was bullshit.

00:27:15.659 --> 00:27:16.659
[laughter]

00:27:16.659 --> 00:27:21.690
But in terms of your number, are there other
hot numbers out there or has the number grown?

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:23.919
&gt;&gt;male #1: Does it float?

00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:24.919
Yeah.

00:27:24.919 --> 00:27:30.379
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Well, media itself is, electronic
media itself in the history of humankind is

00:27:30.379 --> 00:27:32.210
not very old.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:43.200
And I do think that our hunger for focus on
love of the illusory certainty of numbers

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.989
is not something that necessarily dates back
to the beginning of electronic media.

00:27:47.989 --> 00:27:55.220
I'm guessing that because there were fewer
numbers then, there were probably fewer opportunities

00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:02.619
to elect a number "most popular" the way that
50 thousand in recent years has been elected.

00:28:02.619 --> 00:28:04.070
&gt;&gt;male #1: Thanks.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.429
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Anything else?

00:28:05.429 --> 00:28:07.950
&gt;&gt;male #2: I have a question.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:08.950
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Yeah.

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:11.730
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Do you wanna use the microphone?

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.619
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Yeah, use the microphone.

00:28:13.619 --> 00:28:20.080
&gt;&gt;male #2: So, when you talk about "The Influencing
Machine," I start thinking about media that

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.080
has--.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:26.029
So, we have more people that are making media,
if I can put that in quotes now.

00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:28.139
And that can be upward in a lot of ways.

00:28:28.139 --> 00:28:34.450
One section that's really intriguing to me
is the creation of silly, little internet

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:35.450
memes.

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:39.239
So, I'm sure you've come across I Can Haz
Cheezburger.

00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:45.549
And to me, that is an interesting thing because
in of itself, it's not a joke.

00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:50.371
It's not, as an image, as an objective view
of the image, I Can Haz Cheezburger with a

00:28:50.371 --> 00:28:52.369
cat's face on it isn't funny.

00:28:52.369 --> 00:28:57.799
But ten people in the world decided that this
is funny and then it snowballed from there.

00:28:57.799 --> 00:29:02.659
And then the creation of this whole new language,
which all these people came together and decided

00:29:02.659 --> 00:29:03.919
this is funny.

00:29:03.919 --> 00:29:05.600
And then it kept snowballing.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.889
And that's something that goes on in a lot
of memes online.

00:29:09.889 --> 00:29:16.470
Do you have a point of view on where that
fits in in the whole objective/subjective

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:22.419
paradigm and how that fits into "The Influencing
Machine?" if I may put it that way.

00:29:22.419 --> 00:29:27.249
&gt;&gt;Brooke: I'm not a hundred percent sure I
understand the question, but if you're saying

00:29:27.249 --> 00:29:36.200
that where does this election of certain memes
is being particularly popular or as a place

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.070
to land briefly as you go on?

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:45.239
There was a time when people would stand around
the water cooler and talk about the Mary Tyler

00:29:45.239 --> 00:29:47.090
Moore show.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:52.950
This is an environment in which those moments
become briefer and briefer and briefer.

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:57.549
And maybe they're only as big as a single
still photo.

00:29:57.549 --> 00:30:07.809
But there is a world of absurdity, or ironic
detachment, that can be conveyed in even a

00:30:07.809 --> 00:30:17.789
single still message, or just a kind of mysterious
resonation that just appeals.

00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:20.529
I mean, I don't get them all.

00:30:20.529 --> 00:30:21.929
I do get some of them.

00:30:21.929 --> 00:30:27.249
And I think they're hilarious and some of
them pass me right by.

00:30:27.249 --> 00:30:31.440
And I've certainly been guilty of sending
a lot of these things around as well.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:39.260
And I was an early sender of Pearl on the
Funny or Die, the drunken two-year old yelling

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.260
at Will Ferrell.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.779
I mean, I just couldn't get enough of it.

00:30:42.779 --> 00:30:43.779
But that was lengthy.

00:30:43.779 --> 00:30:47.159
And there are plenty of others that I've sent
around over the years.

00:30:47.159 --> 00:30:49.600
I think that they're a way to hook up.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:57.739
It's part of this global sense of humor that
emerges, not to unite people, but to create

00:30:57.739 --> 00:31:02.879
different communities around the world just
as they're created around issues.

00:31:02.879 --> 00:31:07.400
They could be created around these cultural
moments and these cultural memes.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:15.289
This is another way in which a new kind of
cultural arrangement.

00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:18.100
I don't wanna say "order" because it isn't
hierarchical.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.570
It's a new way that we connect, which is unfamiliar.

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:22.570
It's new.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:27.890
It's not how we ever connected before and
has no reference to time or space.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:33.090
It's part of that kind of community that could
only exist in a world without time and space.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:34.700
&gt;&gt;male #2: Thank you.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.749
&gt;&gt;Brooke: I hope that sort of got there.

00:31:36.749 --> 00:31:37.749
&gt;&gt;male #2: It did.

00:31:37.749 --> 00:31:38.749
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Thank you.

00:31:38.749 --> 00:31:39.749
&gt;&gt;male #3: Hi.

00:31:39.749 --> 00:31:41.059
My name is Trey Harrison.

00:31:41.059 --> 00:31:45.639
I'm an engineer here at Google New York.

00:31:45.639 --> 00:31:54.419
I loved your book and in July, I was posting
on Twitter and Google+ about the book as I

00:31:54.419 --> 00:31:55.630
was reading it.

00:31:55.630 --> 00:32:00.779
And this was in the middle of the whole Vivian
Schiller mess and NPR.

00:32:00.779 --> 00:32:07.429
And I think a lot of people were just searching
the web for NPR and waiting to jump into things

00:32:07.429 --> 00:32:08.429
to argue about.

00:32:08.429 --> 00:32:11.440
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Well, thank you for posting it then.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.440
[laughter]

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:18.129
&gt;&gt;male #3: But one interesting, I got like
50 responses to this one post that I made

00:32:18.129 --> 00:32:19.529
about the book.

00:32:19.529 --> 00:32:29.010
And the argument that people got into, and
I think some of the right wing and anti-NPR

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:35.879
types egged them on, but it's some of the
people who say that they always give to their

00:32:35.879 --> 00:32:38.279
NPR stations that got into it.

00:32:38.279 --> 00:32:44.019
But they said that they thought that it was
unfair what you were doing with the book.

00:32:44.019 --> 00:32:53.419
For instance, the YouTube promo where it had
the "On the Media" music and the fact that

00:32:53.419 --> 00:32:55.759
the book subtitle had "On the Media" in it.

00:32:55.759 --> 00:33:03.370
And that you were spring boarding off of what
were partially public dollars and partially

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:10.809
pledged dollars to do some sort of self-aggrandizement
between you and Neufeld.

00:33:10.809 --> 00:33:17.710
And I just wondered if you would just respond
because I think that it's perfectly reasonable

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:23.029
for somebody to have a career and try to move
forward with their career, especially in ideas

00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:24.979
as important as the ones you bring up.

00:33:24.979 --> 00:33:27.169
&gt;&gt;Brooke: I think it's a fair criticism.

00:33:27.169 --> 00:33:28.460
I thought about it.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:39.119
I know that Bob wanted to interview me on
the book and I said, "Absolutely not."

00:33:39.119 --> 00:33:42.720
It was Norton that obviously wanted to--.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.340
I am who I am.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:50.879
It wasn't NPR that was promoting the book.

00:33:50.879 --> 00:33:56.650
It was probably Norton and other people who
had approached me over the years to write

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:59.279
a book did it because I had a selling platform.

00:33:59.279 --> 00:34:00.799
So, it's true.

00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:02.429
I let them use the music.

00:34:02.429 --> 00:34:04.529
We didn't stop them from using the music.

00:34:04.529 --> 00:34:07.519
On the other hand, Ben Allison just has it
on a record.

00:34:07.519 --> 00:34:09.800
So, anybody can use the music.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:22.820
I could see why people might think that because
there's public money involved--.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:23.820
I don't know.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:38.170
I mean, how does any author sell a book while
boxing off what made them competent--if they

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.070
were competent--to write the book.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:44.780
I mean, it's my expertise developed over years
on the program that--.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:50.040
Otherwise, why not just say "The Influencing
Machine" by Anonymous?

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.340
It just doesn't really make sense.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:57.630
I sympathize with the queasiness.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.730
I had some.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:02.490
I did not want this subtitle: "Brooke Gladstone
on the media."

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:03.670
That was definitely Norton.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.200
I had like, 20 billion other subtitles.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.150
And they went, "Nah, let's go with this."

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:11.110
I was like, "Oh, gee.

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:12.880
That's a surprise."

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:20.430
So, I can identify with the queasiness, but
I honestly feel that this is my own project

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:22.670
and Josh's.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:28.550
And it is a product of mine and Josh's past.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:31.470
That's what we have to recommend us.

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:35.790
Josh wrote a brilliant book on Katrina called
"AD After the Deluge."

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:40.510
Should he not put that in anything?

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:44.570
I understand that I work for a non-profit,
but I don't think that means I have to put

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:48.590
a gag order on any reference to what I've
done in my history in non-profits.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.470
I've been with NPR since 1987.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:55.590
That's a long time to black out.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:36:00.140
So, I sympathize, but not enough to not use
it.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:05.520
&gt;&gt;male #3: It's a very good follow-up on the
question of it being a project between you

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.480
and Josh.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.480
How did that work.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:12.990
I mean, it's a graphic novel, non-fiction
book.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:16.470
I mean, did you write the text and he illustrated
it?

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.050
Did you have meetings and--?

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:19.370
&gt;&gt;Brooke: It was quite interesting.

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:22.620
I mean, I decided to do it this way.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:26.570
I decided it was possible to do it this way
after I read two books.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:32.010
One was Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics,"
which is a magisterial work of sheer genius

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.210
that I kept by my bed the whole time.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:42.930
And the other was the graphic novelization
of Paul Auster's "City of Glass," which is

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:49.310
a gorgeous book in which there's much abstract
nonlinear thinking going on, which is conveyed

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:54.050
so brilliantly by Dave Mazzucchelli and the
other people who worked that book.

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:59.450
Now, I saw what was possible and I saw what
you had to do to do it.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:07.700
I have gotten media books in my office once
a week for the last decade and it's very frustrating

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.590
because they can be very hard to get through.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:13.030
They tend to fall in one or two camps.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.070
It's either a right wing.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:20.740
It's either a right wing book that's masquerading
as media criticism, or a left wing book masquerading

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.740
as media criticism.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.060
In other words, political proxy books.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:30.790
Or else, they are, it's the collapse of civilization,
doom is neigh.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:35.700
Or else, we are teetering on the brink of
an absolute gorgeous cyber-utopia, so don't

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.550
worry about a thing.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:41.400
And I felt like I was steering the middle
course.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:45.710
And that seems like, "Well, what's the big
deal with that?"

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:51.270
But that means that a lot of people got mad
at me on both sides of that line.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.170
But I wanted to do it in a way--.

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:58.900
I wanted to build my argument on a series
of historical anecdotes that I thought were

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:03.750
terrifically significant and I wanted those
ideas to be sticky.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:07.020
And I understand about visual images being
sticky.

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.320
I mean, somebody talks to me about this book
and they ask me question and I'll say, "Well,

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.120
remember that picture where blah, blah, blah."

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.630
And they'll remember it a lot faster than
they will the argument.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:19.120
I also wanted to try something new.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:24.730
And I felt that this would be much more like
radio, which I know is a little weirdly counterintuitive.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:31.420
Radio is [chuckles lightly] the medium without
pictures, but radio is incredibly intimate

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.550
and anybody who listens to it on a regular
basis knows that you have a relationship with

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:39.630
that voice which is not the same as with newspaper
reporting or television.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:40.630
There's a person there.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.180
There has to be a person there.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.780
And I'm used to writing for radio.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:49.890
Done it almost all of my professional life
and I wanted to speak in bubbles and look

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:51.570
the reader in the eye.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.260
So, I was able to do that.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:58.030
Also, this book, unlike almost every other
bit of graphic non-fiction--with the exception

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:00.790
of Scott McCloud--is nonlinear.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:02.060
It's non-chronological.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.160
You're jumping back and forth.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.690
You need a guide.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:12.100
You need a Virgil to take you [giggles lightly]
through this very complicated territory, especially

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:17.150
since we're hopping back and forth through
a couple of millennium with a little side

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:21.620
trip to the Stone Age and to the year 2045.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:26.610
And so, you really need somebody to hold your
hand through that thing and I wanted to be

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:27.610
that person.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:32.800
In terms of the process--I know this is long
answer--but that was really interesting because

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.641
the difference between a graphic book, like
this one, and an illustrated book is that

00:39:37.641 --> 00:39:40.310
an illustrated book supports the text.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:44.210
But a graphic book, in panels, replaces the
text.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:50.330
Now, when I first wrote my first few pages
for Josh, he said, "What is this?"

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:54.050
And I said, "Well, I hope I didn't give you
too much.

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:57.680
Here's my suggestion for what I think could
be in the page, but I don't wanna cramp your

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.680
artistic freedom."

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.590
And he went, "Oh no.

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:03.200
You totally don't get it."

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:08.350
He said, "You have to tell me exactly what
you want me to draw.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:10.050
I can't read your mind."

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:15.850
So, for a thousand panels, essentially what
I did was write--.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:22.900
Say there were 20 words text in the panel,
a detailed description of 200 words of how

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:29.710
to arrange the whole thing, and then maybe
a half a dozen links to visual reference points

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:30.710
for Josh.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:34.020
Josh was brilliant.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:43.130
He did an astonishing job of writing funny
columns and comics that are absolutely tragic

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:49.020
based on a lot of photographic material and
a lot of fancy.

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:54.450
There were a lot of times when I sent him
something and he would say, "No, Brooke.

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:58.730
You cannot fit the entire Crimean War in a
single panel.

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:02.310
[audience chuckles]
You can do one horseman, [audience laughs]

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:07.790
or you could do a two-page splash, but what
you're asking for in an army of a trillion

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:11.620
extras is not gonna happen in one-sixth of
a comic page."

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:19.870
So, he was like the experienced director of
photography--brilliantly skilled, experienced

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:21.320
director of photography.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:25.740
And I was like the newbie director.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:29.160
I story-boarded every single panel.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:33.161
And when it worked, he did it as I asked.

00:41:33.161 --> 00:41:37.340
And when it didn't, he would suggest other
angles.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.810
And we both worked towards the production
of this book.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:48.780
But the astonishing thing for me was how much
fun and how illuminating, how much I learned

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.210
looking for reference points.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:57.580
So much information in this book, I happened
upon serendipitously when looking for visual

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.110
reference points for Josh.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:04.790
&gt;&gt;male #3: But so, the many visual callouts,
like the Gin Lane and Beer Street one for

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:05.790
instance.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:06.790
That came from you --.

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:12.010
&gt;&gt;Brooke: I sent him the Hogarth and I said,
"Do this Hogarth, but I want you to have them

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:14.240
reading these newspapers."

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:21.130
And I sent him a list of the names of newspapers
that were being read in the time that I'm

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:22.160
talking about.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.230
But yes, I sent him the Hogarth.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.870
I sent him the Vitruvian Man.

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:34.120
I sent him all this stuff and then he had
to make sense of it.

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:43.510
And he was drafting these frames even after
my description, some of which were not possible

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.510
to follow.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:48.660
I mean, he had to teach me all the time the
art of the possible.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.460
By the end, I sort of got it.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:56.130
But I had to completely redo the war section,
which is kind of a book within a book because

00:42:56.130 --> 00:43:01.950
I, what I had asked him to do was quite literally
impossible.

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:07.990
Had to completely send revisions on every
single one of those panels.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:09.580
I thought he was gonna--.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:12.580
It was just surprising he was able to keep
his equanimity.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.510
&gt;&gt;male #3: Thanks.

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:15.800
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Mm-hmm?

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:23.700
&gt;&gt;male #4: You had mentioned someone else
mentioning that our role is perhaps part of

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:24.700
the problem here.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.700
&gt;&gt;Brooke: That what is?

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:30.310
&gt;&gt;male #4: That Google is perhaps part of
the problem here in terms of focusing the

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:36.520
results on what the person is expecting or
what we know about that person's expectations.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:41.420
And I think most people who work at Google
have actually thought this themselves at one

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.990
point along the line.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:47.150
Are we contributing to narrowing everybody's
world view?

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:52.640
But the flip side of that, isn't it, is what
you mentioned in terms of corporation.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:44:00.960
Google's job is not to educate and uplift
the intelligence of the population, right?

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.890
Our job is to make money.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:11.920
And if we don't deliver the results that people
want, even if that is very much narrow-casting,

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:17.340
people are gonna go to Yahoo or Bing or something
and Google will fall by the wayside.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.070
So, I'm not sure how to do that.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:20.910
I have sympathy for--.

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:24.870
&gt;&gt;Brooke: And how does that conflict with
the "don't be evil" mandate?

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:25.870
[laughter]

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:27.940
&gt;&gt;male #4: Yeah, don't be evil, but don't--.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:28.940
I'm not sure.

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:29.940
Yeah.

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:34.500
Is it really evil though to deliver the results
that people expect?

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.780
&gt;&gt;Brooke: This is a really--.

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:41.060
It is a fine irony.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:46.180
When Eli Pariser, he was complaining about
Google, he was also complaining about Facebook

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:53.290
dropping people off of his newsfeed who--these
conservatives--he's very liberal, he's the

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:57.920
founder of Move On-- these conservatives that
he had friended, so he could see what was

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.510
going on there.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:06.000
And Facebook eventually dropped their things
from his newsfeed.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.700
I'm sure he has many hundreds or thousands
of friends.

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:15.930
So, because he wasn't going to them.

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:17.870
And he was like, "How could they do that?

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:21.130
They've just edited my stuff for me."

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:23.210
But you weren't going to them.

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:29.290
So, the question is you wanna create a situation
where--.

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:33.570
Like for instance, if I created an RSS feed
that had tons of stuff in it that I wasn't

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:38.780
interested in and I didn't go to them, what
good is the RSS feed?

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:44.870
Ultimately, we have to be responsible for
going outside our comfort zones.

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:52.030
The only trouble is, is Google is a way to
get outside your comfort zone painlessly in

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:55.000
the process of doing a basic search.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:04.400
So, it would be a shame if Google served us
so well that an area of serendipity disappeared.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.580
I understand that there's a conflict.

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:14.150
At this point, I don't see any real competition
on the horizon.

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:18.670
And maybe the narrowing of the focus isn't--.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:26.300
I mean, have they done lots of studies to
determine whether or not you're way more successful

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:31.790
and you make a lot more money and people click
to more things when you do searches based

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:32.880
on their past behavior?

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:33.880
Do we know?

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.960
&gt;&gt;male #4: I can't answer that question.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.960
&gt;&gt;Brooke: I mean, it's a good business.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.000
Or do we just think it's good business?

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.230
I guess is the question.

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.370
I'm sure there's an answer out there.

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:42.370
I just don't know what it is.

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:46.780
&gt;&gt;male #4: In the print media, in the example
that I think of like, major newspapers, of

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:51.350
the major newspaper that tried to do this,
tried to be erudite and educate people in

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:55.360
terms of stuff they should know would be the
Christian Science Monitor, right?

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.870
And they didn't survive, right?

00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:04.260
People go for New York Times with its supposed
liberal bias, or the Wall Street Journal and

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.420
FOX News for the other side of it.

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:09.640
&gt;&gt;Brooke: I don't know that I would distinguish
a whole lot between the Christian Science

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.690
Monitor and the New York--.

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:12.690
I mean, some of these--.

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:16.320
I think the Christian Science Monitor went
through so many cuts, they started doing less

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.320
and less reporting.

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:23.020
It was the vicious circle that's happened
with a lot of newspapers where they just,

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.440
they keep cutting back their service.

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:28.300
So then, fewer people come and then they have
to cut back their service even more and eventually

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:29.300
they disappear.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.130
I mean, I think that--.

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:36.170
I wouldn't say that the mission of the Christian
Science Monitor was radically different from

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:37.830
that of the New York Times.

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:44.150
I just think that the Christian Science Monitor
didn't have enough reserves, wasn't big enough

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:50.180
to survive the darkest times and to adapt
appropriately.

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:55.810
I wouldn't say, "Oh, there's an example of
a pure newspaper that didn't survive because

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:59.330
it tried to be really good."

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:00.820
I can't really believe that.

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.350
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I think this will be the
last question.

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:04.350
Go ahead.

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:12.680
&gt;&gt;male #5: So, you mentioned earlier the effect
of the fact that media organizations are businesses

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:17.900
on how they, basically on everything that
they do.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:26.090
And I was wondering what your perspective
was on how that means that wealthy individuals

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:35.820
and wealthy corporations can use that wealth
to direct the media discussion.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:43.010
&gt;&gt;Brooke: Well, certainly the patronage model
seems to be making a comeback.

00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:50.140
I mean, if you look at ProPublica, which does
amazing work in partnership with lots of other

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:56.360
mainstream media outlets, they essentially
function because they get lots of grants and

00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:01.590
stuff, but basically it's one family that
supports this organization and enables it

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:02.770
to function.

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:09.370
It does it according to very high ideals of
journalism.

00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:16.530
Every news outlet has to decide what it is
that's worth covering and what isn't.

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:23.190
And they'll make those decisions maybe along
liberal lines, but it's good work.

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:24.490
It's solid work.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:31.880
It's prize-winning work in the case of the
amazing piece that was done about the hospital

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:35.210
during Katrina, where they just let some patients
die.

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:37.340
I don't know if you saw it in the New York
Times.

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:43.280
It was a really stunning piece that won a
Pulitzer.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:50.490
Rich people will come back into this in a
big way, I think, if they're willing to lose

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:52.620
money [chuckles] because they will.

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.670
I mean, rich people have always been in--.

00:49:54.670 --> 00:50:05.110
I mean, it's always been rich families that's
owned a lot of America's great and worst newspapers

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:06.730
and magazines.

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:12.700
I think that rich people will direct the discussion
with news outlets more.

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:23.190
The most noticeable way I think that rich
people direct coverage is by being desirable

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:24.490
audience members.

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:32.380
And the fact of the matter is, I've been upbraided
and I think correctly, because I say that

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:39.290
the media reflects all of America, and I think
it pretty much does in a fun house mirror.

00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:40.640
It's a little distorted.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:41.650
It's a little cracked.

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:42.940
It's not well-calibrated.

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:48.310
But essentially, we're all out there and so
is everybody that we can't stand.

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:53.380
But one thing that is hugely unrepresented
is poor people.

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:59.650
And I really do think that's because of the
fact that for most media, this is an advertising

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:01.530
run business.

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:07.070
I think you'll see maybe a little bit more
of that on public media, but not a whole lot

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:08.070
more.

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:09.540
I think there should be more.

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:15.610
I mean, there's been over the last 50 years,
there's been an explosion of business reporting

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:19.460
and a complete shriveling of labor reporting.

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:24.970
There are things out there that relate to
coverage that have everything to do with wealth.

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:29.390
I think mostly it's a great thing if we can
get rich people to part with their money.

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:31.610
I work for National Public Radio.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.170
So, I could use it.

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:35.220
Actually, I work for WNYC.

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:39.070
But, same thing.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:40.070
Thank you guys very much.

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:41.070
It was a pleasure.

00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:41.071
