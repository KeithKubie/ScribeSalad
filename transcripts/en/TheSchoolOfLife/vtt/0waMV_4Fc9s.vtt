00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.080
One of the most important principles for choosing a lover sensibly

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.420
is not to feel in any hurry to make a choice.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.060
Being satisfied with being single is a precondition of satisfactory coupledom.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.080
We cannot choose wisely when remaining single feels unbearable.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.740
We have to be utterly at peace with the prospect of many years of solitude

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.900
in order to have any chance of forming a good relationship,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:37.320
or we'll love no longer being single rather more than we love the partner who spared us being so.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.640
Unfortunately, after a certain age, society makes singlehood feel dangerously unpleasant.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.040
Communal life starts to wither.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.760
People in couples are too threatened by the independence of the single

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.000
to invite them around very often

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.380
in case they're reminded of something they might have missed.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.440
Friendship and sex are, despite all the gadgets, still remarkably hard to come by.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.940
No wonder if when someone slightly decent, but not quite so comes along,

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.860
we cling to them to our eventual, enormous cost.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.820
When sex was only available within marriage,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.420
people recognized that this would lead some people to marry for the wrong reasons,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.580
to obtain something that was artifically restricted in society as a whole.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.780
Sexual liberation was intended to allow people to have a clearer head

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.660
when choosing who they really wanted to be with,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.000
but this process remains only half finished.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.460
Only when we can make sure that being single is potentially as secure, warm and fulfilling

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.100
as being in a couple

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.560
will we know that people are choosing to pair up for the right reasons.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.260
It's time to liberate companionship from the shackles of coupledom,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.460
and make it as widely and as easily available as sexual liberators wanted sex to be.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.940
In the meantime, we should strive to make ourselves as much at peace as we can

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.220
with the idea of being alone for a very long time.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.720
Only then do we stand a chance of deciding to be with someone on the basis of their own and true merits.
