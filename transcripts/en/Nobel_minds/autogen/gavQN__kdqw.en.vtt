00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140
what do you've been writing about all
 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.970
what do you've been writing about all
this time in a way is that question of

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980
this time in a way is that question of
 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.770
this time in a way is that question of
our place in the world our connection to

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780
our place in the world our connection to
 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.450
our place in the world our connection to
each other our connection with the world

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460
each other our connection with the world
 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.540
each other our connection with the world
but is perhaps the theme you explore the

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550
but is perhaps the theme you explore the
 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.220

I could put it a little bit more

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980
I could put it a little bit more
 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.160
I could put it a little bit more
narrowly than that I mean it's probably

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170
narrowly than that I mean it's probably
 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.930
narrowly than that I mean it's probably
one of the things that's interested me

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940
one of the things that's interested me

one of the things that's interested me
always is new this be how we live in

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780
always is new this be how we live in
 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.660
always is new this be how we live in
small worlds and big worlds at the same

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670
small worlds and big worlds at the same
 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.060
small worlds and big worlds at the same
time and we have a personal arena in

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070
time and we have a personal arena in
 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.780
time and we have a personal arena in
which we have to try and find fulfilment

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790
which we have to try and find fulfilment
 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.200
which we have to try and find fulfilment
and love and that but that inevitably

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210
and love and that but that inevitably
 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.930
and love and that but that inevitably
intersects with the larger world where

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940
intersects with the larger world where
 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.010

politics and or even yet dystopian

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020
politics and or even yet dystopian
 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.900
politics and or even yet dystopian
universes can prevail here and so I

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910
universes can prevail here and so I
 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.190
universes can prevail here and so I
think I've always been interested in

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200
think I've always been interested in
 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.580
think I've always been interested in
that that we live in we live in small

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590
that that we live in we live in small
 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.200
that that we live in we live in small
worlds and big worlds at the same time
