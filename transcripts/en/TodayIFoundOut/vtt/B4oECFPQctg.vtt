Why We ‘Drop’ the Ball on New Years

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.340
When Adolph Ochs purchased the floundering
New York Times in 1896, he made it his mission

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.529
to make the newspaper the number one paper
in all of New York.

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.490
He started by forming the New York Times Company
and made himself the majority owner, ensuring

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.200
the financial health of the paper.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.320
Next, he lowered the price of a daily edition
from three cents to one cent.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.490
Readership began to ascend.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.230
Then, he moved the entire staff into a new
shiny building in the middle of Manhattan,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.360
to a place called Longacre Square, later renamed
Times Square.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.420
But Ochs was a man of fine tastes and big
imagination.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.739
To celebrate the 1904 New Year and to show
off the Times’ new digs, Ochs threw a lavish

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.820
New Year’s celebration that was to be “the
talk of the town.”

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.990
He hosted an all-day street festival climaxing
with a midnight fireworks display from the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.580
base of the Times building.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.510
Reportedly at midnight “the joyful sound
of cheering, rattles and noisemakers from

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.200
the over 200,000 attendees could be heard
from as far away as Croton-on-Hudson, thirty

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.200
miles north.”

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.650
Despite the city later putting a kibosh on
the fireworks display, the Times Square New

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.890
Year’s Eve bash was born.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.970
Even without fireworks, Ochs found a new way
New Yorkers could celebrate the incoming new

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.850
year in style and with glorious light.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.631
In 1907, Ochs commissioned the building of
an electrically-lit ball to be lowered on

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:34.360
the flagpole of the roof of One Times Square
(the new name of the newspaper’s building).

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.810
A “time ball” had been the suggestion
of the newspaper’s head electrician, Walter

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.340
Painer, who had seen one in use on top of
the close-by Western Union building.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.930
Time balls had been a favored way of broadcasting
the time to sea travelers in the 19th century.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.659
The first one was built in 1829 by inventor
Robert Wauchope.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.060
These soon became regular features in ports
across the world.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.330
When the ball began its descent (1 pm in many
parts of the world and noon in the US), people

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.259
would set their clocks to match the ball.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.480
By the beginning of the 20th century, with
the advent of radio and other more advanced

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.710
technologies, the time ball became obsolete.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.180
In 1907, the time ball, while not completely
considered archaic yet, was beginning to become

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.489
something people just enjoyed watching.

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.529
ball-dropIncandescent light bulbs were a relatively
new invention, having just begun being mass-marketed

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.892
to consumers around the turn of the twentieth
century.

00:02:24.892 --> 00:02:29.459
The newness of this innovation appealed to
Adolph Ochs and he fashioned his “New Year’s

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.870
Eve Ball” with one hundred 25 watt light
bulbs.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.860
The rest of the ball was made out of iron
and wood.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.349
Though it was only five feet in diameter,
it weighed nearly 700 pounds.

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.230
Ochs had a young immigrant metalworker by
the name of Jacob Starr, working for the sign

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.040
company Artkraft Strauss, make the ball.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.459
Starr was also given the responsibility of
lowering it at the specified time.

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.900
On New Year’s Eve, 1907, at exactly the
stroke of midnight, Starr lowered the ball

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.970
signifying that it was 1908 and the beginning
of a New Year’s tradition.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.419
The ball’s construction over time, in many
ways, mimicked the history of industry in

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:04.560
the United States.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.430
In 1920, they would replace the original ball
with one made solely out of iron, showing

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.370
off the steel strength of America.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.389
The ball didn’t drop in 1942 and 1943 -the
only time it didn’t drop in the last 110

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.439
years- due to wartime light restrictions and
industrial production focused on the war efforts.

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:27.120
In 1955, the heavy iron ball was replaced
by a much lighter aluminum ball weighing in

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.480
at a shade over two hundred pounds.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.749
Rhinestones, strobe lights, and a computerized
lighting system were added in 1995, signifying

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:36.760
the age of ubiquitous computers.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.659
The new millennium brought a new ball outfitted
with 504 Waterford Crystals, 168 halogen bulbs,

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:43.979
and spinning mirrors.

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:49.099
The weight of the ball jumped from two hundred
pounds to over 1,070 pounds.

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.329
Today, the ball is twelve feet in diameter,
more than double its original 1907 size.

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.809
The new ball weighs in at over five metric
tons and features LEDs and computerized lighting

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:59.809
patterns.

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:04.349
It sits on top of One Times Square year-round
for tourists and locals alike to marvel at,

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:14.199
but it’s only on one day a year the we actually
see 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:35.000
the 
ball drop.
