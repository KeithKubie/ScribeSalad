1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,040
You are listening to
radio lab radio from W.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,300
N y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,980
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad.
I'm Robert Krulwich. Right.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,320
So let me explain to you how
I got got started with this.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,470
You were at some kind of an
affair. I'll tell you how good.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,810
I was at a party party. Uh, it was a,

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,590
it was a conference where they have a
lot of different people of different

8
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:28,860
disciplines come together,
you know, one of those. Um,

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,810
there are panel discussions
of various things. It's,

10
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:33,930
we were at one of the
like functions and, uh,

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,980
it was a situation where like dinner
hadn't yet been served and there was a lot

12
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:40,860
of booze being served, so everybody
was like drunk on an empty stomach.

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,120
So I was standing there with some
biologists. Oh, they're the fun ones.

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,070
The junk biologists. Yes. As night. My
people barely. And uh, they, uh, we were,

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,740
they, they started to lose their shit,

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,270
like genuinely lose their shit about
this thing called CRISPR. And like,

17
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:59,970
I've never seen scientists this
excited about anything. So I was like,

18
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:01,770
what is this thing?
Wake up, what is CRISPR?

19
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,060
And they were trying to explain it to me,

20
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:05,460
but they couldn't slow down
enough for me to get it.

21
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,710
I gathered it had something
to do with genetics.

22
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:10,050
And then at 1.1 of the biologist
turned to me and was like,

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,880
I'll tell you what it is. I can use
CRISPR to take a little dog and Poof,

24
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:16,920
make it into a big dog.
Give me a Chihuahua.

25
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,190
I can turn it into the size of a great
Dane. And I was like, no, you can't.

26
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,920
He's like, yes I can. I could
do it with crisper. I was like,

27
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:25,620
what the hell is this thing? Do
you want me to sit here as usual?

28
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:30,880
If you sit here, I will get out,
let me know, imply I, no, no, no,

29
00:01:30,881 --> 00:01:32,520
no, no. We'd be sitting here together.

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,870
So what happened was I came back and I
immediately called science writer Carl

31
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,100
Zimmer because I just figured for this
kind of thing, this is a Carl thing.

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,390
I got to talk to Carl. So I a, I
basically asked them like, while the fuss,

33
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,770
maybe it was just the alcohol or,

34
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,690
but maybe there's something
really happening here.

35
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,360
Oh, there's something totally
happening here. I mean, it's big.

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,090
He started at the beginning so that
you can actually find like the first

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,120
reference to CRISPR in a 1987 paper
from some Japanese scientists.

38
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,960
They basically described something
weird in Nikolai and they said,

39
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,070
we don't know what this is.

40
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,400
Ecola are bacteria inside humans.

41
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,350
And like all living things equalize made
up of DNA, A's and t's and C's and g's.

42
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:20,610
And what happened was that
these scientists were reading
a chunk of that genetic

43
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,690
code when

44
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,780
they found this really
strange stretch of DNA.

45
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,410
Strange how well, so
basically what it was, um,

46
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:32,390
was five identical sequences

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,020
in a row.

48
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,400
And then they were separated by very
short sequences in between them that were

49
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,000
all different from each other.
These little blurbs, it'd be like,

50
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,203
okay,

51
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,283
[inaudible]

52
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,070
and they looked at this and
they're like, well, what,

53
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,650
this is nothing like we've seen before.

54
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,730
Repeated sequences in
bacterial are kind of unusual.

55
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:03,910
Seems very strange. Some
biologists felt that, you know,

56
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,780
there must be a purpose for these among
those purposes. Eagers Jennifer Doudna,

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,440
University of California Berkeley.
She's a cell biologist, so it's Doudna.

58
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,880
Not Dude. No, it's Doudna.

59
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,090
I used to be called the dude
sometimes in the in school,

60
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,620
but in the movie she will be played
by Jeff Bridges. Right. Anyhow,

61
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,533
as time goes on,

62
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,560
scientists are seeing these little
repeat blurp repeats everywhere. Yes.

63
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,460
Releasing bacteria, lots and lots of
lots of species of bacteria. They say,

64
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,210
okay, wait a minute. That's
kind of cool. Their findings,

65
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,220
it so often that they decided they had
to give it a name and this is this where

66
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:41,020
the named CRISPR comes from. The full
official name is clustered regularly.

67
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,820
Interspaced short palindromic
repeats. Oh my God.

68
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,280
I don't know why they called it
CRISPR. It's kind of a CRISPR.

69
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,450
It's like a furniture manufacturer or
something. It sounds like an app. Yeah,

70
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,100
yeah. CRISPR. CRISPR, but now
scientists had this puzzle.

71
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,230
If nature at this level
preserved something intact. Here,

72
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,320
I'm here and here and here and here and
here and some of these here's or are

73
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,600
creatures that have been around for
hundreds of millions of years. You figure,

74
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,610
well, whatever this is, it's
doing something, doing something,

75
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,480
but what it doesn't take very long
before the first big clue comes up.

76
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,171
All right,

77
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:25,171
fast forward 2005 now scientists have
these big searchable databases of DNA

78
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:29,410
sequences, so some scientists
think, well, let's do a search.

79
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,340
Let's see if these repeating
patterns. We keep finding match.

80
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,370
Anything else that's out there in the
world and the scientists are using

81
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:43,210
computers to just line up these stretches
of DNA with thousands upon thousands

82
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:46,030
of different species and then click.

83
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,700
All of a sudden they discover that
those bits of DNA between the repeats,

84
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,630
the stuff in the middle of those blurps,

85
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,660
these are matching virus DNA.

86
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,590
Like you can find viruses
with genes where these little,

87
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,630
you know these little to the bacteria
had virus inside of them. Yup.

88
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,790
I mean that,

89
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,480
that a virus brought it into these cells
will tell you anything but the origin

90
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:16,750
of it. The first recognition
was this is virus DNA.

91
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,410
Somehow all these bacteria have little
snippets of virus DNA wedged in these

92
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,300
particular places in their genome,

93
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,190
which is a little weird
if you think about it.

94
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:29,050
I mean these are totally
different creatures.

95
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,710
They would be like inside a human
finding, a little bit of mosquito DNA.

96
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,010
You're want, how do we interpret this?
Well, actually there was one scientist,

97
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,350
his name is Eugene Koonin who looked
at these results and just said, okay,

98
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:45,490
I get it. It's a defense
system. Why would he think that?

99
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,170
Because he's a brilliant
man. What do you mean?

100
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,940
If I went to a large sanitation dump
and I found a team bit of human hair,

101
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,290
why would I think, oh, I got it. It's a
defense mechanism. I wouldn't know it.

102
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,650
Just like a bitty human,
right. Well, you see I,

103
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,670
that metaphor might sort of betray
your lack of skill and microbiology.

104
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,410
I'm just saying like this
is not a dump. All right.

105
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:14,411
This is bacteria are not gonna just let
virus DNA get into their genes willy

106
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:18,740
nilly. Okay. Remember, viruses
are the big enemy, right?

107
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,310
If your bacteria, viruses
make your life a nightmare,

108
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,460
think about it in the ocean. Okay.
The, the ocean is full of viruses and,

109
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,900
and uh,

110
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,990
viruses kill up to 40% of all
of those bacteria every day.

111
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,430
Really? Every day. Yeah. And we
know that they have defenses.

112
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,980
What Eugene Koonin said was, okay,

113
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:48,670
I'm going to bet that these bacteria
are somehow grabbing pieces of DNA from

114
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:55,001
viruses and then they're storing it and
now they have a way of recognizing those

115
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:57,260
viruses if they come in later,

116
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,600
a little Polaroid shots
of the enemy, right? No,

117
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:07,250
thy enemy. Yeah, like a most wanted
poster. What do you call the Mugshot?

118
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,580
This is Eugene Koonin leader
of the evolutionary genomics
group at the National

119
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:14,690
Center for Biotechnology Information.

120
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:18,500
He's the guy that Carl referenced who
thunk up the whole idea that maybe these

121
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:23,000
bits of virus DNA inside the bacteria
is the bacteria trying to defend itself.

122
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:28,220
But really if I, if I, if I, if I
could eat myself with anything here,

123
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,740
it was not so much getting
this because you know, again,

124
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,640
you see the vague dentical sequence
that gets pretty obvious. It is

125
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,030
figuring out how the
mechanism was likely to work.

126
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,130
So can you walk us through how the
mechanism is likely to work? Oh right.

127
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,460
What happens if you know,
when a virus comes in

128
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,250
to a cell, I just kind of

129
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,570
explodes and just kind of
releases naked genes. Basically,

130
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,280
if you're this bacteria, these
things might take over your cell,

131
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:05,370
so you've got to respond,
move moonstruck the guy,

132
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,170
you have multiple weapons of defense.
If you've never seen this virus before,

133
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,320
it usually the first thing you do says
Eugene is you send out these enzymes to

134
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:15,510
attack the viruses.

135
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:19,530
They're sort of like the ground
troops and they fight really hard,

136
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,910
but much of the tie,

137
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,810
thank you

138
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,070
fail and then no one will
hear about you again.

139
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,300
They're not terribly
sophisticated fighters, so
very often various takes over.

140
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,820
The bacteria dies,

141
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,880
but [inaudible] very
fun nonzero probability

142
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:45,940
[inaudible]

143
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,680
that you actually survive it.

144
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,700
If you do then with the bacteria will
do is send in some new enzymes to

145
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:53,590
basically clean up to go out,

146
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:58,591
find any stray viruses and then caught
the enemy DNA into futile small pieces in

147
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,630
here. He says when you
get to the storage part,

148
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,130
those enzymes will then take those little
bits of virus and shove them into the

149
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,170
bacteria as own DNA,

150
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,910
right in those little spaces between the
repeats right there and nowhere else.

151
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,940
So I use those spaces in my
own DNA as a storage facility,

152
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,200
as a as a, you use it as a memory device

153
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,150
cause here's what happens
next time that virus shows up

154
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,200
sprays with jeans everywhere.

155
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,830
Now you are prepared and this is where
the CRISPR story really gets going

156
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,040
because instead of sending
out the ground troops,

157
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,390
we're probably going to
get their asses beat.

158
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,880
Now you can actually send out the big guns

159
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,920
and in fact what the cell does is it
will manufacture these special molecular

160
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,010
assassins and they'll give those assassins
a copy of that little bit of virus

161
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:02,070
DNA it has in stores. Basically
saying, here, take this mugshot.

162
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,070
If you see anything that
matches this pattern, kill it.

163
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,990
And these attackers, do we know what
they, one of them looks like. Yup.

164
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,310
So we know what the protein looks
like. It, it actually looks,

165
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:18,020
I would describe it, um, a little bit
like a clamshell sort of imagine pack man,

166
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:21,100
but kind of misshapen and rough
in each one of these guys.

167
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,030
What it has is a copy of that virus DNA.

168
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,340
It's got the mugshot that
it's kind of waving around.

169
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,230
What then happens is that whenever
the PAC man bumps into some virus DNA,

170
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,360
it pulls apart the DNA
and zips. It reads it.

171
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,580
If it's not the right one, it goes on.

172
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,053
Nope,

173
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,583
sure.

174
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,983
[inaudible]

175
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,110
and if that RNA has the same sequence,

176
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,700
then click click. It just locks in.

177
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,780
And if that happens then the DNA is
trapped and molecular blades come out

178
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,410
and chop cartoon gets scared
that the mighty blow. Yeah.

179
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,350
Smart scissors too. It's like,
are you like the thing I got?

180
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,010
Are you like say I got your like
thing, I got sniff. Sniff. All right,

181
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,830
now we are going to kill. Oh,
I see. And it has to be exact.

182
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:20,940
It has to be an exact match.

183
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,520
When scientists first discovered this
whole system, they were fascinated.

184
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,383
They were like,

185
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,460
they were working it out.
They were like, oh, okay.

186
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:30,800
Then this happens and this
happens, this happens. Cool.

187
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,873
But then

188
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,070
in walks the dude,

189
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,700
Jennifer Doudna with a crazy idea,
I don't know if it's crazy radical.

190
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,330
This could be an amazing
technology. This is a tool.

191
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,450
This is a tool, right?

192
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,150
This is a tool that we can use to
cut DNA where we want to cut DNA.

193
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,880
The basic thought was, why don't
we turn this defense into offsets?

194
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,541
Cause these things,

195
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,170
they seem to be really good at cutting
and yet they only seem to cut the things

196
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:03,430
that are on their mugshot.

197
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,670
So maybe I could just replace
what's on their mugshot.

198
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:08,710
So instead of them going after viruses,

199
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,260
maybe they could go after a gene that
causes Huntington's disease or hemophilia,

200
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,900
for example. And this is actually
something that's been done.

201
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:20,110
So you've got a mouse with
something like hemophilia. Okay?

202
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,120
This is a disease is
caused by one bad gene.

203
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,980
So what you do is you take
these little surgeons,

204
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:25,570
you give them the mugshot for the bed

205
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,870
gene, then you stick the surgeon
with the new mugshot and a mouse.

206
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,290
Then you set it loose and just
like it's the program too,

207
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,170
it will find that gene and

208
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,220
click, click chop.

209
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:38,781
Yes.

210
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:43,781
Scissors will end up cutting exactly
the gene you wanted to cut to,

211
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:48,370
the bad genes gone. Now the question is
how do you put in the good gene? Right,

212
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:49,050
right, right.

213
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,110
It turns out actually
according to Jennifer Doudna
now that that's actually not

214
00:12:52,111 --> 00:12:54,540
as hard as you would think. Really. Yeah.

215
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:59,541
Apparently what you do is just throw
this new good gene kind of in the

216
00:12:59,971 --> 00:13:03,570
neighborhood of where they all genius
to be just in the general vicinity.

217
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,840
You don't have to get super precise. I
mean, it turns out that, um, you know,

218
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:11,841
there are repair enzymes that are probably
continually surveying and checking

219
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,790
for breaks. And she says, what'll
happen is it inside the cell,

220
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,940
these repair crews come
along, they'll see the break,

221
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,670
they'll see the good Jean just
sitting there next to the break,

222
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:21,504
there'll be like, all right,

223
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,850
I'll just stick it in and split the
pretty guy in this space. Exactly. So,

224
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:31,470
so we take advantage of a natural
repair pathway that cells have.

225
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,680
They trick both the cutters
and the fixers. Yeah.

226
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,090
Now we're not assassinating anymore.
Now we're actually engineering.

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,050
We've gone from killing to refashioning.

228
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,703
[inaudible]

229
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,430
well though, haven't we been
designing jeans doing genetic,

230
00:13:56,431 --> 00:14:01,400
a form of genetic engineering for, I
don't know, like 30 years. Yes, but

231
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,293
not like this.

232
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,973
[inaudible]

233
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,640
genome editing technologies have
been around for a long time,

234
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:13,210
but none of them have been
as powerful as CRISPR is.

235
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,550
That's Beth Shapiro from UC Santa Cruz.

236
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,420
She was actually one of the biologists
that I drunkenly talked to at that thing.

237
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,270
Was it a modern art museum?
I can't even really remember.

238
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,293
I don't remember either.

239
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,700
It must've been quite an evening to
have the setting be so vague. Anyhow,

240
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,000
here's how she put it
to us. Back in the day,

241
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,540
this was just like two years ago you
would have these gene editor or things you

242
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,374
would take one,

243
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,010
put it in a cell and what happened
before was you would give it on some

244
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:43,600
instructions about where to go and
it might go there but it might go to

245
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,330
somewhere. That's kind of
related to where that was.

246
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,630
It's like you just dig it right? Its
Staten Island but it takes a left,

247
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,280
not only would it take a left
Staten Island and not find there,

248
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:55,610
but it would've cost you a fortune and
taken up six months of your time to get

249
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:59,030
that thing and now you
know it's really easy.

250
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,540
You just give it that mugshot and it
goes, I'm going to find that to guy.

251
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,810
Exactly. So it seems to be
pretty precise and it's cheap.

252
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,650
Like the old tools would set you back
about five grand just to use them once

253
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,820
CRISPR but 75 bucks. And
here's the kicker, says Carl,

254
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:17,150
it seems at the moment that you can
take these things out of bacteria,

255
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:19,490
stick them into almost any other creature

256
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,220
and it still works. You can use
the same CRISPR system on anything.

257
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,630
Can you like do it? If corn
is vulnerable certain past,

258
00:15:28,631 --> 00:15:31,390
you can do it in corn and corn,
do it in anything. I have not.

259
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:36,130
I'm waiting for someone to say CRISPR
doesn't work in species x and I have not

260
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:36,964
heard of that.

261
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,400
So basically what you have for the first
time in science is this gene editing

262
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:44,300
technology that is cheap,
precise, and possibly universal.

263
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,030
And Jennifer Doudna says the moment,
the full impact of that landed on her.

264
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,720
I really, I literally had, you know,

265
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,880
the hairs on the back of
my neck were standing up

266
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:03,190
just processing the fact that
this thing exists, you know,

267
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:08,191
and that you could actually program it
to cut DNA and just like this molecular

268
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:12,550
scissors and I can just program
it and it cuts DNA. Roder I want

269
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,860
it is amazing unless you
think about it further,

270
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,140
which we will do in just a moment.

271
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:32,320
I feel a cloud coming in over their
eyes and just over there, TC. I see you.

272
00:16:32,321 --> 00:16:35,180
Let's get a certain horizon mark
over there, but we'll be right back.

This is Radiolab, mom jad up and Ron,
I'm Robert Krulwich. Okay, so, uh,

298
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,630
clearly the possibilities are there
to use CRISPR to treat disease, right?

299
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,610
Right. But what if you could get
a little more fanciful, right?

300
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:20,850
Like what if you could actually go
back in time and resurrect long lost

301
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:23,730
creatures. I mean, this is something
that Best Shapiro has talked about a lot.

302
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,710
We could reconstruct using a computer
what the genome sequence of the ancestor

303
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:32,430
of all birds was and that would
have been a kind of dinosaur.

304
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,640
And then we could use crispers to
turn a chicken into that thing.

305
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,630
Or what if you could take an
elephant and snip, snip, snip,

306
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,680
gradually turn it into
its long lost relative,

307
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,640
the woolly mammoth. No, cause they're
related. But if they're there,

308
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:51,930
they're similar over. Well, right. But
if you know the woolly mammoth genome,

309
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,540
which they do cause they apparently
got it off some bone or some hair,

310
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,760
then you could compare the number of
differences you use CRISPR to crisper out

311
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,700
the different parts of the elephant
and put in wooly mammoth and stuff.

312
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,750
If you can in effect, go backwards
in time and make changes.

313
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,480
And obviously I think you can go
the other way too, right? I mean,

314
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,010
humans are good at design.
We're designing animals.

315
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:18,990
So if it doesn't seem to me to be a crazy
notion to imagine parents all over the

316
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,870
world wanting, I don't
know, taller children.

317
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:25,320
So silencing the short jeans
and favoring the taller jeans,

318
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,770
getting rid of weak muscles and going for
stronger ones and on and on and on and

319
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,750
on. I don't know where
the designing stops.

320
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,580
We sort of got into all of this with
uh, Carl Zimmer, science writer.

321
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,510
If, if you can be very,

322
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:44,740
very gene specific and you learn
more and more about genes over time,

323
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,810
why couldn't you invent a creature?
Why couldn't you make a pig with wings?

324
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:52,900
You might one day get
sophisticated enough to do that.

325
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,760
There's no wing at pig lab. You know,

326
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,340
the best you're going to hope for
right now is a woolly mammoth lab.

327
00:19:58,341 --> 00:20:02,970
And that's down the hall from where
the, where the real action is,

328
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,690
is now there's a hall and
at the end of the hall,

329
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,950
a wing piglet has not been built
yet. It may be 20 years from now.

330
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:13,310
But that's what you're
looking at. Well, I think,

331
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:17,360
but the thing is that why shouldn't anyone
realize that that's really what we're

332
00:20:17,361 --> 00:20:19,520
talking about? Well, because
you can't make weight.

333
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,440
We need the pigs just because of sort
of evolutionary barriers. Okay. Well,

334
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:29,320
there's no reason to fly a gentleman for
the job down. Come on down. I'm just,

335
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,820
I mean, okay. I,

336
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,830
I don't think that we need a federal
department of homeland piquing security.

337
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,800
I think we're okay there. All
right. Well we do need is like,

338
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:43,340
uh,

339
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,030
we do need to like figure out what are
we going to do about CRISPR and humans.

340
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,530
I mean, they're going to be
using CRISPR for cancer. Okay.

341
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,500
They're going to take people's immune
cells out of their body and they're going

342
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:58,300
to use CRISPR to basically
allow them to make proteins,

343
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:03,010
are going to be able to grab onto cancer
cells and attack their own cancer.

344
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,190
Yeah. That's to be for that. I mean, you
have to be, well, I don't know. I mean,

345
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:10,630
are you for that is your, your,
your, you talk, you are tink,

346
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,670
you are tinkering with someone's own body.

347
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,080
You are altering their
own cells. You know,

348
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,730
dude, where do I, it's just,
I tell you, look, was it,

349
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,390
this is me.

350
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,470
I don't know if it's a religious thought
or just the thought of a conservative

351
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:31,880
person, but I mean, I've, I grew
up in the, in the test to baby era.

352
00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:36,110
I now know many wonderful adult
formerly test two babies. And I,

353
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,400
I remember being astonished
that no, so I can't,

354
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,540
I don't know where the sacred begins and
ends anymore on that particular turf.

355
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,100
I guess what I'm instead
on is I'm on, on, um,

356
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:53,330
a Hobbsy in view of human beings that
there is something about human beings

357
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,030
including scientists, human
beings, all human beings,

358
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,340
that there's a darkness and
a light there, there, there,

359
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,020
there's an angelic side to being human.
And here's a very, very difficult set.

360
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,450
And as the human beings get more and
more power to create and design and

361
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:10,910
essentially create a future,

362
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,090
that future will include the imaginations,

363
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:17,690
both light and dark of humans and
that will be new in the world.

364
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,850
Yeah.

365
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,800
I don't think it is new because if you
go back to the start of the scientific

366
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:21,590
revolution,

367
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,590
some like Francis Bacon
would say explicitly like
science is going to be both

368
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:33,010
about learning about how the world works
and using that knowledge to control it.

369
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,710
You know, this has been discovered.
This has been published.

370
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,030
Everybody knows it exists. Um, if
you're going to say like, okay,

371
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:42,040
now we're going to all,
we're going to outlaw this.

372
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,730
I'm not saying festing that
well. What are you suggesting?

373
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,740
I think we should cringe level as
opposed to just have a big part. Right.

374
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,920
That's all great. You
Ready? One, two, three.

375
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,170
[inaudible] what do we have? Cringed,
deny way. What do we do now? Well,

376
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,090
I don't know if that's
what you're arguing. No.

377
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:05,370
[inaudible] cringe too. You
cringed meanly and deep and you

378
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,590
Chris Chew Cummins with attitude
I don't pitching with with,

379
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,300
I would like because you're
afraid of like dragons.

380
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,490
You're saying?

381
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,420
You're saying, oh my God, yes,
I'm afraid of dragons. Okay,

382
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,480
so that conversation with Carl was four
months ago and a lot has happened in the

383
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,890
in in that time because to
the question that you asked,

384
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:29,720
like where does the sacred
begin and end? Well,

385
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,770
one of the lines that had been drawn by
Jennifer Doudna and others was that we

386
00:23:33,771 --> 00:23:38,300
should not use this technology on
humans who haven't been born yet.

387
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,240
Meaning not on sperm cells or egg cells.

388
00:23:41,241 --> 00:23:45,200
Because if you CRISPR say an embryo
that is a, that is a permanent,

389
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:46,971
right.

390
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:50,210
That is a change to the DNA that will
be passed on to their children and their

391
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:52,880
children's children and their
children's children's children.

392
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:57,910
And you can't ask the person if that's
okay because you're doing it before

393
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:02,060
they're born. Consent
becomes a real issue.

394
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,440
And if you imagine making these changes
and they cascade through generation

395
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:10,760
after generation, you could affect
the evolution of organisms. And it's,

396
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,030
I don't want to say trivial, but it's,
you know, it's fairly easy to do it. Wow.

397
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,360
It's kind of profound. I feel
it's really profound. Profound.

398
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,350
But it was just an idea that is until

399
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,320
for the first time in history,

400
00:24:23,321 --> 00:24:27,430
researchers in China have successfully
edited the human genome and an embryo.

401
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,130
Just two months ago, it was announced
that a Chinese team from Estonia,

402
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,160
Watson University use a technique called
CRISPR to edit DNA than human embryos.

403
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,420
It's a way of hacking evolution itself.
Well, this is hugely controversial.

404
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,940
Now these embryos, the
Chinese team had edited,

405
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,370
they were created through
IVF and they were not viable.

406
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,360
But these are embryos that are, are not
going to actually develop into a person.

407
00:24:49,361 --> 00:24:52,150
So they're, they're going to be
discarded anyway. It's still thinking,

408
00:24:52,151 --> 00:24:55,330
figuring it out with those embryos. What's
to stop any of us from going further.

409
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:00,010
I ologist and bioethicists are sounding
an alarm scientists face accusations

410
00:25:00,011 --> 00:25:03,490
that they crossed an ethical line that's
just sort of thing could be sort of a

411
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:05,980
slippery slope towards
toward designer babies.

412
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,230
Essentially genetically
engineering the human race

413
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,470
when I use the term chips to
kind of test your levels. Okay.

414
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,210
Now that the cringe party had spread
and Robert didn't seem like such a loon.

415
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,100
Yeah, we called up Carl again.
Well, we have to revisit,

416
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:24,450
we have to revisit it because in our
Iron Mageddon conversation in which I

417
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:28,440
believe I was extremely alarmist
and you were extremely down pudding,

418
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,790
I feel that I should do a
small little parade called the

419
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:40,320
[inaudible]. The Alamo is take remember,
remember China and you have to close.

420
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,970
You should just begin anytime you want.

421
00:25:41,971 --> 00:25:43,840
Like getting on your knees
and saying how sorry you are.

422
00:25:43,841 --> 00:25:47,130
I don't if you start from
there. Um, I'm sorry.

423
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:49,260
So are we actually surrounded by,

424
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,750
uh, an army of, uh,

425
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:56,640
clones with superpowers? Not yet. Not
yet, but I think the dyke has been open.

426
00:25:56,641 --> 00:25:59,280
I believe, I'm going to
quote somebody who said, uh,

427
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,060
maybe a few weeks ago, I
think maybe it was last week,

428
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,400
even writing for National
Geographic. I think it was,

429
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:08,760
maybe it was somebody named
Carl who said that, uh,

430
00:26:08,761 --> 00:26:13,680
the news from China and that news was
probably the beginning of an entire new

431
00:26:13,681 --> 00:26:17,550
era. I think I actually said it was a
historical moment. That's right. Yes.

432
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,940
Yes. And I, and I still stand by that.

433
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,910
Do you feel differently now than
the first time we talked? Yeah,

434
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:27,500
that's really the question. I don't
feel different actually because,

435
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,030
um, there isn't really no
scientific surprise here. He says,

436
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:34,400
people have been doing all these CRISPR
experiments on all these different

437
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:37,580
mammals. We're mammals. This is
bound to happen. And in fact,

438
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:40,700
it may be happening more than we think.
Uh, in one account in the journal,

439
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:44,310
nature has said that for other Chinese
labs are doing this kind of work as we

440
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:48,570
speak. But Carl also told us,
which he said was unsurprising too,

441
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:51,320
but I actually find it kind of
surprising that the CRISPR worked.

442
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,240
This Chinese team did,
didn't work very well.

443
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,520
It worked kind of,

444
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,010
I mean,

445
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:03,010
in only a few of the cases did they
really get exactly what they wanted.

446
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,870
Um, they tried using CRISPR and about
86 embryos and they only get off to work

447
00:27:07,871 --> 00:27:08,440
right.

448
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,460
And maybe 28 getting in and a lot of
them crispers made the wrong cuts and

449
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:16,180
screwed up the cells and that led them
to conclude that this is a technology

450
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:17,770
that's not ready right now for

451
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,550
application in the human
germline. And I agree, oh,

452
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,350
we're sort of,

453
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,470
we still are in this kind of a
fortunate position where we can say, oh,

454
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:32,471
well it's dangerous so we shouldn't
use it on in human embryos.

455
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,220
I just don't think that we're
going to be able to sort of, uh,

456
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,750
find refuge there in like 10 or 20
years. In 10 or 20 years. You know,

457
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:44,360
CRISPR will be so sophisticated
that people will be able to say,

458
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,250
I can get you the change you
want and I can do it safely.

459
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,290
I can guarantee you that you will have
human embryos that have the alteration in

460
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:57,410
the particular gene
you want. So then what,

461
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,141
in fact,

462
00:27:58,141 --> 00:28:01,350
Jennifer Doudna told us
that this experiment or
similar experiments have been

463
00:28:01,351 --> 00:28:05,250
repeated in mice with more
advanced CRISPR systems.

464
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,060
Cause apparently there are many
different kinds and they're,

465
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,500
it was done with almost no error.

466
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,560
Sometimes I feel like we're sort of
displacing all our ethical concerns onto

467
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,000
something that hasn't happened yet.

468
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:21,110
If we really are concerned about what
we're doing to the human gene pool,

469
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,270
you know, it's already here. Take

470
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,530
as an example, in vitro fertilization,

471
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,920
about 60,000 kids are born a year through
IVF and it's probable that some of

472
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:34,460
those parents chose whether they
wanted a boy or a girl. And, and

473
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,200
when people started doing IVF,
there was a huge controversy.

474
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:40,080
People said this was
dangerous. This is unnatural.

475
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,730
I don't see people who are unable to
sleep at night because of the existence of

476
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:48,660
IVF. Yeah, yeah. Now I'm going to sound
like I'm on Robert side of this. I mean,

477
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,590
okay. So, so I won't hurt. They won't.
It won't. It will. Okay. All right. Yeah.

478
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,070
Here we go. So, okay, so breath.

479
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,430
So you guys know about, uh,

480
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,300
all the stuff going on in Iceland where
they're looking at people's DNA and you

481
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:05,790
know, they're looking for
disease genes and so on.

482
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,540
And when they were looking
at these Icelandic people,

483
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:14,460
they found that some
people had a gene that, uh,

484
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,440
protects them against Alzheimer's. It
reduces their odds of getting Alzheimer's.

485
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:24,300
Let's imagine your doctor said now if
you'd like for an extra thousand dollars,

486
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:29,570
we will take these IVF embryos and we
will use CRISPR to give them the Alzheimer

487
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:35,460
protecting variant. Would you like that?

488
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,640
Do you want to add that to your,
to your procedure? Sure. Yeah.

489
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,100
Or would you like your
child to, to face a,

490
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:46,900
a future of, of Alzheimer's,
your choice. See,

491
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:48,970
here's my, here's my thing.
Here's my thing with this whole,

492
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:52,240
with this whole thing, I'm, I'm a little
bit haunted by the thing you said,

493
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:56,050
which is that when it's not
dangerous anymore, what will we do?

494
00:29:56,051 --> 00:29:59,080
And I'm afraid we've already answered
that question, that it's not,

495
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:03,550
it's not a question that's open anymore
because if we're already doing this kind

496
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:07,390
of stuff and who's going to say no to
that? Who's going to say no to that?

497
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,460
That's what he just was
demonstrating. Yeah. Yeah.

498
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,180
We've already answered the question. Yeah.

499
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,823
We may have

500
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,080
