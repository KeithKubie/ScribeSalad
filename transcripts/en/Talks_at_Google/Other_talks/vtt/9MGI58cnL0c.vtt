PRESENTER: Good afternoon.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.055
I have the pleasure
and privilege and honor

00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:10.070
of welcoming to the Google
campus Dada Nabhaniilananda,

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.820
also known as the monk dude.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.230
Dada is a meditation
teacher, a yoga monk, author,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.320
singer songwriter,
and speaker who

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.790
is originally from
New Zealand and was

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.870
has ordained as a
monk in India in 1979.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.090
And if you have
the image of a monk

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.320
as being somebody
being very reclusive

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.200
and retreating off to
a monastic environment,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.430
then perish the thought.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.535
Because since then, he
has traveled, spoken,

00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:44.540
and performed in 40
different countries,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.850
including once in Brazil
in front of the Dalai Lama

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.981
and 10,000 people
in the audience.

00:00:51.981 --> 00:00:54.820
In fact, I myself had
the distinct pleasure

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.660
of running into Dada once
at Yoshi's Jazz Club, where

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.177
we both had gone to
listen to [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:05.177 --> 00:01:06.010
And I was intrigued.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.140
Who is this person in
orange with the turban?

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.010
I need to talk to
him and find out.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.468
And it turned out he was one
of the most interesting people

00:01:12.468 --> 00:01:14.180
I've ever met.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.870
Dada has produced
eight musical album.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.220
He's the author of the
book meditation book

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.091
"Close Your Eyes,
Open Your Mind,"

00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:30.529
which has been translated
into 10 different languages.

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:31.570
DADA NABHANIILANADA: Yep.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.260
Just 10, just last
week, Vietnamese.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.950
PRESENTER: Vietnamese
being the latest.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.160
He also teaches a
course on meditation

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.770
and how it unlocks creativity
at the University of Berkeley

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.920
and speaks on this topic
to several corporations

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.740
all over the world.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.010
I'm delighted, once again, to
welcome to the Google campus

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.090
singer songwriter, performer,
author, and yoga monk

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.220
and meditation teacher,
Dada Nabhaniilananda,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.822
also known as the monk dude.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:03.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:07.460
DADA NABHANIILANADA: Thanks
so much, [INAUDIBLE],

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.512
and thanks very much for
inviting me back to Google.

00:02:10.512 --> 00:02:11.720
Because I was here last year.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.300
Who was at my talk
here last year?

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.200
A couple of you were.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.910
OK, good.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.140
Because I've got to tell
you, I discovered since then

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.180
that everything I told
you then was wrong.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.870
No, I'm just kidding.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.130
But at least must
of you weren't here,

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.780
so I can reuse some of my
Google jokes from them.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.170
So I'm going to be speaking
to you about meditation

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.960
and the idea of the
enlightened leader,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.110
and how meditation can help you
to develop love, creativity,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.885
and wisdom.

00:02:45.885 --> 00:02:47.510
At the beginning
of last year, I was

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.600
speaking at a
corporate conference,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.030
and at the end of
the presentation,

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.150
we had a short meditation
and chanting session.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.360
And just after, one of the
directors of the company

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.700
came up to me and thanked
me and said, I want to say,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.590
that was the first time--
just that short meditation

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.390
was the first time I
felt peace in months.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.655
And it really struck me.

00:03:12.655 --> 00:03:17.000
Because I thought, wow,
this is really serious

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.230
that there's so many people
in the corporate community who

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.530
are silently suffering.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.420
And what I've got to offer is
more valuable than I realized,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.060
because I've taken
it for granted.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.100
I've just taught them
something, a short meditation.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.750
I've done 1,000 times.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.810
It's no big deal for me.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.070
But for her, it was
really important,

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.310
and perhaps for many others.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.840
If you develop a regular
meditation practice,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.020
it can remove most
of your suffering

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.870
if you experience anything like
that from stress and anxiety

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.201
and the related
kind of problems.

00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:00.700
How many of you
feel that you suffer

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.930
from some kind of stress?

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.330
It's pretty much universal.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.280
Believe it or not, I do,
too, but not very much

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.820
compared to what I might do
if I didn't use this practice

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.100
to help me.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:23.424
But you all probably
knew that already.

00:04:23.424 --> 00:04:25.840
Everybody knows that meditation
relieves stress-- probably

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.673
everyone at Google, at
least, because you've

00:04:27.673 --> 00:04:30.520
got a whole big
meditation program here.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.200
It's called Search
Inside Yourself.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.780
I believe it's free on campus.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.550
It started in Google, and it's
gone out to other companies.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.510
You also have somebody
whose job, full time,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.450
is to make sure that people
that go to the program actually

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.122
practice.

00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:51.830
Because they discover
that lots of people

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.760
went through the training that
then didn't keep the habit.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.660
So that's his job, and Google
is paying him to do that.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.680
So it's seen as a
priority by somebody

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.260
somewhere in this company.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.050
But most of you
probably already knew

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.650
that meditation relieves stress.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.300
But what I'm really
interested in

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.380
is how meditation does
way more than that.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.200
There are a whole
lot of other benefits

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.377
from meditation that I
actually find more exciting.

00:05:18.377 --> 00:05:20.210
I'm going to talk about
three of them today.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.920
And that is how it can develop
love, creativity, and wisdom,

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:31.460
and how it can help you to
improve your relationships.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.300
That's what love does.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.940
How wisdom, as you
develop it, can help

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.670
you make much clearer
decisions, how creativity

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.950
can make you more innovative.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.610
And we're going to use the
ancient science of yoga.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.400
We're going to draw on
that to get to that result.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.920
And yoga is a very
misunderstood word these days.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.940
Most people think
of it immediately

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.187
as some kind of exercise
station that young ladies

00:06:00.187 --> 00:06:02.020
go to because they want
to be young forever.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.490
That's just one of
the bits of yoga.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.480
There's a system
called asthanga yoga.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.350
Yoga has eight limbs,
like my friend here.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.350
That's in the Sanskrit.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.780
So astungas means postures.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.830
That's the yoga postures.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.890
The first limb of
yoga is called Yama,

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.340
and it roughly translates
as don't be evil.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.290
That rings a bell.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.690
Is that familiar
to anybody here?

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:36.420
Your company was founded on
the first principle of yoga.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.640
So what is yoga, really?

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.374
If it's not just
these exercises,

00:06:39.374 --> 00:06:40.540
it's all these other things.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.640
It's a whole lifestyle.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.610
It's a philosophy.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:49.010
It's a value system, and a set
of not just physical exercises,

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.910
but mental exercises--
concentration

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.760
exercises, breathing, and
different meditation techniques

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.040
all designed to develop
your body, mind,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.750
and spirit in harmony.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.830
So when I talk about yoga, I
mean the whole big yoga, not

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.100
just the physical exercises.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.740
The other thing I want to clear
up which might be misunderstood

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:16.294
sometimes is that I'm not
actually a religious fanatic.

00:07:16.294 --> 00:07:17.710
You could be
forgiven for thinking

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.900
that, because I'm dressed like
maybe I'm a religious fanatic.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.059
But this is something
I like to address

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:28.600
at the beginning of
my presentations.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.830
Because sometimes
somebody will come up

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.070
to me at the end of a constant
or a talk or something

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.990
and they'll ask me shyly, why
are you dressed like that?

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.490
And I realize that
they haven't been

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.406
able to think of anything
else the whole time.

00:07:40.406 --> 00:07:42.580
They didn't listen
to a word I said.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.775
So better that I answer
this at the beginning.

00:07:44.775 --> 00:07:45.650
And it's very simple.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.760
I'm from New Zealand, and
everybody in New Zealand

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.509
dresses like this.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.770
OK, that's not completely true.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.030
There are three
other monks like me

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.590
from New Zealand, so at least
four of us out of four million.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.340
This is the traditional
color-- orange or saffron

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.960
is the traditional color
worn by monks and nuns

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.580
from oriental traditions,
like Buddhism and Jainism

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.970
Hinduism and yoga.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.540
And it symbolizes
self-sacrifice.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.210
And the turban comes
in handy in case

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.030
a real religious
fanatic throws something

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.900
at me to protect my head.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.615
So that's a little bit about
why I'm dressed like this.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.039
Leadership.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:38.100
Why am I even
interested in the idea

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.100
of more enlightened leaders?

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.320
It's really simple.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.400
Leaders have power.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.560
The have influence.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.390
They act as role models.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:55.550
And humanity is in a situation
where we're facing the greatest

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.100
number of incredibly
complex problems

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.022
that we've ever
faced in history.

00:09:00.022 --> 00:09:02.480
And I think right now, we could
do with some really, really

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.650
good leadership.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:08.600
So I want to do whatever
I can to enhance that.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.660
But being an enlightened leader
is more than just a fancy title

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.910
like head beagle.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.150
Snoopy was once elected
the head beagle,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.050
and he found it a lot
of responsibility.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.580
And he said, I have to
make a lot of decisions.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.297
Today, I made 147 decisions.

00:09:28.297 --> 00:09:29.255
All of them were wrong.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.750
So if Snoopy is not our
ideal leader, who is?

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.540
Do you have some
people that you look up

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.140
to that you think embody
the kind of qualities

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.619
that you look for in leadership?

00:09:42.619 --> 00:09:43.660
Let's have some examples.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.410
It might be somebody
in your personal life.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:46.410
It might be your mother.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.280
My mom was the head of
our family, no question.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.700
Or it might be somebody
prominent-- a famous comedian.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.620
I don't know.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.570
So tell us some
figures in your life,

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.020
somebody in your life who's
inspired you that you feel

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.870
has played that role for you.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.440
AUDIENCE: Both my parents.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.230
DADA NABHANIILANADA:
Your parents.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.375
Great.

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:10.710
And what qualities, what
particular quality do you

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.976
think they embodied?

00:10:12.976 --> 00:10:16.612
AUDIENCE: To be firm
about your desires

00:10:16.612 --> 00:10:20.380
without being a jerk about it.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.023
[INAUDIBLE] compromising
with people around you.

00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:24.272
DADA NABHANIILANADA: OK, cool.

00:10:24.272 --> 00:10:26.792
Let's have some other ones.

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.620
AUDIENCE: A number
of teachers I've had.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.006
DADA NABHANIILANADA: Teachers
in school or college here.

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:31.860
Cool.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.700
And the qualities?

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.360
I'm looking for the qualities.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.650
Try to give us one word,
one-word definitions.

00:10:40.345 --> 00:10:41.334
AUDIENCE: Authenticity.

00:10:41.334 --> 00:10:42.750
DADA NABHANIILANADA:
Authenticity.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.370
Fantastic.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.970
I was always a big
fan of Nelson Mandela.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:52.390
And I would say if I had
to choose one word that he

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.295
embodied forgiveness.

00:10:55.902 --> 00:10:58.110
And that's a huge inspiration
to me and to the world.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.608
Some others?

00:11:02.608 --> 00:11:03.960
AUDIENCE: Gandhi.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.460
DADA NABHANIILANADA:
Mahatma Gandhi.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.460
And what does he embody?

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:13.455
AUDIENCE: One word is hard.

00:11:13.455 --> 00:11:14.420
Unconditional love.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.590
DADA NABHANIILANADA:
Unconditional love.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.690
AUDIENCE: A guy I worked
with four years ago here,

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.210
Eric Schmidt.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:27.110
Not a single word, but a
phrase-- smart and balanced.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.110
DADA NABHANIILANADA: OK.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:28.830
Not coffee.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:29.371
AUDIENCE: No.

00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:30.370
DADA NABHANIILANADA: OK.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.270
Cool.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.923
So those kind of
qualities-- and there

00:11:35.923 --> 00:11:38.560
are a whole lot
more-- that's what

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.710
I've been trying to develop
consciously since I was 19.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.240
And that was way back somewhere
in the Pleistocene Era

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.360
as far as I can remember.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.750
So how did I get into this?

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.020
How did I start off
doing meditation?

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.110
If you had told me
when I was about 12--

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.150
which was just after I became
an atheist-- that I'd end up

00:11:55.150 --> 00:12:00.894
being a monk, I would have said
you'd lost your last marble.

00:12:00.894 --> 00:12:02.560
Because I had a very
different ambition.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.480
I wanted to be a wizard.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.010
I wanted to be wise
and strong and kind,

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:13.710
like Gandalf, who defeated the
evil dark lord of the ring.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.216
You may detect a
flaw in this plan.

00:12:17.216 --> 00:12:19.810
It took a little while
for me to figure it out.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.660
I finally realized that
wizards don't exist.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.770
So I had to adopt a more
realistic life goal.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:27.700
I like playing music.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.860
So I thought, why don't
I become a rock star?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.480
But when I was 19,
I hadn't experience

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.010
that changed everything.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.470
It was a kind epiphany, you
could say-- a very powerful

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.890
spiritual experience.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.080
Imagine all the love in
the universe condensed

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.740
into a single moment floating
before you like the sun,

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.740
so real that the rest of
your life seems like a dream.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.530
And in that moment, I realized
that the purpose of existence

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.550
is to become one with the
source of love within us.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:11.250
And I felt inspired to walk
the spiritual path as a Yogi

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.720
and master my mind
through meditation,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.310
and hopefully to
become a teacher

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:20.060
and help other people find
the path to happiness.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:24.040
I'd finally found a life purpose
that actually made sense.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.140
So I left my university,
and I left my country,

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.110
and I went to India.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.620
And there, I studied
the intuitive science

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.970
of tantra yoga and the
ancient wisdom of the mystics.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.270
And I studied under
a great master.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.010
That was a long time ago.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.030
But you don't have to
become a monk like me

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.810
in order to get the
benefits of meditation.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.840
I have a friend--
his name is Mike.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.570
I met him a few years ago.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.170
And Mike is a manager
of big projects.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.512
He was running a
$100 million project,

00:13:58.512 --> 00:13:59.970
and he was under
a lot of pressure.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.810
He would get up at the crack
of dawn and jump into his car

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.050
and drive it through the
traffic like a weapon,

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.716
and yelling on the
phone at contractors.

00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:12.350
He's get to work and
continue his day like that.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.280
The stress was really
telling on him.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.540
He came to a workshop of mine
where he learned meditation

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.920
and a chanting technique.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.809
Before he left, somebody
suggested to him,

00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:23.600
why don't you get one
of these chanting CDs

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.335
so you can play it in your car?

00:14:25.335 --> 00:14:27.670
I think there must have
been a passenger in his car

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.090
at some point.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.550
They wanted him to slow down.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:32.440
He said, no.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.680
My CD player in
my car is broken.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.626
There's been a Beatles CD stuck
in there for three months,

00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:39.000
and I haven't
bothered to fix it.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.410
But at the last minute,
he thought, oh, I'll

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.555
get the CD anyway.

00:14:41.555 --> 00:14:43.630
He comes down to his
car, opens the door,

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.710
and the Beatles
CD has popped out.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:47.854
So he took that as a sign.

00:14:47.854 --> 00:14:50.020
So he started listening to
this chanting in his car.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.600
And instead of
yelling on the phone

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.410
and feeling like
he's at war, he was

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.650
relaxed when he got to work.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.820
And he was nicer to people, he
got along with people better,

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.260
and he laughed more often.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.160
And then he started
meditating in his office

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.870
before he would go home.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:11.360
And his workmates would comment
that his office felt peaceful.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:17.550
And then he had created this
sentry in his office space.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:22.060
And as he changed, his
surroundings changed as well.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:32.610
So what did love, creativity,
and wisdom do for Mike?

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.200
Through being more
creative, he was

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.770
able to innovate in the
ways that he did things.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.330
Through developing
more clarity in wisdom,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.090
he was able to make
much better decisions,

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.600
because he wasn't so emotional.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.900
And when he developed more
feeling of love and connection,

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.950
all his relationships improved.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.680
And this didn't do too
badly for his career.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.830
Right now, he's helping
to build the $4.5 billion

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.260
Apple Spaceship in Cupertino.

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:07.730
Creativity.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.640
Creativity is a kind of power.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.949
With creativity, we've learned
to manipulate our environment,

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:16.240
and we've taken over the world.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:21.070
We've built all kind of
cultures and civilizations.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:26.710
Every city and ship and
corporation like Google

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.780
and piece of music and
book-- and not to neglect

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:35.690
the 357 different
types of toothpaste--

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.030
started with an idea.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.420
Ideas are powerful.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.360
Creativity has enabled us
to take over the world.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.680
And that's why when IBM
conducted a very extensive

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.570
study in 2013 trying to
find out what qualities are

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.540
organizations looking
for in future leaders,

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.180
they found that the number one
quality they were looking for

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:02.810
was creativity.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.859
So how do we tap
into our creativity?

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.359
Where does creativity come from?

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.480
Would you like to know
if you are creative?

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.420
Who thinks they are creative?

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.960
Some of you.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.510
I have actually
developed a test.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.859
This is the only 100%
effective psychological test

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.710
in the world.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.240
It's called the Monk
Dude's Famous Creativity

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.290
Test, modestly named by myself.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:36.050
And it requires you to stand
up and answer one question.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.370
You don't even need to speak.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.720
You get to answer
it with your bodies.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.830
I have one question
for you, and that

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:48.500
is who amongst you was not
at some point in your life

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.000
a child?

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.961
If you were never a
child, remain standing.

00:17:55.961 --> 00:17:57.210
If you were, you can sit down.

00:18:00.967 --> 00:18:02.425
I just did this
exercise in Mexico,

00:18:02.425 --> 00:18:04.320
and somebody remained standing.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.340
I thought, every room has one.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.039
I always tell him to remain
standing in the back corner.

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:13.955
You're all too polite.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.490
All children are creative.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:22.680
They love to play.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.710
Creativity comes out
of that kind of mode.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.470
So our inner child
is still there.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.950
But as we grow older, we
develop this other side,

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.820
the critical adult.
And the critical adult

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.500
tends to suppress
the creative child.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.110
That's why Disney-- they're
not allowed in the same room.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.180
They literally have separate
rooms for creative thinking.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.420
Disney movie studios,
they have separate rooms

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.232
for creative thinking
and critical thinking.

00:18:51.232 --> 00:18:53.145
And this was Walt
Disney's own policy,

00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:55.770
because he understood that these
two cannot operate at the same

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:56.269
time.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:05.220
So how do we connect to
that inner creative child

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:05.990
we all have?

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.990
I just proved it to you.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.052
I learned the answer to this
when I started meditating.

00:19:12.052 --> 00:19:13.010
And I didn't expect it.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.420
I started meditating because
I wanted to become enlightened

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.209
or something grand like that.

00:19:19.209 --> 00:19:20.750
But one of the first
things I noticed

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:25.450
was that suddenly, I started
getting all these ideas

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.340
for my music and my poetry.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.530
That's what I was into.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.670
And it was like I had
turned on this tap of ideas

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.476
somewhere inside.

00:19:34.476 --> 00:19:36.600
And I remember sitting--
and I was learning a piece

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.310
by Beethoven.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.530
It was his first piano
sonnata-- the last seven

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.475
chords of the first movement,
for those who are interested.

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:45.640
And it seemed so beautiful.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.560
And I was transported.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.460
And I felt for a
moment, really, I

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.470
felt that I was
Beethoven at the moment

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:53.667
that he wrote this music.

00:19:53.667 --> 00:19:55.250
And I was feeling
what he was feeling.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.124
It was extraordinary.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.222
And I thought, this
meditation is doing something

00:20:01.222 --> 00:20:02.180
really different to me.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:02.500
I don't know.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.520
I didn't expect this.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.160
What I learned very
soon afterwards

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.204
was that the Yogis who
developed these practices,

00:20:11.204 --> 00:20:11.870
they understood.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.800
They had figured
this out ages ago.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.600
They had a whole
map of the mind,

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.120
and which bit is creative,
and how you tap into it,

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.760
what technique you
use to get to this.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.250
And they'd developed a
system for developing,

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:28.570
amongst other things, love,
creativity, and wisdom.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.500
And it's all related to
the different Chakras,

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.291
but I'm not going to
talk about that today.

00:20:32.291 --> 00:20:34.920
That's grade three.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.170
So the middle one, creativity.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:39.689
So the yogis divide the
mind into five layers.

00:20:39.689 --> 00:20:41.980
The first two, you're probably
familiar with-- the idea

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.210
of conscious mind and
subconscious mind.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.020
It's not exactly
parallel to this system,

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.030
but it's very similar.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.110
And then they divide
this third layer,

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.070
which is lumped together
in Western psychology

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.200
into the unconscious.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.600
They divide that into
three layers of intuition.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.840
And the first of
those is creativity,

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.341
and we can tap into that
with a particular meditation

00:21:01.341 --> 00:21:01.840
technique.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.530
And that's what I discovered.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.500
It's hard to find very good
research of creativity.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.960
It's really easy
to find research

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.690
on stress related to meditation,
but creativity is much harder

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.490
to measure.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:15.100
But [INAUDIBLE]
University in Germany,

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.200
a group of cognitive
psychologists

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.045
came up with this
result. They said

00:21:19.045 --> 00:21:21.070
that certain
meditation techniques

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.150
can promote creative thinking.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.610
The advantages of particular
types of meditation

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.599
extend much further
than simply relaxation,

00:21:28.599 --> 00:21:30.640
which is what I've been
telling people for years.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.806
I was so happy to find this.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.240
That's what I thought
when I saw this study.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.395
So creativity is power.

00:21:41.395 --> 00:21:44.630
It gives us power.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.930
But not all the things
that we have created

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:51.630
are as beautiful as
a Beethoven sonata.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.920
We've also created
terrible weapons,

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.370
oppressive forms of government,
exploitative systems

00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:03.370
of economics, toxic
chemicals, the Spice Girls.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:08.307
Terrible outcomes have come
from the creative mind, which

00:22:08.307 --> 00:22:10.390
is why it's so important
for an enlightened leader

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.360
also to cultivate wisdom.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:20.860
A few years ago,
I met a young man.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.060
He impressed me very much.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.790
It was at a meditation
retreat, and he was meditating.

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:29.830
And his mother showed me an
essay he wrote for his school.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.670
It was called "30
Things I Believe."

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:36.040
I'll read you part of it.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.760
I believe life is good.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.620
I believe God is in everything.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.630
I believe we are all equal.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:48.340
I believe that when I
meditate, I feel peaceful.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.310
I believe we should be generous.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.410
I believe kids should
respect their parents.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.700
Any parents here?

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.430
You agree with him?

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:01.310
I believe people
should go outside more.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:05.050
I believe we should help the
Arctic and rainforest animals.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.040
I believe God is
in good and in bad.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:08.990
I believe in magic.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:13.200
I believe people
should not give up.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.710
I believe love is everywhere.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:22.130
I believe we live
best in community.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.980
I believe we can protect
people in danger.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.620
I believe we should
help the poor.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:33.270
I believe it's OK to
die, but not to kill.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:36.160
I believe war should stop.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.470
I believe we can make peace.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:44.190
When Tarak MacLean wrote
this, he was six years old.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.170
I should tell you,
he's a teenager now.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:51.910
He has blue hair.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:53.285
He's not as cute
as this anymore.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.120
But this blew my mind,
and a lot of other people.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.950
He went on NPR and so forth.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:07.740
You don't need a
Ph.D. to have wisdom.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:13.962
Many of us confuse knowledge,
information with wisdom.

00:24:13.962 --> 00:24:15.420
But they are very
different things.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:20.960
In fact-- well, any of you
read "Lord of The Rings?"

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.860
You remember Saruman?

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.560
He made some very,
very bad decisions.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.090
Very smart guy.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.610
And Gandalf called
him a wise fool.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.600
I thought that was pretty cool.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.840
There's piece of
research being done

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.420
at Toronto University
where they were

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:41.850
trying to correlate intelligence
with rational, balanced

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:43.540
decisions.

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.650
And the result that they found
was that there's no connection.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:53.330
The harsh truth is that
greater intelligence does not

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.260
equate to wiser decisions.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.130
So I know you're all-- a
lot of people in Google

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.865
have done a lot of work
on their education,

00:25:05.865 --> 00:25:07.420
a lot of smart people.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:11.284
But this doesn't necessarily
mean you make better decisions.

00:25:11.284 --> 00:25:13.200
Joseph Stalin was probably
a pretty smart guy.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.480
I think you get the point.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.930
So good decisions
really come out

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:26.640
of a combination of
rationality and intuition.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.300
Intuition is a different
kind of function from several

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.690
of these higher levels of mind.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.780
And if we just develop
our intellect and reason

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.060
and think that's going to
solve all our problems,

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.590
you're dreaming.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:44.890
We need these subtler faculties.

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:49.001
And many great thinkers have
pointed this out-- Einstein

00:25:49.001 --> 00:25:49.500
for sure.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.730
Steve Jobs always
talked about this.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:56.310
There's this lovely quote from
this writer-- this is actually

00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:00.900
a real photograph of a Google
employee, of their brain,

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.440
the actual contents of
somebody working here.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.400
I'm not allowed to say who it
is, but they're in this room.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.560
It could be you.

00:26:10.369 --> 00:26:11.910
So what are you
doing with your mind?

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:14.007
We're all intelligent.

00:26:14.007 --> 00:26:15.840
We've got a lot of stuff
going on, thinking.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.110
But what are we thinking
about, actually?

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.430
I think that a great
majority of it--

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:26.760
going by my own mind, the
great proportion of it is junk.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.350
And for most people, it
would be huge benefit

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:32.860
to learn to think less.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.840
Keep the quality ones.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.371
I just keep the
Star Wars previews

00:26:37.371 --> 00:26:38.370
and get rid of the rest.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.240
Intuition.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.100
If you slow your
mind down to get you

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.890
intuition back-- you
get your intuition back

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.710
when you make space for it,
when you stop the chattering

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.780
of the rational mind.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.590
So once again,
these two functions

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:57.585
are mutually exclusive.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.640
And actually, research
into intuitive insights

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.300
amongst indigenous tribes has
revealed that they generally

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.800
are much more intuitive than
city dwellers and educated

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.520
intellectuals.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.320
We're out of balance, and we've
lost something in that process.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.720
So wisdom comes out
of a nice combination

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.170
of rationality and intuition.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.940
Love.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.810
Creativity has enabled
us to conquer the world,

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:36.800
but only love can
conquer your heart.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.360
I'm not talking
about romantic love.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.680
I'm talking about something
much bigger and certainly

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.200
more dependable than that.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:53.150
I'm talking about the
invisible glue that

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:57.350
creates friendships and
families and communities,

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:00.630
the sense of
connection that enables

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:04.330
us to look at a stranger and
see ourselves in their eyes

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:07.319
or inspires a little
girl to share her ice

00:28:07.319 --> 00:28:08.110
cream with a puppy.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.340
Edgar Mitchell was
an Apollo astronaut.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.370
When he was coming
back from the moon,

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:24.840
he had an extraordinary
experience, a euphoric insight.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.010
And he said this.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:30.710
You develop an instant global
consciousness, a people

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:34.010
orientation, an
intense dissatisfaction

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.300
with the state of the
world and a compulsion

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.160
to do something about it.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.100
From out there on the moon,
international politics

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.220
looked so petty.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.170
You want to grab a politician
by the scruff of the neck

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:48.300
and drag him a quarter
of a million miles out

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.926
and say, look at that,
you son of a bitch.

00:28:51.926 --> 00:28:52.800
My kind of astronaut.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.530
I love this guy.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:28:59.360
Oh.

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.940
I just gave the game away.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:01.832
Oh, dear.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:09.460
To develop this
sense of connection,

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.950
and this sense of community,
and this sense of friendship,

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.780
and really feeling what
other people feel--

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.970
the most effective way
to do that-- well, you

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.428
might think I'm going to say
meditation if I hadn't already

00:29:22.428 --> 00:29:23.600
given you the clue.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.950
But actually, what I
found in my experience

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:29.490
is most effective in
doing this is music.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:32.080
And that's why in our
practice we use music

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.880
to lead into meditation.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.344
Music is the
language of emotion.

00:29:36.344 --> 00:29:38.510
If you get back from work,
and you're kind of tired,

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.760
and you're a bit down, you
put on your favorite piece

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.920
of music, what happens?

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.420
It's an instant mood change.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.650
It takes seconds.

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:48.490
It's very powerful.

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:51.880
It resonates with our nervous
system, and our Chakras,

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.450
and the whole body and mind.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:58.200
So before meditating--
which we're

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.930
going to do in a
little while-- we

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.020
use music to put
you in the mood,

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.230
and then it's much
easier to concentrate.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:08.294
If you try and go
straight from work mode--

00:30:08.294 --> 00:30:10.460
you've got to be serious,
you've got to make money--

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.560
and then you go to suddenly
be peaceful and not

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.910
be thinking too much,
it's very difficult

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.250
to make that transition
without something

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:22.320
to shift you into the right
kind of emotional background.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.460
And that's what music does.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.150
So I use music as a
lead-in to meditation.

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:33.820
And you'll find it in so many
different spiritual traditions,

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.590
also.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.270
Just about every
spiritual tradition

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.750
uses music for the same reason.

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.120
So how does meditation work?

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.640
A couple of questions
I want to ask you.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:48.259
First thing-- who thinks
that to meditate you

00:30:48.259 --> 00:30:49.175
have to stop thinking?

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.740
Maybe.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.350
This is often confusing.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.950
The end result of
meditation might be a state

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.790
where you're not thinking.

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:07.930
But to get there, it's
very hard to get there

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:09.074
by trying to stop think.

00:31:09.074 --> 00:31:10.240
It's pretty much impossible.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.865
Because the mind is
a thinking machine.

00:31:11.865 --> 00:31:14.000
It's designed to think.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.090
And you have to lead it by
a more roundabout route.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.720
So I would say the
meditation, you get there

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.840
by concentrating,
learning to concentrate

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.820
on at least one thought
or single flow of thoughts

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.230
rather than wandering
all over the place,

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:32.600
and that leads you to
a state of deep peace.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.470
So I think that's
a misconception.

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.540
So I think that
meditation means equal

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.340
stopping thinking--
the practice.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.650
Maybe the end result,
but not the practice.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:42.604
Second question.

00:31:42.604 --> 00:31:45.103
Who thinks that meditation is
the same thing as mindfulness?

00:31:49.034 --> 00:31:49.940
None of you.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.400
Because you know I'm going to
say that's not true, right,

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.940
and you don't want
to get it wrong.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.045
A lot of people actually
do think meditation is

00:31:57.045 --> 00:31:58.330
the same thing as mindfulness.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.300
But nobody in this
room, clearly,

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.130
because you're all way
too smart for that.

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.650
Because meditation is
more than mindfulness.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:07.420
Mindfulness is a
part of meditation.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.750
It's kind of step one, or
it might be step three.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:11.210
But it's a subset.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:19.860
So just to give you a very--
this is a very eloquent man.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.670
I think you know who
that is-- Jim Carrey.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:24.850
So he's speaking about
an experience that

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.150
is, I would say, beyond
mindfulness, just

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.450
so you get it really clear.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:33.000
JIM CARREY: A few months
ago, I understood suddenly

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.530
how thought was just
an illusory thing,

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:47.520
and how thought is
responsible for, if not all,

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.790
most of the suffering
we experience.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:33:00.060
And then I suddenly felt like
I was looking at these thoughts

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.560
from another perspective.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:08.690
And I wondered, who is it
that's aware that I'm thinking?

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:16.950
And suddenly, I was thrown into
this expensive, amazing feeling

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:22.660
of freedom from myself,
from my problems.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:27.310
I saw that I was
bigger than what I do.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:29.330
I was bigger than my body.

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:33.640
I was everything and everyone.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.790
I was no longer a
fragment of the universe.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:40.220
I was the universe.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:45.490
And ever since that day, I've
been trying to get back there.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.830
It comes and it goes.

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:01.840
It's like riding a wave.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.070
Sometimes I'm on.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:05.210
Sometimes I'm off.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.160
But at least I know
where I want to go.

00:34:09.431 --> 00:34:11.889
DADA NABHANIILANADA: I could
not have put it better myself.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.801
So we lost a little
time at the beginning,

00:34:17.801 --> 00:34:18.800
because we started late.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.399
So I want to skip
forward and actually

00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:21.940
get to where we're
going to meditate.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:22.440
OK.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.940
I'm going to run
through this fast.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.940
Neuroplasticity.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.659
You know what
neural pathways are?

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:30.760
When you think,
your brain changes.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.500
If you keep thinking
in a particular way,

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.805
you create neural pathways.

00:34:35.805 --> 00:34:39.270
Our thinking habits
change our physical brain,

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.230
and it changes our personality.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:42.969
We used to think
that the brain was

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:45.854
a static physiological
organ, but that understanding

00:34:45.854 --> 00:34:48.560
has changed completely.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.540
And thinking, it's a
little bit like water.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.540
It doesn't have a
particular form.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.530
It's kind of soft.

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:55.969
But that's very deceptive.

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:57.800
It can be very powerful.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:02.020
If water keeps running in
a stream for a long time,

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:05.580
this can become this.

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:11.120
So keep thinking happy thoughts,
and you'll be happier person.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.080
If you keep thinking
angry thoughts,

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.500
you'll become an angry person.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:22.320
It's very reassuring to
me that this new discovery

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:28.650
of neuroplasticity has
confirmed something that Yogis

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:33.380
have known for 7,000 years.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.960
Thought is extremely
powerful, especially

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.987
repetitive,
concentrated thought.

00:35:39.987 --> 00:35:41.820
And that's one of the
secrets of meditation,

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.190
that type of concentration.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.610
It changes your brain.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:48.190
It changes you over time.

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:50.600
To do that, we use
something called a mantra.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.130
Wizards use magic words,
Yogis use mantras.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:59.450
So a mantra is a, in this
case, a Sanskrit word of power.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:02.610
And it's repeated or
sung, and it really

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.850
helps to bring us into
that meditative state using

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:09.370
the sound and also the meaning
behind the mantra, the power

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:12.710
of positive thinking
which is demonstrated

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.820
in neuroplasticity.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.160
So the mantra we are going
to use has three words,

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.120
and we're going to
put to music to it.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.720
And it means love is
the essence of all.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:26.480
It's a very positive idea.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.710
So to meditate-- I want
you all to sit straight.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.365
Feet flat on the floor, please.

00:36:33.365 --> 00:36:35.115
Hands cupped in your
lap, thumbs together.

00:36:38.876 --> 00:36:40.250
Hopefully, this
is going to work.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.010
So first, let's get
the mantra straight.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:50.390
Can we get the mantra back?

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.510
Thank you.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.060
I want you to
pronounce it with me.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.190
So it's pronounced baba.

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:56.369
AUDIENCE: Baba.

00:36:56.369 --> 00:36:57.410
DADA NABHANIILANADA: Nam.

00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:58.270
AUDIENCE: Nam.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:59.478
DADA NABHANIILANADA: Kevalam.

00:36:59.478 --> 00:37:00.340
AUDIENCE: Kevalam.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.740
DADA NABHANIILANADA: And all
together, baba nam kevalam.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.540
Very good.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:08.180
So as I said, that means love
is the essence of everything,

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:08.980
essentially.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:15.110
So you're welcome to
sing with me if you want.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.747
And I'll guide you through a
very short, silent meditation.

00:39:21.002 --> 00:39:23.155
And just keep your eyes closed.

00:39:27.082 --> 00:39:29.290
And breathe through your
nose if you can comfortably.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:38.070
And let the mantra and the
music continue silently

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:40.570
as though you're hearing it,
as though your inner voice were

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:46.840
singing to you-- singing
to you and reminding you

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:51.200
that within you is a place
of perfect peace and love

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.905
and harmony.

00:39:53.905 --> 00:39:57.510
And it's always there.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:01.985
And you can return to
it if you pay attention.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:09.130
So just let the music and the
mantra continue in your mind

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:09.850
by itself.

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:12.870
Let that be your focus
for a couple of minutes

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:13.790
of silence now.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:35.090
I've seen this kind of practice
and this kind of lifestyle

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:41.000
transform from
really somebody who

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.540
maybe had a lot of
problems, really

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.510
didn't know what
they wanted to do,

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:49.230
into somebody who's
very centered, very open

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:54.140
hearted, much more connected
to their source of wisdom

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.630
and creativity and love.

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:59.780
And I think that with
this kind of practice,

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.680
we can create a new kind
of corporate culture

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.260
where everybody
understands that health

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.580
and well being have no price,
that people matter more

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:12.630
than things, and
that the solution

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:15.890
to most of our problems is
really right inside of us.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.310
There's something in
yoga called a Mudra.

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:25.800
A Mudra is something
that connects

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:29.270
the mind and body with meaning.

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:31.610
It's a language of the body.

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:34.630
This idea can be
represented with the hands.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:36.034
The hands are creative.

00:43:36.034 --> 00:43:37.450
We've created all
kinds of things.

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:38.220
We build things.

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:41.420
We write, we play the
piano, we use computers.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:44.420
Hands are creative.

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:46.870
They're amazing
creative instruments.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:52.030
But without your head, they
wouldn't know what to do.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:54.680
So your head is like this.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:44:00.390
And your mind, if it doesn't
get guidance from your heart,

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:02.340
it doesn't always
make the best choices.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.930
So there's a Mudra in yoga
call the Namaskar Mudra,

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:06.980
and it goes like this.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.550
The hands, the
head, and the heart.

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:11.140
Let's all do that.

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.700
Then you'll remember it.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.510
Muscle memory.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:19.950
So the hands are creative,
the mind can produce wisdom,

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:26.240
and the heart is what
connects us to everyone else.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.820
So thank you all very much.

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.610
That's called a Namaskar Mudra.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.140
We've got a little
time for questions.

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.910
And I can also give
you a little bit

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.910
of information about where you
can learn more if you'd like.

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:48.470
But let's see if you
have any questions.

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.970
Yeah.

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:54.550
Do we have a mic?

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:57.282
You can use the guitar mic.

00:44:57.282 --> 00:44:58.490
Just pretend you're a guitar.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:00.050
It'll be fine.

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:02.260
AUDIENCE: So actually,
I have two questions.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.390
The first one was--
earlier on, there

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:09.720
was a reference to research
that certain kinds of meditation

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.030
can improve creativity.

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:14.620
And I was wondering
if that meant

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:17.090
certain kinds of
meditation are particularly

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.530
good for creativity,
other kinds of meditation

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.220
may be good at other things.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:24.600
Is that what was meant by that?

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.660
And in that case, what
kinds of meditation

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:30.155
are particularly good
at bringing about--

00:45:30.155 --> 00:45:31.530
DADA NABHANIILANADA:
The practice

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:33.820
in Asthanga yoga, this
eight-limbed yoga that

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:35.890
helps to develop
the level of mind

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:39.220
that creativity arises
from, is called Pratyahara,

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:42.590
it means sense withdrawal.

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:44.760
There are various techniques
of sense withdrawal,

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.240
but effectively it means
to withdraw your attention

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.524
from the world and
focus your mind inward.

00:45:49.524 --> 00:45:51.440
And that's usually done
through visualization.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:59.050
AUDIENCE: The second question
is about-- so being aware of how

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:01.300
as one thinks, so one becomes.

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.930
And sometimes, we're
in situations where

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:06.780
there are affairs that come up.

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:07.620
I'm in trouble.

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:10.010
I need to perform
better at work.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:14.490
And my mind is thinking,
how am I going to do this?

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:16.880
And if I lose my job, then
I'm going to lose this,

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.381
and we can't afford
to pay for that.

00:46:18.381 --> 00:46:20.463
And in the mind-- you're
trying to sleep at night,

00:46:20.463 --> 00:46:22.840
and the mind just keeps
going on and creating this.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:26.700
And I know-- yes, these
thoughts are not helpful.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.450
These thoughts will
create more fear.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:30.220
I don't want them.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.610
But I don't remember choosing
to have these thoughts.

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:34.260
They just keep
coming by themselves.

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.300
And they're very, very
stubborn, these ones

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.570
that are attached
to these deep fears.

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:42.780
And I was wondering, do you
have any specific recommendation

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.970
for when you find yourself
in that kind of situation?

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:47.470
DADA NABHANIILANADA:
Well, there are

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:50.530
some things that can help
when the problem pops up.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:54.890
But meditation is more
effective as a preventative.

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:59.030
So what I would say is that
if you practice meditation--

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:01.050
and actually,
specifically spiritual

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:07.030
chanting-- you tend to-- this
really addresses anxiety.

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:12.590
You tend to let go of
that fear-based anxiety

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:14.780
when you've been
practicing for a while.

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:18.051
So on the spur of the moment,
I don't have a magic bullet

00:47:18.051 --> 00:47:19.550
to come along and
say, this is going

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:20.660
to stop you being anxious.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.610
But if you do these
practices regularly,

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:26.300
you're probably not
going to get like that.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.110
While you're
wondering about that,

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:30.680
I might tell you
what you can do next.

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:31.262
Read my book.

00:47:31.262 --> 00:47:32.720
Yes, everybody
should read my book.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.428
It's available in 10
languages, including

00:47:34.428 --> 00:47:37.800
Vietnamese and Norwegian
and blah, blah, blah.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.470
Lots of people think it's
good book, not just me.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.800
The other thing is
if you want to get

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.280
a recording of this
kind of chanting

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.930
and a guided meditation,
you can give me your email

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:51.840
or just text it to
me at that number,

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.410
and I'll send you a link.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:57.470
Or you can download a
couple of sunrise and sunset

00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:00.340
meditations, which a lot
of people really like.

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:03.140
And the music is great,
I have to tell you.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.590
It was recorded with another
musician friend of mine

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:09.740
who's a fabulous guitarist.

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:11.744
I'll also send you the
slide set if you want

00:48:11.744 --> 00:48:12.910
to get some of the pictures.

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:15.820
Everybody wants the picture of
the little girl with the puppy

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.720
feeding the ice cream.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.530
What other stuff?

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:21.112
What else do I do?

00:48:21.112 --> 00:48:23.320
You can just write to me if
you've got any questions.

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.180
If you want to learn more,
I do one-to-one coaching.

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.470
I teach workshops and
retreats and stuff like that.

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:30.550
So that's all available.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:34.240
And that's my website,
The Monk Dude Speaks.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.010
That's my new
corporate website which

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:40.090
was very beautifully
put together by Emily.

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:41.470
Thank you.

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:44.492
Emily is also
collecting testimonials

00:48:44.492 --> 00:48:46.200
if any if you would
like to say something

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:49.760
about what you got out
of this so we can use

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.780
that to inspire other
people to maybe come

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.070
to programs like this.

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:57.931
So that's going to be
happening straight afterwards.

00:48:57.931 --> 00:49:00.430
I think that's everything I'm
going to tell you unless we've

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:02.576
got any other questions.

00:49:02.576 --> 00:49:04.450
AUDIENCE: How do you
lead the horse to water?

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:07.782
I know some people
that benefit from it,

00:49:07.782 --> 00:49:10.597
and you tell them about
the possibilities, yet--

00:49:10.597 --> 00:49:12.430
DADA NABHANIILANADA: I
know 7 billion people

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:13.513
who could benefit from it.

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:21.349
There's a very good book
called "10% Happier."

00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:22.015
Anybody read it?

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.660
There was a guy who's super
skeptic, this ABC journalist,

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:28.577
Dan-- what's his name?

00:49:28.577 --> 00:49:29.285
AUDIENCE: Harris.

00:49:29.285 --> 00:49:31.220
DADA NABHANIILANADA:
Dan Harris, thank you.

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:34.140
So Dan Harris, he's
a brilliant writer.

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:37.760
He's a nationally famous
journalists, so he'd better be.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:44.126
So he was super skeptical,
tremendously resistant.

00:49:44.126 --> 00:49:45.750
But what convinced
him was the science.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:50.990
Science is the
religion of the day.

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:56.220
The research proves that
meditation helps you.

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:58.760
People that do it have
known that for 7,000 years.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.050
But nowadays, we
only believe it if we

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:03.190
can see it in a laboratory
and all those figures.

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:08.030
So we have those figures
now demonstrating

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:09.740
a lot of the benefits.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:12.090
The more subtle benefits
that I'm personally

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:15.135
most interested in are harder
to prove, as I indicated.

00:50:15.135 --> 00:50:17.010
And creativity is just
the beginning of that.

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:20.110
But the more tangible
benefits, the physiological

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:24.820
stress-related benefits,
there's no doubt.

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:26.844
That's one way to do it.

00:50:26.844 --> 00:50:28.260
Get them to read
Dan Harris' book.

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:29.180
That's pretty convincing.

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:30.179
Or just watch his video.

00:50:30.179 --> 00:50:32.840
He's got a really
need four-minute video

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.190
you can find on
YouTube, which is

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:39.590
a brilliant exposition on
the benefits of meditation

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:40.573
in four minutes.

00:50:40.573 --> 00:50:41.406
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:41.406 --> 00:50:43.650
DADA NABHANIILANADA: OK.

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:44.800
Thank you all very much.

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.700
I think that's it.

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.450
[APPLAUSE]
