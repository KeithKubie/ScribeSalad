and there's that video afterward yeah
that's<00:07:03.119><c> right</c><00:07:03.300><c> so</c><00:07:03.479><c> we</c><00:07:03.509><c> must</c><00:07:03.839><c> um</c><00:07:04.249><c> unless</c><00:07:05.249><c> you</c>

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:05.459 align:start position:0%
that's right so we must um unless you
 

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's right so we must um unless you
made<00:07:05.610><c> it</c><00:07:05.669><c> out</c><00:07:05.759><c> of</c><00:07:05.879><c> order</c><00:07:06.059><c> but</c><00:07:06.389><c> yeah</c><00:07:06.749><c> that</c><00:07:06.899><c> could</c>

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 align:start position:0%
made it out of order but yeah that could
 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.509 align:start position:0%
made it out of order but yeah that could
be<00:07:07.080><c> possible</c><00:07:07.589><c> too</c><00:07:07.800><c> but</c><00:07:08.449><c> but</c><00:07:09.449><c> then</c><00:07:09.599><c> it's</c><00:07:09.719><c> inside</c>

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:10.519 align:start position:0%
be possible too but but then it's inside
 

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:12.649 align:start position:0%
be possible too but but then it's inside
yeah<00:07:11.519><c> that's</c><00:07:11.759><c> true</c><00:07:11.909><c> so</c><00:07:12.179><c> you</c><00:07:12.209><c> would</c><00:07:12.360><c> have</c><00:07:12.509><c> to</c>

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:12.659 align:start position:0%
yeah that's true so you would have to
 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:14.779 align:start position:0%
yeah that's true so you would have to
avoid<00:07:12.779><c> yeah</c><00:07:13.619><c> I</c><00:07:13.649><c> don't</c><00:07:13.800><c> know</c><00:07:14.009><c> but</c><00:07:14.490><c> no</c><00:07:14.580><c> but</c><00:07:14.729><c> I</c>

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:14.789 align:start position:0%
avoid yeah I don't know but no but I
 

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:15.980 align:start position:0%
avoid yeah I don't know but no but I
would<00:07:14.969><c> make</c><00:07:15.119><c> sense</c><00:07:15.300><c> so</c><00:07:15.419><c> he</c><00:07:15.569><c> could</c><00:07:15.749><c> put</c><00:07:15.899><c> the</c>

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 align:start position:0%
would make sense so he could put the
 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.899 align:start position:0%
would make sense so he could put the
