TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:03.690
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.023
And this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.023 --> 00:00:07.910
from Google in the last week.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.400
It's that time
again-- more Chrome.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.500
Head over to the post
linked in the description

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.790
below to read about some
of the great updates

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.257
in Chrome 53 Beta including
Shadow DOM V1, the Payment

00:00:18.257 --> 00:00:22.690
Request API, Android
autoplay, and more.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.290
Speaking of the
Payment Request API,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.580
it makes checkout
flows easier, faster,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.970
and consistent on
shopping sites.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.840
And we have a great post for you
with a video overview and code

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.010
to get you started.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.630
Parsey McParseface is
the world's most accurate

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.350
English parser.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.980
And now it has 40 cousins.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.320
Parsey's Cousins is a collection
of pretrained syntactic models

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.030
for 40 languages.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.100
Take a look at the post
for the really cool way

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.360
we built these models.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.610
Also, the GitHub
link is there, too.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.780
And we'll be at the 2016 Annual
Meeting of the Association

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.387
for Computational Linguistics.

00:00:57.387 --> 00:00:59.470
If you can't make it to
Berlin for the conference,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.660
instead check out
our post with links

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.400
to all the Google
research being presented.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.350
Over the last six months, we've
made a number of improvements

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.420
to the AdWords community,
which is a great place

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.910
to help you improve performance,
share best practices,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.640
and ask an expert
your questions.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.590
Take a look.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.910
Streak is a full-blown CRM
built directly into Gmail

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.720
and built on the
Google Cloud Platform.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.480
Read the post to learn how they
added advanced functionality

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.160
into the Cloud Datastore
object storage system.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.390
It's a cool post with a
lot of detail and code.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.470
The App Engine Admin API lets
you manage your application

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.690
programmatically.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.110
With it, you can deploy to App
Engine from your own custom

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.420
toolchain, write your own A/B
testing framework, and more.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.790
Oh, and now it's
generally available.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.860
Check out the post for
an example with code.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.710

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.920
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.520
And I'll see you next week.
