00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.160
Some of us like to spend our weekend with
a book in hand, while others prefer a night

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.099
out being the centre of attention. But from
a scientific perspective, is there an advantage

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.400
to being an introvert or an extrovert? Which
is better?

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.100
The idea of two polar personalities was first
described by Swiss German psychologist Carl

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.010
Jung, who coined the terms introversion and
extraversion. Jung’s theory was further

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.830
elaborated upon by Hans Eysenck, a German
psychologist who defined introverts and extroverts

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.800
by their baseline arousal. Extroverts, with
their lower level of arousal, would need to

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.320
do more exciting things that would physically
and mentally exhaust an introvert, in order

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.030
to reach satisfaction. So while an introvert
might be content with a leisurely bicycle

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.460
ride through a quiet park, an extrovert might
need to hit the dirt roads in order to feel

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.070
mentally satisfied.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.631
Brain scans show a thicker prefrontal cortex
in introverts compared to extroverts, which

00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:57.730
is associated with deeper thought and planning,
suggesting that extroverts may be more impulsive

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.640
than introverts, who prefer to ‘mull things
over’ instead of directly springing into

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.259
action. But because of this tendency to ruminate
in introverts, they’re also more susceptible

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.020
to developing anxiety and depression.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.310
Extroverts also respond more strongly to rewards,
with brain scans showing a significantly more

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.010
activated dopamine reward system than introverts,
when completing and winning a computerized

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.209
gambling task. And given that we’re social
animals, dopamine is also released when interacting

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:29.549
with other humans. This was especially important
as hunter-gatherers who relied upon others

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.009
for both food and protection from predators.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.069
However, human connection has a greater impact
on extroverts than introverts. In fact, it

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.159
has been shown that the brains of extroverts
respond more strongly when shown photos of

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.560
humans faces compared to neutral photos of
nature. For introverts, the brain response

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.990
is similar between the two.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.329
Now, that’s not to say that introverts don’t
feel any excitement from winning or that they

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.170
strongly dislike being around people. But
they simply don’t feel as excited and don’t

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.280
require as much social interaction in order
to feel good.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.799
In terms of genetics, there may be an evolutionary
advantage to each trait. For instance, introverts

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.700
might have stuck to the sidelines to avoid
predators, while extroverts would roam and

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.209
explore giving them an advantage when food
is scarce. A study involving 130 participants

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.880
discovered that those who were more inclined
to be adventurous had two copies of one particular

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.120
allele (Met/Met), reinforcing the idea that
these personality traits are partially linked

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.120
to genetics.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.879
In many ways our society has an extroversion
bias, where qualities like ‘putting yourself

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.950
out there’ are highly valued. Our institutions
are also often designed with the extroverts

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.209
in mind, where ‘group work’ is a popular
practice in most schools and workplaces, with

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.280
the idea that creativity comes from a sociable
place. However, as social animals we instinctively

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.730
mimic others opinions without realizing it,
suggesting that your brainstorming sessions

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.819
with others may not always be productive.
When we disagree with a group, neuroscientists

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.969
have shown high activation in the amygdala
- a part of the brain associated with the

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:00.780
sting of rejection.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.000
When we think of introverts, shyness and the
preference to be alone often come to mind,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.219
but in reality, introverts may simply prefer
close conversations with one or a few people,

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:15.000
instead of dozens. Furthermore, introverts
may even be better public speakers, as they

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.659
are known to think through ideas thoroughly
compared to extroverts, who may choose to

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.390
make rash decisions instead.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.480
But, perhaps you are an ambivert, right in
the middle of the introvert/extrovert Venn

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.129
diagram, combining the best of both worlds!
A recent study involving 340 call centre representatives

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.590
had their sales record tracked for a period
of three months. Those who were neither strong

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.260
extroverts or introverts generated the most
revenue, averaging $208 per hour, compared

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.130
to the study average of $138 per hour.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.379
So, what do you see yourself as? And do you
think one is better than the other?
