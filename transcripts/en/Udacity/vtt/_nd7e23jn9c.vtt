00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Meet Viva Real
A partner company of Udacity

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.700
I think everyone knows why Viva Real exists,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.100
because finding a property, 
renting and buying a property is hard.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.900
We see a great potential to organize this process,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.800
give people more information

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.500
and assure people they
can make a good decision

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.500
about where to live.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.100
Today we are 600 people,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.200
we've grown a lot,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.800
and today we have
over 5 million properties registered

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.600
for rent and for sale.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.100
And I think  that
companies that forget

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.200
they need to constantly review

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.700
their existing ideas
and bring new things

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.900
will fail in the digital world.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.000
We truly believe in
bringing new people, new talent,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.400
people who bring new ideas
and think outside the box.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.800
Professionals who are prepared,
those who are experienced,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.300
who have technical background

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.500
they are very disputed in the market.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.800
So how will your company,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.300
how will Vival Real

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.800
become a company
which is irresistible enough

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.400
so that they will refuse
other offers and choose us?

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.200
Today our greatest trouble

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.100
is finding professionals
who adhere to our culture.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.800
Who can identify
with the way we work,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.800
with what we look for
in terms of behaviour...

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.900
Our team is arranged
by products cell.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.800
We use effective methodologies

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.900
but we don't use
one specific methodology,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.500
we truly believe each team
can work independently

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.900
and we standardize a few things.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.400
We standardize
the interfaces accross teams

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.900
So the way requests
get to the teams,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.000
the way we document
each product's needs,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.100
and the way these teams
shoud communicate.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.000
But the internal processes
are determined by each team.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Usually, by giving them space

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.505
we reap much more benefits than

00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:49.800
by creating something very formal.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.300
It's one of the few places I've worked

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.000
where I feel truly comfortable.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Which motivates me the most here

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.300
besides the freedom we have
within the Viva Real platform

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.600
are the people.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.700
So here we have a team
that is very good and very diverse.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.400
You end up learning a lot each day.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.900
Learning is essential
for a tech professional.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.300
Those who are not interested
in keeping themselves updated

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.400
will get quickly outdated.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.700
It even becomes a matter of survival.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.100
Especially when you wish
to work at cutting-edge companies.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.700
I believe our partnership with Udacity

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.000
can help Viva Real find the best talent.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.500
We look for people who are
always willing to get better

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.300
and Udacity's students
are already doing that.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.400
We often have positions opened in data

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.700
so data analystics and data science

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.500
are openings we very often have.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.200
An expertise area we've been always
looking at is performance marketing.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.200
Today I have openings
for developers in our back teams

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.100
when we think about
the stacks of ruby, python...

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.200
...all you can imagine,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.100
because we do not limit
the use of any technology.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.600
Front development.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.200
And for the mobile teams we use iOS, Android.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.500
Talking about iOS we use swift.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.200
Get ready for the market
