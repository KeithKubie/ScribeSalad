00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So now I want to ask you a question.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So given this quality function Q,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and assuming that our utility function

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is the log function,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
since we saw that for some values of this state

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the best action--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the action with the highest quality is 'hold'

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and other values is 'gamble,'

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
there must be a point at which there is a crossover--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
where the two values are approximately equal.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So what I want you to tell me is:

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to the nearest million, what is that crossover point C?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That value of state--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that value of the amount of money that I currently have

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to say that I'm indifferent between the 2--

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that if I have C dollars, then my quality for gambling

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is the same or approximately the same

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
as my value for holding.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What value of C to the nearest million is that true of?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And just to make it easier for those who can't divide by e in your head,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we'll use the log10 logarithms rather than the natural logarithms

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so that the log10 logarithm of a million is 6.

00:01:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Tell me what the crossover point is to the nearest million.
