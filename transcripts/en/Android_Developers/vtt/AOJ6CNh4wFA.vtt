RICH HYNDMAN: Android Developer
office hours.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.150
With me today, little, fluffy
Android as always.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.420
For the first time, Stephan
Linzner is joining us.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.800
He's joined our team from
Stuttgart, Germany?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.484
STEPHAN LINZNER: Yeah,
actually Frankfurt.

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:18.670
But I'm originally coming
from Stuttgart.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.180
RICH HYNDMAN: OK, yeah.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.290
He's come over and he's
joined our team.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.800
He'll be based out of the
London office as well.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.100
And so, welcome Stephan.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.620
Bring some new testing skills
to our team that we quite

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.250
badly need for all those
questions on

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.690
testing that you asked.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.110
So in the future, moderators for
these feel free to answer

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.755
more questions on testing.

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:37.270
And hopefully Stephen will be
able to fill in the blanks

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.200
where we didn't have that
experience before.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.526
Also, of course, is--

00:00:41.526 --> 00:00:43.090
MATT GAUNT: Matthew
Gaunt, hello.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.820
NICK BUTCHER: And hi.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.160
Nick Butcher.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.120
RICH HYNDMAN: Always.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.480
And we've got two
people joined us

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.870
in the Hangout already.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.510
We've got Bill and Clemens.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.980
Hi guys.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.135
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.370
NICK BUTCHER: And Chris
Banes is out sick.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.350
So get well soon, Chris.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.600
Because you're clearly
watching.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.060
RICH HYNDMAN: Right.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.770
Mystery viewers-- he might
be one of them.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.320
All right.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.050
As usual, we'll be discussing
Android development topics.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.400
But we won't be discussing
roadmap features that haven't

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.990
been released.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.490
That sort of thing.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.418
Someone else has just joined
us in the Hangout.

00:01:13.418 --> 00:01:14.762
It's Johan.

00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:15.658
Hey, Johan.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:16.630
Good seeing you again.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.640
Thank you for joining
us today.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.940
STEPHAN LINZNER: Hey, Johan.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.280
RICH HYNDMAN: Johan is either
on mute or his laptop is

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.740
trying to catch up.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.340
There we go.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.140
A wave from Johan.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.560
OK.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.180
Before we delve into the
moderator, does anyone have

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.400
any questions from the
Hangout for us?

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.540
Ah, it's Guiseppe as well.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.000
Hey, Guiseppe.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.110
Good to see you.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.510
Any questions for inside
the Hangout today?

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.020
BILL MOTE: I have a
question for you.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.280
RICH HYNDMAN: Hi, Bill.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.580
BILL MOTE: The AsyncTask went
from being single threaded to

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.630
then being parallel
processed and then

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.710
back to single threaded.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.150
Why did you do that?

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.452
RICH HYNDMAN: Because
it broke stuff.

00:01:57.452 --> 00:01:58.850
A lot of people--

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.220
NICK BUTCHER: It was never
actually documented, was it,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.320
how it was executed?

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.907
So we felt it was OK to change
the implementation because we

00:02:04.907 --> 00:02:07.570
weren't actually violating any
contracts that we've made.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.080
But yeah, essentially, because
it broke stuff.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.575
RICH HYNDMAN: People were
relying on the fact that

00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:13.210
AsyncTasks would come back in
the order that they were

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.440
requested it.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.420
And as soon as we said it's a
multi-threader, this time

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.290
coming back in other orders,
applications across the place

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.480
all started to fail.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.290
So we did revert it back again
which makes life particularly

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.490
awkward for you.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.350
But you can specify.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.390
So you can put the threadpull
executor specified in your

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.730
AsyncTask if you'd like it to
be multithreaded or not--

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.090
if you like it not to
be multithreaded.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.405
And we always recommend
specifying which one you

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.710
prefer, because behavior
may vary.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.825
Behavior definitely will vary.

00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:43.010
NICK BUTCHER: Go execute
on executer.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.630
RICH HYNDMAN: Execute
on executer.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.040
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, that's
what you want.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.570
BILL MOTE: We were having a
debate about that yesterday.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.880
And I did a bunch of reading.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.390
So I thought, well, I'll join
the Hangout and ask.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.190
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, it's
a good question.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.950
We've had that one in
conferences before as well.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.390
It's just one of those things.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.285
We do test a lot of applications
with each release

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:01.770
of Android.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.261
And we didn't spot this
particular issue arising.

00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:06.890
But it was the early Honeycomb
right, that it

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.820
got switched over?

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.540
STEPHAN LINZNER:
And sometimes--

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.140
sometimes it's also
about performance.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.750
If you have one thread, it might
be faster than spawning

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.570
multiple threads.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.530
Because I've seen applications
where they respond like 20 to

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.060
40 threads especially when
scrolling a list view.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.890
Just as an addition.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.380
MATT GAUNT: That's what
threadpulls are for.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.810
RICH HYNDMAN: The reason it
happened at that time, as

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.270
well, it was all single core
devices up until then.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.350
And then we got the
dual core devices.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.400
So we're like, let's
make use of it.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.185
Let's make all these
applications multicore web.

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:38.952
Oops.

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:40.202
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.450
RICH HYNDMAN: Who else
has just joined us?

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.990
We've got Yossi.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.300
Hey, Yossi.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.880
Good to see you in the
Hangout again.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.728
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Hi, guys.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:49.176
RICH HYNDMAN: Hey, hey.

00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:50.520
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Hi.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.457
RICH HYNDMAN: Any other
questions from inside the

00:03:51.457 --> 00:03:53.250
Hangout before we have
a look at today's

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.035
moderator and G+ thread.

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:55.920
NICK BUTCHER: I'll also
just chip in as well.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.530
I think we had a bit of
discussion on the new format

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.540
which we tried out for the
first time last week

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.005
compressing us down to half an
hour and trying to keep us

00:04:04.005 --> 00:04:05.330
really focused on the content.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.810
And there were some
people saying it

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.890
felt a little rushed.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.720
And I'm sorry if that
came across.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.000
But also, a lot of people seemed
to very much enjoy it.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.230
Especially looking at the
YouTube stats, people seem to

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.369
have got a lot more from that.

00:04:17.369 --> 00:04:20.740
So we're going to stick with
the half hour format.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.529
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes,
it's unfortunate.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.410
The people who interact with us
in the Hangout really seem

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.560
to appreciate the
time to chat.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.880
Thank you to the guys
who do join us.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.611
You do make half the
show for us.

00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:32.750
But the stats are
just incredible.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.640
NICK BUTCHER: But the 5,000 or
so rewatches on YouTube seem

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.660
to prefer the shorter format.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.090
RICH HYNDMAN: We've done shows
now, 1 hour, 45 minutes, and

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.190
30 minutes-- and the shorter
show, the more of the show

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.595
people watch, not just
percentage wise but actually

00:04:44.595 --> 00:04:46.270
in real minutes.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.585
So by the time we get
to an hour show, it

00:04:48.585 --> 00:04:49.630
drops quite a bit.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.220
NICK BUTCHER: So we're

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.370
optimizing now to give minutes.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.026
RICH HYNDMAN: The whole show
will be five minutes, and

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:55.040
everyone will watch
the whole thing.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.220
Which is sorta like Reto does
on "This Week in Android"

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.772
which was so fast this week,
I haven't even seen it yet.

00:05:00.772 --> 00:05:02.221
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, nor did I.

00:05:02.221 --> 00:05:04.260
RICH HYNDMAN: Reto?

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.830
OK, anything else from
inside the Hangout?

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.130
GUISEPPE PORCELLI: Can I
ask a question quick?

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.667
RICH HYNDMAN: Are Nexus
10s unbreakable?

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:15.470
Let me find out.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.110
It is fine, yup.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.560
GUISEPPE PORCELLI: Can I go?

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.530
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes,
please proceed.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.160
GUISEPPE PORCELLI: Yes.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.510
We are implementing a new
application that is based on

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.870
the module concept.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.810
For module concept, I mean that
to the base application

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:42.200
must be able to load external
library in JAR.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.900
I would like to ask if there
is any suggestion from you

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.310
guys how to implement a good
management of external model?

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.750
So the user would be able, for
example, paying through the

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.630
In-app system some special
model, and once he paid, then

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.190
we would supply the download
link of the JAR library.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.170
And then, the app would
be able to load at

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.420
runtime this model.

00:06:15.113 --> 00:06:18.080
RICH HYNDMAN: Mm-hm.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.280
MATT GAUNT: What's
the question?

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.643
So what's--

00:06:20.643 --> 00:06:21.390
RICH HYNDMAN: Whether
it's possible--

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.566
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:22.566 --> 00:06:24.440
MATT GAUNT: I think
with both--

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.110
RICH HYNDMAN: So Britta did a
post on Android Developers

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.032
about ClassLoader and loading
classes remotely at some

00:06:30.032 --> 00:06:31.654
point, didn't we?

00:06:31.654 --> 00:06:33.118
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:06:33.118 --> 00:06:34.760
RICH HYNDMAN: It was Fred?

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.082
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:06:36.082 --> 00:06:36.480
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, OK.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.730
Fred, Britta-- interchangable.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.000
So yeah, you asked whether it's
technically possible or

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.440
the best way to do it?

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.620
GUISEPPE PORCELLI: The
best way to do it.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.800
RICH HYNDMAN: So the only
written guidance we have on

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.180
that I'm aware of at the
moment is on Android

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.540
Developer's blog.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.180
I'll find it for you now.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.270
That was a post written by Fred
Chung, apparently, which

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.080
does go into details of the
best way to do dynamically

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.700
load class files.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.240
But other than that, Android
Developers' blogspot.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.240
GUISEPPE PORCELLI: And connected
question, what do

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.270
you think about the permission
security--

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.410
the permission security will be
connected inside, would we

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.210
attach it to do the single
library that we load at

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.940
runtime, or all the permissions
must be in the

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.040
main application?

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.892
RICH HYNDMAN: Definitely all
permissions must be in the

00:07:35.892 --> 00:07:37.430
main application.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.610
There's no other
way than that.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:39.710
STEPHAN LINZNER: Specify
them once.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.430
You cannot change that.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.790
GUISEPPE PORCELLI: Definitely?

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.110
RICH HYNDMAN: Definitely.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.230
NICK BUTCHER: Or for a different
example, if they're

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.840
in a plug in system, you can
look at the dashclock that

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.690
Roman Nurik just opensourced
which has an API where you can

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.890
kind of write your own modules
and runtime will pull them in.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.500
So that's an example code
you could probably take

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.500
a little look at.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.730
So that's at code.google.com/p
for "project" dashclock.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:02.440
And technically--

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.525
GUISEPPE PORCELLI: And we can
put this link in the chart?

00:08:05.525 --> 00:08:06.920
NICK BUTCHER: Ah, no.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.750
RICH HYNDMAN: We can put it
into a G+ thread, right?

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.835
NICK BUTCHER: I'll put
it in your ears.

00:08:11.835 --> 00:08:12.765
MATT GAUNT: I'll do it.

00:08:12.765 --> 00:08:15.560
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.260
NICK BUTCHER: I will.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.730
I was just joking.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.195
RICH HYNDMAN: I've posted our
link into the G+ thread for

00:08:21.195 --> 00:08:22.026
this Hangout.

00:08:22.026 --> 00:08:23.940
For the class loading.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.930
And Nick will do the
other one for you.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.470
And everyone looking
for it right now.

00:08:36.434 --> 00:08:37.790
Good question.

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.246
And should I have Ron or
[INAUDIBLE] do it?

00:08:40.246 --> 00:08:40.678
I've

00:08:40.678 --> 00:08:41.110
NICK BUTCHER: Not yet--

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.200
GUISEPPE PORCELLI: By the time
that you find it, I would add

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.720
something, Richard.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.210
Well, I was just trying
to find the solution.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.860
Because I was thinking that
the permission could be

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:59.690
included in the single JAR and
not in the single library, and

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.720
not in the main one.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.050
But at the handle for the day,
if I have to include the

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.500
permissions in the manifest in
the main application I'm in,

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.740
then this would not solve the
whole other real problem.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.410
Because the real problem today
is that I would like to have

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:22.590
specific feeders that users
can buy separately.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.250
And then, when he buy
separately, he know that this

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.560
special feature need some
special permission.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.042
That is the real problem.

00:09:32.042 --> 00:09:34.180
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, so there's
two solutions to that.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.955
The filters list on
the Android--

00:09:36.955 --> 00:09:39.560
oh my god, I have to drink-- on
the Play store themselves,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.100
just list the filters
as separate

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.850
purchases on the Play store.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.560
And they can have their
own permissions.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.870
And link to them from inside
your application.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.800
The other thing would be
downloading APKs to the

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.090
device, and then calling the
installer to install those

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.700
APKs and then show the
permission screen.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.130
But that wouldn't be allowed if
you were shipping after the

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.340
Play store.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.650
So the only way would be to--

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.030
GUISEPPE PORCELLI: Could you
please explain better the

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.320
second solution?

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.300
RICH HYNDMAN: Well, the second
solution doesn't really apply.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:16.520
Because it would be effectively
writing your own

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.684
marketplace where you would
download APK files, and then

00:10:19.684 --> 00:10:22.790
call the device's installer
to install them.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.020
And then, the user would get
to accept the permissions.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.650
But you're not allowed to ship
other marketplaces inside the

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.560
Play store.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.010
So it wouldn't really apply.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.230
The only way to have separate
permissions is to have--

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.140
GUISEPPE PORCELLI: Do you think
possible that in future

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.227
we will have optional
admissions?

00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:44.140
RICH HYNDMAN: As per the
disclaimer at the start of the

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:48.080
show, we wouldn't gamble as
to answer that question.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.670
I don't know.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.500
No idea, Guiseppe.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.895
No idea.

00:10:51.895 --> 00:10:54.270
GUISEPPE PORCELLI: But this
is a question that must be

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.380
brought to the main place
where they decide?

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.270
RICH HYNDMAN: Absolutely.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.250
GUISEPPE PORCELLI: Because
optional permissions-- some

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.372
option permissions will
help us to [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:05.372 --> 00:11:06.650
and many customers
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:07.905
RICH HYNDMAN: My team are
fully aware of it.

00:11:07.905 --> 00:11:09.230
We know that [INAUDIBLE]
has implemented it.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.470
And it has been discussed.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.910
But there's nothing to talk
about on future releases,

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.120
unfortunately either way.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.690
NICK BUTCHER: OK, let's get
back to the moderated

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.350
questions and try and
get through them.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.680
So a few of them popped up.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.530
And a few more are coming
in as we speak.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.600
First quick one, slightly off
topic, but where do you get

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.500
the Android heart t-shirt?

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.480
RICH HYNDMAN: This is a beta
bean, sorry, a jellybean.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.630
MATT GAUNT: It's a jellybean.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.130
RICH HYNDMAN: If there were
two little things

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.310
it'd be more obvious.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.230
NICK BUTCHER: And you get one
by having a time machine and

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.530
working on the Android
engineering team.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.920
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, they went
out to everyone who worked on

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.260
the Jelly Bean project
unfortunately.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.070
No, fortunately.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.041
NICK BUTCHER: So you have
those then [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:43.020
unlucky.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.930
RICH HYNDMAN: Or take a photo
of this and get one printed.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.707
Also a good one here from
Andrew Kelly, a

00:11:51.707 --> 00:11:53.420
friend of the show--

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.290
not directly related to Android,
but is there a way to

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.490
change the private channel
graphic that appears in the

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.350
Google Play store.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.810
I don't know about the answer.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.250
STEPHAN LINZNER: I got asked
the same question.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.640
Maybe it was you.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.205
I was just issuing an email to
the guys, and I will get back

00:12:08.205 --> 00:12:10.940
at you with our answer.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.080
We don't know yet if
it's possible.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.320
It's not in the documents.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.688
I looked it up.

00:12:15.688 --> 00:12:17.970
But we will get back
at you for that.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.740
So next up, Mackan from Sweden
asks, how do you open a custom

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.500
file type from a Gmail app?

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.000
If I make an intent filter for
application/octet-stream and a

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.800
file pattern like .mab, it still
tries to open all other

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:37.870
file types as well as my app,
like file.epub, etc.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.656
RICH HYNDMAN: So all other file
types as well as my app?

00:12:40.656 --> 00:12:44.550
MATT GAUNT: I don't
see that last bit.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.840
RICH HYNDMAN: We've had
this question in--

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.840
NICK BUTCHER: So basically
saying if you just say that

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:53.710
your app can handle all
octet-streams, then it will--

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.110
yeah, it's too wide.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.455
It'll open other types, not just
the type that you want.

00:13:00.264 --> 00:13:02.097
Yeah, there is a way
to specify this

00:13:02.097 --> 00:13:04.320
that is quite specific.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.490
Who did a post on
this recently?

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.490
Anyone offhand?

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:07.870
RICH HYNDMAN: No.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:08.900
MATT GAUNT: No.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.290
RICH HYNDMAN: You're right.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.540
There was something
that recently.

00:13:15.748 --> 00:13:16.480
NICK BUTCHER: I can't
remember offhand.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.550
Talk amongst yourselves while
I look for something.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.280
General [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.530
question.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.018
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:24.018 --> 00:13:25.570
RICH HYNDMAN: I'm back to
the Android tshirt.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.650
Just bare with us a second while
we all stare at screens

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:38.920
momentarily.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.690
MATT GAUNT: OK.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:40.700
RICH HYNDMAN: Talk amongst
yourselves.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.780
MATT GAUNT: What I'll do is I'll
go on to other questions

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:49.550
that came in on the Google+
stream from Jens Hohl.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.000
Any suggestions on creating
a floating

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.700
window on top of fragments?

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:57.950
So it depends kind of what
you're trying to do

00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:58.620
it with that one.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.270
But my gut instinct would be
it kind of sounds like you

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.060
want to just have something
in a relative layer or the

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.480
activity layer.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.400
And then, essentially, add the
fragments within that and just

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.220
make sure that the window
element is kind of the last

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.440
thing in the relative layout.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.960
So it's kind of floating
on top.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.870
If you can kind of give us some
more context if that's

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.005
not suitable may
be a good idea.

00:14:21.005 --> 00:14:22.722
But ultimately it kind
of sounds like

00:14:22.722 --> 00:14:24.770
what you want to do.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.698
And a floating window, I'm
assuming you're not trying to

00:14:27.698 --> 00:14:30.215
[INAUDIBLE] inside an app
in an actual window, in

00:14:30.215 --> 00:14:32.530
which case-- no.

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.260
But yeah, that's what I'd do.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.900
[INAUDIBLE] the activity
there.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.700
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.150
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, you could
actually do a download and

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.820
customize it.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.410
That would be another
way of doing it.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.720
RICH HYNDMAN: My initial
reaction would be [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.810
But if you could--

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.645
but if by floating, he means he
wants to be able to move it

00:14:51.645 --> 00:14:53.920
around as well or that
he just wants--

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.070
MATT GAUNT: You could do
an activity with just a

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.490
transparent background and
then have a little chunk.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.230
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.180
You could track touch inputs.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.120
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.564
RICH HYNDMAN: And I make
the window around?

00:15:03.564 --> 00:15:04.400
MATT GAUNT: Different options.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.590
Yeah, what you're trying to
do, I guess would be--

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.540
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, James, if
you have any more details on

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.110
exactly what you're trying to
do, just put them on the

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.640
thread and we'll see them.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.120
And we'll see if we can get
you a more precise answer.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.595
MATT GAUNT: I'm all
about precision.

00:15:16.595 --> 00:15:20.236
Anyone find any more info
on the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:20.236 --> 00:15:21.310
NICK BUTCHER: Nick's deep
in his [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.260
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.860
STEPHAN LINZNER: There is an
answer on state or flow, but

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.520
not exactly what he asked.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.910
So I think we have
to look at some.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:30.666
RICH HYNDMAN: You know,
unfortunately we didn't get a

00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:33.920
chance to read through the
moderator questions before the

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.650
show today due to Chris Bane's
unexpected illness.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.286
So we're slightly
less prepared.

00:15:39.286 --> 00:15:41.240
Guiseppe, could you--

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.900
Yes, Guiseppe I put the link
for that dynamic library

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.115
loading in the Google+
thread for this post.

00:15:46.115 --> 00:15:48.950
So if you go to Google+ where
it says, you'll see my name

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.544
and the link there.

00:15:50.544 --> 00:15:53.380
Not a problem.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.192
Weibe, who's usually inside the
Hangout with us but not

00:15:56.192 --> 00:15:57.620
today, says, good
to see Stephan.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.760
Congratulations.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.600
Thank you.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.520
Wasn't--

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.180
and he says he could
post some code.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.260
Anything else?

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.970
Do we have any other questions
for inside the Hangout?

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:09.900
We're kind of short
on material.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.295
Or anything you just
want to talk about?

00:16:13.295 --> 00:16:17.020
MATT GAUNT: Well, Johan just
had the thing with the

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.020
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.190
now dodgy Android user group.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:21.930
You guys have become--

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.920
STEPHAN LINZNER: And you might
want to talk about it, about

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.082
the Android Puzzles project?

00:16:28.082 --> 00:16:29.332
MATT GAUNT: That as well.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.900
They just signed a bit of
paper which makes them.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.750
JOHAN PELGRIM: Sure.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:35.055
Sure.

00:16:35.055 --> 00:16:36.305
Sure.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.260
Well, first of all,
boys, welcome.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:49.490
Stephan, good to see you
there in London.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.710
We registered as an official
foundation now, and it's good,

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:58.600
so we can now more easily get
some funds from companies.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.935
And we have some great Meetups
lined up, so one is the Code

00:17:01.935 --> 00:17:03.720
Puzzlers and tips and tricks.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.270
We're going to do a couple
of workshops as well.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:10.040
We're going to do something
on design, so a

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.440
couple of good Meetups.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.240
Yeah.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.530
And a little party because
we're, well, an official

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.805
foundation, so parties
are always good.

00:17:21.805 --> 00:17:23.619
RICH HYNDMAN: What is an
official foundation as opposed

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:24.869
to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:28.224 --> 00:17:31.040
JOHAN PELGRIM: Oh, just register
with the Chamber of

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.570
Commerce and tax office.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:36.290
So we've been doing mainly--

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:42.420
how do you say it-- small
Meetups, but some sent their

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:47.520
prices involved and large
catering stuff.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.450
And it's easier to do it
officially, so we can do

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:53.950
better Meetups then.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.396
RICH HYNDMAN: The Dutch
Android users are very

00:17:55.396 --> 00:17:57.876
business [INAUDIBLE] as a
company in its own right.

00:17:57.876 --> 00:17:58.868
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:17:58.868 --> 00:18:00.852
RICH HYNDMAN: Thank you, Nick.

00:18:00.852 --> 00:18:01.590
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.886
Oh.

00:18:02.886 --> 00:18:04.145
NICK BUTCHER: So I found
a good link.

00:18:04.145 --> 00:18:07.442
I'll placed a link to
it in the G+ thread.

00:18:07.442 --> 00:18:10.590
But it's basically saying that
you need to register for both

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.100
your application type and
the octet-stream.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.070
It sounds like you're doing the
right thing by listening

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.270
for application [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.180
stream.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.530
But you're also providing the
host and path pattern as well

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.460
is the bit that we don't
quite specify.

00:18:28.114 --> 00:18:29.780
I'm just trying to reread it.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.790
So isn't there a [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:36.490
like just .map like I think you
actually need to specify.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.570
I think the problem of it you're
not specifying the path

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:38.960
pattern correctly.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.770
I think you need to do .star
and then escape the dot.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.500
And then Map.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.060
So rather than just .map as your
path pattern, it needs to

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:53.230
be dot.star/.map I think
is the problem there.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.520
You're not specify the path
pattern, which is why it's

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.390
appearing [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.230
It's a RegEx thing.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:02.240
I will post a link to
reply [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:10.022 --> 00:19:13.410
RICH HYNDMAN: tuxjsmith or
tuxjssmith, probably

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.490
tuxjsmith, [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:19.120
from the UK has asked a
question about account

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.610
[INAUDIBLE].

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.630
Some users Galaxy S2 and ZTE
that he knows about are unable

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.920
to register with the Google
Cloud Messaging service when

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.260
using his chat app.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.725
Missing Google accounts
firewalls blocking so ports

00:19:31.725 --> 00:19:32.180
have been ruled out.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.875
Can you think of
other reasons?

00:19:33.875 --> 00:19:34.650
That's a tricky one.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.700
Why wouldn't GCM be available
on these devices?

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:43.560
Obviously, not having internet
connection, firewalls--

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.660
missing Google accounts would've
been the first one I

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.910
would have thought of.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.830
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Problem with Play
Store caching maybe on

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.272
the device?

00:19:54.272 --> 00:19:55.940
RICH HYNDMAN: The Google
Cloud Messaging?

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.855
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:19:56.855 --> 00:19:57.815
RICH HYNDMAN: Play services?

00:19:57.815 --> 00:20:01.134
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yes.

00:20:01.134 --> 00:20:02.120
RICH HYNDMAN: I don't know.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:02.780
Usually--

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.426
I mean if people are installing
the applications

00:20:04.426 --> 00:20:07.370
through the Play Store, the Play
Store is up to date, and

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.636
the Play services will
be up to date.

00:20:09.636 --> 00:20:12.070
MATT GAUNT: Could be an issue
with switching from the

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:17.085
previous [INAUDIBLE]
cloud messaging.

00:20:17.085 --> 00:20:19.610
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Maybe the update
that you send doesn't

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:20.860
work for those devices?

00:20:25.485 --> 00:20:29.080
RICH HYNDMAN: Galaxy S2 though
is hugely widespread.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.740
We'd know if there were
big issues on it.

00:20:35.974 --> 00:20:36.485
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.670
I can say we don't have issues
here with Galaxy

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.150
S2 or ZTE with GCM.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.610
RICH HYNDMAN: And it's
just some of them.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.670
I think again, unfortunately in
this case, you're going to

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.550
have to get more info, either
put some more logging inside

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:53.110
your application or find a
reproducible test case.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.650
Get in contact with one of the
people who have told you that

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:57.977
their applications-- the
application's spinning on

00:20:57.977 --> 00:20:58.570
their device.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.915
I have [INAUDIBLE], and
I reach out to my

00:21:00.915 --> 00:21:01.437
users pretty much--

00:21:01.437 --> 00:21:04.570
[PHONE RINGING]

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.160
when I need help debugging
things like this.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.580
It's probably best
just to do that.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.530
See if they can send you any
screenshots of the situation.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:12.850
Maybe you'll notice there's
something wrong with the

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.667
network connectivity
or who knows.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.000
It's a strange one though.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.150
It'll be nice to find
out what it was.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.060
M@rine of Hell is back again.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:25.766
Hi, M@rine of Hell.

00:21:25.766 --> 00:21:28.140
What's the best way to flag
a version with increased

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.920
functionality to separate it
from the commercial version

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.710
with unlimited use
of functionality?

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.800
A version with increased
functionality as opposed to a

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.720
commercial version with
unlimited use of

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.630
functionality, is there
a best practice?

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.338
I don't really want to create
two development branches.

00:21:43.338 --> 00:21:46.040
Did you get that?

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.070
So you have a standard version,
a version with

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.160
increased functionality, and
a commercial versions with

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:51.940
unlimited use?

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.850
MATT GAUNT: So maybe it's a
case you can buy one as a

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.100
pretrial with limited
functionality.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.230
You can pay a bit of money, you
can get one [INAUDIBLE]--

00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.860
RICH HYNDMAN: Increased
functionality?

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:00.343
MATT GAUNT: --[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:00.343 --> 00:22:00.440
something.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.057
RICH HYNDMAN: And then you can
buy it while subscribing to

00:22:02.057 --> 00:22:02.910
the whole thing, the
commercial one?

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.461
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:22:04.461 --> 00:22:07.430
So I guess rather than having
three separate apps to do each

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.670
of those, you just want to sit
there and say, they've got

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.002
this, they've got
this version, or

00:22:11.002 --> 00:22:11.650
they've got this version.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.645
RICH HYNDMAN: And who are you
flagging-- is this the flagger

00:22:13.645 --> 00:22:15.020
to use it in the Play Store?

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.010
Or it's a flagger inside your
code so you can keep one

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.970
source tree?

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.870
But be able to build three
different versions of it.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:26.150
If it's one source tree with
three different versions, I'd

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:28.690
be tempted to use a library
project and put everything

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.730
that is common inside the
library project and then run

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.950
off three separate projects off
the top of it, restricting

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:36.300
the functionality either
into these

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.095
three different baskets--

00:22:39.095 --> 00:22:40.345
buckets.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.350
Again, more information.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.730
Sorry.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:44.546
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:22:44.546 --> 00:22:46.665
Because presumably if you're
going to have three different

00:22:46.665 --> 00:22:48.425
apps in the store, you're
going to have to have

00:22:48.425 --> 00:22:50.496
different packages anyway,
so that [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:50.496 --> 00:22:50.891
doing makes sense.

00:22:50.891 --> 00:22:50.970
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:54.487
NICK BUTCHER: I'd go with a
single app, and different

00:22:54.487 --> 00:22:55.850
in-app packages to unlock
some features.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:56.335
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:22:56.335 --> 00:22:57.550
NICK BUTCHER: Single app,
single code-base.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.080
RICH HYNDMAN: Or maybe
subscription to--

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:58.760
NICK BUTCHER: -- make it--

00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.185
RICH HYNDMAN: --the
commercial one.

00:22:59.185 --> 00:23:00.782
NICK BUTCHER: --make your
life a lot easier.

00:23:00.782 --> 00:23:01.610
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.270
NICK BUTCHER: If that's possible
with your setup.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.066
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:23:03.066 --> 00:23:05.095
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:23:05.095 --> 00:23:06.345
Hopefully, that did answer
your question.

00:23:09.655 --> 00:23:11.935
How is the best way to become
an Android developer?

00:23:11.935 --> 00:23:14.350
How is the best way--
hey-- hey, there--

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.410
end the chat there.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.850
How is the best way to become
an Android developer?

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.070
Go to developers.android.com
is definitely

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.210
your best way to start.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.470
Download the bundled STK.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:26.400
It will install the Android
STK and the clips for you.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.960
And then we have a whole bunch
of tutorials, right from

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.300
beginner stuff through to
advanced topics, so still

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.190
having a look through
the tutorials.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.063
If you're already a Java
developer, you'll find it

00:23:35.063 --> 00:23:35.800
ought to be pretty easy.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.480
You just have to get the
UI and sorted out.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.340
And--

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:41.805
yeah.

00:23:41.805 --> 00:23:44.150
NICK BUTCHER: And then you see
if there's like an Android

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:48.503
developers Meetup or Google
Technology User Group or

00:23:48.503 --> 00:23:49.450
something like this
in your area.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.430
So if you see Google developers
groups in your area

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.020
and get to meet some
like-minded

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.520
people that will help.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.600
RICH HYNDMAN: There's also
tons of YouTube videos on

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.330
becoming an Android
developers.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.720
One guy do a series of 100
YouTube videos which takes you

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.480
right from of the
eclipse to being

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.695
supposedly an expert developer.

00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:06.280
NICK BUTCHER: Wow.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:06.990
RICH HYNDMAN: And there
lots of other--

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.540
NICK BUTCHER: Really.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.320
RICH HYNDMAN: --resources
online.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.470
Check out the activity life
cycle and then everything else

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.630
that makes up an Android app
in terms of services--

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:17.615
STEPHAN LINZNER: And we have
great training courses

00:24:17.615 --> 00:24:18.010
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:18.690
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:19.320
You could do a training
course.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.360
STEPHAN LINZNER: And look
at the samples.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.182
The samples are very good.

00:24:23.182 --> 00:24:25.020
MATT GAUNT: Read his book is
also a great ones to get

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.640
started on.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.570
I forgot what it's called.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.103
But, yeah, read Jeremiah's
book.

00:24:29.103 --> 00:24:29.476
It's a good one.

00:24:29.476 --> 00:24:31.110
RICH HYNDMAN: But as is always
the way, just get stuck in.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.600
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.575
RICH HYNDMAN: Make your
first Android app--

00:24:32.575 --> 00:24:33.090
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.400
RICH HYNDMAN: --play with it,
get excited about it, run

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.610
around with it on your phone.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.830
That's the best thing about a
program for mobile devices,

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.050
right, you have it on
you all the time.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.160
You can show it off.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.020
People suggest things.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:41.510
You go home.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.778
You try them out, and then you
just have good times with it,

00:24:43.778 --> 00:24:44.930
and you can't--

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:45.920
you can't stop.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.130
AUDIENCE: I have to disagree.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:48.090
You'll see that doesn't
look cool.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.296
That looks awful.

00:24:50.296 --> 00:24:52.756
STEPHAN LINZNER: What
did he say?

00:24:52.756 --> 00:24:57.640
AUDIENCE: I think it's one of
the nicest features you can

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.020
have on the device.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.170
MATT GAUNT: Can you
show us-- now that

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:01.420
you're full screen shows?

00:25:03.618 --> 00:25:05.490
Say something [INAUDIBLE]
to us.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.900
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Hey,
can you see this?

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.930
Can you see me now?

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:10.840
OK.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:15.290
Say you're on the screen and you
want to go through all the

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.050
applications.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.750
Instead of pressing the Home
button and then trying to get

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.820
to the drawer and stuff, you
just swipe to the left, and

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.035
you have all the apps,
all the start apps.

00:25:26.035 --> 00:25:27.560
RICH HYNDMAN: Is this
an edge gesture?

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.340
NICK BUTCHER: What about all
these apps that you use the

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.410
Bezel gesture opening the
[INAUDIBLE] trails and things?

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:34.610
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No.

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:39.050
It's nice because you can have
recently used apps also

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.010
available here and
also start apps.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:41.350
So if you want--

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:42.950
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, but if--

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.190
within an application, something
like, say, Spotify,

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:49.132
which has to be swiped from the
edge to open up the tray,

00:25:49.132 --> 00:25:52.359
what happened?

00:25:52.359 --> 00:25:53.040
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Just a second.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.591
RICH HYNDMAN: Is the app
only inactive when the

00:25:54.591 --> 00:25:54.772
launch is on script?

00:25:54.772 --> 00:25:54.937
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:25:54.937 --> 00:25:56.160
Yeah-- no, no, no.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.390
It's also active like
when I'm on Chrome.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:00.090
MATT GAUNT: Oh, yeah.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:00.520
So if I wanted--

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.780
RICH HYNDMAN: So if I want to
go to the previous tab on

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:03.643
Chrome, and I do the
edge swipe--

00:26:03.643 --> 00:26:04.060
MATT GAUNT: Oh, man.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.675
RICH HYNDMAN: --now I can't get
to the previous tab now?

00:26:05.675 --> 00:26:06.860
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No, you can.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.320
You can.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.220
MATT GAUNT: How?

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.470
YOSSI ELKRIEF: I'll
open some tabs.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:14.290
Here, some tabs are open.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:15.875
I don't know if you
can see them.

00:26:15.875 --> 00:26:17.262
Just a second.

00:26:17.262 --> 00:26:19.060
RICH HYNDMAN: You have on
the phone, not on the 7.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.170
On the 7 you've got
tabs at top.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:20.880
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.960
RICH HYNDMAN: Any application
that interfere with the

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.927
behavior of other applications
can get barred

00:26:23.927 --> 00:26:24.316
from the Play store.

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:25.288
I'm just saying.

00:26:25.288 --> 00:26:27.840
YOSSI ELKRIEF: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.990
I think it's a cool app.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:30.217
RICH HYNDMAN: It is cool.

00:26:30.217 --> 00:26:30.382
The [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:30.382 --> 00:26:30.465
functionality.

00:26:30.465 --> 00:26:32.702
MATT GAUNT: Each to their own.

00:26:32.702 --> 00:26:34.076
RICH HYNDMAN: That's the great
thing about Android, right,

00:26:34.076 --> 00:26:36.370
just the functionality you want
on your device you can

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:37.260
make it fit on there.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.860
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No,
I didn't do it.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.320
It's a friend of mine on XDA.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.500
I'll send you the link to the
chat or to the G thread, G+

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.740
thread, to people to see.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.430
I think it's nice.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:54.100
It's just to see how you can
learn enable all the cool

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.700
gestures and--

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.590
RICH HYNDMAN: Well, we're late
in our new 30-minute format.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:58.436
We are down to the
last two minutes.

00:26:58.436 --> 00:26:58.860
So we don't have--

00:26:58.860 --> 00:26:59.980
MATT GAUNT: There's one last
question from the moderator.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.010
It should be a quick
and easy one.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.800
Is there a way to use other
languages such as Python as

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.570
native development languages
on Android,

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.538
asked Burhan from Kuwait.

00:27:09.538 --> 00:27:11.270
And the answer is no.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.900
It can only supported route
for native development is

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.520
through Java or with the MPK.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.450
There are applications out there
such as the scripting

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:22.410
layer for Android and so on,
which you'll run as an

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.920
interpretative language
on your device.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.940
There may be some scripting in
other languages, but they

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.820
aren't any routes for having
it compiled native.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.410
There are approaches out there
I think like Mono and stuff

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.400
that which were trying to
be cross-compilation.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.910
Well, I think where
it's actually--

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.270
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:41.700
I think it will just take C#
and then compile it down to

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.432
[INAUDIBLE] code.

00:27:42.432 --> 00:27:44.222
RICH HYNDMAN: MishaS is saying,
can you please,

00:27:44.222 --> 00:27:45.180
please, please answer
my question.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:45.910
I've got a class in
a few minutes.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:46.250
I need to go.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.420
But--

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.150
MATT GAUNT: Maybe he--

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:47.910
RICH HYNDMAN: --answer
his question anyway.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:50.760
MATT GAUNT: -- he wanted to do
something with embedded text

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.346
to speech, but he wanted to
do the offline stuff.

00:27:54.346 --> 00:27:56.660
You know before you always had
to connect to the server, and

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.682
now there's the ability to do
it on the Android device

00:27:59.682 --> 00:28:01.690
itself without having
to go online.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:02.135
STEPHAN LINZNER: Speech
recognition.

00:28:02.135 --> 00:28:02.610
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.850
Text-to-speech thing.

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:04.550
OK.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.220
NICK BUTCHER: Then what
about text to speech?

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.690
MATT GAUNT: That would
be the voice

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:10.780
recognition because you'd--

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.930
STEPHAN LINZNER: Text to
speech is recognizing.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.123
MATT GAUNT: Oh, yeah,
going the other way.

00:28:14.123 --> 00:28:14.540
STEPHAN LINZNER: Yeah.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.450
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.410
So that's the reason why
I've confused it.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:21.750
And it sounds like you've
confused it as well.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.430
So that might be it.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.930
RICH HYNDMAN: I want to
use offline text to

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:27.248
speech in my app.

00:28:27.248 --> 00:28:28.116
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:28:28.116 --> 00:28:29.110
Embedded text to speech.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.500
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.566
And you try that and
didn't work.

00:28:33.566 --> 00:28:35.030
It should've worked.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.100
If we have a bit more detail.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.550
When did you see the question?

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:38.980
MATT GAUNT: It's further up.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.210
So I'll read it out.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.460
Ohh, went [INAUDIBLE]--

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.440
RICH HYNDMAN: Where is it?
