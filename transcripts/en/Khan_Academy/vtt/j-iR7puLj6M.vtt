00:00:01.026 --> 00:00:02.163
- [Voiceover] Hi, my name's Willy.

00:00:02.163 --> 00:00:04.578
I'm the Khan Academy
Electrical Engineering

00:00:04.578 --> 00:00:06.110
Content Fellow,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.386
and we got a Tweet in from Jane,

00:00:08.386 --> 00:00:10.708
and Jane asks, "Could you take a video,

00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:12.658
"could you make a video
on solving complex circuit

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:14.005
"problems in physics?

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.790
"For example, something
similar to this question."

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.786
So, Jane sent us a circuit here,

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.760
here it is over here,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.014
and it's an interesting looking circuit.

00:00:23.014 --> 00:00:24.895
We're going to take a
shot at solving it here,

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:27.217
and I'll tell you how
I would approach this.

00:00:27.217 --> 00:00:28.633
Let's take a quick look at it.

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:32.093
We have two batteries in
it, which is a bit unusual.

00:00:32.093 --> 00:00:33.857
There's two resistors here.

00:00:33.857 --> 00:00:35.668
They happen to have the same value,

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.433
1.4 ohms.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.615
There's a third resistor connected up,

00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:41.659
and the question we're
being asked is to find,

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.677
what's the current in
this resistor right here?

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:47.603
So that's what we're looking for.

00:00:47.603 --> 00:00:49.530
So the way I approach
these kind of questions,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.711
first, I sort of just live with
this schematic a little bit.

00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:55.590
I look at it and see if I
can imagine how the currents

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.121
are flowing and what's going on,

00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:01.256
and then a really good
way to do that is to,

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:03.415
I'm going to draw this schematic myself,

00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:05.040
I'm just going to draw it
over and let me own hand

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.477
kind of learn this circuit as we go,

00:01:08.477 --> 00:01:09.800
so I'll draw the battery.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.633
Here's the two batteries.

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:16.459
And I see that they're connected together.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:19.575
Okay, that's interesting.

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:23.732
Each battery then goes to

00:01:23.732 --> 00:01:25.682
a resistor,

00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:28.538
this goes to a resistor,

00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:30.465
and those are connected, let me check,

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.950
yeah, those are connected together,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.408
and then they go to a
third resistor like this.

00:01:37.408 --> 00:01:40.333
And now if you notice what I'm
doing is I'm taking all the

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:43.073
funny corners and dots and
curves and things like that

00:01:43.073 --> 00:01:45.209
and I'm just going to
draw a square schematic

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.160
that I can understand.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.855
Now, I'm going to label
it just to make sure

00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:50.317
I got everything right,

00:01:50.317 --> 00:01:53.568
so, this is 11 volts.

00:01:53.568 --> 00:01:54.891
And I know from the battery symbol,

00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:58.072
that the short line is the minus side,

00:01:58.072 --> 00:02:00.441
and the long line is the plus side,

00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:02.948
and same here.

00:02:02.948 --> 00:02:07.244
So, these two batteries
are hooked up exactly

00:02:07.244 --> 00:02:08.753
the same way in the same direction.

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:12.166
This one's also 11 volts.

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.815
And that's going to prove
out to be interesting.

00:02:13.815 --> 00:02:16.021
We'll call this one R1

00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:19.666
because the problem had i1 here.

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:22.963
We'll call this one R2.

00:02:22.963 --> 00:02:27.963
And we'll call this one R3, of course.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.974
And the current that we're
looking for is this current

00:02:30.974 --> 00:02:33.342
right here, what's that?

00:02:33.342 --> 00:02:36.012
Okay.

00:02:36.012 --> 00:02:37.800
So, before I start doing
mathematics on this,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.679
what I'm going to do is
see if I can simplify

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:44.603
the diagram, and what
I'm going to notice here,

00:02:44.603 --> 00:02:48.783
this is kind of a trick
that was done here.

00:02:48.783 --> 00:02:51.012
Let's look at these batteries.

00:02:51.012 --> 00:02:53.473
These two ends of the
batteries are connected

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:56.422
together, so they are at the same voltage.

00:02:56.422 --> 00:02:57.978
We don't know what that
voltage is, but we know

00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:02.227
it's the same, and we know
that they're both 11 volts

00:03:02.227 --> 00:03:04.432
and that means that this node here,

00:03:04.432 --> 00:03:08.890
this node here, and this node here

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.232
are at exactly the same voltage

00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:16.831
with respect to this node here.

00:03:16.831 --> 00:03:20.709
This one is 11 volts lower in voltage

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.376
and this node is 11
volts lower in voltage,

00:03:25.376 --> 00:03:27.187
so what I'm going to imagine in my head,

00:03:27.187 --> 00:03:29.973
if I connected a wire
between these two nodes,

00:03:29.973 --> 00:03:31.529
this end would be at 11 volts,

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:33.549
this end would be at 11 volts.

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.451
So no current would
flow through that wire.

00:03:36.451 --> 00:03:38.332
It would have no effect on the circuit.

00:03:38.332 --> 00:03:38.959
It wouldn't,

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.560
there would be no current
like diverted from here

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.535
over to here.

00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:45.367
I'm actually going to draw that wire in.

00:03:45.367 --> 00:03:48.084
I'm going to draw that wire in,

00:03:48.084 --> 00:03:50.778
and I didn't change the
circuit when I did that.

00:03:50.778 --> 00:03:53.262
The same current goes
through this wire as before

00:03:53.262 --> 00:03:55.212
because zero goes this way,

00:03:55.212 --> 00:03:56.907
the same current goes through this wire

00:03:56.907 --> 00:03:58.858
because zero current goes this way

00:03:58.858 --> 00:04:00.646
because I know they're both at 11,

00:04:00.646 --> 00:04:04.430
at the same potential above here.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.938
Right, so this is a good
time to redraw this again.

00:04:06.938 --> 00:04:10.351
If you look here, I have two batteries

00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:11.512
that are hooked up,

00:04:11.512 --> 00:04:12.743
their inputs,

00:04:12.743 --> 00:04:14.368
their positive side is hooked up together

00:04:14.368 --> 00:04:16.435
and their negative side
is hooked up together,

00:04:16.435 --> 00:04:20.219
so they're actually just
acting like one, big battery,

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:21.218
so let me draw that.

00:04:21.218 --> 00:04:26.218
I'm going to draw the circuit
again so it looks like this.

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:30.895
Here's my combined big battery.

00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:35.236
And it goes to...

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.553
Relabel these again so
we don't get mixed up.

00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:56.905
Okay.

00:04:56.905 --> 00:04:59.459
This is R1.

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:02.269
This is R2.

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:06.170
And this is R3.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.490
So this circuit looks a little simpler,

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.419
and I'm gonna look at it again,

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.323
see if I can do any more simplification,

00:05:12.323 --> 00:05:14.877
so what I recognize right
here, right in this area right

00:05:14.877 --> 00:05:18.476
here, R1 and R2 are in parallel.

00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:22.144
They have the same voltage
on their terminals.

00:05:22.144 --> 00:05:24.373
That means they're in parallel.

00:05:24.373 --> 00:05:26.579
I know how to simplify parallel resistors.

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:29.528
We'll just use the
parallel resistor equation

00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:31.803
that I have in my head,

00:05:31.803 --> 00:05:33.405
and that looks like this,

00:05:33.405 --> 00:05:37.306
let's go to this color here.

00:05:37.306 --> 00:05:41.509
Okay, so parallel resistors, R1

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.993
in parallel with R2.

00:05:43.993 --> 00:05:46.687
I made up this symbol, two vertical lines,

00:05:46.687 --> 00:05:48.219
that means they're in parallel,

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:51.656
and the formula for two
parallel resistors is R1

00:05:51.656 --> 00:05:54.233
times R2,

00:05:54.233 --> 00:05:59.233
over R1 plus R2.

00:06:00.014 --> 00:06:01.013
Now I'll plug in the values.

00:06:01.013 --> 00:06:03.195
We know that R1 and R2
are actually, if we look

00:06:03.195 --> 00:06:04.798
over here at our schematic,

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:06.516
they're the same value,

00:06:06.516 --> 00:06:10.022
and that has a special thing
when in parallel resistors

00:06:10.022 --> 00:06:13.923
so it's actually R R

00:06:13.923 --> 00:06:17.888
over 2R.

00:06:18.218 --> 00:06:20.447
Because those resistors are the same.

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:23.675
And you can see I can cancel
that and I can cancel that

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.114
and two parallel resistors,

00:06:25.114 --> 00:06:27.181
if the resistors are equal,

00:06:27.181 --> 00:06:29.990
is equal to half the resistance.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.451
And let's plug in the real values,

00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:37.451
1.4 ohms over 2

00:06:37.583 --> 00:06:40.346
equals

00:06:40.346 --> 00:06:42.877
0.7 ohms.

00:06:42.877 --> 00:06:46.058
That's the equivalent resistance
of these two resistors

00:06:46.058 --> 00:06:49.024
in parallel.

00:06:50.168 --> 00:06:52.188
So this is a good time to
redraw this circuit again.

00:06:52.188 --> 00:06:53.604
Let's do it again.

00:06:53.604 --> 00:06:56.965
Here's our battery.

00:06:57.133 --> 00:07:00.477
This time I'm going to draw
the equivalent resistance.

00:07:00.477 --> 00:07:01.986
Then we have R3,

00:07:01.986 --> 00:07:04.656
we'll put in R3 down here.

00:07:04.656 --> 00:07:06.374
Nothing's changed there,

00:07:06.374 --> 00:07:11.157
and that goes back to our voltage source.

00:07:11.157 --> 00:07:13.108
Again, do some labels,

00:07:13.108 --> 00:07:18.108
so this is R1 in parallel with R2.

00:07:19.232 --> 00:07:22.070
This is R3.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.042
This is the current we
want to know, right there,

00:07:25.042 --> 00:07:28.014
and this is 11 volts,

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:32.124
that's the plus side and
that's the minus side.

00:07:32.124 --> 00:07:34.191
Okay, we got a pretty
simple circuit here now.

00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:35.375
Let's fill, well,

00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:36.373
let me fill in the values

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:38.486
for

00:07:38.486 --> 00:07:40.344
our resistor here.

00:07:40.344 --> 00:07:44.988
R1 in parallel with R2 is 0.7 ohms.

00:07:44.988 --> 00:07:47.426
R3, let's go look that
up, remind ourselves,

00:07:47.426 --> 00:07:50.810
2.7 ohms.

00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:54.298
Now I can almost do this in my head.

00:07:54.298 --> 00:07:57.479
These are both now just
two series resistors.

00:07:57.479 --> 00:07:59.871
So, Ohm's law equals

00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:02.541
V equals iR.

00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:05.165
This is the form of it I always memorized.

00:08:05.165 --> 00:08:07.185
If I want to know i, I'm
solving for a current,

00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:12.079
so i equals V over R.

00:08:12.572 --> 00:08:14.708
We can start filling in values,

00:08:14.708 --> 00:08:19.708
i equals 11 volts over,

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:20.629
what's the resistance?

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:22.672
It's the series resistance here,

00:08:22.672 --> 00:08:26.642
so it's the sum of these two resistors,

00:08:26.642 --> 00:08:29.522
which is 0.7

00:08:29.522 --> 00:08:33.371
plus 2.7.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.949
If I work that out,

00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:43.949
it equals 11 over 3.4

00:08:45.798 --> 00:08:47.470
equals,

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.724
okay let me actually work that out.

00:08:48.724 --> 00:08:51.812
It's 11 volts

00:08:51.812 --> 00:08:56.812
divided by 3.4 ohms

00:08:57.292 --> 00:08:59.404
and that equals

00:08:59.404 --> 00:09:04.404
3.23 blah-blah-blah

00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:08.135
something something something.

00:09:08.135 --> 00:09:11.594
And that will be in Amps.

00:09:11.594 --> 00:09:15.031
So, this right here is our answer.

00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:18.096
Right there.

00:09:18.096 --> 00:09:19.860
So find the current i,

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.860
i equals 3.2 Amperes.

00:09:27.128 --> 00:09:28.985
And now I'm going to check,

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.307
actually can check to
see if that's the answer.

00:09:31.307 --> 00:09:33.536
Let's see what Jane sent.

00:09:33.536 --> 00:09:35.046
She actually sent in the answer.

00:09:35.046 --> 00:09:37.368
So thank you, Jane, for doing that,

00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:40.618
and, there it is.

00:09:40.618 --> 00:09:42.336
So that's it.

00:09:42.336 --> 00:09:43.840
Thank you very much for listening.
