00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
 We have the phrase 17 whole and 4/9 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.450
 minus 12 whole and 2/3. 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.830
 I recommend that you stop the video 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.905
 and try to solve it yourself. 

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:11.660
 Let's examine it. 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.655
 What I will do is write 

00:00:13.655 --> 00:00:15.095
 these mixed numbers in another way. 

00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:19.675
 I will write this as a 17 whole and 4/9 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.695
 minus 12 whole and 2/3. 

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:24.960
 I will write 12 exactly under 17, 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.810
 and 2/3 under 4/9. 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.555
 Let's make it quite clear that we're getting 12 whole and 2/3 

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:32.685
 from 17 and 4/9. 

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:33.985
 The first thing we want to do, 

00:00:33.985 --> 00:00:35.385
 is to look at the fragments 

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:37.950
 and start subtracting from them, 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.555
 but see, they have different denominators. 

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:41.850
 We have 9 and 3. 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.150
 Then the first thing we want to do, 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.950
 is to get a common denominator, 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.690
 and the good common denominator will be the smallest number, 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.885
 which is shared at 9 and 3 at the same time. 

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:50.980
 What is this number? 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.690
 To find him, 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.315
 I prefer to start with the bigger number, 9. 

00:00:55.315 --> 00:00:57.595
 I say: is it divided into 3? 

00:00:57.595 --> 00:00:59.215
 Well yes, divide by 3. 

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:00.715
 Share the other denominator, 

00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:02.755
 so that's actually the smallest common fold. 

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:04.975
 If it was not, I would continue to look for larger numbers, 

00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:05.990
 which are multiples of 9. 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.730
 I was going to try with 18, then with 27, 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.155
 and continue until I find a number, 

00:01:10.155 --> 00:01:12.125
 which is divided into 3. 

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:13.135
 But I did not have to do it, 

00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:15.090
 because 9 is divided into 3. 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.415
 I can write these fragments 

00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:19.830
 with denominator 9. 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.110
 The top is recorded with a denominator 9, 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.640
 so I can transcribe it. 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.040
 17 whole and 4/9. 

00:01:27.825 --> 00:01:30.555
 And the lower number can be written as 12 

00:01:30.555 --> 00:01:33.510
 and some number on 9. 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.585
 How many nine are 2/3? 

00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:39.875
 To receive ninth from third, 

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:44.150
 I have to multiply by 3, so I multiply by 3, 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.955
 but I have to multiply the numerator too. 

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:49.775
 2 by 3 is 6. 

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:52.790
 2/3 is equal to 6/9. 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.090
 Now I can try to pull them out. 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.695
 Even here when I try to pull out, 

00:01:57.695 --> 00:01:59.630
 I get a bigger liver, 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.325
 which I try to pull out of a smaller one. 

00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:04.325
 I have 4/9 minus 6/9. 

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:05.495
 What can I do? 

00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:08.330
 The answer is that I can regroup. 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.095
 I can take a whole of 17. 

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:13.790
 Let me do it. 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.325
 If I take one unit of 17, 

00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:19.520
 it will become 16, 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.710
 and this unit I just took, 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.660
 you can say that this is the place of the integer, 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.325
 I can add it to this liver. 

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:28.785
 One unit will be 9/9. 

00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:30.750
 I just regrouped. 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.150
 I took 9/9 from 17. 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.895
 9/9 is 1 and when I take 9/9 out of 17, I'm left with 16, 

00:02:36.895 --> 00:02:38.690
 then regroup them and add that 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.450
 in the place of the fractures - you can accept it and so. 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.760
 How much is 4/9 plus 9/9? 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.220
 This will be equal to 13/9. 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.590
 This is here 13/9. 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.285
 13/9. 

00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:53.980
 It's a strange way to record it, but 17 whole and 4/9 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.690
 is the same as 16 whole and 13/9, because, pay attention, 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.295
 that it is bigger than the other one. 

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:02.855
 This is the same as 1 whole and 4/9. 

00:03:02.855 --> 00:03:06.310
 1 and 4/9 plus 16 will be 17 and 4/9. 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.930
 Why did I do all this? 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.425
 13/9 is greater than 6/9, so I can get them out. 

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:16.850
 How much is 13/9 minus 6/9? 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.415
 13 of something, in this case 9 

00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:23.780
 minus 6 of the same thing will be equal to 7/9. 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.015
 7, I will write it in neutral color. 

00:03:27.015 --> 00:03:30.695
 This will be equal to 7/9. 

00:03:30.695 --> 00:03:34.325
 13/9 minus 6/9 is 7/9. 

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:35.955
 Then I can look at the whole parts. 

00:03:35.955 --> 00:03:37.785
 Here I am 16. 

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:41.295
 16 minus 12 is 4, and ready. 

00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:44.395
 17 whole and 4/9 minus 12 and 2/3 

00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:49.395
 is equal to 4 and 7/9.
