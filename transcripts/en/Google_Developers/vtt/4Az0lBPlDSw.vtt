00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.570
NIKOLAI MUNK PETERSEN: The
sky's the limit, they said.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.250
They said your imagination
is the only thing holding you

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.510
back.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.070
We discovered that there's
more to this story,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.520
and I'm going to share
with you what we found.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.840
My name is Nikolai,
and when you're

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.270
building augmented
reality experiences that

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.470
allow users to move
around, you have

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.180
to think about real
hard physical limits.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.370
Let's say you have designed
an icy virtual world

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.450
for a much anticipated
massively multiplayer online

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.310
roleplaying game.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.900
You have only had time to create
one small ice floe and one

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.470
main character, the penguin.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.540
Your user lives the penguin life
on the ice with their friends,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.680
but is growing
increasingly frustrated

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.810
by the ever-growing
number of penguins.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.270
The user therefore
decides to jump off

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.540
the ice to explore new
inhabitable worlds.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.310
What happens next?

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.020
The user's room is too small
to fit any more ice floes.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.560
The icy world doesn't scale.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.930
What should the user do?

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.900
In this episode, we
will talk about how

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.890
to handle physical
boundaries that

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.490
obstruct the virtual space.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.630
A very simple but
powerful method

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.240
to design around
any kind of boundary

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.160
is to put an invisible
fence around the user.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.080
We built a small example
to show you how that works.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.750
The fence serves two purposes.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.030
First, it tells the user
where the virtual world ends.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.840
Second, it helps the user
not walk into physical walls.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.230
Yet it is a fence, and
it does impose rather

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.990
direct and hard constraints.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.140
So let's look at some
other gentler ways

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.270
to handle physical boundaries.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.340
In mobile devices that
promote physical movement,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.330
such as Project Tango, how
do you take into account

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.730
the hard fact of life
that is full of doors

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.050
and walls and furniture
that you can bump into,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.840
and how do you leverage
this hard reality

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.000
to make stunning
experiences that

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.120
deliver on the promise
of seamlessly blending

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.530
virtual and physical worlds?

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.980
If the virtual world
has a fixed size,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.550
it may or may not fit
within the physical space.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.820
An ice floe may
fit in your room,

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.030
while a glacier probably won't.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.840
As a developer,
it's important to be

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.600
proactive about
these challenges.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.830
Using a slightly more advanced
version of the fence concept,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.180
you could let the
user define the space

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.790
by marking its corners.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.580
In this example, we put
out four markers to fence

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.360
off the play space.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.660
The system automatically
fits the virtual world

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.860
within the available space.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.470
As an alternative, you can let
the user scan the surroundings

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.150
using the depth
perception system

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.290
in Project Tango at the
beginning of the experience.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.080
The system can use this 3D
information of the surroundings

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.900
to calculate a bounded box
and build the virtual world

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.710
within it.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.750
If you do not manage to
fit the virtual world

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.260
into the physical,
the user may not

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.980
be able to get to all the
places within the world.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.800
For these situations,
the user can

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.380
benefit from either the
clutch or teleportation modes.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.740
In clutch mode, the user pauses
motion tracking for a moment.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.710
This effectively pins
the virtual world

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.200
to the Project Tango device so
the user can rotate it, like

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.550
here, or move it with them.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.080
If the user is facing
a physical wall

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.490
with the virtual world
in front of them,

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.180
the clutch can be used to rotate
the virtual world around 180

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.280
degrees, and by doing
so they can get places

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.580
that were out of reach before.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.250
The clutch control is powerful,
but can be a bit complicated

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.840
for users, so instead you may
want to try teleportation.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.060
Teleportation petition allows
the user to jump places.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.410
These can be pre-defined
destinations, or in this case,

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.710
wherever the user
taps on the screen.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.920
If the virtual
world is large, it

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.840
may just be too much
work to walk places.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.770
Teleportation is a great way
to make it easier to get around

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.000
faster and with less effort.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Since the boundary between
the experience on screen

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.140
and in real life are
starting to blend,

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.280
it is important to
think about how to do so

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.820
without confusing the user.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.260
Physical boundaries
can prevent the user

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.590
from entering virtual places.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.400
Virtual boundaries
can cause the user

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.980
to accidentally exit
virtual places, which

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.110
we will cover in the designing
for virtual boundaries episode.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.160
To create phenomenal
experiences,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.020
you must be mindful of
the boundaries that exist

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.500
and handle them seamlessly.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.110
