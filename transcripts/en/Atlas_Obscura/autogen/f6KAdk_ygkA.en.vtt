and cherubs and lambs so you would come
 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.210
and cherubs and lambs so you would come
into a cemetery like this there was a

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220
into a cemetery like this there was a
 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.740
into a cemetery like this there was a
reporter who did in the late 19th

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750
reporter who did in the late 19th
 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.560
reporter who did in the late 19th
century and was horrified by all of the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570
century and was horrified by all of the
 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.440
century and was horrified by all of the
three-foot-tall

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450
three-foot-tall
 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.720
three-foot-tall
crucified tortured Christ's in the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730
crucified tortured Christ's in the
 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.070
crucified tortured Christ's in the
cemetery and he said that this was an

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080
cemetery and he said that this was an
 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.890
cemetery and he said that this was an
aesthetic failure of the cemetery so it

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900
aesthetic failure of the cemetery so it
 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.590
aesthetic failure of the cemetery so it
was just a very different vibe at a

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600
was just a very different vibe at a
 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.630
was just a very different vibe at a
Catholic cemetery than around somewhere

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640
Catholic cemetery than around somewhere
 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.120
Catholic cemetery than around somewhere

maybe not wouldn't be your first choice

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760
maybe not wouldn't be your first choice
 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.860
maybe not wouldn't be your first choice
so it's German Catholic that was a

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870
so it's German Catholic that was a
 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.550
so it's German Catholic that was a
little bit different

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560
little bit different
 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.640
little bit different
what about customs right so since it was

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650
what about customs right so since it was
 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.010
what about customs right so since it was
German they would have German verses

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020
German they would have German verses
 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.920
German they would have German verses
that were spelled out on the monuments

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930
that were spelled out on the monuments
 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.750
that were spelled out on the monuments
my understanding is that when children

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760
my understanding is that when children
 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.560
my understanding is that when children
died the parents would come and leave

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570
died the parents would come and leave
 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.620
died the parents would come and leave
playthings and leave toys at the graves

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630
playthings and leave toys at the graves
 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.360
playthings and leave toys at the graves
which is something that parents still do

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370
which is something that parents still do
 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.760
which is something that parents still do
today in cemeteries if they allow it and

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770
today in cemeteries if they allow it and
 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.010
today in cemeteries if they allow it and
it's custom that I was really fascinated
