00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.575
The answer is the second version is better and the reason for this is what would

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:09.146
happen if we defined a PandaBear class? And suppose out PandaBear can climb a

00:00:09.146 --> 00:00:13.173
tree. So, we'll have a climb_tree attribute. With the first version, the

00:00:13.173 --> 00:00:16.955
PandaBear will go hungry, even though it's able to climb a tree, because we

00:00:16.955 --> 00:00:21.042
didn't know about PandaBears when we wrote this chase method, we only knew about

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:25.357
BlackBears and GrizzlyBears. With the second version, the PandaBear will be able

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:29.417
to climb the tree just like the BlackBear because its got a climb_tree method.

00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:32.531
When we wrote the bear chase method, we didn't need to know about the PandaBear,

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:35.305
we just need to know what it means a climb a tree and what it means to knock

00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:39.278
down a tree. I don't have a PandaBear but I do have a duck, quack, quack, and

00:00:39.278 --> 00:00:42.209
this is what's known as duck typing, quack, quack.
