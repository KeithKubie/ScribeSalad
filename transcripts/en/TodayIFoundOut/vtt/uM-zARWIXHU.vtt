00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.420
One Moon “day” is approximately 29 1/2
Earth days.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.310
This rotation coincides with its orbit around
the Earth so that we only see about 59% of

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.510
the surface of the Moon from Earth.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.710
When the Moon first formed, its rotational
speed and orbit were very different than they

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.710
are now.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.760
Over time, the Earth’s gravitational field
gradually slowed the Moon’s rotation until

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.300
the orbital period and the rotational speed
stabilized, making one side of the Moon always

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.430
face the Earth.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.539
How does this work?

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.580
Simply put -tidal friction.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.030
For a slightly less simple explanation, we’ll
have to put our science caps on.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.390
But stick with us- it’s fascinating.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.539
I promise.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.000
To start, think of how the Moon causes major
tides on the Earth due to the Moon pulling

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.640
at the Earth via its gravitational field.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.220
The Earth has this same effect on the Moon
and, being 81.28 times more massive, the effect

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.790
is much more powerful.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.760
So, as the mass of the Moon is attempting
to go one way (in a straight line), the Earth

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.160
is simultaneously pulling it another way (towards
the Earth).

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.490
Further, the effect of the Earth’s gravitational
field is stronger on the side of the Moon

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.990
closest to the Earth than on the far side
(and the same with the Moon’s gravitational

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.030
field’s effect on the different parts of
the surface of the Earth).

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.829
This combination essentially stretches the
Earth and Moon, creating tidal bulges on both

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.170
celestial bodies.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.680
This occurs on both sides of each, with the
bulge on the sides closest together from gravity

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.009
and on the sides farthest away from inertia.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.320
In the latter case, the matter is less affected
by the gravitational force with inertia dominating

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.380
in this instance.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.299
To put it another way, the matter is trying
to move in a straight line away from the Earth

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.830
and the gravitational forces here aren’t
as strongly able to overcome this, which creates

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.210
the bulge on that side.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.880
So back before the Moon was tidally locked
with the Earth, the bulge on the side of the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.670
Moon nearest to Earth ended up slightly leading
thanks to friction and the fact that the Moon

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.340
rotated faster than its orbital period around
the Earth.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.319
So with this slightly leading bulge being
offset from the line of gravitational pull

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.390
between the Moon and Earth, this created a
torque, which overtime resulted in the Moon’s

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.800
rotation slowing until it became tidally locked
with the Earth; thus, only one side faces

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.800
the Earth.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.070
(Note: the bulge on the far side of the Moon
had the opposite effect, but the bulge closest

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.110
to the Earth dominated the interaction.)

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.710
You’ll note, though, that I said we actually
get to see about 59% of the surface of the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.920
Moon from Earth, not 50%.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.170
The discrepancy comes from the fact that the
Moon’s orbit around the Earth isn’t perfectly

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.550
circular, more of an ellipse.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.500
As the Moon’s distance from the Earth increases
and decreases, its angular speed changes,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.280
while its rotational speed stays the same.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.680
The result is that we get to see an extra
9% of its surface than we would if it had

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.870
a perfectly circular orbit.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.270
The other side of this, as you may have guessed,
is that the Moon has the same effect on the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.310
Earth and is gradually slowing the Earth's
rotation in the exact same way the Moon became

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.060
tidally locked with the Earth.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.890
Further, as the Moon slows the Earth’s rotation,
a small portion of the Earth’s rotational

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.120
momentum gets transferred to the Moon’s
orbital momentum, with the result being that

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.810
the average radius of the Moon’s orbit increases
at about 3.8 centimeters per year with the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.780
current continental positions and barring
major geological events.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.130
(Contrary to what you’ll often read, the
Moon isn’t getting all the energy here,

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.390
most of it is being converted to heat via
friction, with only an estimated 3% of the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.660
energy in the interaction being “stolen”
by the Moon.)

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.160
Thus, the distance between the Moon and the
Earth changes gradually and is more or less

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.630
in step with the rotational period change.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.850
It should be noted, though, that it’s not
a constant change as things like major earthquakes,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.140
glacial changes, continental drift, and other
such geological events play a role here, which

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.320
is why leap seconds aren’t added at regular
intervals, but only when needed.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.900
But the overall effect is that over time,
the Moon is getting farther and farther away

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.970
from the Earth every year, while the Earth’s
rotation is slowing down.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.820
In theory, at some point tens of billions
of years from now (with the exact timeframe

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.810
being extremely difficult to nail down due
to so many unknowable factors) the same side

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.759
of the Earth will always face the Moon, with
the Earth only rotating once per lunar cycle,

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:36.500
which at that point most estimates indicate
should be about 47 current Earth days long.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.400
“In theory”… but this will likely never
happen.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.400
Why?

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.630
In about 1 to 2 billion years or so, the Sun’s
brightness will have increased sufficiently

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.380
to vaporize all water on the surface of the
Earth, getting rid of the ocean tides altogether,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.910
which is a huge factor in this interaction.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.080
However, there still would be some bulging
of the Earth’s crust to continue the process

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.600
to a much lesser extent.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.630
In 5 to 6 billion years, the Sun will be around
the peak of its Red Giant phase, and according

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.670
to the most models, even with the Sun losing
quite a bit of mass during this process, thus

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.790
making the Earth’s orbit farther out, the
Sun should just barely consume the Earth and

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.280
Moon many billions of years before such a
dual tidal lock can occur.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.590
Bottom line, at some point in the next billion
years or so, humans will need to either find

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.960
another home, or figure out how to manually
move our current one to a farther out orbit,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:55.310
keeping Earth in the habitable zone of our

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:15.320
solar system.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:58.730
Bonus Fact:
• There is technically no true “dark side”

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.730
of the Moon.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.511
As noted, the Moon is still rotating and,
despite the fact that we don’t see it, the

00:07:03.511 --> 00:07:07.710
opposite side from our perspective still gets
sunlight during that side’s “day”.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.210
In fact, the only time the “dark side”
of the Moon is truly totally dark is when

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:27.500
we are seeing a full Moon.
