00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
I made two bizzare objects, they were both made from two cups of, uh, esspresso

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.480
one of them glued like this and the other one glued like this

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.820
so this one I can balance very carefully like this

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.120
on a support

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.720
whereas the other one I have really no chance of balancing

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.220
it's very unstable

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.940
so you might have the impression that this one

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.360
is the stable one  and this one is the unstable one

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.160
because this bulges out and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.660
and hugs whatever supported standing on

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.860
with this is well, going to tip.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.760
Let's do the dynamic

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.020
version of the experiment so this is an

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.200
inclined plane and we'll try to let this roll down the slope.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.500
here we go. And it rolls down

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.060
and rolls all the way down very happily.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.530
next, this one. let's try to make it roll down the slope and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.460
when I do that, oops, it went off the rails

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.340
oops, however hard I tried to center it, it really

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.260
doesn't want to go all the way down it's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.210
very very difficult

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.990
almost made it, but not quite it doesn't

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.750
why is this such a good roller all the way down

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.020
and why is this such an unstable roller?

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.060
the difference is very interesting and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.710
it has to do with one of the most

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.619
fundamental if simplest ideas in science

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.869
and engineering which really is at the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.850
heart of today's technology called

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.670
the stability and instability. let's first look at

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.240
this one.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.759
well as long as I can center this thing

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.960
exactly in the middle

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.020
well thats fine goes straight down, rolls straight down, there

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.450
is no problem there. But, you know in nature

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.549
you always make mistakes so there is

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.860
some error initial error. let's see if it has

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.829
erred slightly to the left like this so

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.640
it's now deviated slightly to the left.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.920
in that case you see

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.140
this thing is going to be supported on

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.899
the left the rail here and on the right

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.329
rail here that is on the left

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.759
it's rolling on effectively a wheel that

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.399
has a large radius over here it's

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.409
effectively rolling on the wheel that has

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.439
small radius so you have a large wheel

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.509
on the side and small wheel on this side

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.450
and you know what they're going to do

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.759
going to start deviating rightward in

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.860
other words in such a way as to cancel

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.500
the initial error to the left so this is

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.840
a restoring mechanism or an automatic

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.610
correction mechanism whenever there is a

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.440
slight deviation to the left, the system

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.360
automatically corrects itself by going

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.450
right and if it deviates a little bit to the right

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.680
into the same thing the other way around

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.930
you start automatically going to the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.819
left so there's an automatic correction

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.820
mechanism and that's why it's so stable just wrong

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.780
(Brady) Why, professor? Why can't the big one roll along slowly

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.080
and what's the physical thing that happens?

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.080
Aha, because if you have a

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.000
small wheel on the side a large wheel on

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.099
the side and if they roll both at the

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.739
same time you see the per same amount of

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.079
angular roll the smaller one will advance a small

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.090
distance and large one advance a large

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.829
distance so you see this one goes a

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.459
little but it this one goes large so it starts curving in this

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.019
direction and if you have a small one on

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.329
this side and large one on this side, it's the other way and starts curving

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.290
on this side, so whichever side is smaller that side is

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.390
the side toward which the whole thing

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.380
starts reeling

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.800
(Brady) it's because they're connected, isn't it

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.680
Yeah they are connected. That's right.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.459
ok so that's why this thing is such a

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.889
stable roller because whenever there is

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.540
an initial error which is inevitable

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.060
automatically is correcting its course

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.250
so why it's wobbling around the center

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.560
it can still go down in contrast this

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.760
is a disaster because again you know if

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.160
you can if you can at all center it in the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.829
middle there is no problem to roll straight down but

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.049
that's only the ideal scenario in

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.420
practice there's always initial error let's

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.730
as before assume that there is a slight error to

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.239
the left but then you see the left part

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.160
of this object is supported here on the

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.459
rail so it's rolling on a small wheel

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.650
whereas the right part is supported here

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.319
which is rolling on a large wheel so

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.750
whenever it's deviating slightly to the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.060
left you have a small wheel on the left

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.220
and a large wheel on the right and you know what those

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.680
wheels will do they'll start moving

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.430
towards left so if there is an initial left error

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.859
there will be a tendency to start going even

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.380
further left so the error grows and grows

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.739
and goes out of control

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.630
and eventually of course the whole thing

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.349
moves off the rails so there is a mechanism

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.940
which is opposite to what we had before

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.150
that is, whenever there is a small initial error which is

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.620
inevitable there is some mechanism

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.020
a devilish mechanism that makes the error grow and

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.000
grow and that is called an instability

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.250
and in general in abstract terms

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.470
whenever there is a system that we want

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.970
to control or something that nature

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.979
gives and you know there are some

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.430
initial errors in the positioning well if

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.889
the error has a tendency to diminish

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.270
there's an automatic correction mechanism

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.270
that system is stable and if the error

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.130
tends to grow and goes out of control

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.520
that's the unstable mechanism and that is why this can

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.569
hardly go down the slope whereas this is very very

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.639
stable thing that keeps going down

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.509
(Brady) Professor, anyone watching is immediately right now

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:12.090
is going to start thinking about trains maybe. How does a train wheel work?

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.430
So, if a train is going straight there is no problem

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.680
but suppose it wants to round the corner

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.560
and it has the wheel that say on this

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.150
side and the outside wheel on this side

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.550
and they are connected. As it goes around the corner

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.400
the distance that this outer wheel has to travel is

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.800
actually longer than the distance this inner wheel

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.630
has to travel so there's a

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.340
problem because they are rotating at the

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.240
same rate

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.919
one of them must skid and that's a very

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.320
bad the situation so they cannot both roll

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.300
because the distances are different

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.330
so how do you correct for this effect as

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.130
long as the wheels are connected it

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.810
seems to be completely insurmountable as a

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.240
difficulty but today is a really nice

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.050
mechanism here is what you should do: effectively

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.000
you should put this kind of design on

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.270
the pair of rails you see so when it wants

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.849
to go around the corner the centrifugal

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:03.090
force make this go slightly outside but

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.069
that's very good news because as long as

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.280
it's on the outside that part of the wheel

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.940
becomes effectively larger and this part effectively smaller so the

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.099
distances that they travel are ultimately

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:17.550
adjusted and indeed the outer wheel does travel

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.949
the longer distance and the inner wheel a short distance and

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:22.229
because the wheels radii are different

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.599
and of course in real train

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:25.580
wheels it doesn't look

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.039
like that but actually the designs kind

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.259
of look like this cross-section and this

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:31.819
is sitting on the rail like this and

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:33.470
this is sitting on the rail like this

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.629
so as the wobbles left and right the

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:38.780
effective wheel size varies and that

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.150
automatically adjust for the unstable

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.129
rounding of corners its radial on the

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:45.560
full thing. And by the way if you designed

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.750
the wheels in this fashion that would be

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.430
really a disaster train that

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.250
immediately come off the rails just as this

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.099
couldn't go down the slope.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.650
I wonder if I can actually make it

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:07.500
go down all the way. AHAHA -- the first time.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.840
[laughing]

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.200
You've just undone

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.400
all that math there

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.680
one way to do it, is from my point of view, the right hand and pull it

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.760
over and then do this which produces

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.160
a perpendicular knot.
