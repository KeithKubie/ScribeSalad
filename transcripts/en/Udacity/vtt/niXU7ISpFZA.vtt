00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.090
Another way to visualize and evaluate
the accuracy of a regression algorithm

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.100
is to look at the relationship
between predicted and

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.130
actual values of our
dependant variable Y.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.216
Here's what I mean, query our model,

00:00:15.216 --> 00:00:21.830
the one that we trained on training
data with Xtest, our testing data set.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.560
The output of that query is a new
vector of Y values, Ypredict.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.740
So based on this Xtest data our
model predicts this Ypredict data.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.350
We can now compare what we know
to be the correct, or true,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.560
data and
Ytest with what our prediction was.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.396
So this pair would appear
somewhere on this chart, say here.

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:50.815
So its a value along the horizontal
access here is what the prediction was

00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:54.800
and along the vertical axis
was what the ground truth is.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.040
So we can plot these pairs
all the way through our data.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.729
Now, if this scatterplot is arranged
in approximately a nice line like this,

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.050
that means we've got a pretty
good prediction algorithm.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.535
On the other hand,
if they're not aligned so well and

00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:17.480
they look sort of like a shotgun blast,
our learner is not so good.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.430
We can measure this
property quantitatively

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.740
using something called correlation.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.320
You can use the num pi function corrcoef

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.620
to measure the correlation
between Ytest and Ypredict.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.997
You'll get an answer
somewhere between -1 and +1.

00:01:35.997 --> 00:01:39.451
Where +1 means they're
strongly correlated,

00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.822
-1 means they're inversely correlated,
and

00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:47.990
0 means there's essentially no
correlation at all between them.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.837
One thing to point out here is
that correlation isn't the slope

00:01:52.837 --> 00:01:53.941
of this line.

00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:55.980
Lots of people think that's what it is.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.720
Correlation has to do with how well
aligned the points are with the line

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.780
that we fit.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.575
So if it's a nice oval that
fits close to that line,

00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:06.605
we usually have a high correlation.

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:13.480
If it's a big round thing
we've got poor correlation.
