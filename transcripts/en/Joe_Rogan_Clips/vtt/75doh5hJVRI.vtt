WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.960
Just me and he's about three and a half years younger.
Oh,

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.970
so what are you doing personally?
Ah,
well,
you know,

3
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:09.300
most of the time I'm in the lab and try to run a bunch of companies to make

4
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:13.800
these drugs,
that reality.
Uh,
but daily I try to keep her healthy weight.

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.940
I do intermittent fasting,
which is pretty easy because I'm so busy.

6
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:21.120
I forget to eat.
How many hours do you give yourself every night?
Uh,

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.600
well I suffer from a late night snacking,
but I try to skip breakfast and,

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.700
and even skip lunch if I'm busy.
So I'm a night eater.
Um,

9
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.790
but that seemed to be good cause a study came out about a couple of weeks ago,

10
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.460
at least in mice that it's not what you eat,
it's when you eat.

11
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:39.930
That's most important for longevity really.
And when,
when being,

12
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.030
when like what's it cost?

13
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.230
It doesn't actually matter if you eat a lot in the morning or a lot at night.

14
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.880
I like nighttime eating,

15
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.360
but you need a period during the day at least if you're a mouse,

16
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:52.860
probably if you're a human where you're hungry.

17
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.520
And that puts your body in a defensive mode.
And this,

18
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.440
these are the things that we've been studying in my life for the last 20 years.

19
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.240
What are the processes that diet and exercise do for us?

20
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:03.991
They keep us healthy.

21
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:07.980
And why does calorie restriction and intermittent fasting make animals live so

22
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:11.610
much longer?
And we think we've figured out a large part of how that works.

23
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:16.080
And now we're mimicking that with molecules.
Um,
is the,

24
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.060
is the idea that you can mimic it with molecules and it be as effective as

25
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:25.030
intermittent fasting?
I think the molecules will be better.
Um,

26
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.310
and not only that,

27
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:29.670
when we add them onto a healthy diet and exercise in the animals,

28
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.010
they do even better.
It's like a supercharged mouse.

29
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.260
Now when you add them on to the mice,

30
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.770
do you also add them on with intermittent fasting and is there an additional

31
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:41.820
benefit?
Uh,
we do.
We do one of the first molecules that infants,

32
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:45.720
molecules that we are known for is resveratrol from red wine.

33
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.290
That molecule discovered it in my thirties at least,
linked to aging.

34
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.620
What we showed was that if you give it to a fat mouse,

35
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.800
there is healthy as a thin mouse.
Uh,
they live just as long.

36
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:57.720
They can get heart disease and all of the other bad stuff.

37
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.700
Then what we did was interesting.

38
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:04.701
We gave it to the mice either every day in their food or let them skip a meal

39
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.990
every day so that they were fed every other day.

40
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.560
And that combination of his Vertel plus every other day feeding,

41
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.670
we had the longest lifespan we'd ever seen.
And it was so it was additive.

42
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.570
Same with exercise.
If we give our latest molecule called airmen,
uh,

43
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.470
to a mouse and we exercise it,

44
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.440
it'll run even further than it could with either of those alone.

45
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.760
So it's not an excuse to sit around and just eat chips and watch TV.

46
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.920
It augments a healthy lifestyle.

47
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:36.240
Get you further than what you could get naturally.
So in any,

48
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.610
are you seeing a benefit in addition?

49
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:42.270
So it was the idea to compound all those things together.
Exactly.
Right.

50
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:46.230
So you asked about myself.
So I do,
I eat healthy,

51
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.730
I try to skip meals.
Uh,
I also take supplements.
Um,
and in fact,

52
00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:55.050
most of my colleagues are in the field of aging or anti aging as people call it

53
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.590
a,
so I take enemen every morning.
What is an m?
N?
Good question.

54
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:04.270
So let me take a quick step back.
Sure.
Uh,
so about 20 years ago,
ah,

55
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.470
Lenny Guarente and a team of us at MIT discovered a set of genes that controls

56
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:13.090
aging in yeast cells,
just brews east what you find in beer and bread.

57
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.900
And those genes are called Sir tunes.
And there are seven of them in our bodies,

58
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.430
five and yeast.
And what they do is they protect all organisms on the planet,

59
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:26.230
plants,
bacteria,
humans from deterioration and disease.

60
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.660
They're like the Pentagon.
They sense when we're hungry,

61
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:31.780
since when we're exercising and they send out the troops to defend us.

62
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.500
So when you,
when you put more of these genes into a yeast cell or a mouse,

63
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:39.190
they'll live longer between five to 20% longer.

64
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.360
And so we think that these genes are responsible for the effects of dieting and

65
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:44.710
exercise,
which is great.

66
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.200
Which what that means is we can now mimic that with molecules.

67
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.090
So Anna men is one of those molecules.

68
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:54.070
So he's virtual that you can think of her as virtual as the accelerator pedal

69
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.680
for the Sirtuin genes.
And the enemy is the,

70
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.740
is the fuel and without fuel rich virtual event works or Nmn is the gas in the

71
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:05.470
car?
I've heard of resveratrol but is NMN a new molecules?

72
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:06.670
Is commercially available?

73
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.120
Are some people who started selling it on the Internet?
Um,

74
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.550
fucking eight related to uh,
NR,

75
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.930
which is sold by a bunch of companies and our,
yeah,

76
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.490
nicotinamide riboside is a supplement that raises the levels of a molecule

77
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:26.491
called Nad feel like I should make a shopping list so they get a pen.

78
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.060
So what,
what are you writing that down to that?
So the Sirtuin okay,
get this.

79
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:36.061
Social Tunes Need Nad to work without them.

80
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.400
They're at work.
In fact,
if you don't have nad in your body,

81
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:42.130
you'd be dead in about 30 seconds.
It's a really important molecule.

82
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.600
But as we get older,
we lose nad.
So by the time you're 50,
like I almost am,

83
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.610
you have that half levels of once or you had when you're 20,
so that's not good.

84
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.530
And these are two ones.
They don't protect the body without high levels of Nad.

85
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.830
So what Nmn does,
and this other molecule called NR,

86
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:01.300
which both you can get on the Internet,

87
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.920
they boost the body's levels of Nad backup to youthful levels again.

88
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.350
And if we give them to mice,
these molecules,

89
00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:13.660
team to mice or even to worms or yeast,
they live longer and they super healthy.

90
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.700
Now,
what level or how many milligrams are you taking of these things?
Uh,

91
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:23.230
so yeah,
and a man is,
is um,
something I get from,

92
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.540
for myself,
I'm not selling anything.

93
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.200
So I take a gram of any men in the morning based on clinical trials has been

94
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:32.350
shown that that will raise nad with or without food.
Um,

95
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.700
I take a little bit of yogurt that I make myself at home just to see me.

96
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.210
Uh,
you have been doing this for awhile.
Uh,
and uh,

97
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.690
I only start doing stuff when I say working animals first.
So take,

98
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:47.740
take the yogurt mix in some are virtual,
virtual is great,

99
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:51.760
but it's really in solubles like brick dust.
So in the yoga will dissolve.

100
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:56.440
Take another half a gram of her is virtual and how much a half a gram.
Yeah,

101
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.280
it's,
it's a,
it's a powder.

102
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:03.260
I have a few kilos leftover from clinical trials in my basement.
Uh,
so yeah,

103
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.540
that,
that's going to last me a few decades.
Uh,

104
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.730
and then I also take at nights and Metformin,

105
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.490
which is probably the most radical thing that I take,

106
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.190
which is a prescribable drug for diabetes.

107
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.580
Net Foreman met met m m e t and prescribable drug.

108
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.600
So you but you don't have diabetes?
I do not.
But you take it for,

109
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.650
for preventing cancer,
heart disease,

110
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.510
Alzheimer's and aging met for I can you spell it?
M e t f o r m.
I.
N.

111
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.600
And so out of studies of 10,000 people and more,

112
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.110
it's been shown that people who take metformin,
er,
even if they have diabetes,

113
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.080
are protected against other diseases of aging.
Even frailty.

114
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.780
And so most scientists have you asked them,
in my field,

115
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:50.360
we'll say you metformin is likely to extend your lifespan.

116
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.010
It's just that the FDA doesn't let you have it for aging because aging isn't a

117
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:56.270
disease yet.

118
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.040
So do you have to get diabetes to get it or do you have to get a sneaky doctor?

119
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.480
Well,
I wouldn't call a sneaky doctor,

120
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:05.300
but the doctor typically has to be convinced because they don't keep up with the

121
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:08.510
literature and it's off label.
Okay.
All right.

122
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:12.320
And how much should you take of that?
Uh,
I take a gram of that as well,

123
00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:15.740
which is about a,
a low dose as some diabetics type two grams.

124
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:18.500
So it's not crazy amounts.
Is there any side effects?
Well,

125
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.030
the good news is that it's extremely rare that you get sick from any of these

126
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:26.000
molecules.
Um,
in millions of patients around the world.

127
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.040
Nobody's getting sick.

128
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:33.020
The worst you'll have as far as I can tell is a stomach upset.
And I get that,

129
00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:37.400
which is actually helpful if I'm hungry or I lose my appetite.
But,
uh,

130
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.080
I think the downside is extremely low and that the upside is,
you know,

131
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:47.330
anything's better than what's coming and what is the mechanism that metformin is

132
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.760
operating.
Okay.
So that,

133
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.180
so this is the great thing is that over the last 20 years,
we have figured out,

134
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.740
we scientists have figured out that there are universal regulators of aging from

135
00:07:57.741 --> 00:07:59.540
yeast to worms to mice and in humans.

136
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.230
And there were three main pathways that we figured out,
respond to what we eat,

137
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.300
how we exercise.
And one of them is called a m p k a,

138
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:12.650
and this is,
uh,
a target metformin.
And so I'm active.
When I take Metformin,

139
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:16.830
I'm activating my amp K,
which we'll send out the troops.
Uh,

140
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.180
the Sir two ones I've mentioned,
that's the second of the pathways.

141
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.880
And so I take enemen and reserve tool for that.

142
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.670
And then third one is called Mtor,

143
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.510
which is a pathway in the body that responds to how many amino acids,

144
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:31.340
how much meat you're eating,
uh,

145
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:35.870
and it will also protect the body if you tweak it just the right way.

146
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.470
And there's only,
besides eating low amounts of protein,
the only way to,

147
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.510
to effect that pathways with a drug called Rapamycin,
which is,

148
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.740
which is a little dangerous to try and is,
is used for a immunosuppressants.

149
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.740
So it's not something that I would recommend and I don't take it.

150
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:56.850
Wow.

151
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:01.850
So this is your daily routine along with what would kind of like died do you

152
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:07.290
follow?
Well,
I,
I try to not eat too much.

153
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:11.700
It's pretty easy to overeat.
So I try to skip one or two meals a day.
Um,

154
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.340
I avoid sugars and carbs.

155
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.470
I try to run once a week.
I do work outs on the weekend.

156
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.760
Like you,
I,
I love Saunas.
I like to put my body in some temperature,
stress,

157
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:27.070
all your hate.
And then I jump in a cold bath back and forth that,

158
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.890
that works well for yeast.
We can do that in lab and I,
they live 30% longer.
So,

159
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.290
uh,
there's all that.
Um,
do you have generally,
generally I eat normally.

160
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.220
Do you ever try going from Sauna to cryotherapy?
Uh,
no.

161
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:45.060
I haven't tried actual cryotherapy.
Just a that you haven't done it a raw Nah,

162
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.120
you won't do it today.
Sure.
Have you got one?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We'll take you,

163
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.540
take you down the street.
There's a great one because it's,
um,

164
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.140
there's different kinds and some of them are from the neck down where they're

165
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:58.470
using liquid nitrogen.
The other ones,
they actually freeze the air.

166
00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.490
So when they're,

167
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.030
they're using the nitrogen to freeze the air and they're pumping in air that's

168
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:07.200
240 degrees below zero.
And you're,
you know,
you're going to do about two minutes.

169
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.860
I do three because I do it all the time,
but uh,
it's awesome.

170
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.650
I do three and then I take 10 minutes off and then I go back in for another

171
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:17.040
three.
Yeah,
it makes sense.
And what you're doing to your body when you do that,

172
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:21.540
we think is to activate these longevity pathways like this or two ones.
Yeah.

173
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.231
And uh,

174
00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:25.200
and that's really the trick is to activate your body's defenses against aging.

175
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.440
Uh,
I mean,
the old theories about aging,
you've got to throw them out.

176
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.490
Most people at parties will tell you,
oh,
antioxidants,
free radicals,

177
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:37.440
DNA damage or mutations.
That is all for the most part,

178
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.580
incorrect that antioxidants cause DNA damage.

179
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.060
Now that's true that it repairs DNA damage.
Well,

180
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.960
antioxidants have been a rather big failure in the aging field,

181
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.880
but resveratrol is an antioxidant.
Correct?
Uh,
it's a mild antioxidant,

182
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.350
but it doesn't work by being an intox.
Oh,
what does it work?

183
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.250
What does the pathway,
it steps on the accelerator pedal of the Sirtuin enzymes.

184
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.140
And so it's directly controlling the body's defenses against aging.

185
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:08.450
So as we discussed it,
or as people discussed it as an anti oxidant there,

186
00:11:08.451 --> 00:11:12.030
it was just a mom,
a mild form of antibiotics and an accident,

187
00:11:12.031 --> 00:11:13.860
but it didn't so much more.
Right.

188
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:18.390
And we know this because if you create a yeast cell or a worm or a mouse,

189
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.330
and then you knock out the gene for the Sirtuin,

190
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.880
now raise Vertel doesn't help the animal anymore.

191
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.010
That's interesting because when people talk about wine,

192
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.790
that's the one thing they say.
There was very Charles and antioxidants.

193
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.970
Really good for you.
Yeah.

194
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.540
This is one of those urban myths that never goes away and still fuels a billion

195
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.373
dollar industry.

196
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.590
But what we're finding is that the molecules in plants like resveratrol,

197
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:38.760
first of all,

198
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.270
we think that produced by plants because the plants are benefiting from the

199
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:45.780
stress.
Uh,
we call it hormesis.
A little bit of stress is good for you.

200
00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:47.520
What doesn't kill you,
makes you stronger kind of thing.

201
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.050
And hormesis was discovered,
uh,
about 60,

202
00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:55.990
70 years ago when people were spraying herbicides on plants and a little bit of

203
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:57.700
urbicide actually made them stronger.

204
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.380
And we think that these molecules in plants are similar,

205
00:12:00.381 --> 00:12:03.010
that they make the plant stronger during times of stress.

206
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.470
So if you stress a grape that's for wine making,

207
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.300
you get great wine,
but you also get a lot of virtual.

208
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.270
And so when we ingest that resveratrol from the clients,

209
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.170
we get the same health benefits because the plants are activating their

210
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.410
serotonin pathways and we have the [inaudible] tunes and they activate us as

211
00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:24.670
well.
Ah,
interesting.
Interesting.
So low

212
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.850
<v 1>carb,
low sugar,
um,
any specific type of protein?</v>

213
00:12:28.851 --> 00:12:30.500
Do you limit your amount of protein?

214
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.200
<v 0>Yeah,
I mean,
I,
I enjoy eating mammals just as much as anybody,
but,
um,</v>

215
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.790
I try to avoid them.
Um,
for the main,
well,
two main reasons.
One is that,
uh,

216
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.840
there's this TMAO molecule that seems to cause heart disease.

217
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:49.120
Tmao yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
and how's it linked heart disease?

218
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.220
Um,
these epidemiology studies,
I forget,

219
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:59.221
but I do recall that the study was able to give the Tmao to animals and they

220
00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:01.840
developed heart disease.
So it's somehow causing it,

221
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.020
I forget exactly how it might be damaging the genome.

222
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.040
That's my recollection with omnivores or predators.

223
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.800
Uh,
I think as red meat is the culprit,
right?
So are they giving this to rats?

224
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:17.590
Are the given us too?
It was a mouse study again,
so I mean,

225
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.190
my might be different from humans of course.
Uh,
but the other problem with,

226
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.870
with meat in general,
from,

227
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.590
from animals is that there's a lot of minnows in there and it's easy to eat a

228
00:13:26.591 --> 00:13:30.280
lot of meat.
And so if you have high levels of immuno acids,

229
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.490
it will activate this mtor pathway,

230
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:37.270
one of those three on Jevity pathways.
And you don't want that.

231
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.230
You don't want that.

232
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:42.490
You don't want that cause him Tor has evolved to cents times of adversity and

233
00:13:42.491 --> 00:13:43.324
stress and hunger.

234
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.070
So why do people see a performance benefit when they consume branch chain amino

235
00:13:48.071 --> 00:13:52.000
acids?
A really good question.

236
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.450
So in the short run,
just like taking testosterone,

237
00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.370
it will give you performance benefits,
but we think in the long run,

238
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.410
it'll actually come back to bite you.

239
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.710
So how will blend branch chain amino acids come back to bite you?

240
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:10.040
So branch chain amino acids will activate this mtor pathway.
Um,

241
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.570
and
when we do that in animals,
we actually,
we reduced their lifespan.

242
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.430
So it's the opposite.
You want to keep those levels low.

243
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.070
That's interesting that that seems,

244
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.750
<v 1>I mean,
for a dummy like me,</v>

245
00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.650
it seems counterintuitive because what's making you perform better?

246
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:28.540
Currently you would see,
you would think,

247
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:31.540
especially something like amino acids and natural part of the human body,

248
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.550
you would think that that would be beneficial.

249
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.740
You're adding to your body something that it needs.

250
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.160
<v 0>Yeah,
you would.
But,
but what you should consider is that it's a trade off.</v>

251
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.280
There's a theory that probably correct.
Uh,
it's the,

252
00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:48.520
uh,
some Tom Kirkwood's terror theory called the disposable Soma.

253
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.920
And our bodies want to do one of two things.

254
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.630
Either want to grow really fast and reproduce fast,

255
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.240
build up a lot of muscle cells,
divide that's great.
In the short run,
you know,

256
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:00.950
you'd be fertile,
you can run.

257
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.180
But actually that it's at the expense of hunkering down and building a long

258
00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:08.240
lasting body.
It's a trade off over time.

259
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.750
And so animals that grow fast and reproduce fast like a mouse,

260
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.520
we'll only have a short lifespan,

261
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:19.070
whereas a whale that grows slowly and reproduce it slowly will live a long time.

262
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:23.590
Interesting.
So the idea is you're,

263
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.350
you're limiting your calories,
you're limiting your carbohydrates,

264
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:30.140
you're limiting your protein,
you're limiting your amino acids,

265
00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:34.520
but you're ramping up and all these beneficial molecules,

266
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.200
right.
These,

267
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.610
these pathways that have evolved since the beginning of life to make us live

268
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:44.920
longer during adversity so he can thrive when times come back that he could do

269
00:15:44.921 --> 00:15:49.340
you take into consideration quality of life versus length of life?

270
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:53.120
Like is there a,
uh,
like a sweet spot?
Yeah,
that,
well,

271
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.510
it's hard to ask the mice how they feel,
but they,
uh,

272
00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:00.350
we do test them and we do frailty studies and we can see that they got better

273
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:04.790
memory and they can run further and a treadmill.
Um,
they're stronger.

274
00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.020
Those kinds of things they see better.
And,
uh,
you know,

275
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.140
we think that that probably means they're happier as well.
