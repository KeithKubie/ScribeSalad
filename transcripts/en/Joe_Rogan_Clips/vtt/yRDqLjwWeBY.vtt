1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.610
Let's at the Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 1>like the network will let us do anti thing.</v>

3
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:06.900
We've been on the show for moving on the network for four years.

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.450
The only time they've ever killed the show was we want to do something about the

5
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:13.440
Ncaa,
about how the NCAA shouldn't kill,
I shouldn't kill.
Sorry.
Shit.

6
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.680
It should pay athletes,
right?
Well,
in the case of football is going,
yeah,
yeah,

7
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.300
yeah.

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.410
<v 0>We'd talk about that all the time.</v>

9
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:23.700
I think it is one of the craziest fucking scams in,
in all of money.

10
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.270
Let College sports or

11
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.050
<v 1>it's unbelievable.
I'm making so much money off those kids.</v>

12
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.330
When you watch those things,
every single person's getting paid,
you know,

13
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.690
everybody's getting paid.
The Guy,
best players,

14
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.460
the guy bringing water to the announcers are getting paid except for the
players.

15
00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:41.760
Right.
And the guy who literally,
I'm blanking on his name,

16
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:43.890
but the guy who created the system,
right,

17
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:46.890
who like formed the NCAA later when he left,

18
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.160
he compared it to plantation slavery.
He was like,
this is like slavery.

19
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:55.020
What I invented,
you know,
there's no justification for it at all.
It is bananas.

20
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.940
Uh,
we want to do that topic for a college episode.
We pitched that to true TV.

21
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.000
Uh,
you know what airs on true TV every March,
March,
math,
March madness.

22
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:09.570
They said no.
They said,
they said,
and here's,
here's how I live with myself.
I say,

23
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.610
look,
I will never take a no until it's the only absolute answer I can get.

24
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:18.450
So they said,
no.
I say,
I really want to do it.
Tell me know again.
You know,

25
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.690
they told me no again.
I was like,
if the president of the network tells me no,

26
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.330
then I'm not doing it.
And the president of network told me no,

27
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.160
because that's the guy who I could write it and he could tell the episode.

28
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.390
<v 0>Wow.
Yeah,
that's true.
That's true.
Really.</v>

29
00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:34.860
It shouldn't have NCAA on,
you're worried about,

30
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:38.030
they're worried about pissing off the NCAA books.
Yeah.

31
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.870
Pissed off those money grubbing thieves wheelie man,
those athletic kids.

32
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.990
I'm with you all these month.
People are paying money to see those fucking kids.

33
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.780
That shit drives me crazy.
Exploiting of young athletes in,

34
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.250
in college is anchors.

35
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.800
It is one of the ones that drives me because I got into it with Joey Diaz who

36
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:56.461
explained to me,

37
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:59.370
cause Joey used to be a bookie and he really understands gambling.

38
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.900
He was explaining to me how much money gets donated to the schools by people who

39
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:06.060
used to go to them.
He goes,
it's insane.

40
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.210
And he sent it and most of it is based on the performance that the school has in

41
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:15.240
college sports at these people who are,
you know,
I'm a fucking,
you know,

42
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:18.190
Blah Blah Blah.
I went to school there and I'm there till I.
Dot.

43
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:22.140
I fucking go team.
Yeah.
These assholes throw shit.

44
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:26.490
Tons of money and there's thousands of them all throughout history.

45
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.180
Years and years guys have been donating for 25 fucking years and when the team

47
00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:34.000
wins the championship,
they give them a bonus to add even more.
Right?
Yes.

48
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.390
Who doesn't get the money as the kid?
Fucking people

49
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.200
<v 0>who play the game.
All they have to do so well.
If you get through here,</v>

50
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:43.820
you're going to do education and then you get to go to pro sports.
Yeah.

51
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.010
How many of them make it,
especially in football,
almost none.
Almost.
No,

52
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.900
but look at it.
What are the numbers?
What does it like?

53
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.710
I wonder what the numbers are guys who sign up for college football,

54
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.540
who make it first of all,

55
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:59.541
with a body that's functional after four years of 600 fucking pound dudes,

56
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.620
slam magazine.
Not that big,
but giant,
giant dude slamming into you.
You know,

57
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:06.200
five days

58
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.760
<v 1>we did a,
we did an episode on football and the the concussion thing,</v>

59
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:13.210
and it's not just concussions,
right?
It's like just the little hits,
right?

60
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:15.400
It's just the routine tackles.
You know what I mean?

61
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.100
What happens every single time you do that,
your brain,

62
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.910
you got to think of it this way.
Your brain is riding your,
your skull is the car.

63
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:25.000
Your brain's a passenger.
Your brain doesn't have a seatbelt,
right?

64
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.430
Every time you run into somebody,
boom,

65
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.940
your brain slides forward a little bit cause it's not wearing a seat belt bumps

66
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:32.800
into the front of your skull and bounces back,
right?

67
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.160
And even if it doesn't cause a concussion,
it causes a little,

68
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.140
a little hurt every single time,
right?

69
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.380
And so you can never get a concussion do that over and over and over again,

70
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:42.790
and you're going to end up with CTE.

71
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.470
And so some trauma happens in soccer players.
Yeah,
it's an issue in soccer.

72
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.830
And those kids or those kids are hurting themselves,
you know,
uh,

73
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.300
and they're not getting paid for it.

74
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.010
<v 0>Jamie wrote here in football,</v>

75
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.110
out of 73,557 NCAA participants,

76
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.500
approximate number who are draft eligible is down to 16,346 and now down to

77
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:06.251
draft picks,

78
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:11.251
it's 256 so 256 out of 73,000 make it to draft,

79
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:13.790
pick

80
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.620
<v 1>1.6% make it from the NCAA to the majors.</v>

81
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.670
<v 0>1.6% ridiculous.</v>

82
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.800
Ncaa to major pro,
1.6% that is fucking crazy.

83
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.370
Let's be honest,
these kids are not getting a full education as polos.

84
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.270
Baseball is almost 10% way more teams with like miners and all that kind of

85
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:34.890
crazy though.

86
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.550
<v 1>It's wild.
So I was 10% that's weird.
Well,
the there'll,
but that's,
oh,</v>

87
00:04:38.551 --> 00:04:41.960
that's 10% of from draft eligible to drafted the major battles,

88
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.020
not even the participants because look that's,
that's a 35 k seven,

89
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.860
seven k or draft eligible and then seven joint seven are drafted.

90
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.810
<v 0>Right.
But look how low the number is in terms of uh,</v>

91
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.410
baseball participants versus footballs.
Half less than half.

92
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.090
And yet they have way higher percentage.
This is our writings themselves.

93
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.780
We look at charts also.
The thing is like with baseball,
you don't get hit,
right?

94
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:06.370
Yeah.
Unless you get hit by a ball.

95
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.290
Most of the time your injuries just from running or sliding and stuff like that.

96
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.720
Yeah.
Well you can get,
yeah,
you can get hit in the head with a baseball.

97
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.880
So much safer.
If I had a kid and the kid was thinking of like baseball,

98
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:20.710
football or basketball,
be like,

99
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:23.440
we'll take that football out of the fucking equation.
You've got two choices.

100
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.980
It was don't do it.
Just don't do it.
You're not gonna make it.

101
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.660
The very few people that make it out of there without like serious injury.

102
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.540
It's like it's not worth it.
It's just not especially,
yeah.

103
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.150
<v 1>Do you look at that 75,000 number?
If you look at,
uh,</v>

104
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.260
for how many kids are playing in the NCAA now think about how many kids are

105
00:05:42.261 --> 00:05:44.120
playing high school football.
I don't know the number,

106
00:05:44.121 --> 00:05:45.230
but it's gotta be 10 times that

107
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.380
<v 0>you showing us Sherry,
me,
this kid is going to be,</v>

108
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.040
he's the Heisman trophy winner and he already has been drafted to the major

109
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:51.850
league baseball,

110
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.170
but he's also projected to potentially be in a top five NFL picks.
Whoa.

111
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.720
There's like a big discussion on what should he do.
It's up to him obviously,

112
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:01.580
but players like Deion Sanders,

113
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:05.030
so I've been in both leagues and I've done both at the same time as like play

114
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:09.500
baseball,
baseball man.
Well that's better for your life because you're less,

115
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:14.390
you're less likely to,
to like,
yeah,
I have brain damage.

116
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:17.030
Do you ever talk to a fucking baseball player that's retired?

117
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.800
It's like talking to a regular person.
He still doesn't,

118
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.060
he still wants to be the quarterback.
They'll,
you know,
I mean,
well,

119
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.120
can be a basketball player.
Those guys clearly have the best of it,

120
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.570
like out of all the major sports basketball players,
because they,

121
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.020
I don't know about that because it's a much more grueling schedule physically.

122
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.920
First of all,
you're running and shooting every night.
You're sprinting,

123
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.070
you're doing all these different things,
and baseball is so much more leisurely.

124
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.710
<v 2>Okay.</v>
