00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.280
Freezing Water in Unbreakable Containers

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.270
Some listeners may recall a science class
in which an excitable teacher walked to the

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.970
front of the class to show off a small, cracked
steel container, seemingly damaged by an incredibly

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.539
powerful, but tiny force; only for said teacher
to reveal that the damage had been done by

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.160
nothing more than water.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.570
However, what would happen if you put the
water in a container it couldn’t break out

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.390
of and then froze it?

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.179
The short answer is that the water still turns
into ice; however, if it genuinely cannot

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.739
break the bonds of the container it is trapped
inside, it turns into a very different kind

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.870
of ice than we’re used to seeing.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.110
We currently know of 15 different “solid
phases” of water, aka ice, with each type

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.949
being distinct due to differing density and
internal structure.

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.280
The form you’re likely most familiar with
is Hexagonal Ice which is what happens when

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.110
water freezes normally under regular conditions.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.910
If you keep lowering the temperature of Hexagonal
ice, it eventually becomes Cubic Ice; tweak

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.949
the temperature and pressure further and you
can create Ice II, Ice III all the way up

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.610
to Ice XV.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.910
Due to the inherent difficulty of producing
such high/low pressures and temperatures,

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.460
it has taken science up until as recently
as 2009 to fully document every known form

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.460
of ice.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.120
The majority of ice’s final forms were discovered
in part by a group of researchers in the Chemistry

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.280
department of Oxford University who were able
to create Ice XII, XIV and XV for the first

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.280
time.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.020
In the case of Ice XV, creating it involved
taking Ice VI and slamming the temperature

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.549
down to -143 degrees Celsius before exposing
it to pressure 10,000 times greater than the

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:38.899
Earth’s own atmosphere.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.930
This final form of ice, and by extension form
of water, still managed to surprise even the

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.550
minds at Oxford when against all of their
expectations, it proved to be totally antiferroelectric,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.970
being unable to hold a charge at all.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.509
But in the simplest sense, the different forms
of ice are created through a varying combination

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.730
of both pressure and temperature, the exact
combinations of which can be found out by

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.100
taking a quick look at the phase diagram of
water linked to in the show notes.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.580
However, scientists can artificially tip the
scales in their favour through various means.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.580
For example, when creating Ice XIII and XIV,
Dr Christoph Salzmann and his team at Oxford

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.890
used careful measures of hydrochloric acid
to alter the temperature needed to create

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.030
the ice.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.330
If the above seems rather simple in the scheme
of things, that’s because it was and other

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.750
scientists, such as Professor John Finney
(who was part of the team that discovered

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.120
and created Ice XII in 1996) noted as much
when questioned about it, commenting that

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.720
Salzmann’s team had done in a few years
what other researchers couldn’t do in 40.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.850
Back to the question at hand, regular ice,
or at least the version you were familiar

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.550
with before we told you about the other 14
kinds, is capable of applying massive amounts

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.010
of force when it freezes and expands.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.670
This is due to a very unique trait of water,
mainly that it is less dense as a solid than

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.670
as a liquid.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.570
This density disparity is due to how the molecules
of water react upon freezing; water molecules

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.620
join together in a rigid hexagonal structure
which leaves a small, but nonetheless significant

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.120
gap between the atoms that wasn’t there
when the water was liquid.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.560
For the curious, water reaches its densest
point at 4 degrees Celsius; any cooler or

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.760
hotter and it begins to expand.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.910
So exactly how much force is the ice capable
of exerting?

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.000
Well, people have been trying to work this
out for a long time.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.370
In 1784 and 1785, one Major Edward Williams
took advantage of the weather in Quebec and

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.290
repeatedly tried and failed to find a method
of containing ice.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.230
Williams at first tried to seal water inside
of artillery shells, the cast iron plugs of

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.070
which were launched 475 feet at an astonishing
20 feet per second when the pressure become

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.070
too great.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.030
Unperturbed, Williams then took to anchoring
the plugs in place using hooks, only for the

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.920
shells to split in two.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.260
In another experiment, an attempt was made
to fill cannons made of one inch thick cast

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.860
iron with water only for them too to split
when it was frozen.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.500
Academics in Florence later tried to fill
a ball made of one inch thick brass with water

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.920
only for that too to crack when it was frozen.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:10.260
They later worked out that the force required
to do so clocked in at around 27,720 pounds.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.310
For a more exact answer, you need to once
again go back to the water phase diagram linked

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.600
in the show notes, which shows that ice will
turn into Ice II when the pressure reaches

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.050
300 Mega Pascals, which is exactly, 43,511.31
pounds of force per square inch.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.160
In other words, that’s the amount of pressure
a container would need to be able to survive

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.940
to stop water turning into regular ice, instead
causing it to turn into Ice II.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.840
So, to answer the initial question, if you
froze water inside a container so strong it

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.960
couldn’t turn into ice, it would still turn
into ice, just a slightly different type of

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:59.600
ice in terms of scientific classification
and its internal structure.
