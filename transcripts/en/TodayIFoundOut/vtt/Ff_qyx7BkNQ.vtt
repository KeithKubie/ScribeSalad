00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:16.770
Wolfgang 
Amadeus Mozart is known for many things, few

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.790
of which we care to cover on this site because
you probably already know all about them.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.363
Instead, we prefer to cover things that you
likely didn’t know, like that the alphabet

00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:25.619
song was based on a tune by Mozart, or covering
his extremely adult themed works that included

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.650
a bit of an obsession with all things scatological,
and the significantly more family friendly

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.850
subject of today- that time Mozart pirated
a cherished choral arrangement from the Vatican,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.469
reportedly all from memory.

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.079
That piece was Miserere mei, Deus (literally,
“Have mercy on me, O God”), which was

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.280
based on Psalm 51 and composed by Catholic
priest Gregorio Allegri sometime in the 1630s.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.559
Although today Miserere is regarded as one
of the most popular and oft recorded arrangements

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.120
of the late Renaissance era, for many years,
due to papal decree, if one wanted to hear

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.199
it, one had to go to the Vatican.

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.809
The punishment for ignoring the ban on copying
this music is widely stated by many a reputable

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.750
source (as well as Mozart’s dad, Leopold)
to be excommunication from the Catholic church.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.720
(Although I couldn’t find any primary documents
that back Pope Urban VIII, or any other Pope,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.300
ever making such an official decree, and various
pirated versions of the music are known to

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.640
have existed during the moratorium without
anyone seeming to have been excommunicated.)

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.700
Nevertheless, there was indeed a ban on copying
the music that lasted for almost a century

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.119
and a half.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.180
To add to the mystique surrounding the piece,
it was only allowed to be performed publicly

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.930
on two specific days during the Holy Week
(the week before Easter)- Holy Wednesday and

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.930
Good Friday.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.930
(And if you’re curious, see: Why Determining
Easter’s Date is So Confusing) All this,

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.829
combined with the superior acoustics of the
Sistine Chapel and the unparalleled talent

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.770
of the Papal Choir resulted in the piece becoming
an almost mythical entity, with people travelling

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.880
from across the globe to hear it performed
in all its glory.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.619
Though the Vatican refused for many years
to ever release a copy of the sheet music

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.899
for the piece, by the mid eighteenth century
the Church had been cajoled into gifting three

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.909
copies to prominent individuals.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.289
These individuals were the King of Portugal,
famed composer and Catholic friar Giovanni

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.700
Battista Martini, and Emperor Leopold I.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.210
In regards to Emperor Leopold, he seems to
have heard the piece on a visit to the Vatican

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.520
sometime in the late 1600s, becoming enamoured
with it.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.930
Leopold used his influence to convince the
Pope to give him a copy of the sheet music.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.230
He then summoned the finest singers he had
at his command and arranged for a performance

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.370
of the piece to be held in the Imperial Chapel
in Vienna.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.010
By all accounts, the resulting performance
was lacklustre and dull.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.410
This supposedly resulted in the Emperor believing
he’d been cheated and given an inferior

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.380
copy of the music, sending a courier to the
Vatican to explain to the Pope what had happened.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.460
Apparently upset himself over his orders not
being followed, the Pope subsequently is said

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.130
to have dismissed the Maestro di Cappella
who’d provided the music.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.260
As it turns out, Leopold had indeed been sent
a genuine copy of the sheet music.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.530
However, over the years the Papal Choir had
added many embellishments to the original

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.560
work that were not reflected in the sheet
music, nor were they seemingly ever written

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.560
down.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.040
The story goes that the Maestro di Cappella
eventually got his job back when this was

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.350
explained to the Pope.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.170
Whether that oft’ told story is perfectly
accurate or not, Emperor Leopold would later

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.810
enshrine the copy of Miserere he’d been
given in the Vienna Imperial Library.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.190
This all brings us to 1770 when a 14-year-old
Mozart was touring around Italy with his father.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.560
After arriving in Rome, Mozart attended the
Holy Wednesday Tenebrae, during which he heard

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.830
Miserere in full.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.430
Later that day, Mozart, who was already considered
a musical prodigy at this point, transcribed

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.280
the entire 15 or so minute piece from memory.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.770
He is also rumoured to have attended the Good
Friday performance later that week to hear

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.840
it again, helping to improve upon his unauthorised
copy.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.040
(Popular myth states that he smuggled his
copy into the performance in his hat and corrected

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.090
it on the spot.)

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.390
Despite knowing that copying the piece was
taboo, Mozart’s father, Leopold, was reportedly

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.870
impressed that his son had managed to transcribe
the song from memory, writing in a letter

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.110
to his wife dated April 14, 1770:

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.160
You have often heard of the famous Miserere
in Rome, which is so greatly prized that the

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.960
performers are forbidden on pain of excommunication
to take away a single part of it, copy it

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.120
or to give it to anyone.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.670
But we have it already.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.190
Wolfgang has written it down and we would
have sent it to Salzburg in this letter, if

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.000
it were not necessary for us to be there to
perform it.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.199
But the manner of performance contributes
more to its effect than the composition itself.

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.030
Moreover, as it is one of the secrets of Rome,
we do not wish to let it fall into other hands.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.950
Unlike the other, authorized copies of the
piece that existed at the time, Mozart’s

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.490
supposedly included the multitude of flourishes
and ornamental embellishments employed by

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.539
the choir that were of fundamental importance
to the arrangement, but, as previously stated,

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.700
not in the original music by Allegri.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.770
All this said, while that is the widely reported
story, it should be noted here that it isn’t

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.300
actually clear from evidence at hand how accurate
Mozart’s copy of the piece was, as it has

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.479
unfortunately been lost to history, and going
off a boasting father’s account is somewhat

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:57.479
suspect.

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.590
However, for those who support the idea that
Mozart made a perfect copy, it is noted that

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.810
Miserere is an amazingly repetitive piece,
with the gist of most of the arrangement coming

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.879
in the first few minutes.

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:10.180
It’s also often stated that a short while
after transcribing Miserere, Mozart was at

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.990
a party with his father when the topic of
the tune came up in conversation, at which

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.259
point Leopold boasted to the guests that his
son transcribed the legendary piece from memory,

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.039
prompting some amount of skepticism from the
attendees.

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:26.370
However, in attendance at said party was a
musician named Christoferi, who’d actually

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.169
sung it while a member of the Papal Choir.

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.340
After looking over the copy made by Mozart,
he supposedly confirmed that it was a faithful

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.340
reproduction.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.340
Mozart in 1777 with his papal insignia
Mozart in 1777 with his papal insignia

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.060
Whether that party anecdote actually happened
is as difficult to determine as many other

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.440
details of this tale.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:47.260
But what is 100% verifiable fact is that news
of this supposedly extremely accurate unauthorized

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.979
copy of Miserere eventually reached Pope Clement
XIV (perhaps even via Leopold Mozart himself

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.189
spilling the beans to the Pope in a letter).

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.960
The Pope then summoned the young composer
to Rome while Mozart was travelling through

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.960
Naples.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.349
However, rather than being upset or excommunicating
Mozart, the Pope was impressed by the young

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.969
composer’s musical ability and initiative
and instead awarded him the Chivalric Order

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.830
of the Golden Spur– essentially a Papal
knighthood.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.710
This, perhaps, gives credence to the notion
that Mozart’s copy of the work must have

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.949
been reasonably accurate, as presumably the
Pope would have checked with his Maestro di

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.940
Cappella concerning Mozart’s transcription
before awarding such an honour.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.659
This knighthood was something Mozart seems
to have been extremely proud of, including

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:30.590
frequently wearing the cross medal that came
with being knighted.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.560
He also took to signing his name Chevalier
de Mozart.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.009
However, in a letter to his father dated October
of 1777, the 21 year old Mozart reveals that,

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.440
during a concert in which various nobles were
in attendance, Mozart wore the mark of his

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.689
papal knighthood and the nobles mocked him
for it, after which he seems to have ceased

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:50.909
wearing it and further stopped signing his
name with the title.

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:55.210
In any event, impressed by Mozart and no doubt
realising, both based on Mozart’s transcription

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.389
of the work and the others that existed at
the time, that the cat was out of the bag

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:00.680
(or perhaps simply not caring as his predecessors
had), Pope Clement XIV got rid of the ban

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.469
concerning copies of the music for Miserere,
ostensibly making it available to the masses.

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:07.289
However, due to the abbellimenti that the
Papal Choir employed when they performed the

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:10.719
piece, compared to what the stock music said,
for almost a century more the true Vatican

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:13.900
version of the song remained something you
could only hear at the Vatican.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.460
It wouldn’t be until 1840 when a Catholic
priest by the name of Pietro Alfieri published

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.800
the embellished version of Miserere that the
world finally had what is considered to be

00:07:20.800 --> 00:08:32.810
an accurate sheet music representation of
the Chapel Choir 

00:08:32.810 --> 00:09:23.770
version 

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.790
of song.
