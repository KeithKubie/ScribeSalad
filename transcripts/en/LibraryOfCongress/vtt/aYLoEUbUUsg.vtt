00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.520
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Good
afternoon/early evening.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.080
It's so great to have you all here.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.240
I don't know if did any of
you catch the performance

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.570
in the afternoon already?

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.220
Or are you here in anticipation
of tonight's performance?

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.550
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Or
both performances?

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.850
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Yeah.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.890
Yeah. Oh, good.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.690
My name is David Plylar and I'm
a music specialist at the Library

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.100
of Congress and I'm here with two
special guests just to talk about--

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.170
a bit about the history
of composing for dance

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.470
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.330
But also, to talk about what
is involved in that process

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.800
of composing for dance, and
actually putting together a project

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.730
like the one that we're all
being able to take part of,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.340
which is what the Martha Graham
Dance Company this weekend

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.870
and actually over the past
week, which is involved--

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.490
talks about Isamu Noguchi as well

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.480
as some other aspects
of the Graham legacy.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.560
So, I'm pleased to have with me
Aaron Sherber, who is the conductor

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.730
and music director
for these performances

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.070
and with the Martha
Graham Dance Company.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.200
And he's been leading the way with
our musicians and you won't see him

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.660
but he's in the pit
doing all the work.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.770
So, you know, with the musicians.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.880
And so, he offers a
very unique perceptive

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.270
that we'll be able to get.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.270
And then also, Libby Smigel who is
our new dance archivist curator.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.360
We're not sure we just
call her the dance person.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.960
And she's been a delight to
have in the music division

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.890
and will offer some
perspective from that side.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.090
So, before we get started,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.390 position:56%
what I thought we could do is maybe
just give a little bit of background

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.680
on who you are, that
would be helpful.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.680
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: I come from
traipse and through a lot

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.420
of different aspects of dance
and I realized I did work

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.110
with a composer back in my
undergrad days, which are hard

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.630
to remember at this point.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.060 position:56%
Where I was choreographing for a
production in Greek of "The Bacchae"

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.930
and doing that for my senior
theses and working with the person

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.690
in the music division, who is
doing her own senior theses

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.750
and was writing for the
dancing at the same time,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.090
and it didn't ruin our friendship.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.390
So, there was that.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.900
And then, I have also
gotten a PhD in drama.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.710
So, I am bringing that to the floor

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.810
and my most recent work before
coming to the library in August,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.510
I headed the Dance Heritage
Coalition, which was an association

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.120
of dance archives and
museums and libraries

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.240
so that we will be saving better,
we hope, dance legacies for all.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.750
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: I've been
with the Martha Graham Company

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.580 position:56%
for almost 18 years, 1998 I started.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.260
And actually, my first performance
with the company was here

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.360
at the library and it was the
first time that we brought back

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.840
"Appalachian Spring"
since the premier.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.400
So, it was-- that was
quite something to step

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.530
into as my entre into that world.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.000
I had no dance experience
as a conductor before that

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.580
but it gotten plenty
in the year since.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.370
And along the way, one
of the interesting things

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.120 position:56%
about my job has been-- because of
the way the Graham Company is setup,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.500
I'm essentially the
whole music department.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.300
So, it's part conductor, part
librarian, part archivist,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.400
part historian and it's been
just a real thrill for me to come

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.060
into contact with these pieces
and find out what their history is

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.050
and how all these things
come together.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.260
And it's also nice to be
back here at the Library.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.560
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Well,
it's great to have you.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.090
And also, we'll talk
about this later perhaps

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.390
where you're doing
some editorial work--

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.690
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Yeah.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.990
Uh-huh.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.290
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: -- as well.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.590
So, on some of these pieces.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.880
So maybe we'll start with hearing
just a sentimental recording.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.250
&gt;&gt; Which much affection,
Mrs. Coolidge.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.120
&gt;&gt; Do you remember
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge?

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.950
&gt;&gt; I certainly do and
with much affection.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:47.950
Mrs. Coolidge really made her
mark, I think, on American music.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.740 position:56%
In the consistent way over the
years, she established and continued

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.090
to have here in Washington of
excellent chamber music concerts.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.760
We really owe her a great debt

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.630
and I'm very glad you've
given me the opportunity

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.690
to say that in public.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:12.130
I've often thought it and I wish
we had more Mrs. Coolidges around.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.930
&gt;&gt; That relationship is sort of
symbiotic in a way because just as,

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.070
we, yourself, among the many
composers, owe a debt to her,

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.160
I think, her memory owes quite
a debt to the man who composed

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.510
"Appalachian Spring" for her.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:36.320
[ Applause ]

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.090
&gt;&gt; You're forgetting Martha
Graham who created the work.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.700
&gt;&gt; And it didn't even
have a title, did it?

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.150
&gt;&gt; No, it didn't.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.610
I can't imagine that
being true any longer.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.200
I'm so used to thinking of
it as "Appalachian Spring".

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.930
It never occurred to me
that when I was writing it,

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.240
I didn't know what
she would call it.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.300
She hadn't given a name yet.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.020
So after finishing the work
and reading it back to her

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.230 position:56%
when she already had it in rehearsal
the first time I said her--

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.140
saw her, I said, "Martha, what
have you call the ballet?"

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.690
I called it ballet for Martha
just so, you know, in my own mind.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.500
&gt;&gt; And that too-- That's exactly
what it says on the front page

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.870
of the manuscript,
ballet for Martha.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.280
&gt;&gt; But that was the subtitle.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.580
No, I didn't have a title.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.760
I was really putting
Martha Graham to music.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.290
I'd seen her dancing so many times.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.910
I had a sense of her
personality as a creative artist.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.560
I had a, really, in the front
of my mind, I wasn't thinking

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.000
about the Appalachians
or even spring.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.170
So, that I had no title for it.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.170
The first thing I said to her when
I came down to the rehearsal here

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.060
in Washington was, "Martha,
what did you call the ballet?"

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.500
She said, "Appalachian Spring."

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.800
Oh I said, "What a nice name.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.600
Where did you get it?"

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.070
[ Laughter ]

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.410
She said, "Well, it's a title
of a poem by Hart Crane."

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.210
"Oh," I said, "Does the poem have
anything to do with the ballet?"

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.510
She said, "No.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.010
I just like the title
and I took it."

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.310
[ Laughter ]

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.110
And over and over again,
nowadays, people come up to me

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.650
after seeing the ballet on
stage and say, "Mr. Copland,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.900
when I see that ballet and
when I hear your music,

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.510
I can just see the
Appalachians and feel the spring."

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:23.040
[ Laughing ]

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.100
I began to see the
Appalachian myself a little bit.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.180
[ Laughter ]

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.960
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: I have to add
two quick things about that.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.150
First of all, Copland
loved telling that story

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.250
and he told it almost
verbatim multiple times

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.670
and I haven't heard the one
with the laugh track like that.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.970
So that's a new one.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.270
But the second interesting thing

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.420 position:56%
that I think even Copland either
may not be aware of or glossed over,

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:53.250
it's not spring the season, it's
spring a body of water in the poem.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.470
And very few people
are aware of that.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.770
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: It's not--

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.070
If I'm not mistaken,
it's also not the title.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.370
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: I know, it's
also not the title, I believe.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.670
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Yeah.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.970
It's--

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.270
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Yeah,
it's in there.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.570
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar:
I have a colleague,

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:05.870
a retired colleague
name Wayne Shirley

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.870
who put together this really nice
overview of the whole process

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:14.280
of commissioning "Appalachian
Spring" and also the other ballets

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:20.750
that were-- or works that were
included on this event in 1944,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.780 position:56%
that kind of goes into this in
great detail covering correspondence

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.080
and things like that.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.790
So, he addresses that
at that at one point.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.760
You know, as funny as it is,
it actually brings up a lot

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.940
of interesting issues that I think
are there from the onset of the--

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.250
at the beginning of
any great undertaking.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.530
And I consider any great
undertaking one that requires more

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.170
than one person because you have
to come to terms with each other

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.100
in some way if you're going

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.770
to create some meaningful
work of art together.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.730
And so, even something as seen
as kind of tangential or kind

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.150
of after the fact as the title
of the work, that is the way

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.450
that we have first access to
it in some-- in many ways.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.120
So, it's-- it ended up people--

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.190
it has a certain resonance with
people today that, you know,

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.710
if it were-- if it had a terrible
title, it wouldn't have helped it,

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.960
you know, it's always nice that it
had this poetic component to it.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.390 position:56%
And one of the thing I just want to
mention about this and maybe, Aaron,

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.570
you may be able to speak to
this as well, is that he did say

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.420
that he didn't know what
Martha was going to call it.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:30.170 position:56%
That was the same, I think, the same
situation for the Hindemith work,

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.200
"Herodiade" and the Milhaud work

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.640
because they were--
had different titles.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.250
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Well--
Though the Hindemith did not.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.930
The Hindemith I believe--
what do you have?

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.230
You got something?

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.530
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar:
"Mirror Before Me"?

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.830
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: "Mirror
Before Me", oh you're right.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.820
So, it was called "Herodiade"
ultimately because both Hindemith

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.120
and Graham based their work

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.830
on the Mellarme pros
and poem by that name--

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.130
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Right.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.430
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: And I think it
just made more sense ultimately.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.730
I'd forgotten "Mirror Before Me."

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.030
Yeah. But that, you
know, but the naming--

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.140
that's not unusual that
the name comes last.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.440
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Sure.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.740
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: And in
fact, the world premiere,

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.790
the Pontus Lidberg ballet didn't
have a name about 2 weeks ago

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.250
when they had to print
it in the program.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.930
So, you know, that
fortuitous things.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.590
And the Barber that
were performing "Cave

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.890
of the Heart" was originally called

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.080
"Serpent Heart" when
it was premiered.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.120
Another Graham ballet "Diversion
of Angels" was originally called

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.130
"Wilderness Stair"
when it premiered.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:20.920
So sometimes that process of
finding a name is, you know,

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.320
it's the act of summing up
what it is you've created

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.220
and sometimes it takes a little
while for that to settle in.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.630
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar:
Well, there's also that

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.830
and there's also what the
composer might call it on the side

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.860
versus what the completed
work is called.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.080
So like in the case of Milhaud
who had a piece that was also--

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.170
and he called it "Jeux de
Printemps" I think and then--

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.790
but went by the name
of "Imagined Wing".

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:47.680
So, I think in his catalogue, he
kept it as with the French title

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.430
but it-- so there's
different-- it never quite--

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.730
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Right.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.030
And the Barber piece
is called "Medea".

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.330
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Right.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.630
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: His-- The
published ballet is called "Medea".

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.300
On the other hand, I think
people do make a little too much

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.020
about the fact that Copland
titled it "Ballet for Martha"

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.840
because really, what else
was he going to call it?

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.310
If you're writing a piece of
music and you're writing a ballet

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.230
for Martha, you know,
that's what he put on.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.490
I don't think he ever
intended that to be a title.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.790
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Sure, sure.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.200
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: But I know
in all the Graham programs

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.870
when we perform it, it always says
how Aaron Copland called it "Ballet

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.380
for Martha" which Martha changed
it "Appalachian Spring" and I--

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.350
at first, I think there's little
too much significance in that but--

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.650
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Sure.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.950
Sure.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.250
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: Yeah.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.060
And actually, "House of
Victory" was one of the titles

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.600
that Martha had settled
on in her iterations

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.680
of sending scenarios
to Aaron Copland.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.720
And I think it's to his credit,
he didn't decide to adopt

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.610
that one right away, you know.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.280
But she, you know, has
a handwritten, you know,

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.670
this is a working title and, you
know, I think it sort of still was

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:53.130
in the process of being created
and it makes a lot of sense not

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.430
to settle on something too soon.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.730
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Well, sure.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.750 position:56%
And you know, and before we even get
to this process of getting created,

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.530
you know, it's one thing
for friends to get together

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.000
and put together, you know, a work.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.790
But it's another if you're talking
about professionals coming together

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.130
and working under contract and
having those types of issues

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.790 position:56%
that one must think about especially
with these larger works and these--

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.920
the correspondence
and effort that goes

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.150
into just the business end
of putting it together.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.260
I don't mean it in a crass
way, meaning like, it--

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:34.740
there is a cost to hire 12
performers versus 5 performers.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.960
If you only have enough
money for five performers,

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.480
chances are the piece will
probably only have five players.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.800
If you have-- there's other
considerations such as space,

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.540
for instance, the Coolidge
Auditorium, we--

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.310
most people know "Appalachian
Spring" and it's kind

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:55.740
of rich large orchestral version
but maybe don't know as much

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.040
about that original version.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.560
And maybe Aaron, you
can say a little bit?

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.020
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber Yeah.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.610 position:56%
Also, I wanted to add there, there's
a funny letter that Wayne reproduces

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.680
in there from Erick
Hawkins who was--

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.560 position:56%
it was the first husband when he was
the company manager at Martha Graham

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.110
at that time and also became
Martha's husband for a couple

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.810
of years, that's a
whole other story.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.290
But he-- there's a letter
that Wayne reproduces in there

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.790
where Erick is complaining about
the fact the Hindemith decided

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.320
to add a second violin.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.200
He said that could wreck
our touring budget.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.500
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: It's true.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:29.610
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Which
is-- Yeah, it is very true.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.070
Yeah. That the various versions

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:34.480
of "Appalachian Spring"
are very difficult.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.850
It's a very long and tangled story
and in fact, if you read just

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.480
about any biography of Aaron
Copland they get it wrong.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.810 position:56%
I mean, very bright people who spent
a lot of time studying Copland.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:45.110
It's just-- It's very confusing.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.810 position:56%
So, Copland wrote the piece for
Martha Graham, it was premiered here

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.720
at Library, it was a ballet, it
was written for 13 instruments,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:57.420
double string quartet plus base,
piano, flute, clarinet and bassoon.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.310 position:56%
The year after the ballet premiered,

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.980
Copland made a sweet
out of it for orchestra.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:08.400
So, he took about 6 minutes out
of the "Simple Gifts" variation

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.760
and if you go nips and
tucks here and there

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.490 position:56%
and scored it up for full orchestra.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.650
And that's the way, I know
in my parents' generation,

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.850
that's what everybody knew
at the orchestra suite.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.070
It was hugely popular in the '40s
and '50s and through the '60s

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.460
and even today, it's one of his
most often performed pieces.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.660
There are a couple of reasons
why people are less familiar

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.160
with the 13 instrument version.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:34.130
One is, while Martha was alive, she
died in 1991, Copland stipulated

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.540
that nobody but Martha could
play the ballet version.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.070
And there's a funny story behind
that which is when she died

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.740
and Boosey &amp; Hawkes who
was her publisher said,

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.130
"Great but not great.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.840
But now we can rent this out
and make some money off of it."

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.410
They realized, they didn't even
have parts to it and they called

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:58.490
up the Graham Company and said, "I
know you have parts which you paid

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.410
for and made but technically,
they're our property,"

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.790
because they hold the copyright.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.050
So they consider them
to be on permanent loan.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:08.880 position:56%
So they said, "Send us a set of your
part so we can make a copy of them."

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.300
And to this day, if you
rent the ballet from Boosey,

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.350
you get a really bad
Xerox of our parts

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.260
because they just--
So that's changing.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.380
But Copland himself-- Copland

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.970
for a long time preferred
the orchestral version.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.620
And if you listen to it,
I mean, it sounds a lot

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.310
like the other stuff he
was doing at that time.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.170
It sounds like "Rodeo"
and "Billy the Kid".

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:32.420
It's very much of that time period
and the same use of the orchestra.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.510
It wasn't until the late '60s that
some friends of his convinced him

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.780
that people wanted to hear at
least the chamber orchestration

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.730
that didn't had value of its own.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:46.610
And so, in 1972, what he did
was he took the edits he made

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:51.480
to make the orchestral suite, he
made the same edits to the ballet

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.660
so that you now have
a 13-instrument suite.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.190
So the same musical material
as the orchestral version

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.040
but the original orchestration.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.340
And then, for a couple of decades,

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.540
a lot of people grew
up knowing it that way.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.830
As a young conductor, we
all know the 13-instrument

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.630
"Appalachian Spring" suit
because it's on every audition.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.260
When you're putting together
an audition tape to go

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.980
to graduate school, 13 players
is really easy to get together.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.140
So every young conductor
in my day, you know,

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.170
grows up knowing that suite.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.090
And in the ballet version,
hearing that extra music and some

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.470
of you heard this afternoon,
others will hear it tonight,

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.730
but there's about 6 minutes in
the middle of "Simple Gifts"

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.430
where you go, "Where
did that come from?

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.530
I have never heard
that music before.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.310
Is that even Copland?"

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:39.210 position:56%
But it gets very complicated because
there were other versions of things.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:43.060
Copland orchestrated some but
not all of the missing music

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.790
in the 1950's and some
conductors like to put that--

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.560
put a big insert into the
suit and then some people

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.720
like to put the same insert
into the 13-instrument suit.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.690
There's a version that
Boosey has been publishing

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.950
which they say is complete
which isn't really complete.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.220
It's a long story, but we're in
the process of rectifying that

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.520
and maybe I'll get to that later.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.820
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Well, sure.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.010
Well, in addition to these
issues that have to do

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.430
with instrumentation, there are
of course the production costs

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.520
and thoughts, you know,
that have to do

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.190
with the creation of
a large dance work.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.940
And maybe Libby you can speak to
that alone or just about what types

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.240
of things people have to think

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.960
about when they're putting
together these things.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.620
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: Well,
I think in think

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.620
in the initial even
conversations between the composer

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.890
and the choreographer
to find that place

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.920
of working together is essential.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:37.890
And I am still in awe of some of
the ones, the examples we have

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.290
where they're carrying
this correspondence

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.860
on by mail across,
you know, an ocean.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.580
And I think about in the
Library of Congress materials,

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.950
we have a collection of
correspondence between Ruth Page,

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:57.460
who is sort of a Ballet Russe
generation, Chicago dancers,

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.910
choreographer who is
really interested

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.810
in getting herself on the map.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:06.290
It's a very interesting piece
in itself a small correspondence

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:12.960 position:56%
with a composer named Remi Gassmann,
who was interested in working

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.260
with her, but this-- he was
living in Strasbourg at the time

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.700
when she was trying to
get this group together,

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.790
even getting a rehearsal
piano score,

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.070
she couldn't do to try this out.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:32.620
And it seemed to end up being a
correspondence about composers

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.710
that can't meet deadlines,
which of course we have

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.820
with the Martha Graham as well

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.780
because we have the problem
with the "Dark Meadow".

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:48.300
And again, Carlos Chavez was in
Mexico busy being a conductor now

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.740
of a major symphony and even
though he had a great track record

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:58.160
of having composed just
myriad pieces, it just seemed

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.550
as though this wasn't going
come to the finish line.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.080
And, you know, there is some
interesting correspondence

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.010
in the Spivak collection
at the Library of Congress

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:10.350
where finally he's
pulling the plug saying,

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:14.960
"We have to get Darius Milhaud
because he meets the deadline."

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.590
And, you know, so artistic
concerns at that point are going

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:22.470
out the window because
you've got a fixed deadline

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.540
for putting on a show.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.770
And I don't know that, you know,

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:30.560
clearly the "Appalachian
Spring" example is a better model

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.230
and even Aaron Copland couldn't
meet the initial deadline

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.340
because the debut was
about a year late,

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.670
I think, from what they thought.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.090
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: This is a--
I mean, speaking from experience,

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:45.750
this is a very common thing
for composers to be late

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.050
on these types of things.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:51.000
So I don't-- while we, you know,
we talk about Chavez not being able

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.320
to get it done, I don't-- I can
kind of understand a little bit.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Copland said, it
was part for the course for Chavez--

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.300
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Oh,
with the-- well, sure.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.050
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber He was frequently
late and incommunicado, so.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.350
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Yeah.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:03.650
Well the-- And then you
have people like Milhaud

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.710
who did have the reputation
of just writing.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.240
So, prolifically and
easily and he did.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.930
He actually produced it so
quickly that it was no problems.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.870
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: You talked about
the mechanics of all of this.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.350
And I'll add two things to sort
of bracket this discussion.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.520
So, what we're talking
about this period is--

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.000
particularly in the '40s with
Martha Graham as she was working

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.890
with better known composers the way
she worked as David indicated was

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.590
to send this scenario,
description of the dance

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.180
and the composer would
work from that

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.140
and then send the dance
back previously.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.430
So, one of the great things about
the Martha Graham Dance Company is

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.790
that from about 1935
until 1975, all--

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:43.970
I think, all but three of Martha's
new dances used commissioned music,

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.520
new music and almost
all new American music.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.220
It's a really unmatched
record of support

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.300 position:56%
for American contemporary composers.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.860
And so, from my point, that's
a wonderful thing to work with.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.930
The way she started in 1935

00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:00.180
with commission music was her
music director Louis Horst,

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.760
who was a very influential figure
in not only modern dance music

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.570
but modern dance as well.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:11.350
If you go back to Graham's mentors,
Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn,

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.920
and people-- other people
like Isadora Duncan,

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.900
turn of the century modern dance,

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.950
the way they made a dance was
they'd find something nice

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.500
by Satie [assumed spelling]
that has some full orientalism

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.430
and they'd add some
scarves and some incense

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:26.240
and they would decorate the music
and that was their idea, I mean,

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.810
I'm simplifying a bit, but
they would decorate the music.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.910
And Horst was one of the
first people to say, "Yeah,

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.790
if you want to be taken seriously,
if you want this modern dance

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.210
to be taken seriously,

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.760
the choreographer's
ideas have to come first.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.550
And you can't go find existing
music and fit your ideas it.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.940
You have to have your ideas and the
music will fit it like a frame."

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.400 position:56%
And so from 1935 until that 1940,
41, a lot of people who wrote scores

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.810
for Graham were friends with
Louis who would come in and work

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:55.820
with Graham in the studio

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.990
so that while she was
improvising movement phrases,

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:03.010
they would be improvising at the
piano and finding things that fit.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.560
And then, when she had the
final shape for her dance,

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.480
then the composer would
find the final shape.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.940
But that false apart in the '40s
because Aaron Copland isn't going

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.870
to sit in the studio for weeks
on end while Graham improvises.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.800
But-- So, and the other
thing to bracket that though,

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.810
with all this long distance
and the correspondence,

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.430
Martha Graham was doing a pair
of pieces, one called "Sarabande"

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:28.300
and one called "Deep Song" and
the composer was Henry Cowell.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.550
Graham and Louis Horst
that time were working

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:32.480 position:56%
at Bennington-- Bennington, I think?

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.080
Was it Bennington or
was it Connecticut?

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.300
I forgot. They were
somewhere over New England.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.670
And Henry Cowell was in California
and not only was he in California,

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.860
he was in prison in California.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.830
He was in San Quentin and still
wanted to follow the commission.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.130
Do you-- have you heard this?

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.430
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: No.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.730
This is fascinating.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.760
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: So, Horst and
Graham flew out to California

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.650
to meet him and-- in San Quentin,
Martha Graham demonstrates some

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.640
of what she has in mind
for the dance and talks him

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.500
about what her ideas are and how
this all work and then they leave.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:09.400 position:56%
And what Cowell does is he-- a while
later, sends back east a packet

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:15.710
of music, a series of, I think,
13 or 14 melodic fragments and 8

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:18.310
or 9 percussion fragments
to join them.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:22.010
And he says, "I wrote these in
the style of what you showed me.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.940
Now that you know what
he finish dance is,

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.670
you should arrange them the way you
want them and put them in the order

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.970
that matches what Martha did."

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.510
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: That's great.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.810
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: And they did it.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.110
Yeah.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.410
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Wow.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.710
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Yeah.

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.110
So, that's the extreme of
not being in the same place.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.360
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Well, you know,
I'm speaking to that relationship

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.640
and it's amazing that there they
had an identified relationship

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.940
that worked well.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:51.950
One thing I want to mention before
we kind of shift back to 1944

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:57.380
through '46 and beyond, is just
the Library's earliest commission--

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.340
dance-related commission, I'm kind
of counting them as dance related

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.530
if there was a component that
came out of it and that would be

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:08.690
"Apollo Musage`te" Stravinsky.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:13.020
And Adolf Bolm was the original
choreographer and the dancer

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.460
who was involved in this
has a bit of a strange story

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:22.600 position:56%
and that his choreography is not
the one that is known for that work.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.980
In fact, it was Balanchine,
I think, whose choreography

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.110
and also renamed it as "Apollo".

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:33.630
And that that became the
way that we know that work

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.600
that was originated
here and performed here.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:41.490
But that's kind of a case where
somewhere in that process,

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:45.600
something-- I don't know the
full story, so I'm not sure how

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.440
that happened, but
something went array.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.520
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: So, anyone who
wants to look at a research topic

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.820
that would be publishable.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.120
This sounds like one?

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.470
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Yeah, right?

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:57.950
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: But
that's interesting too

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.290
because it was Ruth Page,
who later was, you know,

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:04.040 position:56%
ascending as a Chicago-based dancer.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.850
And Adolf Bolm also
was Chicago based.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:13.020
And I've sort of wondered, you
know, whether just their location,

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:18.980
when dance as a center in New
York seem to be so important that,

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.740
you know, the ones
on the sort of edges,

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.110
because San Francisco
had its stars too,

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.990
which we just don't
know as much about.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:28.830
So, there are lots of things
to consider, but that's--

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.130
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Yeah.

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:31.430
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel -- that's a
really good question because--

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.730
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar
That's-- that also--

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:37.400 position:56%
speaking of that same thought was
actually articulated by Dakin Hearts

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.190
at our Noguchi lecture
just the other night.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:48.180 position:56%
And he used images of these costumes
that Noguchi had designed for Page.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:52.630
But felt that, again, that part
of her regionalism was part

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.500
of the reason that she wasn't
able to take off with--

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.710
anyway, that's a bit
of in a side, but OK.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:03.330
But going back to maybe this, just
looking a bit more at this process

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:08.020
of creation, the notion
of a scenario and what

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:12.250
that tells a composer is
an interesting one to me

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.410
because that does not strike me
as terribly specific in terms

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.860
of what kind of information
is being conveyed.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.190
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Well, you need
you to look at the scenarios

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:20.930
that Graham sent Copland.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:24.110
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Well, maybe
you can speak to that a bit.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.800
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: Well, she
started out with some curious ideas

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.680
that might not be seemingly
a hit now.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.550
There was a speaking character
in Native American that she had.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.180 position:56%
She had-- It was much more episodic.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.900 position:56%
So for example, there was an episode

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:45.300
of John Brown's uprising
at Harpers Ferry.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.600
There was a lot.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.820
It could have been, you
know, a three-hour melodrama.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.640
And, you know, Copland would
write back and go, "Well,

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.630
this is an interesting part."

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.060
And kind of give her a feedback

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.480
and she'd do another iteration
and kind of move along.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:05.160
In fact, I think she tried out
the "Medea" idea as well with him.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.460
And he was like that's--

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.760
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Right.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.060
Before they got to
"House of Victory".

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.360
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: Exactly.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.660
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: She was very
interested in "Medea", but--

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.960
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: In "Medea" and
he said, "That's really not me.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.260
That's not a good fit."

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.560
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: She sent
him "Medea" in New England.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.300
So, it wasn't quite the
"Medea" that we got that far.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.600
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: No.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.900
No. Not at all.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.350
But at any rate, she sort
of would try out these ideas

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:27.130
and I am a believer that
whether you're writing

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:29.590
or choreographing a
good editor, when you--

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:36.330 position:56%
trust is a great thing to have and I
think this is where we see a really,

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:41.730
sort of a trustworthy relationship,
where she was getting back frank

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.640
but very helpful feedback.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.060
And, you know, that played to both
of their strengths ultimately.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.510
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar Please go ahead.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:52.740
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: But the--
Then the interesting--

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.410
the end to that though is, first of
all, if you look at the last script

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:58.830
that she sent him and you
sit there with the score,

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:02.680
you can through almost line by line
and see what Copland was doing.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.630
Copland, at this point,
he was working on--

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:05.990
working a story out in Hollywood.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.930
He was doing film scores.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:13.500 position:56%
And so, he was basically scoring the
final scenario that Graham sent him.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.800 position:56%
And then, what's really interesting,

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.130
not only did Copland not know the
name of the ballet until they got

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:18.710
down here, he didn't even see it.

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.870
He didn't see nothing of the
ballet until the dress rehearsal,

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.690
the night before it opened.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:26.470
And what he didn't know was
when Graham got the score back,

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.850 position:56%
it took her in different directions.

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:32.430
And so, things that she described
in great detail to Copland,

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:35.730
she decided to do something
totally different with that music.

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.470
He was OK with that though.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:39.920
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: I
think that your mentioning

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.850
of film scoring though is an
important one just to bear

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.910
in my mind in terms of that level
of trust that one must have,

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:53.240
at some point, in terms of one's
ability to realize either something

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:58.290
as scripted or a scenario that
is suggested versus the types

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:02.530
of demands that he was becoming
used to in terms of the--

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:06.430
meaning how you literally deal with
time and use those as constraints

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:10.970
as opposed to necessarily-- things
that could be a bit more loose

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:13.400
in terms of those timings.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.490
That's for composers.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.280
So especially, if you'd say
chamber music composers.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.230
Time is an issue but it's not
something that is so much,

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:27.750
something that is prescribed
from on high,

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.440
unless you're commissioning
agreements as, you know,

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.160
that you have to have
a 23-minute work.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.290
But of course that
never works out anyway.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:38.190
But those-- Composers
respond very differently

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:41.400
when they're collaborating
with others

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.990
or if they're working
on a film score.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:46.920 position:56%
So it's just something to bear in
mind that it's a different type of--

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.150
way of thinking about it and
some people are able to rise

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:53.070 position:56%
to that challenge while others are--
don't that we usually don't hear

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.650 position:56%
about those who don't, so that's OK.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:57.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Well, but that's--
I mean, that's Carlo Chavez, right

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.680 position:56%
I mean, Graham sent him the scenario

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.090
and when she finally got the music
back late, she listened to it

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.810
and said, "This has nothing
to do with what I sent him.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.470
I can't possibly dance that dance."

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:11.000
And so, she had to makeup
something completely different

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.310
to go with that music.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.200
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar:
Speaking to that, I just--

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.540
this kind of shows that I
have a review from the premier

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.800
of the Chavez here
that I pulled out.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:26.180
This is not an advocation of the
content of it, but just rather

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.620
to show what's on the issues were.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:35.400
It says, basically-- let's see.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.700
I'm sorry.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.000
"The work was commissioned

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.890 position:56%
for the Elizabeth Spring Collage
Foundation's festival at the Library

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:43.530
of Congress in 1944, but Carlos
Chavez did not complete the musical

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:44.830
score in time."

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.780
So, this is common knowledge
apparently at this point.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.650
"Whether or not he has yet
completed, it would be difficult

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.570
to answer from last
night's presentation.

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:57.660
It is utterly without theatrical or
a choreographic quality, pure paper

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.740
and ink music and long
stretches of it sound

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.780
like so many pages
out of [inaudible]."

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:05.200
That's a bit-- I don't feel
that way about [inaudible],

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.110
either like it's not--
he's much malign.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:12.260
But-- sorry, the part I
wanted to get to you was that,

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.610
"Ms. Graham has been able
to make a dance composition

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:17.390
against it is inexplicable.

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.910 position:56%
It's rhythmic plan and it's
phrasing are tenuous in the extreme.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:24.400
But she has justified them by
the almost constant employment

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.910
of a free choreographic
counterpoint,

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.740
which not only avoids
a totally static stage

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.650
but actually creates
a certain excitement.

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:36.400
What she has done is a miracle of
sheer invention, but invention not

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:41.330 position:56%
on an intellectual plain, but on the
subjective level of pure intuition."

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:44.380
So, it's kind of an interesting
thing that there was a sense

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:50.380 position:56%
of disjunction or something like
that that was perceived at that time

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.520
but still an appreciation for what

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.330
that final product
still ended up being.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:59.440
So, there you have that.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.230
So, one other-- all
right, let's see.

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:12.790
I think that the-- I'll come
back and mention a few more

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:15.660
of the other commissions
that have been done.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:19.260 position:56%
But I think one thing that would be
interesting to hear both of you talk

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.070
about a bit more is-- OK.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:25.720
Let's say that there's this
agreement between choreographer

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.120
and composer and things are moving
along and you get to a point,

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.350
we'll even kind of gloss over
the stages of piano score

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:37.530
versus having a full score if
it's differently orchestrated.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:41.780
What about the process of
rehearsal and putting it together?

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.140
Maybe you can speak about some
of the challenges that come--

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.650
that are maybe unique to dance

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:51.330
and realizing these
types of new projects.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.860
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: Well,
from my standpoint, I'm--

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.280
what I'm also seeing is that a lot

00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:02.050 position:56%
of people now are using recorded
music and dancers almost get a sense

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:06.080
of even what the spaces
are between those pauses

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.440
and it becomes very organic.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:16.640
And there's something lost,
I think, in terms of the sort

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.150
of performative presence
of really being able

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:23.200
to commune with the accompaniment.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.220
Which isn't to say that they aren't
wonderful because oftentimes,

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:30.200
they can't afford anything but
recorded music but, you know,

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.240
I think we all even know on
our little iPhones, you know,

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.940 position:56%
that we can even know how much space
it is before our next favorite song

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.330
kicks in, what that time is.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:45.980
We get to know that and it
becomes then maybe more mechanical.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:52.500
And a number of choreographers such
as Mark Morris who likes to perform

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.160
with the live music and tours
with, usually, with his own group

00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:01.600
if he can, is that he has them
record many different versions

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.300 position:56%
and just pop these in as a surprise.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.770
So, you know, tonight,
we're using this one.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:10.860
And so, they get that sense that
it's still the same orchestration,

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:15.760
it's the same set of musicians,
but that human thing of, you know,

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.340
never being able to do it exactly
the same a second time means

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.230
that they have to be listening.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:26.720
And he really does respect
the musicality of dancers.

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.090
And that's what he's also looking

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:30.590
for when he's even
choosing his dancers.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:35.200
But, you know, then we have Merce
Cunningham, who works completely

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.540
against that in a sense
that, you know,

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:42.170
he doesn't let the dancers
do rehears to a, sort of,

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:46.410
mechanical stopwatch-driven time.

00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:50.570
And that music is going to come--
or accompaniment or sound score

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:54.590
or whatever it is that Merce
Cunningham would've commissioned

00:34:54.590 --> 00:35:00.190
that was made separately from
the dance and would be imposed

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:03.190
at the same time for
the dress rehearsal.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:09.990
And then, he's hoping that
that internal ability to move

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:14.310
and to hear it within yourself,
irrespective of what's happening

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:17.720
on the outside or the
coughs in the audience,

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.840
that it's going to be the same.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.440
And so, he's actually going for
something that's replicable,

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.000
which is an interesting,
very different aesthetic.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.300
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: That's
interesting.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.600
So, two things.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.990
So first of all, I was grinning

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:33.290
when you told the story
about Mark Morris.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:36.980
I haven't heard that story but
that's been my dream for years.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.370
I mean seriously, because we--
the Martha Graham company,

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.830
we perform with orchestra
whenever we can, but it's--

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:44.610
it hasn't been nearly as
much as when I started.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:46.280 position:56%
And a lot of it has to do with money

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.310
and they've got recordings
and it goes that way.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:51.530
And I've always thought, you know,
recordings wouldn't be so bad

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.490
if you had a few different ones
where you can switch them up.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.950
So I think it's incredible
to hear that.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:01.550
The other thing with Merce
though is, Merce, I think,

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:05.190
is creating the conditions
for the audience

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.130
to have an artistic experience.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:13.930
So, for him, the-- in my
understanding, the dance

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:18.100 position:56%
and the music happens simultaneously
but don't really relate other

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.780
than the fact that they
may stop and start--

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.520
start and stop at the same time.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:25.690
And for him-- you're right, I mean,
I've seen those dancers rehearse

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:26.990
with the timings and
with all that so

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:29.530
that they could do that repeatedly.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:35.030
And I think what's interesting for
him is how the audience perceive

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:38.080
that interaction of
those two artistic things

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.440
happening simultaneously.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.840
But not really interacting.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.450
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: One question
about that is, is there--

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.980
so saying the early
work of this nature,

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.400
was their foreknowledge given
to an audience member or would--

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:57.100
of this sense of lack of
intended interactivity

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.390
versus whether they're
actually, you know--

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:03.790
whether that coincides with what
they're actually experiencing?

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:08.820
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: When he started
doing that, it was clear that he

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:13.920
and the designer and the
composer would get together

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.140
and they would talk about
what is the concept.

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:20.440
So there would be a
concept and then agreed.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.700
And often oftentimes, the
title can give it away.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.000
You've got birds.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.330
You've got island.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.150
You've got points in space.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:33.570
And, you know, you do see that
there are evocative parts in term--

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:38.080 position:56%
when you hear the sound score or
you see the costumes as well as the,

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:41.690
you know, whatever creature
movements that he has.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:49.680
But I do think it's-- it asks
something different, you're right,

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.070
of the audience to-- that
it is a different kind

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:55.390
of aesthetic experience.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:38:01.500
And it requires a different kind
of dancer because you almost have

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:06.070
to train relational
phrasing out of you.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:11.980
It has to come just from the
body to body in space and not,

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.080
you know, what you're hearing.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.840
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: But from the
standpoint of an audience number,

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.560
those relationships, I think,
are constructed in the process

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:24.120
of experiencing the work
for whatever that's worth.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.200
And it might just be, you
know, that that's the end.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.500
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Right.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.100
And I think that's
what he was going for.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.450
I had a long discussion about
this with Beverly Emmons,

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:34.850
wonderful lighting
designer for dance who've--

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:36.150
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: She's wonderful.

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.450
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: -- who's
worked with Cunningham

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:38.750
and also has worked
with the Graham Company.

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:40.050
But she said some wonderful things

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:43.250
that I never considered
in exactly this vain.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:47.810
And her opinion was that
Merce wanted the art

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:49.910
to happen in the audience.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:53.030
He's setting up these conditions,
the interaction of the dance

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:55.940
and the music and the lighting
and whether he rolled the etching

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:57.860
to get something that
night or whatever.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:01.710
I mean, because he did
that-- oh yeah, right.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:03.830
I mean sometimes they
pick, you know, costumes

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:08.440
or light plots depending on roll
of the dice for that evening.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.740
But what-- But Beverly said,
which made a lot of sense to me,

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.810
was that he was about then the
audience being able to perceive

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:20.310 position:56%
that interaction in real time to see
those bits coming together in ways

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:24.020 position:56%
that they may never have come
together before and may never again.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.140
So, locating the artistic
experience,

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.010
the audience is not just
receiving the performance

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:32.160
but in some sense the performance
is happening in the audience,

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.460
that artistic experience.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:37.760 position:56%
I should definitely say [inaudible].

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.060
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: This is all--

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:44.600
well maybe bringing it
back to the case were,

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.910
like say in "Appalachian Spring"

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.840
where the coordination
is fairly clear.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.490
What are some of the
challenges that, again,

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:56.320 position:56%
now that you've been doing it for so
many years and have that experience,

00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:00.070
it's probably not as challenging
as it was when you first started,

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.380
but maybe you can speak
to some of those things

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:06.230
because there's the practical
nature of being able to coordinate

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:09.570
between the musicians
that you're directing

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:11.220
and what's happening on stage.

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.520
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Right.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.820
And then-- well, there's several
aspects to that and some of it,

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:17.740
I mean, following on what was said
before about live music and sort

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:22.830
of some of the uncertainties that
introduces, first of all, I mean,

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:25.920
we're so grateful to any
presenter in the Library

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.170
to be able to have live music.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:31.430
I'm always reminded Joan
Acocella who writes about dance

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:34.870
for "The New Yorker" and
some wonderful articles.

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:38.770
She said, and I think this is
true, "Dancers move about twice

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:41.410
as interestingly to live music."

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:46.370
And she said, "We can become
used to camp music the way

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:49.880
that we become used to smog
instead of air and we get used

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.460
to Spam instead of ham, but that

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.950
when you suddenly have
the real thing,

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:57.050
it reminds you what
you've been missing."

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.680
That happened to have been a review
of some Martha Graham performances

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.820
that didn't mentioned me at all
but it's still my favorite review.

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:07.440
I was never involved in because I
think that's so true what she said.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.620
And following on that-- following
on this idea of interaction,

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:16.090
when I first started in '98,
the dancers I was working

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:18.090
for the first couple of years,
it's a very interesting mix

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:20.790 position:56%
of fairly new dancers of the company

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.960
and some dancers who'd
been there for a long time.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.950
When I was here in 1998,
I mean, Christine Dakin

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:27.970 position:56%
and Terese Capucilli were my brides.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:29.930
Janet Eilber was the
pioneering woman

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:32.200
in her last performance
with the company.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.060
So, there was some of that going
on and then there were, you know,

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.390
younger kids who've just joined.

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:39.850
The younger kids all
came up to me and saying,

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:41.890
"Are you taking the same tempos
that are on the recording?

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:43.190
Are you following the recording?"

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:44.490
They were very worried about this.

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:45.790
I said, "Well, yeah.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:47.090
I'll try to."

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.350
And Terese and Christine
said, "You know,

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:52.470
as long as what you do is
musical, we'll dance to it."

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:56.800
And they, as performers,
craved that difference.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.100
They didn't want it the same.

00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.660
They didn't want it predictable.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.090 position:56%
They wanted it in that range, right.

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:05.160
Something is too slow and
something is too fast,

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.050
but there's a range
and there are things.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:11.320
And so even this afternoon, those
of you who saw the performance,

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.620
the first bride solo [humming].

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.750
I was a little slow today.

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:18.150
I didn't get the tempo
quite where I wanted at.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:20.820
And the dancer in that, for
those 2 minutes, you know,

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:23.690
have to find a way to make
those tempos work and find--

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:25.470
and not just rely on
I know it's this step

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:26.770
and this step and this step.

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:29.410
But how do I stretch this a little
How do I give this a little more

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:31.060 position:56%
weight to fit with that I'm hearing?

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:37.080
And not that I consciously try
to surprise them in that way but,

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.820
you know, we're not automatons.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.940
Every performance I do
is slightly different.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.500
I think I have a very
good sense now with most

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.200
of these dances about
what that ranges.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.260
Sometimes, I like a side of that
range that's a bit different

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.730 position:56%
from where the recording that
they're used to and that's something

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:53.640
that they've gotten used
to with me over the years.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.790
This is going to be a little
different with orchestra but it is

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:58.930
that process and things
are different

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:00.400
and things happen on stage.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.710
So we had a discussion--
this is a small sample just

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:05.760
about timing and things.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.690
If you were at the
performance this afternoon,

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.830
you'll notice that after the
big Medea's dance of vengeance,

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:13.420
which is the big stormy center of
that piece of that Barber piece

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.310
and she runs off stage,
there's a big boom

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.410
in the orchestra, and
we got a plause.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:20.980
That almost always happens
when we do it with live music,

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.280
not necessarily with tape.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.740
But I had to warn--
there's still a dancer

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.850
on stage and the dance continues.

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:28.990
So, I said to the woman
dancing the chorus, I said--

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:30.330 position:56%
because we haven't done this before.

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:32.950
I said, "If there's
a plause, just wait.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:34.250
I'm going to wait for you.

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:35.930
Wait for the applause to
die and I'm not going to on

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:37.720
until I see you start to move,"

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.220
because with the recording,
she's got to go on.

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.420 position:56%
You can't pause the recording there.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.210 position:56%
So even just little things like
that, things about working together,

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:49.920
things about knowing what I'm
looking for to pick up a tempo

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.270
or to queue the beginning
of a section,

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:55.030
the things that develop over time.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.330
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Sure.

00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:59.810
Well, one thing I wanted to
make sure that I mention is

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:02.940
that the three performances
that you're hearing is--

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:06.070
included the premiere or the
world premiere last night

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:10.860
of a new choreography that
was commissioned by the Irving

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.260
and Verna Fine Funds in
the Library of Congress

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:18.270
with the Martha Graham Dance
Company and by Pontus Lidberg

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:20.030
and that he was here last night.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.590
Yeah. He was here.

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:23.890
Oh, great.

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:28.210
And-- So, when-- in this
case, it's using the music

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:33.220
of Irving Fine slight changes in
terms of order but not in terms

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.930
of substance or, you
know, that much.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:38.850
So there is a sense of reference
that you had as supposed

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:41.180
to a newly commissioned work.

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:45.660 position:56%
But actually in terms of how it came
together, was there a difference

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:48.740
with a new work for the
Martha Graham Dance Company?

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:50.040
Was there was a difference
between that

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.510
versus one of the reparatory works?

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:54.740
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Longer
rehearsal period for the dancers,

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.770
and we certainly try, I mean, we
commissioned a number of works

00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:59.460
since Graham died and we try

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.720
to give the choreographer
all the time he needs,

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.590
which can be quite a bit.

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.800
And for the last several weeks, he
was working generally 3 hours a day

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.370
with the dancers to do this.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.280
And even as recently as last
when I went to New York to watch,

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.170
some of the dance was not complete
and that's not unusual either

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:17.210
for things to come
together very last minute.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:21.210
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar:
Well, I thought for now,

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:24.920
we could actually take some
questions if that's good?

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.620
And if you could wait until
a microphone comes to you.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:28.960
It will be on its way.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.500
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:36.430 position:56%
Hi. My question actually isn't about
the music, it's about the costumes

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:40.650
and I'm curious what happened
to the original costumes?

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:45.800
And any stories about reproducing
them and in particularly the fabric

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.960
that these long dresses
that flow so beautifully

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.910
in which Martha Graham
loved the image of.

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:56.420
So I thought, Libby
you may know something

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.600
about the costume and the fabrics?

00:45:58.600 --> 00:45:59.900
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: I think, probably,

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:02.590
you know more about
the costume and--

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:03.890
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Right.

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:07.860
So, Graham designed most of the
costumes for most of her dancers

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.950
at least until the later years.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:16.910
And if you talk to our customers,
she was actually very ahead

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:20.260
of her time in the way she used
fabrics and the way she cut

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:24.230
and sewed them to get certain types
of movement out of the fabrics.

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:26.180
And so, obviously,
we've reproduced these--

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:29.300
a lot of these costumes many
times in the intervening decades

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.350
and it's always a challenge
to find--

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:33.840
because often, the materials
she use isn't made anymore.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.690
And so to try to find
something that's similar

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:39.430
and will react the similar way when
it's cut and bound a certain way.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:40.730
You asked about the
original costumes.

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:42.030
So if you've seen, I
think, there are pictures

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.810
out here of the premiere, right?

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:46.330
Right. The costumes that
Graham used at the premiere

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:48.690
of "Appalachian Spring"
are not quite the same ones

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:50.620
that we dance with nowadays.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:54.240
I think they were changed a
few years after the premiere

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.510
and it was something that
Graham just decided to change.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:00.570
And even today, there are a couple

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:02.530
of variations on the
bride's costume.

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:05.560
The young woman this
afternoon wore a lavender one,

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.860
the one tonight is wearing peach.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.590 position:56%
There's a third one I've seen
recently, I can't think what it was,

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:14.330
but those were-- the peach
is more common nowadays.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.350
Graham's original dress was more
of a [inaudible] kind of thing.

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:18.490
You can see it in the photos.

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:21.910
I'm not sure why she's
changed it, but those--

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:25.070
the peach and the lavender
constructed very much the same way.

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:26.760
The plan-- everyone's
costume is very different,

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.770
it was very severe in 1944.

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:35.420
The black with a bonnet and very
sort of Scarlet letter for boating

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.960
and now it's bit more of
a flowing kind of thing.

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:41.430
But yeah, we do-- we
reproduce the set pieces.

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:43.690
This is brand new "Appalachian
Spring", brand new copy of the

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:45.610
"Appalachian Spring" set.

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:47.200
So, we have--

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.480
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:56.170
Well, the originals-- there are
often two originals for the sets.

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:59.750
So often, Noguchi would have
made a sculptural version

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:03.560
that the Noguchi Foundation has
in their home on Long Island.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.280
And then there would have been,
whatever the first set was

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.090
that was made for the
Graham Company.

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:09.940
We still have some of those.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.870
They haven't been tremendously
preserved, but I'll tell you what,

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:15.430
the sets and the costumes
a few years ago

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:19.910
when super storm Sandy hit
New York, we had just moved

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:24.150
in some new studious down the
lower west side of New York

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:28.470
and our basement was flooded and
a lot of stuff was just lost.

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:31.700
It was water-- I mean,
millions of dollars of damage.

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:35.230
Some originals or old
prints, photographs and things

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:39.460
and old costumes and old original
set pieces that Martha had danced

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.850
with and a lot of that
was just lost.

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:47.420
And it's been a slow process
to get some of that back.

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:51.200
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: But I don't think
that it's unreasonable to think

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.730
that these things should
survive 100 years.

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:58.850
You know, they're touring, they're
putting them up in new places

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:00.580
and having to adopt, I mean,

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:05.610 position:56%
not every "Appalachian Spring" stage
is the size of the Coolidge and--

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.260
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: None of them
is the size of the Coolidge.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.640
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: Exactly.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.710
And so, you know, you're
having to adopt all the time

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:15.470
and the dancers also, you
know, Martha is the same size

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:18.340
but you get new dancers and--

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.510
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: She's
on the smaller one.

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:23.540
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: But, you know, the
new dancers come in, the costume,

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:26.810
you're not going to cast according
to who can fit this costume.

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:30.270
So, you often have to make
a new set because your--

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:34.010
the dancers from the 1950's
are a little different sized

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:35.310
than the 1940's.

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:36.610
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Absolutely.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:37.910
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Another thing

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:39.210
that Janet Eilber mentioned
last night was that--

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:42.590
one thing to point out is that the
sets are being used all the time

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:43.890
so that the--

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:45.190
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: They get more--

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:46.490
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: -- dancers
are interacting with them.

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:47.790
So there's actually a
wear and tear factor.

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:50.580
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Yeah.

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:56.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'd like to go back to the
collaboration issue because to me,

00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.510
that-- it's so interesting
to look at the different ways

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:02.080
that collaborations
can come together.

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.490
And of course, you know, funding
money is always an issue for anyone

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:08.740
in the arts whether you're talking
dance, music, some other kind

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.820
of art, funding is always an issue.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:17.450
My background isn't from the dance
side and we did various projects

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:19.360
that started from different places.

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.880
I mean, sometimes it would
start with the choreographer,

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:26.780
sometimes it would start with
the music and then we work

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:29.820
with a composer or someone
arranging the music.

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:32.810
We even did projects where had a
playwright, who would write a play

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:34.350
and then the dancers
would learn the words

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:39.690
and then the composer
would come in after that.

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:42.650
So, could you-- Aaron,
I'm speaking to mostly

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:44.720
because he's the experienced
one here.

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:49.140
Could you comment on, like from
a composer's or conductor's--

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:52.370
composer, David also, what
would be your preference?

00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:54.700 position:56%
Like, how much direction do you want

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:59.030
at the outset before
you start working?

00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:02.200
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Well me, so
from a conductor's point of view,

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:06.580 position:56%
whether I'm working with an existing
score or a new score, I want to have

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:10.370
as much information as
possible about what's in--

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:13.410
my job as a dance conductor
is to support the dance.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:16.130
I love the fact that I'm down
in the pit and no one can see me

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:19.400
and it's all about providing that
lift to the dancer so that you all

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.880
in the audience can enjoy it.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.820
So, what makes my life
easier is knowing as much

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:27.100
as knowing a brain dump from the
choreographer, what's on his mind?

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.400
What are his influences?

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.460 position:56%
What is he hearing in the music
that I should try to go for as well?

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.890
And I've done a few premieres
with the Graham Company

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:38.760
with varying degrees of
that kind of interaction.

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.520
I had generally little
less interaction

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.470
with Pontus on this dance.

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:47.170
We corresponded early on
as he was trying to figure

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:49.760
out which Irving Fine
pieces he wanted to use.

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.530
So I sent him some
thoughts about some

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:52.830
of the ones that he was looking at.

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:56.090
Just, again, from my point of
view information for him to use.

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:59.040
And I went up last week to watch
some rehearsals but even then,

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.840
he seemed hesitant
to tell me too much.

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:06.880
Maybe that's his way of handling
that working relationship.

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:10.300
And he kind of gave me some
images about what was going on,

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.790
but he was very hesitant
to describe a through line

00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:16.130
to the dance or to give it a plot.

00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:19.460 position:56%
So, I'm working with little
snippets of things I hear and trying

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:25.370
to do what I think will
support what he needs.

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:26.910
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Speaking
a little bit to the--

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:30.190
on the compositional
side of things, there--

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:32.840
I would just say this that
every project, I think,

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:37.290
has a different set of rules to
it and they kind of come into play

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:41.410
as you develop the project and it
depends on how people interact.

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:45.570
But one of the challenges, I think,
that in this case with the dancer

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:47.550
and the choreographer-- or
sorry, with the choreographer

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:52.280
and the composer being involved
is that the composition, at least,

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.160
some types of composition tend
to be more of a solitary endeavor

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:59.230
when it comes to the actual
production of the work,

00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:01.390
while there is a bit more
of a social component

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:03.620
to the choreographic
one, where you're working

00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:06.460
with the dancers and having that.

00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:11.060
And so, it really does have to
be some sort of a coming to terms

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.650
with each other and
that just all depends

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:14.550
on the nature of the project.

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:18.460
And I know the people who have
frequent collaborations well,

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:21.140 position:56%
they might-- it might be that they
work out a pattern of how they work,

00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:25.000
but oftentimes they-- each
project demands different types

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.440
of ways of collaborating.

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:30.490
So that's just probably just one
thing to throw out about that.

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:35.900
Another. Oh, we have
one here in the middle.

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:37.200
&gt;&gt; Who's going to go first?

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.500
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Go ahead.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.840
&gt;&gt; OK. I'm just curious about
how the company has changed

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:44.180
over the year as the
world has changed in terms

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.570
of its approached choreography.

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:56.230
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: One of my least
favorite things about the reviews

00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:58.460
that we often get, and I'd love

00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:02.120
to hear your perspective
on this historically.

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.920
A lot of our reviews say,
"Boy, everything was great.

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:10.070
I had a great time but boy, is
that Graham choreography dated."

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:17.230
That is my personal pet peeve
because it is absolutely true

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:20.700 position:56%
that I don't think there are any
choreographers working today working

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:22.280
in the style of Graham,
whether you're talking

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.750
about the specific movements
or whether you're talking

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:27.270
about her sense of theater.

00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:29.550
It's a very overtly dramatic style.

00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:33.750
It's a very narrative style in
most cases that it's very hard

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:36.570
on your sleeve style that I think
it's just not very [inaudible]

00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:38.270
and that's very true.

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:41.630
But nobody is running the
same way Beethoven wrote.

00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:44.080
And we don't call his music dated.

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.630
The ballet steps have been around
for how long and we don't say,

00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:49.280
"Well, I was in Balanchine,
but boy, does that look dated?"

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.580
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: Or play.

00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.880
Same thing with plays.

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.180
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Right.

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.510
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: It's what you're
doing with them rather than--

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:56.310
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Right.

00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:59.040
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.340
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Yes.

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:07.270
Yes. I think there's a
real belief in the company

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:10.800
and I believe this
too that we're not--

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:15.130
we don't want to perform the pieces
the way they are performed in 1944.

00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:17.120
We have to take these
pieces and relate them

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:19.160
to a contemporary audience.

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:23.230
So, yes these dances where
made up 50 years ago and yes,

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:25.760
it's a very different kind
of story telling that we have

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.330
to honor the spirit of that.

00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:29.770
We don't want to change
what Martha did

00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:33.010
but at the same time we're
performing it in the year 2016

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:35.310
for the audience that
have seen decades worth

00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:36.980
of stuff in the interim.

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:40.570
And it-- But to me, it's
not an unusual thing.

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:42.130
It's the same challenge
that, for example,

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:44.360 position:56%
an orchestra faces playing Beethoven

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.880
or playing Copland
or playing Debussy.

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:49.820
You don't play it the
way you did back then.

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:53.660
You take some lessons form back
then, you're presenting a style

00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:56.930
but you can't have that, you
know, one foot in both camps.

00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:59.910
But at the same time, so
as we've done commissions

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:05.980
since Graham's death, there has
been a very active discussion

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:12.380
about what kind of choreographers
to work with to extend that legacy.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:15.250
Are we looking for choreographers
who are consciously working

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:19.580
in something related to
Graham's style in some way?

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:24.130 position:56%
Or are we looking for just good
choreographers and different leaders

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.390
of the company who have
had different viewpoints

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:28.090
on that sort of thing?

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:29.430
But there's very much a sense,

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:31.740
and I know this is something
Janet thinks a lot about is how

00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:37.710
to invigorate these works and make
them not seem like museum pieces

00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:41.820
and make them really just speak
to you in a certain senses as,

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:44.630
you know, as a performer
or as an audience member,

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:46.790
if I'm watching something,
I don't care how old it is.

00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:48.270
I don't care when it was written.

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:49.570
It's all interesting.

00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:52.910
But what I care is does it move me?

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:55.080
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: Also,
I think dance people

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.910
when they are reviving an
older work, they often talk

00:56:58.910 --> 00:57:03.260
about reconstruction which is
possibly the least creative sort

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:05.580
of word to use.

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:09.130
And instead of finding the
life that's within that piece

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:12.250
that made it iconic to start
with, they're, you know,

00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:15.930
they're sort of thinking about
where the feet were instead

00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:20.730 position:56%
of going how do we get the people to
embody the intention of this work?

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:26.510
I mean the emotions, the ideals
of an "Appalachian Spring",

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:32.980
of the "Cave of the Heart" are, you
know, as fresh today as they were,

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:36.770
you know, a thousand years ago
when on the Greekness [phonetic].

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:40.800
And these, you know, people get
angry, they're jealous, they're,

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.220
you know, delighted when
they're married, they're in love.

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:44.590
These are not new things.

00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:49.880
So how do you take the way that
choreographer or the playwright

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:53.690
or the person writing music
or any of those or the opera

00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:58.970
and make it new for, you know,
do what Yo-Yo Ma did for Bach

00:57:58.970 --> 00:58:03.650
in the 21st century audience,
you know, that made it something

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:06.240
that Americans got excited about.

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:09.570
And, you know, so I think
that we have to rethink that.

00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:12.780
We have "Revelations", we
have "Appalachian Spring".

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:18.090
I would say those are two
major American iconic dances.

00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:23.980
And, you know, why do we-- we're
reviving Broadway, you know,

00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:27.160
"Guys and Dolls" that
seems David to me.

00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.460
And yet we find--

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:29.760
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar:
Oh, that's great.

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.060
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: Well, it's great.

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:34.410
It's great stuff but it's still
a lot of the lyrics and stuff

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:37.150
to me seem David in
the 21st century.

00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:38.720
It's still fun to go and see.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:44.710
And so, the challenge for us is
to find similar ways to revive,

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:51.430
re-stage, re-imagine dance that
has been really important to us

00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:53.020
so that we can experience it again.

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:57.160
And I have to say, I think
what Janet and you are doing--

00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:59.380
I've seen "Appalachian
Spring" a lot.

00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:02.750
I've seen, you know, I'm not young.

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:08.580
And I think this was one of the
most delightfully fresh, exciting,

00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:12.040
productions that I can remember
of the "Appalachian Spring".

00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:15.570
So you're to be commended
and Janet as well.

00:59:15.570 --> 00:59:17.520
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: And
it's very interesting.

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:21.410 position:56%
This gets to the historical point as
well and gets to what we're saying

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:23.360
about costumes and
different dancers and things.

00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:26.250
They are always different dancers
coming into these roles, right?

00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:30.270
Now, one thing-- So when I
started with the company,

00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:32.580
the brides I was working
with were Terese Capucilli

00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:33.880
and Christine Daking who were two

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:36.090
of the senior dancers
in the Graham world.

00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:40.980
They've been there since
the late '70s, I think.

00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:45.590
And they brought such a wealth of
experience to that role that I got

00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:48.080
to learn from working with them.

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.560
And then I've worked with
another bride [inaudible]

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:54.320
who is also a senior dancer in the
company in about 10, 12 years ago.

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:58.590
A young dancer named Blakeley
White-McGuire took on the role

00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:04.580 position:56%
and it was a revelation for me
because she was 25 and she wasn't 40

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:07.040
and she was-- and Graham was 50
when the dance was premiered.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.340
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: Was
recording, yeah.

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:11.910
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: But suddenly,
I was seeing things just

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:15.720 position:56%
because she was younger and fresher,
it's a whole different bride

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:19.330
and I started hearing her music in
a whole different way and trying

01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:20.630
to bring something different.

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:26.140
And if you see these performances
today, both brides are very young.

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:27.550
I think the one tonight
seems a little younger

01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:30.990
than the one this afternoon but
these both wonderful dancers,

01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:34.920 position:56%
fresh face, young girls will bring a
whole different dramatic perspective

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.450
to that role that changes-- so you
know, some of what you're saying

01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:41.410
about the immediacy of that, what
we're seeing is some of that.

01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:45.030
You're not seeing the most
seasoned Graham technique laid

01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:48.900
in performance perhaps, but you're
seeing two young performers who are

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:52.230
in love with what they're doing
and will sell that character

01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:55.330
of the bride in tremendous ways.

01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:58.620
So that's part of all of this also
is the different dancers come in

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:01.020
and put their stamp on the role.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.740
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: And I
think we have to see too

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:05.300
that training has changed.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:10.520 position:56%
So, what was really exciting as the
technique was developing in the '30s

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:13.630
and the '40s, then we went
through sort of a period

01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:16.700
of anybody can be a dancer
and now we are, you know,

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.280
everyone who's a dancer has
to be able to hold their leg

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.500
up here because-- so you can be
on "So You Think You Can Dance".

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:26.710
And what we sort of lost
was some of the empathy.

01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:31.680
So the technique, the ability
to do certain things, I mean,

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.730
it's physically off the charts

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:36.390
as the Olympic competitions
are as well.

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:41.050
Physical training has, you
know, just done amazing things.

01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:46.520
But then that interpretive
capacity that really together,

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:49.630
now this is me talking
not the Library or Aaron

01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:55.320
or anybody else but, I mean, I
see virtuosity as being some kind

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:59.380
of a combination between
technique and interpretation.

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:02.880
And that means you could even
have a master work, you know,

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.910
you see it in opera a lot of times.

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:09.830
But there are certain people
that have extraordinary empathy

01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:12.950
with that and bring it to bare.

01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:15.570
And that's kind of what, you
know, that's why we keep going

01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:19.850
to "Appalachian Spring" or a
"Swan Lake" and we see the--

01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:22.080
or "Revelations", you
know, I don't get tired

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.730
of that one either, you know.

01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:28.430
And you kind of look for what
the new cast is bringing to it.

01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:32.520
You see them develop into
it as they make it their own

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:38.620 position:56%
and that's the part that's
exciting and we need better critics.

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:39.920
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Yes.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.500
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: That can see
those things but they're all

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.320
on blogs so we can't take them.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.110
So, I don't know if that will help.

01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:49.640
That's the archivist talking
and ringing her hands.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.940
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: And
I need to write that down

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:53.150
so that we can keep a
record of those things too.

01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:54.860
That's always an interesting thing
to be able to look back as well.

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:56.440
Maybe we have time for
just one more question.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.740 position:56%
We can also get her-- we can do two.

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.040
&gt;&gt; When a commissioning process
starts, does it usually start

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.610
with the select a composer and
then they select a choreographer

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.110
or vice versa or is there other
pattern or how does that work?

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:03.410
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: It
depends very much on the--

01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:04.710
we can speak to it in different
ways, but it depends very much

01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:06.010
on what institution
is initiating that.

01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:07.810
Or if it's coming from an
artist suggestions or--

01:03:07.810 --> 01:03:42.720
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.500
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: Well, the
initial letters from Mrs. Coolidge

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.530
to Erick Hawkins who
had asked in a letter,

01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:52.820
"Do you think you could
commission a fine American composer

01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:55.670
or a notable composer to
write something for Martha?"

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:59.290
And she wrote back really
consciously to one of the letters

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:03.120
from Mrs. Coolidge's in the
display cabinets here, but she--

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.750
and this next one that she
wrote was, "And I don't know

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:10.500
if we could afford a
Copland or a Hindemith."

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:14.390
And in fact, she ended
up doing exactly that.

01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:19.380
But yes, it means budget it's,
you know, who's available?

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:23.670
There was a World War II that was
brewing, which was another problem

01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:29.170
in terms of getting who was able,
you know, to agree to it and--

01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:30.470
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Yeah.

01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:31.770
I think one of the key
things, just to bear in mind

01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:34.740
about the entire process,
is that it doesn't work

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:38.150
if the partners are not
excited about working together.

01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:41.530
Ultimately, if you have
an institution that wants

01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:47.050
to commission composer
X and choreographer Y,

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:50.480 position:56%
if they are not interested in each
other, that's not-- it's not going--

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.000
you're not going to have
something that's worth doing

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.780
and it probably will fall apart.

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:57.570
So, there's this kind of dance
that happens where everybody's kind

01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:00.370 position:56%
of probably-- they don't want to say
that they really like this one close

01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:02.510
if the other person hates
it, you know, or that.

01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:07.830 position:56%
So this whole process goes about and
eventually things tend to go less

01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:10.750
around a particular partner
or things like that and then

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:15.690
of course the greater stature
one has one more weight

01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:19.340
that opinion tends to have.

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:23.580 position:56%
So, they're able to, you know, once
you have a commission with a Copland

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:26.890
or a Hindemith then
you're able to work wisely

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:30.290
with other composers later
too and there's other--

01:05:30.290 --> 01:05:31.590
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: Doors open.

01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:32.890
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Yeah.

01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:34.190
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: I'll add
just one very funny story.

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:36.390
I think about the money
aspect of this.

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:39.130
So Copland, I think,
was paid $500 I think?

01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:40.430
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: That's right.

01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:41.730
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Is that true?

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:43.030
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: Yeah.

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:44.330
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: For
the commission for this.

01:05:44.330 --> 01:05:45.630
Which, you know, in the '40s was--

01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:46.930
it was not a small amount but
also he could have commanded more

01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:49.550
with his stature.

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:52.150
When the Graham Company
performs "Appalachian Spring",

01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:56.090
because the music is copyrighted,
we pay a royalty every time

01:05:56.090 --> 01:05:59.640
through Boosey, to the
Aaron Copland Fund.

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.050
And we also-- and we do it live,
you know, there's also a rental fee

01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:05.120 position:56%
to rent the actual parts and Boosey,

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:07.470
because they understand
the popularity of this work

01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:10.800
and because they have a monopoly,
they tend to charge a lot

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.180
of money for these things.

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:16.810
I mean, we're talking something
like 3 or $400 per performance

01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:21.080
for royalty and another
400 for the parts rental.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:25.580 position:56%
We happen to find about a year ago,
I don't know if you know this story.

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:28.690
We find a lot of interesting things
in our archives in our warehouse

01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:30.960
that surface after decades.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:34.340
There was a correspondence
between Martha and Aaron

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.680
and we have a letter form Copland
that says, "Well, you know,

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:41.210 position:56%
I know that money is difficult for
you and I'm so glad that you're able

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:43.230
to have this piece out
there and perform it.

01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:45.000
And so, let's just
say between the two

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.510
of us $10 a performance
in perpetuity."

01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:51.050
[ Laughter ]

01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:55.170
So we took the letter to Boosey

01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:58.700
and they have their lawyers
look at it very carefully.

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:03.080
And the lawyer said, "Well,
yeah, I guess that's it."

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:07.170 position:56%
So, we don't get-- we're not getting
money back from them unfortunately.

01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:10.450
But now we pay them
$10 of performance.

01:07:10.450 --> 01:07:15.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: I notice they've
been downsized recently, is that--

01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:23.000
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.300
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: OK.

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.600
That's like a three-hour discussion

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:32.580
but the short answer is the
composer has his own relationship

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:37.590
with the publisher and the
copyright to the music travels--

01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:39.420
and it can be arranged differently.

01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:41.870
A commissioned organization
can undertake

01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:44.600
to own the rights to these things.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.680
But in general, and certainly
with all the Graham things,

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.560
the copyright to the
music travels differently

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.520
from the copyright to the dance.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:52.280
That's the very short answer.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.480
&gt;&gt; David H. Plylar: The difference
is if you have a work for hire,

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:57.370
then the composer gives
up those rights.

01:07:57.370 --> 01:07:59.170
But the Library does not do that.

01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:00.700
So the composer always retains--

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.960
or the creator of whatever work
is always retains those rights

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:10.670
with certain allowances for, say,
broadcasters something like that.

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:15.400
So, I think at this point because
there's a long night ahead,

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:19.950
I'd like to thank our guests,
Aaron Sherber and Libby Smigel

01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:22.470
for joining me and having this
very interesting discussion.

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:23.950
So, if you could join
me in thanking them.

01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:25.250
&gt;&gt; Libby Smigel: Thank
you for coming.

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:27.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Aaron Sherber: Thanks for coming.

01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:30.680
[ Applause ]

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:34.340
