an additional factor that has really
 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.940
an additional factor that has really
enabled us to make progress in this

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950
enabled us to make progress in this
 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.649
enabled us to make progress in this
domain and that has to do with the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
domain and that has to do with the
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.459

a number of ways including through

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
a number of ways including through

formal affiliations with a host of
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109
formal affiliations with a host of
international partners and a number of

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119
international partners and a number of
 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.660
international partners and a number of
local partners including the University

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
local partners including the University
 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.550
local partners including the University
of Pittsburgh with whom we've had a very

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
of Pittsburgh with whom we've had a very
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.620
of Pittsburgh with whom we've had a very
long association and so there is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
long association and so there is
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.669
long association and so there is
tremendous urgency for us right now to

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679
tremendous urgency for us right now to
 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.069
tremendous urgency for us right now to
use these different methods to use our

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079
use these different methods to use our
 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.669
use these different methods to use our
expertise to understand the brain and

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679
expertise to understand the brain and
 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.099
expertise to understand the brain and
its alteration so that we can really

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109
its alteration so that we can really
 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.399
its alteration so that we can really
begin to address these diseases that we

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409
begin to address these diseases that we
 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.370
begin to address these diseases that we
see in humans and bring about some kind

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
see in humans and bring about some kind
 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.670
see in humans and bring about some kind
of change for the good
