00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.523
- Which of the following is equivalent

00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:04.589
to the above expression?

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.946
So I have this kind of
hairy-looking expression here,

00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:08.641
and I have a bunch of choices.

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.138
And at least two of the choices

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:13.725
have me factoring this
expression in some way.

00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:15.327
And when you look at this expression

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:18.323
with a factoring lens,
as hairy as it looks,

00:00:18.323 --> 00:00:22.014
you realize that this actually
is a difference of squares.

00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:26.628
That this thing could be rewritten as,

00:00:26.628 --> 00:00:27.815
let me write it this way,

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:31.959
as the product of, actually
let me write it this way first.

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:33.771
This could be rewritten as,

00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:36.801
let me do this in a color you can see.

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:41.801
This part could be rewritten
as a times one over 2x minus y

00:00:44.752 --> 00:00:47.712
and all of that squared,

00:00:47.712 --> 00:00:49.420
because notice if you
have a times a square,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.311
that's the same thing as a squared

00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:52.820
times this thing squared,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.702
which is exactly what you have there.

00:00:54.702 --> 00:00:58.915
And then minus one squared. Right?

00:00:58.915 --> 00:01:01.647
One is the same thing as one-squared.

00:01:01.647 --> 00:01:02.715
And when you write it this way,

00:01:02.715 --> 00:01:05.814
it becomes very clear that this
is a difference of squares.

00:01:05.814 --> 00:01:08.090
Or even better, we can write it like this.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.469
Because a times one over 2x minus y,

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:14.905
that's the same thing
as a over 2x minus y,

00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:19.905
so it's that squared minus one-squared.

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.136
And so let's factor this out.

00:01:23.136 --> 00:01:25.783
This is going to be equal to,

00:01:25.783 --> 00:01:27.478
actually let me write it.

00:01:27.478 --> 00:01:30.054
So it's going to be the
product of two expressions.

00:01:30.054 --> 00:01:32.353
So that's the first one,
that's the second one.

00:01:32.353 --> 00:01:33.699
And this is once again,

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:34.674
if I have the difference squared,

00:01:34.674 --> 00:01:36.359
something squared minus
something else squared,

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.692
it's going to be, this is going to be

00:01:38.692 --> 00:01:43.692
a over 2x minus y, plus this
thing squared, plus one.

00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:51.621
Plus one times a over
2x minus y, minus one.

00:01:54.922 --> 00:01:58.230
Minus. Minus one.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.437
And once again, nothing fancy here.

00:01:59.437 --> 00:02:01.051
This is just the difference of squares.

00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:03.257
You might have remembered
from your algebra class,

00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:07.749
if you have x squared minus y squared

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:12.556
that that's the same thing
as x plus y times x minus y.

00:02:12.556 --> 00:02:16.212
Just in this example, x is
a fairly hairy expression,

00:02:16.212 --> 00:02:18.313
and y is just the number one.

00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:21.054
But it's the exact same
thing that's going on here.

00:02:21.054 --> 00:02:22.237
And if you look at the choices,

00:02:22.237 --> 00:02:25.175
and if the term difference of
squares seems foreign to you,

00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:28.053
search for it on Khan Academy,
it's a good place to review.

00:02:28.053 --> 00:02:29.668
But if we look at the choices,

00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:31.270
this is exactly what we have here.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.557
They just swapped the order of these

00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:36.134
two expressions being multiplied.

00:02:36.134 --> 00:02:38.374
A over 2x minus y minus one.

00:02:38.374 --> 00:02:41.752
times a over 2x minus y plus one.

00:02:41.752 --> 00:02:44.382
So that's that choice right over there.
