00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.580
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.580
I remember it so you don't have to!

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.460
Y'know, I found myself searching for something deeper and more meaningful in life,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.760
so I decided to turn to the master of enlightenment himself, the Dalai Lama.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.720
I found a video where he talks about how compassion is not a sign of weakness,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.800
and the responsibility one has backing their actions with the undeniable truth.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.400
So moved by these incredible words,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.700
I was a little shocked to find that only 2,000 people actually viewed this video.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.720
Really?

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.360
The worldly known teacher of Buddhism only has a little over 2,000 hits?

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.440
Hmm.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.280
Well, after that I decided I needed something a little bit more light-hearted.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.680
So I put on this dumb shit.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.800
"HEEYEAAYEAAYEAYEA HEEEYEEAYEA"

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.360
"I SAID HEY"

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.680
And was a little shocked to find that not only did it have over 2,000 hits,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.320
but it had... well, this amount.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.760
And that's for the 5 HOUR version of this video.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.920
Why do we love stupid?

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.760
I don't mean the fads that are popular for a short amount of time,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.280
I mean legitimately timeless, hilarious stupid.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.200
I'm talking about the Ren and Stimpys, the Dumb and Dumbers, the Monty Python's Flying Circuses,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.280
those ridiculous YouTube videos that make no sense but for some reason

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.240
still get a big laugh out of you every time.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.320
What is it that can make things we know are idiotic good?

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.920
Like, we know THIS is stupid and doesn't make us giggle:

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.160
"I feel like a duckbill platypus! *duck noises*

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.720
but we also know that THIS is stupid, and for some reason makes us laugh our asses off.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.920
"Wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world?"

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.560
*the most annoying sound in the world*

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.240
"GUYS! GUYS!"

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.960
These things don't effort and focus as Abbott and Costello's brilliant writing,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.440
or Buster Keaton's unbelievable stunts.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.440
It's just...

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.120
stupid!

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.920
So, why are we so lenient to certain stupid routines, and yet so harsh on others?

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.960
Why do we laugh so hard at something 2 year old would laugh just as hard at?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.720
Well, let's first understand why the hell we laugh to begin with.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.640
In my opinion, I think it's a defense mechanism.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.040
I, as well as many comedians, have said that all comedy is based on misery.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.760
Well, the reason for that is if we didn't have comedy,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.120
all we would do is sit around and feel bad about the stuff happening around us.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.160
Comedy helps us confront the bad things in front of us and cope with it.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.160
I'm sure a lot of people were, in one or another, were injured in a similar way the Three Stooges were

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.280
in many of their shorts.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.920
Hell, Houdini died by a blow to the stomach, but we don't think the Stooges are going too far

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.760
when they punch one another in the stomach.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.960
Why? Because it's saying that suffering is a part of life.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.440
And by laughing at it, you acknowledge that, though painful, it's all part of the journey.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.040
It's a way to adjust to the bad things happening around us and move on.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.880
Okay, fair enough, but does something like this:

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.280
"HEEEYEEAAYEAYEAYEA!!!"

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.800
connect to misery?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.920
Well, maybe not misery of the character you're watching, but certainly a jolt to your expectations.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.880
We've all seen screamers before.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.320
Those videos that make you think it's one thing and then suddenly -

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.480
A cheap scare pops up and we've all gone through them and they've been done a million times and we're really sick of it,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.360
but admit it: the first time you ever saw one, you felt a burst of life in you.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.880
This comes from an instinct to keep you on your guard like an animal does to prepare for danger.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.240
But when you find out it's not dangerous, you have yourself a good laugh.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.040
It's one of the reasons people like going to scary movies.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.640
Stupid humor is kind of the same way.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.800
While not every silly joke needs to rely on scaring you into laughter,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.880
It still has to rely on playing with your expectations.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.400
That is, relying on the unexpected.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.840
And that rush on trying to get a handle on what's going to happen but never fully getting that grasp

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.800
can be exciting, fun, and of course hilarious!

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.040
In a show like Monty Python's Flying Circus, they THRIVE on the unexpected,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.840
even to a point of insulting your sense of humor.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.200
How long can this sketch keep using the word 'spam'?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.200
"SPAM, EGGS, SPAM, SPAM, BACON AND SPAM,"

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.880
"SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, EGG AND SPAM,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.800
"SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, BAKED BEANS, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, AND SPAM."

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.760
Just when you think something in them has to know they need to stop, they just keep going!

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.920
(all the vikings together) "Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spammity spam!"

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.400
"Wonderful spam!"

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.240
Again, playing with the expectation of just when you think something is going to cease,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.200
it surprises you and continues,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.720
making even the repeat of one word suddenly funny again.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.320
"Can I have spam instead?"

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.360
"You mean SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM-"

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.320
Andy Kaufman made a playing with both your expectations and your patience.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.360
He once did a stand-up where all he did was eat a bowl of ice cream.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.440
People were so confused and so caught off guard that they couldn't help but laugh at it.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.960
"What I'd like to do for you right now, the bit which got me thrown out of the improv..."

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.040
"I haven't done it since, and although I have tried it a few times, and it never has worked."

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.840
"But, I'd like to do it for you tonight."

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.480
But this isn't just blind randomness, there IS technique to it.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.200
A part of this works because of its build up.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.520
People think it's going to be something shocking and risque, when really it's just a huge waste of time.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.840
So don't be confused, there is certainly method to the madness.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.600
The YouTube video "Batman eating a hotdog" has over 4 million views.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.400
How? It's just Batman eating a hotdog!

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.840
Well, that's because people can't believe that someone went to all the effort to animate,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.440
very well animated by the way,

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.920
one of America's greatest superheros doing nothing but eating a hotdog.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.440
But now, if it was just a line drawing or a still of Batman doing that, it wouldn't be as funny.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.920
The animator knew that it still had to feel like Batman.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.000
If it didn't, the joke wouldn't work.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.520
So he made it intense, dark, and over the top epic,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.760
all for the simple task of eating processed food.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.160
So why does something stupid like that get so much laughter,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.840
and something like the Starving Games becomes universally hated?

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.080
Well one of the reasons for that is that something like the Starving Games doesn't take any risks.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.640
You know the kind of jokes they're going to do because you've seen them a million times.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.240
Mel Brooks did it, the Zucker brothers did it, and SNL did it,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.000
we're all used to this kind of formula.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.520
I think that you can safely say that Batman eating a hotdog has not been done before.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.240
As far as we know, that has never existed.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.680
But that does bring up one of the biggest problems with stupid humor:

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.320
when it becomes predictable.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.480
As much as I love Monty Python's Flying Circus,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.440
if you watch it long enough, you start to realize a bit of a pattern.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.320
You watch somebody being crazy, you think the normal person is going to react normally,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.800
but it turns out that the normal person is just as crazy as the crazy person.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.320
"No pruning necessary."

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.680
"I'd still like the operation. Please do an operation!"

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.680
"Only if you'll come on a camping holiday with me."

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.160
"He asked me! HE ASKED ME!"

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160
And don't get me wrong, there's other jokes too, and ones that break the mold,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.280
but that seemed to be the one that popped up the most.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:27.240
That kind of joke relies on being unexpected, but when it's done a few times, you start to catch on.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.640
The fact is, it's difficult to continually be unexpected,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.600
because if you keep doing things that are unexpected, they suddenly become expected!

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.920
I think that's why we laugh so hard when we see something that IS so strange, and IS so unusual.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.200
Because truth be told, it IS difficult to be silly and goofy while also being funny.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.720
Not everybody has it, and it's not always the easiest to obtain.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.200
It's an instinct that relies on not only what most people are expecting, but what most people have already seen.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.920
Starving Games is predictable and tired,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.800
where NOBODY could predict that when He-Man held aloft his magic sword he would say:

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:09.800
"25 years.... and my life is still..."

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.480
and stay committed to it throughout the entire song.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.120
Something that was SO unpredictable and SO out of left field

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.720
that people are coming back to it time after time to make it more popular.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.000
Now the other all knowing truth that a lot of people talk about with comedy, aside from it all being about misery,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.520
is that it's all subjective.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.280
Maybe none of this stupid stuff got a giggle out of you.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.160
Maybe you do look at it and say, "that's really dumb, why is everybody else laughing at this?"

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.360
But I'm willing to be that there's something out there that you know is stupid,

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.120
and yet you still can't help but howl with laughter at.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.520
Something you can't explain, you can't figure out, but it just makes you laugh.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.560
Comedy isn't an exact science, but there certainly are things that a huge amount of people will find joy in,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:02.560
and whether it be intelligent or stupid, the one thing we can take from both of them is that they both take effort.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.640
Yes, everyone can get lucky with one stupid routine here or there,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.920
or one silly moment that happened by accident and resulted in 15 minutes of fame,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:16.720
but for something to continue to be funny and keep people coming back, that takes a great deal of talent.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.760
Some rely on hours of research, others rely on seconds of instinct.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.680
But both have an art that requires a lot of dedication and a ton of trial and error.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.040
But given all the variations of people out there, as well as millions of different senses of humor,

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.600
nobody is going to hit the majority all the time.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.480
So even something as silly as this:

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.800
is doing that connects to millions of people's senses of humor, whether they realize it or not.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.240
So, the next time you say something is so stupid or so dumb, just keep telling yourself:

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:55.280
if it's making you laugh harder than anything else has that day, it just might be a little smarter than you think it is.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.840
"Now is time for cake!"

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.120
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it because HEEYEEEAYEEEAYEAYEA

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.160
HEEEEYEEEAAAYEA! I SAID HEY!!...
