because you know to read about them is

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610
because you know to read about them is
 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.520
because you know to read about them is
one thing to read about chemistry or to

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530
one thing to read about chemistry or to
 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.310
one thing to read about chemistry or to
read about biology but to be able to see

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320
read about biology but to be able to see
 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.970
read about biology but to be able to see
it in action that's just incredible and

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980
it in action that's just incredible and
 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.920

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.780
that's you know that's what happened to
me you kind of get to see it in action

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790
me you kind of get to see it in action
 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.400

it generates that gee-whiz response

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070
it generates that gee-whiz response
 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.540
it generates that gee-whiz response
which is really what we want and so I

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550
which is really what we want and so I
 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.780
which is really what we want and so I
think that we need to invest more in

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790
think that we need to invest more in
 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.190
think that we need to invest more in
certainly our high school level kids are

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200
certainly our high school level kids are
 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.890
certainly our high school level kids are
college level kids we do quite a bit at

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900
college level kids we do quite a bit at
 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.590
college level kids we do quite a bit at
the middle school level but certainly to

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600
the middle school level but certainly to
 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.810
the middle school level but certainly to
invest more because they are the future

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820
invest more because they are the future
 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.730
invest more because they are the future
scientists of tomorrow

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740
 
 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.800
