00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.910
Flying at 30,000 feet you're higher than Mount
Everest, a place where you need an oxygen

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.910
tank to breath.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.550
So, why don’t you need one flying from New
York to LA?

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.120
Trace here for DNews my frequently flying
friends.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.770
As you go up higher and higher, the air pressure
gets lower.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.960
The ratio of oxygen in the atmosphere stays
the same, but because of the lower pressure,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.730
the oxygen molecules are spread out.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.289
Thus, at over 18000 feet (5.5km), there is
less than half the oxygen available sea level.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.260
Once you're over 25,000 (7km), comfortingly
called the "Death Zone," by National Geographic,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.879
plants no longer take root, and most animals
can't breathe.

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.850
At Death Zone heights, oxygen levels are less
than one-third what they are at sea level.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.159
Flying over 8,000 feet (2.4km) without modern
technology, can cause altitude sickness (or

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.699
hypoxia) which results in headaches, dizziness,
and eventually vomiting, fatigue, and difficulty

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:53.699
thinking clearly!

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.229
It's pretty serious.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.199
But the problem is, airplanes fly best high
up in the air, and people breathe best nearer

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.820
to the ground, so to compensate for that low-pressure,
low-oxygen air, the airline industry invented

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.189
pressurized cabins.

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.229
Today, all commercial airplanes have pressurized
cabins to keep people breathing comfortably.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.710
But, since they don't have tanks of air on
board, they have to supplement the air in

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.210
the cabin from some other source.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.479
Jet turbines sort of look like a massive set
of fans, one after another with lots of blades…

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.770
Inside that giant engine, air is spun through
fan after fan compressing it, causing it to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.119
heat up, before mixing it with some fuel to
thrust the plane forward.

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.150
Because it's compressed by the engines, it
pushes the oxygen closer together, which is

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.250
good for the jet to burn oxygen with fuel,
but also it makes it breathable for the passengers

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.560
inside.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.649
Before it's burned, some of that hot air is
shunted away from the engine -- this is called

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.460
bleed air -- and sent into the plane.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.469
But it's still to hot to breathe -- between
200-250 C -- so, it first heads into the wings

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.329
to keep them from icing over, and into the
plane to keep it warm.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.550
Once that's done, the air is cooled to match
the needs of the passengers so it can be mixed

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.000
with the cabin air.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.490
And that's it, voila!

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.610
"Fresh" outside air!

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.040
The excess, "old" air is vented through an
"outflow valve," to keep the cabin pressure

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.040
constant.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.820
Of course, there's an unfortunate side effect
of this, at high-altitudes humidity is really

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.390
low, and after being heated and cooled a couple
times, the air entering the plane is pretty

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.050
much devoid of moisture.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.640
The World Health Organization says airplanes
hover around 20 percent humidity, the driest

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.520
place on Earth, Chile's Atacama desert, has
a humidity of 17.3 percent.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.520
Yikes.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.570
The thing is, it might dry your skin and boogers,
but dry air alone ain't gonna hurt you, and

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.720
you do get some humidity, from human breathing…
gross, kinda.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.200
New air is being brought in all the time,
and by pressurizing the cabin, and adding

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.040
this "fresh" air, airplane manufacturers have
been able to keep us cognizant and alive during

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.140
multi-hour flights.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.030
Fun fact, if there's a failure in this system,
those masks drop from the ceiling of the plane

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.060
and they are connected to a tank which makes
oxygen.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.570
Please put on your own mask before helping
others, because at 30,000 feet humans only

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.960
have about 30 seconds to 2 minutes of useful
function without cabin pressure!

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.280
If being trapped in a flying metal tube with
filtered air isn't enough, there ARE places

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.510
on airplanes where microbes can lodge and
thrive.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.420
Tara hits you where it hurts in this video
here

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.760
Do you have a science question we can answer
on DNews?

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.629
I'd love to hear it!
