00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.240
We are on problem number 11.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.040
I wrote out that chart,
although you

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.145
probably can't read it.

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:08.460
So they say, according to the
table above, car engine oil

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.800
with a rating of 5w flows how
many times as fast as a car

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.100
engine oil with a
rating of 20w?

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.970
So how much faster
is 5w versus 20w?

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.650
So let's read the chart.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.430
It says 10w is half
as fast as 5w.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.860
So 5w is twice as fast as 10w.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.340
So 5w is 2 times 10w.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.740
Then they tell us that 15w
is half as fast as 10w.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.190
So 10w is double the
speed of 15w.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.040
Actually, let's do
it that way.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.000
10w is double the speed
of 15w, right?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.980
And then 15w is double
the speed of 20w.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.250
So you have two doublings.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.710
So 10w is going to be 4 times as
fast. It's 2 times as fast

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.040
as this, which is 2 times
as fast as this.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.230
So 10w is 4 times
faster than 20w.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:13.540
So 10w is 4 times 20w.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.180
And 5w is twice 10w.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.820
So 5w is going to
be 8 times 20w.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.460
And really, the most confusing
thing about this is the fact

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.180
that these labels for these
ratings involve numbers that

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.380
aren't proportional to actually
how much faster they

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.130
are than each other.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.230
You could actually change this
to x, y, z, and then it might

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.700
be a little bit easier.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.180
But that's all there is to it.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.830
This is twice as fast
as this, which is

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.340
twice as fast as this.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.980
And if you were at 5w up here,
so 5w is twice as fast as

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.940
this, which is twice as fast
as this, which is twice as

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.610
fast as that.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.000
So you're doubling three times,
so it's 8 times as

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.600
fast. And that's choice C.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.850
Next problem.

00:02:00.747 --> 00:02:02.050
Let me draw that.

00:02:05.487 --> 00:02:07.195
We have a line like that.

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:11.025
Straight line at the bottom.

00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:17.420
Then we have a line.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.880
Looks something like that.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:34.350
And this is P, A, Q, B, R.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.860
This is line m.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.290
This is line l.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.610
Figure not drawn to the scale.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.590
Sure.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.790
In the figure above, points
P, A, and B are equally

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.590
spaced on line l.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.110
Equally spaced.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.470
So that means that the distance
from P to A is equal

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.660
to the distance from A to B.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.940
They're equally spaced.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.560
That's good to know.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.500
And points P, Q, and R are
equally spaced on line m.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.450
OK.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.030
So P, Q, and R are
equally spaced.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.580
It didn't look like it
the way I drew it.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.310
But so this is equal to this.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.630
If PB is equal to 4-- so that
entire thing is equal to 4.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.850
So we immediately know
that this is 2

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.110
and this is 2, right?

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.110
Because they're equally
spaced.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.940
PR is equal to 6.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.020
So this entire thing
is equal to 6.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.410
So we know that this
is 3 and this is 3.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.445
And AQ is 4.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.760
What is the perimeter of
quadrilateral QABR?

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.015
Let's see, where is Q?

00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:50.265
QABR.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.660
So we know this side.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.700
We know this side.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.880
We know this side.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.290
We just have to figure
out this side.

00:04:03.615 --> 00:04:06.970
And I'll tell you right now
that this is going to be a

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.145
similar triangle problem,
I believe.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.530
Because these triangles are
going to be proportional to

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.340
each other.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.590
How do I know that?

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.260
I'm going to draw two
triangles for you.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:31.120
You have this big triangle,
and then you have

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.370
this smaller triangle.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.790
And the big triangle is similar

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.030
to the smaller triangle.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.980
And how do I know that?

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.960
Well, they share
an angle here.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.730
and we know that the bigger
triangle, two of its sides are

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.620
just double the sides of
the other two angles.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.600
Or-- I'm sorry.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.080
We know that, for example, this
side on the big triangle

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.610
is double this side on the
small triangle, right?

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.950
Similar.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.725
We know this big side on the
big triangle is double this

00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:08.980
side on the small triangle.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.760
So two sides are proportional
to each other.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.620
We have one common angle.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.550
We know that this is
a similar triangle.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.840
So we know that this side is
going to be double this side.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.390
So this side is going to be 8.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.980
And you could have probably
guessed that even if you

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.530
didn't want to prove that
they're similar triangles.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.640
So this is 8.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.840
The perimeter that we had to
figure out to begin with--

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.440
this is the quadrilateral
right here.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.230
It's going to be 8 plus
3 plus 4 plus 2.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.280
And what is that?

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.140
That's 8 plus-- 17.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.460
Right?

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.860
6, 9, right.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.580
17.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.770
And that is choice E.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.020
Next problem.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.330
Problem 13.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.580
OK.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.810
13 and 14 refer to
these functions.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:04.260
So g of n is equal to
n squared plus n.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.060
h of n is equal to n
squared minus n.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.760
So the first problem.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.920
They want to know what g
of 5 minus h of 4 is.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.910
So g of 5.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.700
Let's stick in 5 into g.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.280
So you get 5 squared plus 5.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.220
I just replace 5 where n is.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.960
And then we're going
to subtract h of n.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.030
So what's h of n?

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.175
Oh, sorry, h of 4.

00:06:31.175 --> 00:06:32.570
It looked like an n.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.160
And h of 4.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.675
So h of 4 is 4 squared
minus 4.

00:06:38.675 --> 00:06:39.710
And so let's simplify this.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:46.750
That's 25 plus 5 minus
16 plus 4.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.370
So that's what?

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:53.620
30 minus 16 plus 4.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:00.710
30 minus 16 is 14, plus
4, so it's 18.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.680
So that is choice D.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.000
All right.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.115
Problem 14 also applies
to this.

00:07:06.115 --> 00:07:07.470
So I'll do it right here.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.855
Which of the following is
equivalent to h of m plus 1?

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.430
So we essentially just,
everywhere we see an n here,

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.170
we put an m plus 1.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.715
So h of m plus 1 is equal to--
we see an n, so we put an m

00:07:23.715 --> 00:07:24.890
plus 1 there.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:31.890
m plus 1 squared minus-- instead
of an n-- m plus 1.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:32.780
Multiply that out.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:41.510
You get m squared plus 2m plus
1, and then minus m minus 1.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.190
Let's see.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.870
So this 1 and this
1 cancel out.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.680
And then 2m minus m.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.410
So you're left with
m squared minus m.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:00.730
So h of m plus 1 is equal
to m squared minus m.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.050
But isn't that the same
thing as h of m?

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.140
Reminds me of that store.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.970
That's H&amp;M, not h of m, although
that would be a fun

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.530
name for a store as well.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.600
h of m.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.380
Well, what's h of m?

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.590
You put an m where
you see an n.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.300
So that also equals
m squared minus m.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.720
So the answer is h of m.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.970
And let me now look
at the choices.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.060
And that is not there.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.920
So I have made a mistake.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.790
m squared plus 1.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.710
They're saying, which of the
following is equal to h of m--

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.700
let me clear things.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.760
OK.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.120
So they say, which of the
following is equivalent to h

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.799
of m plus 1?

00:08:47.475 --> 00:08:51.130
And that is equal to
h of m, right?

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:51.440
Right.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:09:02.440
That is equal to m plus 1
squared minus m plus 1.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:09.420
That's m squared plus 2m plus
1, minus m, minus 1.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.520
So that's m squared-- plus m.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.200
Oh, sorry.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.250
Plus m.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.200
m squared plus m.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.440
And then this cancels out.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:24.190
So h of m plus 1 is equal
to m squared plus m.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.570
Right?

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.220
And what's m squared plus m?

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.910
Well, that's the same
thing as g of m.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:33.880
Because take g of n, or take
g of m and that's also m

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.810
squared plus m.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.370
So that is choice A.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.940
Before I cleared it, my mistake
was when I did 2m

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.040
minus m, I got, for some silly
reason, minus m instead of

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.650
positive m.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:46.480
Should be a positive m.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.940
That was my mistake.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.190
I'll see you in the next video.
