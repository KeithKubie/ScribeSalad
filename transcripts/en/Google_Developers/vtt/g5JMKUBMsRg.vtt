EMILY FORTUNA: Hello.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.740
I'm Emily Fortuna for
The Developer Show.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.140
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.120
news from Google.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.760
Coral is a platform for
building intelligent devices

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.500
with local AI.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.480
It offers a complete
local AI toolkit

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.850
that makes it easy to grow
your ideas from prototype

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.350
to production.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.110
This includes hardware
components, software tools,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.090
and content that helps
you create, train,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.490
and run neural networks
locally on your device.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.490
To learn more, head
on over to the post

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.299
linked in the description below.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.760
TensorFlow 2.0 alpha is here.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.170
This new version
of TensorFlow is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.120
about providing
simple and easy to use

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.642
higher level APIs, focused
on Keras and eager execution.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.600
The big announcement came
at the TensorFlow Dev

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.750
Summit in Sunnyvale,
California this last week.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.120
Other highlights included
new online courses

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.570
from Deep Learning AI
and Udacity, as well as

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.850
a Powered By TF challenge.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.860
Click the links below
for our top five recap

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.420
video, the recap blog post, or
the full playlist of sessions.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.090
Gpipe is a distributor
machine learning

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.210
library that uses synchronous
stochastic gradient descent

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.520
and pipeline
parallelism for training

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.770
applicable to any deep
neural network that consists

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.900
of multiple sequential layers.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.480
It allows you to easily
deploy more accelerators

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.250
to train larger
models and to scale

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.420
the performance without tuning
those annoying hyperparameters.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.440
Graphs and a link to the
GitHub repo are on the post.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.850
Android Jetpack
WorkManager 1.0 Stable

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.150
is available with some
great new features.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.710
The latest version
of WorkManager

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.560
lets you set constraints, such
as network status or charge

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.900
state when the
task runs, supports

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.690
asynchronous one-off
and periodic tasks,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.500
allows chain tasks with input
and output, and much more.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.730
For the intro video and sample
code, take a look at the post.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.970
You can simplify enterprise
threat detection and protection

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.160
with new Google Cloud
security services,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.580
such as the Web Risk API,
which is now in beta.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.100
With a simple API call,
client applications

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.832
can check URLs against Google's
list of unsafe web resources,

00:02:04.832 --> 00:02:06.290
including social
engineering sites,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.509
like phishing and
deceptive sites, and sites

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.420
that host malware or
unwanted software.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.250
To learn more about
this and other tools,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.880
click through to post.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.770
Chrome 74 is available!

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.560
This includes the ability to
highlight all nodes affected

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.830
by a CSS property, which
is super cool, a WebSocket

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.050
binary message viewer,
performance panel

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.862
updates, and much more.

00:02:27.862 --> 00:02:29.320

I'm Emily Fortuna for
The Developer Show.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.540
Thanks for watching.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.080
Dev Show will be
on break next week,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.253
but we will see you in
two weeks for episode 150!

00:02:43.253 --> 00:02:45.080
(ACCENT) How about I
do this whole thing

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.640
in this strange accent.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.980
It's reminiscent of 1930s.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.860
SPEAKER 1: Really?

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.402
EMILY FORTUNA:
(ACCENT) I don't know.

00:02:52.402 --> 00:02:53.400
OK, all right.
