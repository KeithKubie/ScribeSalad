00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.350
There's a lot to remember
when using the terminal.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.320
You can't just click around and

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.060
explore menus like you can
with a graphical program.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.060
This doesn't mean that you need
to remember every command and

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.320
every option though.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.500
Looking things up is a regular part
of the terminal user's workflow.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.100
In fact, it's normal to forget
the details of commands you don't

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.510
use frequently.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.930
Cowsay is an example of a program
with a bunch of options.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.810
By default, cowsay draws a cow,
but you can customize it too.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.890
For example, by using the -e argument,
we can replace its eyes with carets.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.430
We can also draw a penguin
instead of a cow.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.200
So, how do we keep up
with all these options?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.130
Fortunately, all common shell
programs come with a manual,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.820
and there's a command that makes
it easy to read them, man.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.090
Manual entries are called man pages,
and this is cowsay's man page.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.250
Man pages follow a common format.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.800
The first section includes
the command's name and

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.700
a brief description of the command.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.730
The next section is the synopsis.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.110
The synopsis explains how to use
the command's flags and arguments.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.760
Options surrounded by square
brackets are optional.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.750
In this case,
all of cowsay's options are optional.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.150
Some options require
additional information.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.180
For example, if you use the -e flag,
you also need to supply an eye_string.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.230
The description describes all
of the options in detail.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.088
Man pages vary in how they
present this information.

00:01:16.088 --> 00:01:18.048
Some man pages alphabetize their option,

00:01:18.048 --> 00:01:20.970
while cowsay's man page
is a bit less organized.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.186
You can use the arrow keys to
scroll up and down the man page.

00:01:24.186 --> 00:01:27.182
The later sections of the man page
include more detailed information about

00:01:27.182 --> 00:01:28.500
the command.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.540
Man pages are typically arranged so

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.270
that the most important
details are near the top.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.230
When you're done referencing the manual,
you can press q to exit.
