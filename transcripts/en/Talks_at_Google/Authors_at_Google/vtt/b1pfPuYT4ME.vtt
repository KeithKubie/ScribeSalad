[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:07.720
DAVE RUDDEN: Thank you.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.160
Hi.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.010
I'm Dave.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.620
And I write books.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.490
I'm still not used
to saying that.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.697
I have sort of a
delighted, child thrill

00:00:18.697 --> 00:00:20.280
that I'm somehow
allowed in the room--

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.904
not this room, although frankly,
that's also quite surprising--

00:00:22.904 --> 00:00:26.292
but the room of being a writer.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.500
I used to think you had to
be allowed to be a writer.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.580
And you don't.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.840
There's no passports.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.009
There's no cancel.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.309
There's no Grand High Poobah.

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.350
Don't tell John Banville.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.960
He'd be really upset.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.410
People like to make writing
into a mystical process.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.990
When I say people,
I mean writers.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.050
Because it's good business sense
to make what you can do seem

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.310
like a thing only you can do.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.120
And writers need mysticism,
because without that, we're

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.890
just people with bad
internet histories

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.980
who talk to themselves.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.660
I am against
mysticism, generally.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.120
Teaching and writing for kids
kind of knocks that out of you.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.420
You can be in the middle
of a huge dramatic talk

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.230
about creativity
and inspiration,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.771
and a kid will just
put up their hand

00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:09.190
and go, what does
the word indeed mean?

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.290
And you're like,
what does it mean?

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.000
I was doing an event once where
all the kids had read the book.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.630
And so there was 125 kids.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.220
They had loads of really
in-depth questions.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.970
And I said, look, we're
coming to the end.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.595
We only have a little
bit of time left.

00:01:24.595 --> 00:01:25.750
I want your best question.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.010
It has to be really good.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.130
And like a crossbow, this kid
was like, I've got a question.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.632
And I was like, OK, this
has to be really good now.

00:01:32.632 --> 00:01:33.840
It's like our final question.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.756
He's like, oh, I know.

00:01:34.756 --> 00:01:36.610
And I was like,
all right, give it

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.230
to me, your best,
your best question.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.729
What is it?

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.750
And he was like, what's
your favorite number?

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.880
And I was like, seven.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.670
Goodnight, everybody.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.990
So specifics-- I teach a
lot of writing classes.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.490
And the first
question I get asked

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.590
is, how do you become a writer?

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.730
No, that's a lie.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.896
The first question I get
asked is, why is your beard

00:01:56.896 --> 00:01:57.670
so magnificent?

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.260
Beard oil and a tiny comb--

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.490
it's true.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.410
But the second question
I get asked is,

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.880
how do you become a writer?

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.610
And it's quite a tough
question to answer,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.110
because I'm an authority to the
edge of my skin and no further.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.360
I know how I ended up
being a 29-year-old man who

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.280
spends most of the day
in his pajamas googling

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.270
throwing knives.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.410
But the problem with writing
and with arts jobs in general

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.720
is that there's no blueprint.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.150
Writing courses, daily prompt
challenges, retreats, groups,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.410
masters, living in
a driftwood cave,

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.200
and writing poems on your
feet with the tears of fish--

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.770
there seems to be a lot
of different paths to it.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.050
And this is a facet of
publishing, as well.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.640
Bad books do well.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.050
Good books fail.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.750
Writers go unnoticed for
years and then suddenly become

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.070
stratospheric.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.690
Suzanne Collins's
book "The Hunger

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.240
Games" was her seventh novel.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.880
She used to write for
"Clarissa Explains It All."

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.460
I would watch that crossover.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.580
I went to a talk with Brendan
Barrington at Penguin Ireland.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.610
And somebody asked-- because
somebody always asks--

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.440
what's the next big trend?

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.340
What's the next big thing?

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.540
And Brendan gave
the weariest sigh

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.730
I've ever heard from a
human mouth, and went,

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.830
if you would have
told me two years ago

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.370
that a best-selling book in the
world would be BDSM erotica,

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.220
I'd a laughed in your face.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.600
There is no blueprint.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.060
And this does sound daunting
and terrible and all up

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.790
to kind of the
whims of the gods,

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.960
but that's no help to anybody.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.550
And I really believe that if you
chart careers across the board

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.080
and go on safari
into writing groups,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.970
and if read between the lines
and every listicle side notes--

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.680
I hate the word listicle.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.620
There's a word for
lists of things.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.410
It's list.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.190
But you begin to
realize that maybe it's

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.640
not answers that provide a
blueprint, but questions--

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.700
questions of process, of
editing, of submitting,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.830
of motivation, of inspiration.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.310
How many of you at any
point in your life,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.500
on a long car journey or
maybe like walking home

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.530
from the shop, or whatever,
played a movie in your head?

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.840
Just imagine something
happening, OK?

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.700
Yeah, a few of you?

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.160
Hands up-- who would like
action figures or dolls or both?

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.580
And when you played
with them, were there

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.820
plotlines, like sagas of war
and betrayal and heartbreak,

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.649
with a rotating
cast of whatever it

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.480
was you got for
your last birthday,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.360
the kind of cinematic crossover
that Marvel could only

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.356
dream of?

00:04:27.356 --> 00:04:30.380
Yeah, that was my
childhood, as well.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.900
There was a tree in the
field behind my house

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.910
that had a really good
fork about eight feet up,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.430
and it had these
red berries that

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.830
were the perfect size for my
T. rex to use as grenades.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.600
My T. rex was a grenadier.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.200
And my dad-- this is
a picture of my dad.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.520
He looks like a garden
gnome or Captain Birdseye.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.680
But he would look around,
and he'd ask, where's David?

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.210
Oh, is he up in the tree again?

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.330
It's like, yes, forever.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.040
I come from a tiny
village in Cavan.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.170
There are more people in
this room than there are

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.670
in the village where I'm from.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.010
And the only way to
stave off the boredom

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.810
was to play movies in my head.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.330
Now, they weren't
terribly complicated.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.140
Hero saves the world, gets the
girl, happens to be ginger.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.400
But I never assoc-- so can
you all hear me at the back?

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.900
I'm just curious, because I
keep moving back from the thing.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.608
Yeah, we're good?

00:05:21.608 --> 00:05:22.610
Cool.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.819
I never associated
this with writing,

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.110
because writing is a mystical
art only a few people can

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.994
do, right?

00:05:28.994 --> 00:05:30.410
To be a writer,
you obviously have

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.260
to be either English
or dead, right?

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.220
No.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.260
Posh people become writers.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.390
Geniuses become writers.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.760
People from Cavan who look
like sunburned broccoli

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.264
do not become writers.

00:05:43.264 --> 00:05:44.930
They're more likely
to drop a rap album.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.650
And there's a terrible
standardization

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.170
that happens I think
around secondary school.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.050
I've done 210 school
events in the last year.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.780
And the one thing
I've noticed is,

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.342
if you tell a 13-year-old
they can be a writer,

00:05:59.342 --> 00:06:01.550
they drop their head, and
they sort of warble at you,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.240
and they--

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.781
because at some point, they've
been told that being up a tree

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.350
is a weird place to be.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.510
If you tell a 10-year-old
they can be a writer,

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.970
they're like, yeah, I know.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.580
I'm writing a book.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.990
We lose this, or
it's taken from us.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.580
And it takes a lot of
work to get it back.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.480
Kids are fierce, relentless
sponges of information,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.380
because they lack
experience of the world.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.880
They are not used to stuff.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.080
Adults are used to stuff
and beaten down occasionally

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.250
by stuff, and they don't realize
that ideas are constantly

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.520
sleeting by them or
sleeting from them.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.340
What exactly makes the writer is
kind of difficult to quantify,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.070
because writing in itself
is quite contradictory.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.860
On one side, you need the
fierce self-confidence

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.500
that you have a story
that needs to be told.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.380
On the other side, you need to
think your story is terrible

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.210
and that you need to improve it.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.310
On one side, you
need to understand

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.440
that every single
person in this room

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.140
is an intricate machine full
of a billion moving parts

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.390
that has a slightly different
perspective on the world

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.010
than the person beside them.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.710
But you also need to
understand that everybody

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.480
is pretty much the same--

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.734
unique commonalities.

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:14.900
Let me show you what I mean.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.441
I'm not just a bedraggled man
who wandered in off the street.

00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:19.275
Well, I am, but I
also wrote a book.

00:07:19.275 --> 00:07:21.650
So if you've got the book in
front of you-- which you all

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.125
do, which is amazing and
hilarious-- is page 73.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.510
"The woman in white
was eating light bulbs.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.970
Simon couldn't take
his eyes off her.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.620
It was horrible.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.010
She'd found a cupboard on the
third floor corridor about six

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.680
meters from the closet
in which Simon was hiding

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.130
and had begun rifling
through its contents.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.580
Linens were experimentally
sniffed and then idly tossed

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.040
aside, forming lonely
snowdrifts on the floor.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.550
A first aid kit had been
emptied out as well,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.670
its contents
separated with a toe

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.260
and then methodically
stomped apart.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.380
Now she was opening
boxes of light bulbs,

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.440
shaking their contents
out into her palm

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.980
and holding them up to her
face before closing her teeth

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.180
around their fragile domes.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.830
Crunch.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.800
"It had taken Simon a moment
to realize she wasn't looking

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.360
for anything in the cupboards.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.420
She was just destroying
whatever was in there.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.560
Why?

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.030
He didn't know.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.740
There was no urgency
to her movements

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.830
and a strange look of
amusement creased her skin.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.539
Unfortunately, that
meant there was

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.299
no indication of how long
she was going to stay there,

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:45.234
blocking the corridor and
Simon's only means of escape.

00:08:45.234 --> 00:08:46.900
"It was pure luck she
hadn't caught him.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.150
A sudden, unexplainable
feeling of dread

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.460
had made him seek refuge
in the broom closet,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.610
cracking the door
open a hair just

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.390
in time to see her appear
at the top of the stairs.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.120
Maybe he had heard her
without even realizing it.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.850
Maybe he'd felt her
presence or the air

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.770
her movements displaced.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.620
Maybe, maybe the animal
part of his brain

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.510
was taking over all of
that prehistoric instinct

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.460
and awareness you just didn't
use in the modern world.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.790
Simon didn't know or care.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.630
All that mattered was that
he hadn't been caught.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.870
"Suddenly the woman's
head jerked to one side,

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.270
as if she smelled his relief.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.470
She spat a dry clot of
glass out onto the floor

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.330
and closed the
cupboard door slowly,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.760
listening hard for something.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.150
Simon froze, taking
his hand off the door

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.250
so it settled back against the
frame, hiding her from view.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.410
His heart pounded
louder and louder.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:44.925
Stop, stop.

00:09:44.925 --> 00:09:45.550
She'll hear it.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.750
She'll hear it.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.380
And the floor creaked as
she took a step towards him.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.980
Don't panic.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.850
Don't panic.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.905
"With the door closed,
the woman in white

00:09:55.905 --> 00:09:57.990
was more of a
collection of sounds

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.300
than a physical presence,
sounds that Simon

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.070
had to assemble in
his head to figure out

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.010
where she was, a process that
was doing nothing for his heart

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.810
rate.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.330
Periodic creaks, her steps--

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.150
she doesn't care about being
quiet, why would she?--

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:16.740
followed by a drawling,
rasping hiss, her breathing

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.550
roughened by glass,
and then a cascade

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.060
of stiff, mechanical pops
that Simon realized in horror

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.360
were her fingers
clenching and unclenching.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.730
Had he not seen her
with his own two eyes,

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.210
he wouldn't have believed there
was a person out there at all,

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.540
just a machine,
gaunt and terrible,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.940
bearing down upon him.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.930
But more terrifying than
that, though, was the silence.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.470
Silence meant he had no
idea where the woman was."

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.900
Can you all close your
eyes for a second?

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.400
Humor me.

00:10:52.388 --> 00:10:57.370
"Creak, Hsss.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.630
Silence.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.870
Creak, Hsss.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.700
Silence.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.250
Simon closed his eyes,
then opened them,

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.470
and cursed the sound of both.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.970
Everything had become magnified.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.160
His heartbeat was thunder,
his breathing a storm.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.243
The moment stretched
maddeningly, and Simon became

00:11:16.243 --> 00:11:19.320
convinced he could hear the
zzzzt of his nervous system,

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.520
the shhhhh of his sweating
skin, and finally, beneath it

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.900
all, the tick of the future
becoming the present one second

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.620
at a time.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.610
Silence.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.489
The door handle began to turn.

00:11:34.489 --> 00:11:36.780
Simon felt his stomach go
concave, The thought of being

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.670
that close to the woman's hand.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.910
Somehow, magically,
he didn't scream.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.830
Most children would
have screamed by now.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.840
He was sure of it.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.280
Creak.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.980
Maybe just a little scream.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.410
It couldn't hurt."

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.628
Thank you.

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:54.911
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.650
Who here is afraid of spiders?

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.930
Hands up.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.699
Yup, it makes total sense.

00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:03.990
Why do you need that many legs?

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.700
They're up to something.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.190
Who here is afraid of heights?

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.280
Yup, makes total sense.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.095
Nobody likes falling off stuff.

00:12:11.095 --> 00:12:14.500
And what about snakes?

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.490
Really?

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.320
But they're so cute.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.360
Look at them there.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.140
They're lovely.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.804
I don't mind snakes that much.

00:12:21.804 --> 00:12:24.220
I was at a party once with a
snake handler, which probably

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.600
tells you more than you need to
know about the kind of parties

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.850
I go to.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.420
And there was a
woman walking around

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.160
with a snake on her
shoulders, and she

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.470
was letting people put
it on their shoulders.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.670
And me, being an idiot,
was like, yeah, go on.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.110
Give us a go with the snake.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.510
So it's on my
shoulders, and it's

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.470
really big and really heavy and
feels like an alive handbag.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.720
And its head is sort of
moving around like this.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.880
And I turned to the snake
handler say, out of curiosity,

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.180
has this ever gone
horribly wrong?

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.040
And the snake handler
went, ha ha ha ha ha, yeah.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.900
And I went, take it back.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.790
And when I was a kid,
I got glass in my hand.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.120
Did someone here ever have
glass in their hand before?

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.390
Yeah.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.765
For those of you who haven't,
it's unpleasant experience.

00:13:06.765 --> 00:13:07.880
I don't recommend it.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.390
And my sister, who is a
couple of years older than me,

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.955
was like, oh, you know if
you get glass in your hand,

00:13:13.955 --> 00:13:15.580
it works its way into
your bloodstream,

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.120
and it cuts you open from the
inside out, and then you die?

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.220
I was three.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.090
It left a mark.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.520
So ever since then, I
have had a morbid fear

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.230
of ever getting glass
in my hand, which

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.572
is why, when I wanted to
create a really awful villain,

00:13:28.572 --> 00:13:31.030
I could think of nothing worse
than someone casually biting

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.980
into a light bulb.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.359
Unique commonalities, things
that mean so much to you,

00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:37.150
you kind of think they
might mean something

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.070
to somebody else.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.050
If you visit
downtown Minneapolis,

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.480
right beside Skol Liquor
and a bowling alley

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.620
called Memory Lanes--

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.720
I love that-- there's a place
called Orfield Laboratories,

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.210
and the quietest room on earth.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.670
In this fiberglass,
swaddled chamber,

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:58.170
you can hear your bones slipping
off each other when they move.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.570
And Simon, in that scene,
is trying to be so quiet,

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.779
he can literally hear
his nervous system.

00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:06.820
The thing about her knuckles
popping mechanically

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.240
comes from my
friend Michelle, who

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.880
is a primary school teacher.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.700
And like all primary school
teachers, she's super sweet,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.476
and she's super lovely, and
she's a black belt in Kenpo,

00:14:16.476 --> 00:14:18.070
like all teachers.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.130
And because Michelle has spent
so much of her life punching

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.030
stuff, she can now pop
each one of her knuckles

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.230
without touching them.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:32.150
It is exactly halfway between
disgusting and awesome.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.604
And on her first
day of teaching,

00:14:33.604 --> 00:14:36.020
the kids were being a little
bit loud, a little bit rowdy.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.330
So Michelle just walked
out in front of them

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:43.370
and popped each knuckle
without breaking eye contact.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.260
It sounded like someone
racking a shotgun.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.910
And all the kids went, oohhh.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.930
Ideas come from everywhere.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.090
I am, as you might
be able to tell,

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.880
quite an easily
delighted person.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.742
I'm fascinated by people's
lives and their careers

00:14:58.742 --> 00:15:00.950
and everything they get to
do that I won't get to do,

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.262
because I'm not that person.

00:15:03.262 --> 00:15:04.970
I think adults take
too much for granted.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.730
They get used to not
asking questions.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.114
They get used to thinking
life is just life.

00:15:10.114 --> 00:15:11.780
I meet a lot of people
who think they're

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.430
too boring to write books.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.400
And nobody is too
boring to write a book.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.680
I'll give you an example.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.080
I have a friend called Cormick.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.120
And Cormick is very
tall, and he's very shy,

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.120
and he does not know I
tell people this story,

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.110
so you're not
allowed to tell him.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.700
Although he might after this.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.160
And I've been trying
to get Cormick

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.118
to write a book for years,
because I think he's

00:15:33.118 --> 00:15:34.612
a singular, singular person.

00:15:34.612 --> 00:15:36.320
He thinks he's just
Cormick, because he's

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.370
been Cormick a very long time.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.250
But I'll give you an example.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.780
You guys can be the judge.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.380
When Cormick was four, he went
to Disneyland with his parents.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.240
And he went in the
Star Wars ride.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.780
Any Star Wars fans here?

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.280
Me.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.200
At the end of the
Star Wars ride,

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.004
you're greeted by Darth
Vader and two storm troopers.

00:15:57.004 --> 00:15:58.670
Now, even if you're
not a Star Wars fan,

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.044
you're obviously familiar with
Darth Vader-- black cloak,

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:05.630
black helmet, argh,
argh, bad guy,

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.060
or has really about
asthma, one or the other.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.380
I have really bad asthma, so
I'm allowed to make that joke.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.490
Very important fact
about Darth Vader--

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:18.920
not a real person,
fictional character.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.540
Cormick is four.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.490
So when he sees the
dark lord of the Sith,

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.530
supreme commander of
all imperial armies,

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:27.500
come towards his family--
this story's completely true--

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.794
he turns to his
parents and goes, run!

00:16:30.794 --> 00:16:33.230
Save yourselves.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.590
And he charges Darth Vader.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.010
It's completely true.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.750
Now Cormick is
quite a tall child,

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:47.240
so when he head butts
Darth Vader in the crotch,

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.010
Darth Vader goes down.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.020
And Cormick, not a man to
leave a job unfinished,

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:59.540
just starts stomping on his
neck, screaming at his parents,

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.510
why aren't you running?

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.000
Should Cormick write a book?

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.284
Everybody should write a book.

00:17:06.284 --> 00:17:07.700
You don't even
need to be the only

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:12.060
four-year-old with a lifetime
ban from Disney World.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.735
That's why Darth
Vader has neck armor.

00:17:13.735 --> 00:17:16.520
It's because of Cormick.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.859
How can you not be delighted
by something like that,

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:20.930
by being that guy?

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.109
And I know that there is this
mystical image of writers being

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:26.180
these people waiting
for inspiration,

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.099
like kids with their
tongues out under a tap.

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:30.080
But that's not how it is.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.020
Creativity is just questioning
everything around you,

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:37.020
asking why or why
not, asking what if?

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.140
You can wait for an
idea to come to you,

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.480
or you can start
charting the space where

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.950
it should be, like an
astronomer charting

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.810
where a black hole is by looking
at the space between stars.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.410
This is why reading
is so important.

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.260
It shows you what's
already out there

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.210
and what needs to
be out there still.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.460
"Knights of the Borrowed
Dark" is about as an orphan

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.030
who discovers magic.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:02.500
That idea has been done.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:07.421
What But this is a story
that I wanted to tell,

00:18:07.421 --> 00:18:09.420
because those are the
kind of books that I love.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.520
So I had to ask
myself questions.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.100
If I tell you my book is about
an orphan who discovers magic,

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.725
what's the next thing
you want to know?

00:18:15.725 --> 00:18:17.176
Hands up.

00:18:17.176 --> 00:18:18.487
AUDIENCE: Why is he an orphan?

00:18:18.487 --> 00:18:20.070
DAVE RUDDEN: Why is
the kid an orphan?

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.590
What happened to his parents?

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:22.090
OK.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:22.770
That's very important.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.480
Generally-- this is
terrible-- generally,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.640
writers make their kids orphans,
because if they had parents,

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.348
the parents would stop
them going places.

00:18:28.348 --> 00:18:30.492
So it's kind of like,
get out of the way.

00:18:30.492 --> 00:18:31.950
So yeah, why is
this kid an orphan?

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:32.980
Why is that important?

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.348
What else?

00:18:34.348 --> 00:18:36.277
AUDIENCE: Does everyone
know about magic?

00:18:36.277 --> 00:18:38.110
DAVE RUDDEN: Does
everyone know about magic,

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.693
or is it a secret
thing that's hidden?

00:18:39.693 --> 00:18:40.360
OK, very good.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.380
These things are
very, very different.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.265
What else?

00:18:42.265 --> 00:18:43.660
AUDIENCE: What kind of magic?

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.993
DAVE RUDDEN: What kind of magic?

00:18:44.993 --> 00:18:46.960
Is it the ability to
shrink, to throw fire,

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.430
to make kittens vomit?

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:49.610
I don't know.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.250
What else?

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.230
AUDIENCE: How common
is magic in that world?

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.310
DAVE RUDDEN: How
common is magic?

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.540
Who has it and who doesn't?

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.180
Haves and have nots-- very
important for conflict.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.820
I had to ask myself
all of these questions.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.850
"Knights of the Borrowed
Dark" comes from--

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:05.440
I watch a lot of horror films.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.100
And if you've seen any
horror films at all,

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.810
you know there's that scene
where the main character is

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.270
being chased by the zombie
or the demon or the stalker,

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.640
or whatever, and
they run upstairs.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.960
And you're like, why
did you run upstairs?

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.500
Have you never
seen a horror film?

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.490
And the exact same
thing happens in books

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.110
about kids who discover magic.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:29.191
Someone shows off to a kid on
their birthday and says, hey,

00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:30.940
would you like to join
our secret crusade?

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:31.810
It's super dangerous.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:32.893
There's loads of monsters.

00:19:32.893 --> 00:19:34.060
You'll probably die.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.870
And the kid just goes,
yeah, sounds good.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:41.350
And you're like,
that's not realistic.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:44.701
These kids were
automatically brave.

00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:45.700
That's what bothered me.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.540
Who here is a brave person?

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.270
Yeah, one person will
put up their hand,

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.770
and everyone else
goes, yep, me too.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.080
It's so funny doing that
in boys' schools and girls'

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.030
schools, because
boys do, look, I am.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.200
And I go, are you sure?

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.590
And they're like, oh,
there's a followup question.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.570
I don't know if
I'm a brave person.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:04.920
I'd like to think I am.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.030
I'd like to think,
if I had to stand up

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.170
for my friends or my family or
do the right thing, I would.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.470
But I don't think you can
know until it's tested.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.410
I have a cousin who is a
firefighter in New York.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.510
And he's been in so
many fires that his arms

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.190
look like melted candle wax.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:19.805
And I was like, how do
you keep doing this?

00:20:19.805 --> 00:20:21.930
the first time, fair enough,
maybe you didn't know.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.399
But how do you keep making--

00:20:23.399 --> 00:20:24.690
how do you keep going in there?

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.290
And he says, it's a choice.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.290
I make it in the morning,
and then I go to work.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.960
The day I can't make
that choice, I stop.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.270
And that, to me, is
so much more authentic

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.700
than someone who is just brave.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.950
But the thing is
that's not a book.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.390
That's barely a sentence.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.400
So I had to ask questions.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.900
Who is this kid?

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:43.890
Who are their friends?

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.240
Where does the magic come from?

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.570
And in doing so, that showed
me the blueprint for my story,

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.160
like the way you
study in college,

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.930
and you realize
that studying just

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.707
shows you what you
don't already know.

00:20:54.707 --> 00:20:56.790
I should have turned the
page while I was talking.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.990
To think I do this for a living.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.860
And with writing,
there's always a duality.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.130
There's always two things.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.821
So on one side, you go outwards.

00:21:05.821 --> 00:21:08.320
You look at what's being done,
and you try and do something.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.150
You try and go further than
anyone else has gone before.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.020
But on the other side, you go
inwards, because the one story

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.270
people can't tell is yours.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.660
Sometimes you end up in
situations so ridiculous,

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.880
you know they should
go into a book.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.192
The following story
is completely true.

00:21:24.192 --> 00:21:25.900
I was walking to the
shop late one night,

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.015
because I really wanted crisps.

00:21:28.015 --> 00:21:29.140
I don't think that's weird.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.280
Crisps are important.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.550
And on the way to the shop,
I had to go through a park.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.440
Now, when I got into
the park, I stopped,

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.960
because on the far side of
the park, there was a guy.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.172
And the guy was standing
there like this.

00:21:41.172 --> 00:21:44.795
It was like, hmm.

00:21:44.795 --> 00:21:46.615
Nope.

00:21:46.615 --> 00:21:49.500
Hmm, hmm, I've seen this film.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.030
I know how this goes.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.340
And my worry was
made a lot worse,

00:21:53.340 --> 00:22:00.450
because as soon as the guy saw
me, he went, you, come here.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.401
You look like a smart person--

00:22:03.401 --> 00:22:05.900
which, when you think about it,
is exactly the kind of thing

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.520
a zombie would say.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.700
Um, I'm not going to lie.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.920
I was torn.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.000
Because on one side, I
really wanted crisps.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.670
But on the other, I
didn't want to die.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.090
But crisps won out,
as they so often do,

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.520
and I began to walk towards him.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.390
Now, the closer I
got to him, the more

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.310
I realized that
everything possible

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.470
that could happen
to a man's face

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.900
had happened to this man's face.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.370
He was a rough gentleman.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:36.260
He was like, I've got--
walking like a velociraptor,

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.270
apparently--

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:41.300
I've got something I
want to run by you,

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:45.490
because you look
like a smart person.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.560
OK.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.630
You know the way the
world's a dangerous place?

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.230
I'm beginning to.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.970
Well, what if me
and a bunch of lads

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:04.210
were to just go around keeping
people safe on the quiet like.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.120
Now, we wouldn't ask a
soft lad like you to do it.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.790
And I was like, all
right, fair enough.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.800
And there's a word for it.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.100
There's a word for it, I know.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.490
I know there's a word for it.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:21.790
And I like, uh,
oh, um, vigilante?

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.760
And he went, I knew you
were a smart person.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.560
And I couldn't help myself.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.423
I went, like Batman.

00:23:30.423 --> 00:23:33.160
Uh-uh, wrong answer.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.520
He leaned in so close, I could
see each individual scar.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.420
And finally, he whispered,
I would be like Batman.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.620
Then he gave me a hug.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:47.851
So once I survived that, I
knew it had to go into a story

00:23:47.851 --> 00:23:48.350
somewhere.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.057
And I'm not talking about--

00:23:52.057 --> 00:23:53.640
I'm not talking about
just writing out

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.880
bits of your own life.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.220
But people do that.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.380
And you can analyze a moment.

00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.850
Ask yourself why
it stuck with you.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.350
And even if all
you take from it is

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.450
a grin or a whisper
or an eyelash,

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.652
that is fuel for a story.

00:24:04.652 --> 00:24:07.110
I'm going to do another scene
from "Knights of the Borrowed

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:12.630
Dark" now, page 154, which
was inspired by my encounter

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.000
with the Crisp gentleman.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.630
And in this scene, my
protagonist, Denizen Hardwick,

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.020
has been asked to join the
Knights of the Borrowed Dark,

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.130
this secret organization
of men and women

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.680
who keep us safe from
extradimensional predators

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.850
called Tenebrous.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.800
Now, the more the
Knights use their magic,

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.930
the more it slowly
turns them to iron,

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.670
because bravery is a choice.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.560
Bravery carries a cost.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.530
So obviously, they're not
going to force Denizen to join.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.362
But they say, look, we
have to go face the breach.

00:24:40.362 --> 00:24:41.820
We have to go face
the Tenebrous in

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.670
this little, small Irish town
in the middle of the night.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:45.720
Come with us.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.940
See if you can handle this job--

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.253
work experience.

00:24:49.253 --> 00:24:52.680
Now, the fight does not
go well, and they tell

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.700
Denizen to run for his life.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.210
So when this scene opens,
Denizen is running down

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:59.160
this dark country
road, and part of him

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.740
is feeling really, really bad
for leaving his friends behind.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.615
But the other part of
him is really relieved,

00:25:03.615 --> 00:25:05.730
because in the
battle, he was crap.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.920
And that's when he
runs into a character

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.420
that you guys met earlier.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.480
Oh no.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.470
"They'll be all right.

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:15.270
They're warriors."

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:15.810
Sorry.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:16.620
Maybe this is a bad idea.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.850
If I keep moving back
and forth, does that

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.016
make things-- no, it's fine?

00:25:19.016 --> 00:25:19.560
Cool.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.300
"They'll be all right.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.740
They're warriors.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.570
This is what they do.

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.670
It didn't sound very
convincing, even

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.590
in the privacy of his own head.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:32.550
I'd just-- I'd
just be in the way.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.770
The lights of the
village appeared ahead,

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.210
a false dawn beckoning hope.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:41.850
Now, I mean, now they don't
have to worry about me.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.240
There was a woman standing
in the middle of the street.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.610
The breach still infected
the street lights,

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.520
curbing their luminescence
to firefly glimmers trapped

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.810
in glass.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.120
Her shadow arched
across the road,

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.440
huge and gaunt and
close enough to touch.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.650
Hello, Denizen said awkwardly.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.370
It was all he could
think of to say.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:09.780
White lips curved in a smile.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.200
Hello, Denizen repeated,
feeling a little silly.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.720
Are you OK?

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.500
He trailed off as he took
in the woman's blank smile,

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.270
the way she stood with
one shoulder higher

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.430
than the other, body
stooped as if held

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.580
beneath the pinch of a
thumb and forefinger.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.036
She didn't seem to understand
what he had just said.

00:26:30.036 --> 00:26:33.640
Um, Miss?

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.370
The woman didn't respond,
hands digging in the pockets

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.170
of her white overcoat.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.690
Eventually, she pulled
out a loose cigarette

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:43.930
and jammed it in the
fold of her smirk.

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:46.920
It hung there unlit.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.400
Horror began to curl its way
through Denizen's stomach.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.100
The woman looked like
she wasn't quite there,

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.685
as if something essential
had been taken from her.

00:26:56.685 --> 00:26:59.220
Her hair was a
ragged, white cascade,

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.890
framing thin cheekbones
and colorless lips.

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.020
She took a staggering
step forward,

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.341
her cigarette
bobbing in the air.

00:27:07.341 --> 00:27:09.290
[EXHALES]

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:10.894
He couldn't just leave her.

00:27:10.894 --> 00:27:12.560
She was the first
person that he'd seen.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.140
He should help her,
get her somewhere safe.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.440
It wasn't exactly
fighting a Tenebrous,

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.840
but it was the
right thing to do.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.850
Miss?

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:23.840
Miss, why don't
you come with me?

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.370
I know some people who
might be able to help you.

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.720
Miss?

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.190
The woman raised her head
in a series of slow jerks.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:37.980
And Denizen suddenly realized
he'd made a huge mistake.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.960
It was her eyes.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.610
They were bright and pale
and normal, or at least

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.410
a fiend's guess at
what normal should be.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.100
Grey's words from the park
suddenly came back to him.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.570
They look wrong.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.890
Even the really old Tenebrous
that try to look human,

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:57.540
it's the little things--

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.862
the face, the eyes.

00:28:00.862 --> 00:28:02.820
She hadn't done a terrible
job, at least as far

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.720
as Denizen could see.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.290
All the bits were there--
irises, eyelids, whites.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.559
Any doll maker would be proud.

00:28:09.559 --> 00:28:11.100
It's not like there
was a way to fake

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:16.260
the things that actually made
an eye human, like love or pity

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.850
or hope.

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:21.090
The cigarette fell away as
the woman's jaw clacked open,

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:24.370
baring a throat filled with
a mass of delicate clockwork,

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:27.870
a total of cogs and
gears and spindle wheels,

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.020
all wet and shining, oily black.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:35.316
Her howl made the ground vibrate
and far off window shatter.

00:28:35.316 --> 00:28:41.880
[GROWLS] The echoes took a
very long time to die away.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.940
Oh, said Denizen,
in a small voice.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.850
Right."

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.535
Thank you.

00:28:48.535 --> 00:28:51.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.840
So there's this one issue with
the questioning philosophy.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.990
Because asking questions is
wonderful, but once you do it,

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.910
it's hard to stop.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:04.400
Certain questions
start after a while,

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.950
asking themselves,
questions like,

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.050
what if this isn't any good?

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.090
What if I'm wasting my time?

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.920
Why am I doing this to myself?

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.920
I started sending "Knights
of the Borrowed "Dark

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.000
out to agents on
November the 1st, 2013.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.050
And I started getting answers.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:24.890
No was the answer
that I got constantly.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.010
And in the meantime, I
began to question the work.

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:29.630
I began to question myself.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:32.750
But the one thing that I had
learned from writing the book

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.960
and from interrogating each idea
is that some answers give you

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.260
options, and some
answers are dead ends.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.960
Taking no for an answer
means no is the answer.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.440
If I wanted to change the answer
I was getting from agents,

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.210
I had to look at what
I was doing wrong.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.320
I went through every single
line in the book, asking myself,

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.820
is this line the right one?

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.470
Is this plot point
the right one?

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:55.850
Why am I saying vicious?

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:57.470
Do I actually mean cruel?

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:00.752
Why am I saying cerulean
when I really mean cerise?

00:30:00.752 --> 00:30:02.210
Mark Twain says
that the difference

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:05.030
between the right word
and the almost right word

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:08.090
is the difference between
lightning and a lightning bug.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.370
And every word does
make a difference,

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:13.130
because, on average,
my agent would

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.260
get 300 submissions a week.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.880
She reads the first line.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.770
If it's good, she
reads the second line.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:21.320
If she doesn't, she stops.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.450
Who here has heard
the word grand before?

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.620
Yeah, really, really
common Irish phrase--

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.120
I wanted to set the
book in Ireland,

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.800
because everything
is set in London,

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.340
because London is really cool.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.680
But each word
makes a difference.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:38.560
So I used to live in Egypt, as
you can tell by my amazing tan,

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.130
running from shadow to shadow
like the vampire of Cairo.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:47.836
There is such a thing as factor
80 That would stop a bullet.

00:30:47.836 --> 00:30:50.740
But when I was over there,
the local librarian,

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.660
Mr. [? Gamile, ?] was like--

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.660
I was teaching there-- he said,
Mr. David, I have a question.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.950
Every day you come in, and I ask
you how you are, and you say,

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.080
I am grand.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.060
Yeah.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.300
But I looked up the
word grand, and it

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.790
means large and majestic.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.020
And I was like, well?

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.850
Yeah, body positively.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:14.681
Also, we say right over here
when we mean OK-- right,

00:31:14.681 --> 00:31:17.180
I'm going down the shop; right,
I'm going to do my homework.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.720
They don't say that in Egypt.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.080
So I used to go in to
school and go, right, kids.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.150
And they'd all go--

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:25.433
it's like, no.

00:31:25.433 --> 00:31:28.202
Every, every single
word makes a difference.

00:31:28.202 --> 00:31:29.660
There's a line in
the first chapter

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.430
where one of my villains,
the man in the waistcoat,

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.240
is speaking.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.400
And the man in the
waistcoat is gross.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.690
Everything about him is gross.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.580
Even his voice is gross.

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.970
"The words roll off his
tongue like cockroaches."

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:43.430
I was really proud of
that line until my friend

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:47.990
Graham pointed out that
cockroaches don't roll.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:51.430
So it's like, the word
skittered from his tongue

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.500
like a cockroach-- better.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:54.670
This is what you have to do.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:57.670
When it came to writing of
their genders and ethnicities,

00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:59.630
I gave my book to people
all those ethnicities,

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.154
and was like, tear
this book apart.

00:32:02.154 --> 00:32:03.820
Make sure what I'm
writing is authentic.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.800
These are experiences
I haven't lived.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.810
Tell me what I'm doing wrong.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:10.780
I edited, I interrogated,
I sent it out again--

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.720
25 agents, 25 nos.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.290
And finally, Clare Wallace at
Darley Anderson took me on.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.270
We worked on one
more draft together.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.070
And then she asked
me, do you want

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.630
to know who I'm sending it to?

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:24.253
I was like, no, I'll freak out.

00:32:24.253 --> 00:32:28.870
And she was like, OK, now,
this process could take weeks.

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:29.950
OK.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.650
It could take months.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:32.320
OK.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.060
It might never--
OK, Clare, I get it.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.320
Thank you.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.770
So 13 days later,
on my birthday--

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:41.980
a fun fact about me, I was born
the day before Valentine's Day.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.500
Had I been born six
hours later, my mother

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.680
swears she would have
called me Valentine.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.180
I couldn't pull that off now.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.555
I definitely
couldn't pull it off

00:32:50.555 --> 00:32:53.590
as a 15-year-old in West Cavan.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:55.720
But I was in a two-euro
shop on George's Street,

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.689
to give you any idea of
where I was financially,

00:32:58.689 --> 00:32:59.980
with my girlfriend at the time.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.280
And we were trying to decide
between the fancy one-euro soup

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:07.450
and the normal, dust-flavored
50 cent soup and a baguette.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:10.440
And she was like,
Puffin want the book.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:15.050
And I was like, right.

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:16.347
What do you think we should do?

00:33:16.347 --> 00:33:18.180
And she was like, I
think we should say yes.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:22.290
And I was like, OK,
get the one-euro soup.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.822
And I really thought my
job was done at that point.

00:33:24.822 --> 00:33:27.030
I thought, you plateau out,
the book comes out great.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.920
And the first thing
my editor said to me

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.100
was, so we have some questions.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:36.360
I was like, a-huh-huh-huh,
I'm so sick of this book.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.580
Ben is lovely, when he
says he has questions,

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.650
what he means is
we have comments,

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:43.770
1,000s upon 1,000s of comments.

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:47.490
So we've got too many mentions
of the sound the car makes.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:48.900
OK.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:53.280
Repetition, avoid, repetition,
avoid, repetition, avoid.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.320
This one is particularly
embarrassing.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.460
It's October.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.630
It was November in
the previous scene.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:01.620
Ah, ah, I've
accidentally written

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.140
a book about time travel.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.200
And the thing is we went through
six drafts with the book.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.480
And the thing is that's fine.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.310
Every event I've
done, every edit,

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:15.060
every argued over comma, all of
the rejections and the effort,

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.699
and all of the questions
and all the self-doubt,

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:20.219
really come down
to one question.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:22.110
Are you going to be a writer?

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:24.810
If your answer is yes,
it simplifies things.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:26.993
And I'm not being reductive.

00:34:26.993 --> 00:34:28.409
Just because the
question is small

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.040
doesn't mean it's
not complicated.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.940
But it is a guiding principle.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.130
Neil Gaiman talks
about the mountain,

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:36.690
a list of things he wants
to achieve in his career.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:39.060
Anything that brings you
closer to the mountain is good.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.880
Anything that takes you away
from the mountain is bad.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.610
So interrogate that idea,
finish that chapter,

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:47.850
apply to that agent, re-edit
your chapter, reapply

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:48.780
to the agents.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.790
Do whatever it
takes to get there,

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:53.139
because you've decided
you're going to get there.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:54.360
That's the blueprint.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.527
That's your answer.

00:34:55.527 --> 00:34:56.481
Thank you.

00:34:56.481 --> 00:34:59.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.097
So if you have any
questions about writing

00:35:06.097 --> 00:35:07.930
or beards or crisps,
the only three things I

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:10.984
know anything about, shall we?

00:35:10.984 --> 00:35:11.650
All right, cool.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:13.387
AUDIENCE: So my [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:13.387 --> 00:35:14.345
DAVE RUDDEN: Thank you.

00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:16.770
AUDIENCE: And
telling [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:22.500
how normally your writing
process, how it goes overall.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:27.000
I'm especially wondering it you
ever tried nonfiction novels,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.500
if you experimented.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.633
Do you ever use nonfiction in
place in building your fiction,

00:35:33.633 --> 00:35:38.620
and how could you [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.870
DAVE RUDDEN: Oh that's a
really, really good question.

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:45.210
And so in terms of
working in nonfiction,

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.230
I'm a little bit
terrified by nonfiction,

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:49.450
because you're really
putting yourself on display.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:53.190
I like hiding behind monsters
and things like that.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:56.571
But people say, where do you
get your ideas for your work?

00:35:56.571 --> 00:35:58.070
And it all just
comes from yourself.

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:00.160
So I wrote "Knights
of the Borrowed Dark"

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.220
at a time when all of the
villains that I saw in media

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:05.440
were really cool
and kind of sexy,

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.820
Tom Hiddleston, basically.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.530
All the villains
were Tom Hiddleston,

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.470
and they all had cool
plans, that you could almost

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.650
identify with them.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:14.340
And I wanted to do
something different.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:18.440
Now, I was bullied really
badly when I was in school.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:22.360
This is the product of years
of theater, not my upbringing.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.270
And I was like, in order to
make it authentic, in order

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:28.179
to share something that--

00:36:28.179 --> 00:36:30.220
in order to make something
authentic, I was like,

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.270
what scares me?

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:34.480
And what scares me
are bullies still,

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.980
like the idea that you can--

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:39.070
like we all have that dream
that someone will say something

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.950
horrible to you in school, and
you'll turn and go, yeah, well,

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.810
cool line, knowing that, even if
you did do that, the body would

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:45.760
just go, shut up.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.230
And you'd be like,
oh OK, you win.

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:50.080
So my three villains are
called the Clockwork Three.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.590
There's the man in
the waistcoat who

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:55.630
is every single cruel comment,
like every single person

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.414
shouting at you from a bus stop.

00:36:57.414 --> 00:36:59.080
There's the woman in
white, who you met.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.375
She was like brute force.

00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:01.750
And then there's
the opening boy,

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:04.090
who's a hurt child, because
that's what bullies are.

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:08.360
And the sheer meanness
and pettiness of them

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.300
comes from my own
kind of experience.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.910
And the cost, as well--
like I would have

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:16.219
went through very bad depression
in my first and second year

00:37:16.219 --> 00:37:18.260
of college, basically,
once I got away from home.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.020
But things still
followed me, and I

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.864
had an awful problem
with self-harm,

00:37:21.864 --> 00:37:22.780
which I'm through now.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:23.980
And writing replaced that.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.480
And the great
thing about writing

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.330
is you can pour all your angst
out, and at the end of it,

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:31.110
you have art or possibly a job.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.580
But that's reflected
in the cost,

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.980
where I'm not
ashamed of the fact

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.469
that my arms look like barcodes.

00:37:37.469 --> 00:37:39.010
But it's a thing
that happened to me,

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.290
and it's part of who you are.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:43.060
So the Knights, you
can tell a career

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.940
Knight, because they've got
iron blooming across their face.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.860
They wear their
experiences on their skin.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.710
So yeah, it all comes from--

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:54.030
I say I don't write nonfiction,
but there's lots of it there.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.720
And I'm sort of
getting into it now.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.590
I have to talk about
Terry Pratchett later,

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:00.340
which is the scariest thing in
the world, because I love him.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.325
And I hope I don't get it wrong.

00:38:02.325 --> 00:38:05.100
But, yes, yeah, cool.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.110
With regards finding
your voice, I

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.726
was a Neil Gaiman
cover band for years.

00:38:10.726 --> 00:38:12.100
I wrote in other
people's voices,

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.070
because I didn't
have any of my own.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:16.360
And that took years.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.280
I started writing
when I was 20, and I

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.527
think I attempted the
novel when I was 25.

00:38:21.527 --> 00:38:23.860
And it was the first thing
I'd ever written in my voice.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.840
So if you read the
book, it just sounds

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.290
like I'm talking to you,
for better or worse.

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:30.250
And it took me a
long time of practice

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:32.710
before I got the
basics of writing down,

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.840
before I stopped worrying about
trying to sound like a writer.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.280
I was like, maybe if I just--

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.280
I tend to make people
laugh when I talk to them.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.654
Maybe I should
just talk at that.

00:38:40.654 --> 00:38:43.360
So it's sort of trial and error,
and writing around your voice

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.120
until eventually, you just start
writing your voice, basically.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:46.620
Cool.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.870
Good question, though.

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:48.870
KARL RYAN: I'll go
to another question.

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:49.900
I just have a question
for you, Dave.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.860
You talked to me about
worldbuilding before.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.650
And I think that's a
fascinating part of what you do.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.530
And even you just
briefly said there,

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:59.050
the world that you've
created here for this series

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.955
might live on in other books.

00:39:00.955 --> 00:39:03.580
Maybe just tell us a little bit
about the art of worldbuilding.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.770
And I think you talked a
bit about asking questions.

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:07.480
But just how does
that work for you

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.610
as a writer in terms
of building worlds?

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:10.360
DAVE RUDDEN: Cool.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.320
So every line or every
word you put down

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.370
is an opportunity to get
something across to the reader.

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:21.760
But you don't have that
much time, basically.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.370
Like as I said, my agent
gets 300 submissions a week.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.800
You need to hook people
from the very first line.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.910
So I could give people an
encyclopedic background

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.910
to the Knights and their
history through Europe,

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:33.970
but that's not what my
audience want to read.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:37.720
So in my first draft of
the book, I write long.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.600
I pack in every detail, every
cool thing I thought of.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.200
I really interrogate my concept.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.550
So the idea of the
Knights turning to iron,

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.220
I go, OK, what is every
single possible permutation

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.430
or cool thematic
thing from that?

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:54.030
I mightn't use all of them,
but I need to know them.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.520
So I write the first draft long.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.580
I throw in everything
that I can think of.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:39:59.800
And then, when I go
to the second draft,

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.174
I start paring it back and
going, what is actually needed

00:40:02.174 --> 00:40:04.070
to be known in this scene?

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.930
Is this something I
can't wait till chapter

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:07.756
4, chapter 5, chapter 10?

00:40:07.756 --> 00:40:10.130
So you're drip feeding your
reader, because you want them

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:11.870
to constantly turn the page.

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:15.340
In terms of worldbuilding, I
like magic that makes sense.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.250
I know that's a
ridiculous thing to say.

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:20.510
But I think magic is this
great, cool thematic thing.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:22.890
Like with science fiction,
I love science fiction,

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.940
but science fiction has to make
a sort of scientific sense.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.730
Magic can make narrative sense.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:32.450
And I love concepts that you get
lots of legs out of, basically.

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:35.394
Does anyone read "The Dresden
Files," by Jim Butcher?

00:40:35.394 --> 00:40:37.310
They're a book about a
private eye in Chicago,

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.790
who is also a wizard.

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:39.920
And they're great.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.650
And in the first
book, the way it's

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:44.530
explained why no one
knows about magic

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:47.090
is because magic and
technology don't work.

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:50.420
If you try and film magic,
your computer or your camera

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.080
fritzes out, or whatever.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.340
And that could just be there.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.631
I mean, that's in Harry Potter.

00:40:54.631 --> 00:40:55.610
That's a common thing.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:58.640
But he analyzes and
interrogates that one concept

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.190
and gets so much
emotional depth out of it.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:04.460
So Harry Dresden is your
sort of typical gumshoe.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.690
He's very all he has is
his word, is his balls,

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:08.790
and he don't break them
for anybody kind of thing.

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:12.890
So the fact that he can only
use stuff from the 1930s,

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:15.176
because it's not technologically
complicated enough,

00:41:15.176 --> 00:41:16.550
and the fact he
can only eat-- he

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.920
eats basically the
same thing every day,

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.360
feeds into his character.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.520
And then later on, he
can't go visit his friend

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.186
in the hospital, because all the
life support machines will die.

00:41:25.186 --> 00:41:26.914
And it's like, you really just--

00:41:26.914 --> 00:41:28.580
a good concept just
has legs, basically,

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:29.720
and you get plot out of it.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.230
And then also, it helps
you figure out plot holes.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:37.010
I had a kid ask me once,
the cast turning to iron,

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.090
is it like scar tissue?

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.480
And I was like,
what do you mean?

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.855
And he was like, well, if you
get scar tissue at a joint,

00:41:41.855 --> 00:41:44.060
you have to work out,
otherwise, it will seize up.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.227
And I was like, that is the
best thing I've ever heard.

00:41:47.227 --> 00:41:49.560
So now, all the Knights, I
pop their knuckles and things

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.393
like that, just like
keep themselves limber.

00:41:51.393 --> 00:41:53.580
So your worldbuilding
is a chance

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:56.670
to get across theme and
character to your reader.

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.230
It all has to be connected.

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:02.340
Like Denizen is an incredibly
repressed, neurotic, anxious

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:03.360
person.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.360
And his magic is this
wellspring of fire that's

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.040
constantly seeking to get out.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.450
But the more it
gets, the more it

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:10.710
shuts you off from the world.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.882
So yeah, it's a thing basically.

00:42:12.882 --> 00:42:13.590
KARL RYAN: Great.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:15.273
There's a question over here.

00:42:15.273 --> 00:42:17.376
Right there.

00:42:17.376 --> 00:42:19.542
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
how you were coping with--

00:42:19.542 --> 00:42:22.130
or rather, not now that you
are officially a writer,

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.567
but before you
were a writer, how

00:42:24.567 --> 00:42:27.232
you were coping with the
discipline of writing

00:42:27.232 --> 00:42:28.800
and fitting it in.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.570
And was that an
easy thing for you?

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:34.070
Because you said it
replaced depression issues.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:38.475
Or was it a struggle to
get the routine going

00:42:38.475 --> 00:42:41.306
and get the actual work done?

00:42:41.306 --> 00:42:42.930
DAVE RUDDEN: It is
a constant struggle.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:45.150
The only reason I sound
in any way competent

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:48.029
is because I planned out what
I was going to say beforehand.

00:42:48.029 --> 00:42:50.070
You talk about like. oh,
it was this lovely path,

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:50.670
and you got there.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:52.170
And we're talking
about like, no, it

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.480
is a constant, constant battle.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.960
And there's a writer
called Oisin McGann,

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.580
who's been around for 10 years.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.367
And his wife is a librarian.

00:43:01.367 --> 00:43:02.700
And she was driving me to a gig.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.300
And I was like, yeah, I really
feel now that I've got book one

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.900
out of the way, I can really
start finding a routine.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.316
And she's like,
yeah, Oisin's been

00:43:08.316 --> 00:43:09.630
saying that for a decade, Dave.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:12.180
Good luck.

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:14.490
It's really, really tough.

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:16.234
You have to write
around your job.

00:43:16.234 --> 00:43:17.400
Because people need to live.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.080
People need to pay bills.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.780
What I see, with the benefit
of hindsight, what I do

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.744
is set yourself some
manageable goals.

00:43:23.744 --> 00:43:26.160
You are not going to sit down
and write a novel in one day

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.960
if you haven't
written much before.

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:32.520
Set yourself writing 200
words 3 times a week.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.400
Once you find that really
easy, move yourself up to 300

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.540
per session.

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:41.340
Treat it like courage to 5K,
which I will finish someday.

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:42.720
You train yourself.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.210
Now, if I'm writing a
first draft, I sit down,

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:48.240
and I do 1,000 words
4 times a week.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.680
Because 1,000 words is a scene.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.670
It feels like-- it's a
half a chapter if you're

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:55.030
writing children's fiction.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.660
And I don't try
and go beyond that,

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.420
because if I tried to sit down
and write 5,000 words in a day,

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.504
I would fail.

00:44:01.504 --> 00:44:03.420
And then I would have
failure hanging over me,

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.460
and I would feel
bad the next day.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.040
I generally stop myself just
as I'm getting really, really

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.195
excited, because it
means hit the next day

00:44:10.195 --> 00:44:11.070
like a ton of bricks.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:14.850
It's weird the games you have
to play with yourself when

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:16.980
you want to be a writer.

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:19.422
You have to not be
too hard on yourself,

00:44:19.422 --> 00:44:20.880
but also be super
hard on yourself.

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.421
Because if you don't
write your book,

00:44:22.421 --> 00:44:23.770
no one is going to write it.

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:26.103
Now, I have to write my books,
because otherwise, Puffin

00:44:26.103 --> 00:44:28.257
will break my legs.

00:44:28.257 --> 00:44:30.840
I made that joke on Tubridy, and
I got a phone call from them,

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.270
I mean, like, Dave, can
you not make jokes about us

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.750
breaking your legs?

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:38.005
And I was like, or you'll what?

00:44:38.005 --> 00:44:40.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.530
But now, I have
deadlines, and now, I

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:44.850
have people I will let down.

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:48.250
So it makes it sort of
easier and more pressure.

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:50.345
Whereas when you
write your first book,

00:44:50.345 --> 00:44:51.970
no one is going to
be hanging over you,

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:54.030
so you need to be
tough on yourself,

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:56.100
whether that means
reaching out to a community

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.907
and finding writing
groups or even

00:44:57.907 --> 00:45:00.240
having just one or two friends
who are going to be like,

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.170
write that book.

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:03.054
You just need to get it done.

00:45:03.054 --> 00:45:05.220
I will say as well, though,
you don't have to get it

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.750
right on the first try.

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:08.730
It's more important
to get a book finished

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:11.299
than it is for that book to
be perfect on the first draft.

00:45:11.299 --> 00:45:12.840
I meet a lot of
people who've written

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.090
really good first
chapters and never

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:18.432
written chapter 2,
because they're obsessed

00:45:18.432 --> 00:45:19.390
with making it perfect.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:23.050
Whereas chapter 35 is going
to change your first chapter.

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:25.652
So it's better to get it down
so you can see what's good

00:45:25.652 --> 00:45:26.860
and what needs to be changed.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:28.510
So write the thing, basically.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:30.897
It's super basic advice,
but yeah, get it done.

00:45:30.897 --> 00:45:32.480
KARL RYAN: Is there
anymore questions?

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.726
We have one over there.

00:45:33.726 --> 00:45:34.642
Here, let me get you--

00:45:34.642 --> 00:45:37.590
AUDIENCE: I already
have a microphone.

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:38.556
Hi.

00:45:38.556 --> 00:45:42.826
When you get edit after edit
from book doctors and editors

00:45:42.826 --> 00:45:45.560
and publishing houses,
at what point do you say,

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.562
no, this isn't an
error, this is my style,

00:45:47.562 --> 00:45:48.775
I'm going to keep this one?

00:45:48.775 --> 00:45:52.200
Is it important to resist, or
do you take all the feedback?

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.885
DAVE RUDDEN: Generally, with--

00:45:53.885 --> 00:45:54.760
like I'm quite lucky.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.718
And generally, if you're
a professional editor,

00:45:56.718 --> 00:45:58.170
you're good at what you do.

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.260
So like Ben, every edit,
his favorite phrase

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.090
is, let's discuss--

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:05.550
where basically he'll
say, I don't quite

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:06.940
get what you're saying.

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:08.534
Why don't you try
and explain it?

00:46:08.534 --> 00:46:10.200
And I might have a
perfectly good reason

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:10.860
for that being there.

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.810
And he goes, well, I didn't
get it from the text.

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:14.230
Because when you're
writing your book,

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:15.210
you have it all in
the back of your head.

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:16.761
You know how everything works.

00:46:16.761 --> 00:46:18.510
Whereas the reader is
only picking up what

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:19.950
you've put down on the page.

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:26.760
So 99% of the time,
they have been right.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.295
When I handed in book one,
there was a chapter in it.

00:46:29.295 --> 00:46:30.810
And it was probably
one of the best

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:32.280
chapters I've ever written.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.020
And Ben, the first time I
met him, he was like, well,

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.000
look, your book isn't
out for two years,

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.416
so we don't have to talk about
the changes I want to make.

00:46:39.416 --> 00:46:42.550
And I was like, huh, what kind
of changes do you want to make?

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:44.050
And he was like, we don't
need to talk about this now.

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:44.540
Ha ha ha.

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.081
And I was like,
yeah, ha ha ha ha ha,

00:46:46.081 --> 00:46:48.075
what changes do
you want to make?

00:46:48.075 --> 00:46:50.640
And he was like, well, I
think the main character

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.180
reads as a 13-year-old,
not a 15-year-old,

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.600
because there's
no love interest.

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.183
There's no even kind
of scent of that.

00:46:56.183 --> 00:46:58.745
And I was like, yeah,
actually, that does make sense.

00:46:58.745 --> 00:47:00.620
And he's like, oh, and
I think this character

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:01.828
should come in a bit earlier.

00:47:01.828 --> 00:47:03.665
And I was like, yeah,
OK, that's quite good.

00:47:03.665 --> 00:47:06.400
And he's like, oh, and I think
you should cut that chapter.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.600
And I swear to God, the
temperature of the room

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.560
dropped 30 degrees.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.260
And I was like, you
want me to what?

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.840
And he was like, it
doesn't fit the book.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:18.020
It's a great 1,700
words, but it's--

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.340
what he said was-- like
straight to my heart--

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.010
it's an Empire
Strikes Back moment

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:23.570
in what should be a new hope.

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:26.740
And I was like, that's a
good way of describing it.

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:28.700
But I was I was raging
at him for like--

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.990
and my agent was like, we don't
need to talk about this now.

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:34.650
Actually, we can have a bit
of a chat about agents later.

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:36.140
They're really
good as go-betweens

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.280
and having the
awkward conversations

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.230
you don't want to.

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.970
But normally, they're right.

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:43.700
But generally, what
they'll say is--

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.207
they don't tell
you how to fix it.

00:47:45.207 --> 00:47:46.790
They tell you, you're
not getting this

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:47.665
across to the reader.

00:47:47.665 --> 00:47:48.960
Find a solution.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.560
And often, the solution
you find will, obviously,

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.760
make the book better,
and be even more elegant.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.460
Like they're just
signposting things

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:56.270
that you haven't thought of.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:58.520
Because your book is your
baby, and you haven't like--

00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.630
you think it's fantastic.

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:04.720
So there's only a few things
I've ever fought them on.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.970
Like when it comes
to word choice,

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:09.610
there's a line in book one where
it's like, his eyes narrowed

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.359
like an uncle disappointed.

00:48:11.359 --> 00:48:13.650
And they were like, you mean
like a disappointed uncle?

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:15.820
And I was like, no.

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.280
I specifically mean like
an uncle disappointed.

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.160
And they were like, OK.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.860
And we had a moment when the
American edit had come out,

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:26.710
where the main character
drinks a lot of tea,

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:29.100
obviously, because
he's from [INAUDIBLE]..

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:33.860
And the editor, the American
editor, was like, hey,

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:35.950
we think it might be
more age appropriate

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.210
if you have him drinking cocoa.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:40.330
And I was like, this is Ireland.

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:41.590
We drink tea.

00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:43.600
We give to babies in Ireland.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.490
Cocoa's for people with notions.

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:46.390
And they backed off.

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:48.010
And normally, they
will back off.

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:50.350
If you can make your case
strong enough to keep it,

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:52.540
they'll go, OK, you know
what you're talking about.

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.285
But generally, it's that
horrible thing where

00:48:54.285 --> 00:48:55.493
they'll say, what about this?

00:48:55.493 --> 00:48:58.750
And you're like, oh,
oh yeah, OK, cool.

00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:02.280
I did fight them on book
two, because there's

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.270
the main character has two kni--

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:07.150
he gets two knives in book two,
because he's useless with one,

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:09.190
so he may as well
double up, dual wheeled!

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.564
And he's got them in sheaths
underneath his armpits.

00:49:11.564 --> 00:49:14.230
And he's really pride because he
manages to-- will you hold this

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.410
for a second?

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:15.220
KARL RYAN: Yes, of course.

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.469
DAVE RUDDEN: He manages to
draw them both without hand

00:49:17.469 --> 00:49:19.830
capitating himself.

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:21.340
I was delighted with that word.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:25.970
And my editor was like, hand
capitate isn't a word, Dave.

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:27.700
And I was like, but
look at it, though.

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:28.820
It's so beautiful.

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.910
She was like, even
if it was a word,

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:33.190
it would be de-handitate,
because cap means head.

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:36.010
And I was like, please,
just gave me this one thing.

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:37.360
And she was like, fine.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.120
So I got my hand capitate.

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.380
It is always a conversation.

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:43.920
They will never
force you, basically.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.264
So you just talk it out.

00:49:45.264 --> 00:49:46.180
It's very situational.

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.805
You just talk it out
with them and see.

00:49:47.805 --> 00:49:49.407
So so far, it's been
fine, basically.

00:49:49.407 --> 00:49:50.282
KARL RYAN: All right.

00:49:50.282 --> 00:49:52.427
I think we have time for
maybe one last question,

00:49:52.427 --> 00:49:54.051
and then we're out
of time, I'm afraid.

00:49:54.051 --> 00:49:55.327
So right here.

00:49:55.327 --> 00:49:57.910
DAVE RUDDEN: I'm happy to stick
around for a couple of minutes

00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:59.270
afterwards if people want
to ask questions one on one.

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:00.749
KARL RYAN: Thanks, Dave.

00:50:00.749 --> 00:50:01.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:03.315
So I always love to read--

00:50:03.315 --> 00:50:05.440
the first line of a book
would introduces a writer.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.870
And you saying Dave Rudden
enjoys [INAUDIBLE] adventure

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:11.674
and being cruel to fictional
children, how does,

00:50:11.674 --> 00:50:13.090
as a children's
fiction writer, it

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:15.460
work to be cruel to
fictional children?

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:18.050
Has it ever gotten
you to any trouble

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:19.690
in the modern age,
where you write--

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:21.970
where you have helicopter
parents or social jerks

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:22.930
a warriors?

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:27.830
Did it ever get you to any kind
of, like, ooh, no, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:29.607
DAVE RUDDEN: Kids,
kids love that.

00:50:29.607 --> 00:50:31.690
That's the one thing that
kids come to me as like,

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:34.148
you always say it's like being
cruel to fictional children.

00:50:34.148 --> 00:50:34.990
It's like, yeah.

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:37.085
I like books with
angst and danger

00:50:37.085 --> 00:50:39.460
and where people are on the
absolute edge of their nerves

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:40.550
the whole time.

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:43.120
And my bio, and
even the first line

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.831
of the book, which
is looking back

00:50:44.831 --> 00:50:47.080
at how bad a mistake to fill
the orphanage with books,

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.430
was my mission statement.

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:51.610
Because I knew that
my agent or the 26

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:54.270
people who could be my agent
would look at the first line

00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:54.770
first.

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:57.310
And I was like, this is
who I am as a person.

00:50:57.310 --> 00:51:00.310
I want to write a book
that's kind of mean to kids,

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:02.560
because kids love that.

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.750
If you come turn around
to a 12-year-old, which

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:07.000
is who the book is for, and
you're like, how it going?

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:07.790
Look at you there.

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:09.772
They're like, I'm 12.

00:51:09.772 --> 00:51:11.980
Whereas if you walk in and
go, what's wrong with you?

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:13.539
Why are you so small?

00:51:13.539 --> 00:51:14.080
They love it.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.000
They think it's great.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.620
And there is a lot of precedent.

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:19.510
Lemony Snicket was
super successful.

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:21.640
Every big word I know I
know from Lemony Snicket,

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.840
like plateau or marmalade.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:28.201
And I wanted a book that
pushed the envelope.

00:51:28.201 --> 00:51:29.950
It's the first time
I've written for kids.

00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:31.784
And I was like, an
editor will pull me back.

00:51:31.784 --> 00:51:33.116
There's no swearing in the book.

00:51:33.116 --> 00:51:35.410
Swearing is a thing you
can't do in kids' books.

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:37.060
Violence, you can get away with.

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:40.440
And romances, that
stuff is kind of fine.

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.886
And swearing is
pretty much a no.

00:51:42.886 --> 00:51:44.260
So there were a
couple of lines I

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:45.640
had to take out of the book,
because it just wouldn't

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.170
work with that in them.

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:50.470
And I went on, going, I
want to write a book that's

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:52.230
dark and weird and obsessing.

00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:53.730
And if kids have a
problem with this

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:55.000
or want to talk
about the themes,

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:55.990
I will talk about the themes.

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.914
Same with parents--

00:51:56.914 --> 00:51:58.330
I've done
parent-teacher meetings.

00:51:58.330 --> 00:51:59.765
I can be like,
what was the prob--

00:51:59.765 --> 00:52:01.360
because what was the problem
your kid had with the book?

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.190
It's generally a problem the
parents have with the book.

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:04.606
And it's like,
well, this is why I

00:52:04.606 --> 00:52:08.310
did it, and hope I'm charming
enough that they go, OK.

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:09.969
No, my books are mean to kids.

00:52:09.969 --> 00:52:12.010
That's pretty much-- that's
my mission statement.

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:13.250
KARL RYAN: Well, listen,
I think we're out of time.

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:15.820
Dave, we should point out that
the second book, "The Forever

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.470
Court," is out next Friday?

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:20.020
DAVE RUDDEN: It's on sale
from the 31st of March.

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:24.102
And we're doing the launch
in Easons at 6 o'clock--

00:52:24.102 --> 00:52:25.960
at Easons on O'Connell
Street, at 6 o'clock.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.626
And it's being launched
by Eoin Colfer--

00:52:27.626 --> 00:52:30.267
oh, be still, be
still my fanboy heart.

00:52:30.267 --> 00:52:31.350
And you should come along.

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:33.160
There will be
Prosecco and sweets.

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:33.750
KARL RYAN: Definitely
come along.

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:35.430
Listen, huge round of applause.

00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:36.330
Thanks to Dave.

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:39.680
[APPLAUSE]
