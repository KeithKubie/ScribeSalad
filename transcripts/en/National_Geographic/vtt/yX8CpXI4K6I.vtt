00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.960
The saltwater crocodile is
among the fiercest hunters

00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:04.200
on the planet.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.066
This awe-inspiring
prehistoric predator

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:10.233
has the strongest animal
bite ever recorded

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:12.400
and can measure 20 feet long.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.200
No doubt it takes a
certain breed of human

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.467
to live in the salty's habitat.

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:19.734
But in Australia's
top end, locals

00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:23.266
have a unique and surprising
method to cope with the world's

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.066
largest reptile.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.666
Here's Tim Samuel's,
"Down Under."

'It's rare these days
to be able to celebrate

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.199
an extinction good news story.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.600
But 40 odd years after
being close to disappearing,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.266
crocodiles now outnumber humans
in the Northern Territory

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:59.833
thanks to an aggressive
conservation campaign.

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:03.033
As the humans around here
push their boundaries,

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:05.700
the crocodile
population pushes back.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.867
Keeping the peace is
a constant struggle.

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:11.734
[music playing]

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.500
REPORTER: Good evening.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.166
A family's worst
nightmare has come true

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.467
with strong indications
their 11-year-old girl

00:01:25.467 --> 00:01:28.500
has been taken by a crocodile.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.467
Charlene O'Sullivan's
daughter, Brioni,

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:32.333
went swimming with
her sister and a group

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.867
of friends Lambells Lagoon.

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:37.333
[music playing]

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.734
TIM SAMUELS: In 2009,
Charlene O'Sullivan's

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:47.399
11-year-old daughter,
Brioni, became

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.934
the 64th recorded
Australian to be killed

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:54.800
by a saltwater crocodile.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.433
I just remember sitting there
numb, thinking what happened?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.367
TIM SAMUELS: This
is where Brioni

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:06.200
was swimming with her
seven-year-old sister

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.800
Beth and two friends.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.033
I saw a crocodile tail
splash the surface,

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:13.000
and she disappeared.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.433
[music playing]

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.066
What was your
emotional reaction?

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:26.767
Angry, betrayed.

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:29.466
Did anybody else know that there
were crocodiles in the area?

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:31.300
And if they did, why
didn't they tell us?

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.834
[music playing]

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:36.867
This is my favorite.

00:02:36.867 --> 00:02:39.266
Yeah, that's her.

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:41.834
How often does Brioni
pop into your mind?

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:43.500
Daily.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.033
And I am richer for having her,
even if it was for a moment.

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:51.466
[music playing]

00:02:57.667 --> 00:02:59.834
TIM SAMUELS:
Saltwater crocodiles

00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:03.600
are like living dinosaurs.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.799
With adult males averaging
a size of 17 feet

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.400
and weighing half a ton
that a terrifying predator,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.367
so much so that for
a long time killing

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:15.132
them was a badge of honor.

00:03:17.867 --> 00:03:21.399
In fact, by the 1970s,
trophy hunting nearly

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.600
wiped them out altogether.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.966
But 40 years ago, a
controversial conservation plan

00:03:29.967 --> 00:03:32.700
brought them back
from the brink.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.299
Ironically, it was so
successful that now it's

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.433
Aussies that feel under threat.

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:42.132
So what convinced the folks
in the Northern Territory,

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:46.533
the so-called "Top End," to live
alongside these deadly beasts?

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:53.200
Behind this whole
conservation effort

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.132
is one guy, a Darwin
zoologist, the godfather

00:03:57.133 --> 00:03:59.567
of crocodile conservation.

00:03:59.567 --> 00:04:03.467
Grahame Webb knows
Crocs are a tough sell.

00:04:03.467 --> 00:04:05.834
Crocs are as bad as they look.

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:08.200
They will rip your arms
off, your legs off,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.600
they'll eat your children.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.233
You've got to have
good incentives

00:04:12.233 --> 00:04:14.066
for people to put up with that.

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:17.767
TIM SAMUELS: We met Grahame at
Crocodylus Park, the Wildlife

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:20.433
Center he founded in 1994.

00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:22.500
I feel like a maternity nurse.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.500
Yeah.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.967
TIM SAMUELS: Grahame's
been advocating

00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:29.500
for saltwater crocodiles,
or salty's, since the 70s.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.734
But his approach
was and is divisive.

00:04:32.734 --> 00:04:35.299
His aim is to get locals
to see the creature

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.567
not so much as a killer,
but a profitable commodity.

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:41.166
Take these eggs.

00:04:41.166 --> 00:04:43.367
These were laid by
the crocs at the park.

00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:45.700
Grahame and his
team have taken them

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.000
to sell to commercial farmers
to raise for slaughter.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.300
What's their fate?

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.333
Their fate is they'll
go in the incubator,

00:04:54.333 --> 00:04:55.900
and then they'll go
into a farm somewhere.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.834
On the farm raises them to
turn them into leather goods?

00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:02.400
Leather goods, and they go
into meat and souvenirs and

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.000
belts and all sorts of things.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.967
[music playing]

00:05:07.967 --> 00:05:11.366
TIM SAMUELS: Favored by luxury
brands like Louis Vuitton

00:05:11.367 --> 00:05:14.967
and Gucci, crocodile
leather fetches up to 30

00:05:14.967 --> 00:05:17.332
times the price of cow leather.

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:22.767
Some URMA handbags go for
well over 100,000 US dollars.

00:05:22.767 --> 00:05:25.567
[music playing]

00:05:25.567 --> 00:05:29.734
All told, Aussie salty's are
$100 million US dollar a year

00:05:29.734 --> 00:05:33.767
industry, and that's
a strong motivation

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:37.367
for keeping croc numbers up.

00:05:37.367 --> 00:05:38.800
Does it not feel
strange that you are--

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.033
Not for me.

00:05:40.033 --> 00:05:41.900
A zoologist, you're
a conservationist,

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.366
you're lovingly
rearing these eggs

00:05:44.367 --> 00:05:45.633
to then turn into a handbag.

00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:48.567
I can look at what
we've achieved here.

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:53.467
We've brought the populations
back to carrying capacity.

00:05:53.467 --> 00:05:55.500
TIM SAMUELS: Grahame
compares salty's

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.233
with another deadly predator
fighting for survival.

00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:03.467
Back in the 70s,
the global number

00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:07.133
of wild tigers was roughly
the same as the number

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:08.599
of top end salty's.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.600
Today, the crocs
have bounced back,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.934
but the tiger
remains on the brink.

00:06:13.934 --> 00:06:15.700
Why is that?

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.133
Why is that?

00:06:18.133 --> 00:06:20.567
That's because the people
who live with tigers

00:06:20.567 --> 00:06:25.467
do not have any vested interest
in having lots of tigers.

00:06:25.467 --> 00:06:27.567
TIM SAMUELS: Though the
hatchlings from these eggs

00:06:27.567 --> 00:06:29.934
will grow up on
farms, there are still

00:06:29.934 --> 00:06:34.433
100,000 salty's roaming in the
wild in the Northern Territory.

00:06:34.433 --> 00:06:36.700
So while trophy
hunting is banned,

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.533
the Aussie government
allows up to 1,200 permits

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:43.900
a year to top end hunters
who track down problem crocs.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.200
[knife sharpening]

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.300
I'm all ready to go
for a bit of a recky.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.000
When you say recky,
do you mean see

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.467
if any crocodiles is out there?
- Yes.

00:06:51.467 --> 00:06:53.032
And if there is, we're
going to catch them.

00:06:53.033 --> 00:06:54.033
Right.

00:06:54.033 --> 00:06:55.233
Great.

00:06:55.233 --> 00:06:57.367
Roger Matthews
makes a living culling

00:06:57.367 --> 00:07:00.700
problem crocs with the help
of his teenage son, Brody.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.033
Are you game fro
a a bit of action?

00:07:02.033 --> 00:07:04.700
Yeah, let's see
what's out there.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.599
[music playing]

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.066
Roger is being called
out to this ranch

00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:12.799
to hunt down a croc that's
been stalking the owner's cows.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.600
[music playing]

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.400
We drive to a nearby
waterhole, a place

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.500
salty's are known to hide out.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.266
You'd be surprised,
half a meter of water

00:07:28.266 --> 00:07:30.800
and this huge crocodile.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.734
TIM SAMUELS: The salty's MO
is to ambush their victims

00:07:34.734 --> 00:07:37.933
and drag them into the
water and drown them.

00:07:37.934 --> 00:07:40.367
[roaring]

00:07:42.233 --> 00:07:43.400
You see this?

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:48.300
This is definitely a crocodile.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.066
A few bubbles in here.

00:07:50.066 --> 00:07:53.566
[music playing]

00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:55.734
TIM SAMUELS: And how do you
know there's just one in there?

00:07:55.734 --> 00:07:56.700
You don't.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.066
Air bubbles and the nose.

00:08:01.066 --> 00:08:01.933
See that?

00:08:01.934 --> 00:08:03.900
TIM SAMUELS: Yeah.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.967
Roger has spotted the salty.

00:08:05.967 --> 00:08:07.133
Now the hard part--

00:08:07.133 --> 00:08:08.700
it's pretty wild.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.166
Catching it.

00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:11.767
A two man job.

00:08:11.767 --> 00:08:14.367
Woah.

00:08:14.367 --> 00:08:20.734
Reeling in a croc like this
is a half ton tug-of-war.

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:21.532
Have you got it?

00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:22.900
ROGER MATTHEWS: We got him.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.366
[music playing]

00:08:28.033 --> 00:08:32.400
TIM SAMUES: By law, this croc
must be humanely put down.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.467
OK.

00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:35.766
Do you feel bad about
having to do this?

00:08:35.767 --> 00:08:40.100
ROGER MATTHEWS: I do, but
also it's what we have to do.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.600
TIM SAMUELS: And
how he gets paid.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.433
And how much is a
nice trophy skin?

00:08:45.433 --> 00:08:47.700
A full meter
crocodile, the skin

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.200
could be worth anywhere
from $5,000 to $6,000.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.433
And the skull is about
$4,000 Australian dollars.

00:08:55.433 --> 00:08:58.000
TIM SAMUELS: Roger
loves crocs, yet,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.900
he makes a living hunting them.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.266
It's contradictions like
these that define Australia's

00:09:03.266 --> 00:09:05.333
croc conservation program.

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:07.467
Consider Charlene O'Sullivan.

00:09:07.467 --> 00:09:12.066
Her daughter, Brioni, was
killed by a croc in 2009.

00:09:12.066 --> 00:09:13.300
Now, she farms them.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.199
Are you serious?

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.133
I'm absolutely serious.

00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:18.567
Not what a lot of
people expected.

00:09:21.967 --> 00:09:23.400
They're just over here.

00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:28.500
TIM SAMUELS: How many
crocodiles do you have?

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.934
CHARLENE O'SULLIVAN:
About 4,500 at the moment.

00:09:31.934 --> 00:09:35.500
TIM SAMUELS: Charlen's
farm is called be BA Crocs.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.834
The BA stands for Brioni Anne.

00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:41.967
[music playing]

00:09:41.967 --> 00:09:45.967
It is, I guess, the legacy
towards my daughter's death,

00:09:45.967 --> 00:09:48.266
to her life as well.

00:09:48.266 --> 00:09:49.834
This is for her.

00:09:49.834 --> 00:09:53.800
[music playing]

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.733
TIM SAMUELS: In a
capitalistic society,

00:09:56.734 --> 00:10:00.300
it seems everything can be
sold, given the right price,

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.400
even animal conservation.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.199
That salty's are no
longer endangered

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.166
is proof for many this
commercial model is working.

00:10:09.166 --> 00:10:11.533
But as stories of
commercial conservation

00:10:11.533 --> 00:10:15.467
play out around the world
on game reserves in Africa

00:10:15.467 --> 00:10:17.900
and the jungles
of Southeast Asia,

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.900
the true costs
remain to be seen.
