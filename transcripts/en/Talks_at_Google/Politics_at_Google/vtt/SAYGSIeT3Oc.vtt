[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.850
JORDAN KLEPPER: Hey, everybody.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:11.820
SPEAKER: Well, hello.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.055
JORDAN KLEPPER: Hello.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:15.930
SPEAKER: I think I should
start with asking--

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.638
JORDAN KLEPPER: You
say hello back, guys.

00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:18.940
Come on, for God's sakes.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.310
Let's be congenial
to one another.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.391
What are these T-shirts?

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.640
Can I know these T-shirts are?

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.098
Sorry, it's right
in the front row.

00:00:27.098 --> 00:00:29.210
Are these pictures of
you on your own T-shirt?

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.850
Is this a Google thing, or
is this just a Rob thing?

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.784
Good to know, OK.

00:00:32.784 --> 00:00:34.615
SPEAKER: It's not an inside
joke we have to understand.

00:00:34.615 --> 00:00:35.614
JORDAN KLEPPER: OK, yes.

00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:37.100
Just a Rob thing, OK, good.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.250
All right, I'm learning
the Google ways, great.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.177
SPEAKER: So I want to start out
by asking who am I talking to.

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:44.010
JORDAN KLEPPER: Ooh.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.860
SPEAKER: Am I talking
to you, or am I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.937
talking to the character
version of you?

00:00:47.937 --> 00:00:49.520
JORDAN KLEPPER: You
are talking to me.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.561
SPEAKER: The real Jordan.

00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:53.782
JORDAN KLEPPER: The real Jordan,
yes, as actualized as I can be,

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:54.990
which is not very actualized.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.890
SPEAKER: What is the
difference between that person

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.770
and the character?

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.144
JORDAN KLEPPER:
I'd like to think

00:01:00.144 --> 00:01:03.528
the real me is a little
bit smarter and self-aware.

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:05.069
SPEAKER: We'd all
like to think that.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.560
JORDAN KLEPPER: We'd
all like to think that.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.730
I think it's perspective.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.430
I think when we talk about the
character I play on the show

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.450
or what have you, and the
guy I try to highlight,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.047
it's somebody who
doesn't understand

00:01:16.047 --> 00:01:17.630
his place in the
world, and therefore,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.760
feels like he's the
victim in certain ways.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.060
He feels like he's
being hated on.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.100
He's the white man who thinks
he deserves everything.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.080
And I think Jordan Klepper
is the white man who

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.110
understands a little bit of that
privilege and that perspective.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.770
I think the character does not
and just uses that as a cudgel

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.500
and as a weapon.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.375
SPEAKER: The world
is against him.

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:36.260
JORDAN KLEPPER: The
world is against me.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.850
I have something
to fight against.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.842
SPEAKER: So how did
you find that person?

00:01:39.842 --> 00:01:41.300
How did you develop
that character?

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.900
What kind of research
went into it?

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.497
Did you go method
like Daniel Day Lewis?

00:01:45.497 --> 00:01:48.080
JORDAN KLEPPER: I just became a
little bit dumber and angrier,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.430
and just like that.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.880
I don't know what that Daniel
Day Lewis guy is even doing.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.740
I think what has actually
been really fun--

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.150
I've been doing improv comedy
and comedy for a long time.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.220
And so instead of
necessarily stand-up,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.600
with improv and with sketch
you create versions of yourself

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.745
and find characters around that.

00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:10.120
And then getting to do a show
like "The Daily Show," what

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.080
was really fun about
that is you are

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.630
playing this heightened
version of yourself

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.679
but with flaws that
allow you to bounce

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:17.720
around different stories.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.570
And so I think the ability to
play that version of myself

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.920
on "The Daily Show," who
wasn't-- it was titled Jordan

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.420
Klepper.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.740
I was a correspondent there.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.698
But it's a different
version of Jordan Klepper.

00:02:26.698 --> 00:02:30.980
That's something that helped
me figure out both how

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.170
I could play this new
show and how I could be

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.700
a character within that world.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.420
SPEAKER: So it's kind
of a political moment

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.403
we're living through.

00:02:39.403 --> 00:02:40.486
JORDAN KLEPPER: You think?

00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:42.230
SPEAKER: A little bit.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.817
Just a smidgen of
interest these days.

00:02:43.817 --> 00:02:45.650
JORDAN KLEPPER: It feels
like people focused

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.060
on politics nowadays, yeah.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.810
SPEAKER: Possibly.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.380
JORDAN KLEPPER: It could be.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.713
SPEAKER: Or we're getting there.

00:02:49.713 --> 00:02:50.570
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yes.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.520
SPEAKER: So to have a
show like this that's

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.980
right in the thick of it,
right in the midst of it

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.420
going right into
all these issues

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.760
that people are talking
about with this bizarre meta

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.070
twist, how did you develop that?

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.830
JORDAN KLEPPER: Well, I spent
three years at "The Daily

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.040
Show," and I was talking
with Comedy Central

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.900
about doing another show.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.080
And I loved-- my job at "The
Daily Show" was a dream job.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.750
To get to both work
with those people

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.500
to do a show that's constantly
responding to the news

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.250
was my passion and
where I wanted to be.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.266
But we talked about if we
wanted to do a new show,

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:25.640
where did that
show want to live?

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.550
And at the time, I was going
to a lot of Trump rallies

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.840
talking to a lot of people.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.506
And this political
moment you're talking

00:03:31.506 --> 00:03:35.744
about it, this new Trumpism
felt like something new.

00:03:35.744 --> 00:03:37.160
It felt like
something we were all

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.410
experiencing and
trying to articulate

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.930
what this moment was.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.527
And as we were brainstorming
what world should this show be

00:03:44.527 --> 00:03:46.610
in, I want it to be a show
that is about the news,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.276
and I want it to be
about something that

00:03:48.276 --> 00:03:50.390
feels like the news in 2017.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.731
And I think, as I was talking
to a lot of those people

00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:54.980
at the Trump rallies, we
were talking about where they

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.327
were getting their news from.

00:03:56.327 --> 00:03:57.160
And it wasn't like--

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.719
Trump is not your
average Republican.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.010
He's not your average anything.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.282
And I think we realized it's not
an ideological Republican thing

00:04:05.282 --> 00:04:05.990
that's happening.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.250
It's a Trump thing
that's happening,

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.916
and these people were
getting their news

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:12.020
at these Trump rallies
not from the classic

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.690
Fox News or at all CNN, they
were getting it from these more

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.670
fringier worlds and sites,
like the "Infowars,"

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.370
the "Breitbarts,"
the "Daily Callers."

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.730
It was like, I think this
world of paranoia and fringe

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.215
feels like that
moment that we want

00:04:24.215 --> 00:04:25.340
to start to play around in.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.910
So if we're going to build
a show with a perspective,

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.600
let's build it out of that,
out of that paranoia, that

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.690
fear that's the less
classic conservatism

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.800
and more like
paranoia and chaos.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.795
And I think also
folding that in--

00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:42.920
SPEAKER: And make it funny.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.628
JORDAN KLEPPER: And
try to make it funny.

00:04:44.628 --> 00:04:47.000
I mean, for me, what I like
though is I got to play

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.060
a character on "The Daily
Show," so I didn't--

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.700
What I always say is
it's show not tell.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.430
Trevor is so great
at being Trevor Noah

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.180
and telling you the
bullshit that he sees.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.395
I think it's more
fun for me to be

00:04:58.395 --> 00:05:00.770
the guy who doesn't see the
bullshit and gets to play it.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.900
And for us, that felt
like that was the world

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.280
we wanted to inhabit.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.926
SPEAKER: Immersion
in those worlds,

00:05:06.926 --> 00:05:08.050
what did you learn from it?

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.633
What do you continue
to learn from it?

00:05:09.633 --> 00:05:11.720
When you're at
Trump rally, you're

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.370
among Roy Moore
supporters or something,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.430
why is there this fixation
on conspiracy theories?

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.910
Why are they getting their news
from these different sites?

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:24.840
What's the appetite?

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.881
JORDAN KLEPPER: The appetite
is for confirmation.

00:05:26.881 --> 00:05:29.550
Yeah, so there's confirmation
bias of that thing you feel.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.750
Now you can find it.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.310
You can Google it.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.610
I've researched you guys.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.550
SPEAKER: Well done.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.800
JORDAN KLEPPER: I
know what you guys do.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.510
SPEAKER: Product placement.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.450
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yeah.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.410
But you can find the news that
complements your world view.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.930
And so I see that is
something we all do.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.209
I'm guilty of it as well.

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:49.500
We all have our news sources,
the places we want to go,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.541
the places that make us
feel good in the morning,

00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:53.640
of like, yes, this is
saying the thing about Trump

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.600
that I want it to say.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.400
This maybe is from a
different perspective,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.360
but I can throw that out
because I don't like it.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.776
And I think we're
living in a time

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:02.490
where Donald Trump,
what he's very good at

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.950
is creating distrust
in institutions.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.720
And I think we should be
critical of institutions.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.640
We should be aware
of institutions.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.280
But what I saw at
these rallies was

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.800
he legitimized the
idea of doubting

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.280
all information you don't like.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.150
He's de-legitimizing
media in a way

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.980
that people think CNN
is completely fake.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.730
People don't trust
anything that comes out

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.900
of "The New York Times."

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.990
SPEAKER: They
really believe that?

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.406
JORDAN KLEPPER:
They believe that.

00:06:29.406 --> 00:06:33.240
I think you see that groupthink
because they hear it.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.502
A story that I often talk
about is I would go to--

00:06:37.502 --> 00:06:39.960
I started going to Trump rallies
in January of the election

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.590
year.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.930
And I would talk
to people outside.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.150
And I would say 2
out of 10 people

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.570
would buy into the Obama birth
certificate, the birtherism

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.170
conspiracy.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.231
2 out of 10 would talk
openly about that.

00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:52.980
Because at that point,
it was very fringe,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.550
the idea of questioning
Barack Obama, his legitimacy

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.590
as a citizen, was
like, eh, I'm not

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.870
going to-- no, that's crazy.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.280
But I support Donald Trump.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.350
By the end, that was
easy 8 out of 10.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.620
It was so open that
you didn't have

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.120
to feel weird about that because
all those people would walk

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.879
into an arena where a guy
who's leading in the polls

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:14.170
is telling them, "you should
be doubting these things."

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.010
He was yelling at the
media, "they're fake.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.360
They're fake.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.710
They're fake."

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:17.730
It's all you ever hear.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.664
And you hear
something three times,

00:07:19.664 --> 00:07:20.830
and you start to believe it.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.820
And with Donald Trump, you
hear something a million times.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.800
And I think we see that with--

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.460
we see what he's
doing with media.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.520
And I think it's
dangerous, because now you

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.921
don't have to trust that
institution of news,

00:07:31.921 --> 00:07:33.420
and now "The New
York Times" is just

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.522
as fringe as some bullshit thing
you see pop up on Facebook.

00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:39.480
And so I think that's
what I'm starting to see.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.380
I see it starting to
happen now with the FBI.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.713
And I think that's what's scary.

00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:44.820
I think that's the
next institution.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.509
Robert Mueller's going to fire
in the next couple of weeks,

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:49.800
and there's not going to be
an outcry from those people

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.710
because the FBI is
now an institution.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.085
Law enforcement
is an institution

00:07:54.085 --> 00:07:55.709
that we don't have
to buy into anymore.

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:57.590
SPEAKER: What happens
when he gets fired?

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.173
JORDAN KLEPPER: Boy,
I think timing is

00:07:59.173 --> 00:08:01.680
going to be really interesting.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.120
I think the Doomsday--

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.580
or the pessimist inside
of me says he gets fired,

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.847
and the left is--

00:08:07.847 --> 00:08:08.930
they throw their hands up.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.013
They're really frustrated.

00:08:10.013 --> 00:08:13.320
And there's a big groundswell to
hold Trump's feet to the fire.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.690
Hopefully there's a big--

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.240
I could see a big march on
Washington or something.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.650
I would hope to see that.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.280
I think that is a scary
moment in our culture.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.160
I don't see a lot of
the people on the right

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.310
who are in power as having the
backbone to stand up to that.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.680
I think that's a really
scary point for us to be.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.763
SPEAKER: I feel like there
was this pivotal moment

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.580
with Merrick Garland
and the Supreme Court,

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.049
which people don't
always refer to.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.390
But the fact that Mitch
McConnell stonewalled

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.010
so completely on
that is something

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.909
that constitutionally is
simply supposed to happen.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:44.700
He was the nominee.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.449
He's supposed to go
through the procedure.

00:08:46.449 --> 00:08:48.180
It simply never occurred.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.095
That to me was a signal
of all bets are off.

00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:52.470
JORDAN KLEPPER:
All bets are off.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.440
The idea of bipartisanship or
a line that we won't cross--

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.880
and we don't talk about
Merrick Garland anymore.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.390
SPEAKER: Yeah, I know.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.650
People don't even
know who I'm talking

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.200
about when I mention his name.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.470
It's strange, because
it was a major thing.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.820
JORDAN KLEPPER: That was
a clearly partisan move

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.630
that people are like,
this won't stand.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.360
And now we don't remember it.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.360
He won.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.110
McConnell won.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.460
SPEAKER: By doing nothing.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.350
JORDAN KLEPPER:
By doing nothing,

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.140
by not letting Merrick
Garland get his day in court,

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.180
if you will.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.107
They got their own guy in.

00:09:23.107 --> 00:09:25.190
SPEAKER: And that seems
to me significant in terms

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.280
of indicating what could
happen with Robert Mueller.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.850
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yes.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:34.040
I think what we need is good
strong leaders to stand up

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.350
against somebody who is
in their party for what

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.274
is good in America.

00:09:38.274 --> 00:09:39.440
I think you see some people.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.820
You see people like Jeff Flake.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.990
You see people who are
willing to buck the system

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.960
and go against what
the president is doing.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.700
And I think we need that.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.010
And hopefully,
hopefully, we have

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.790
enough faith in American
democracy that people stand up.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.894
I honestly haven't seen
enough evidence of it.

00:09:58.894 --> 00:10:01.310
SPEAKER: I want to switch to
a question about your health.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.189
I'm concerned because of the
MAGAMeal going challenge.

00:10:04.189 --> 00:10:05.480
JORDAN KLEPPER: Oh, geez, yeah.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.063
SPEAKER: I don't
know if you saw this.

00:10:07.063 --> 00:10:08.735
If you didn't, Google it.

00:10:08.735 --> 00:10:09.860
JORDAN KLEPPER: Good, good.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.370
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.680
What did you eat exactly?

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.577
It was basically a Trump lunch.

00:10:14.577 --> 00:10:15.410
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yes.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.500
So it came out in a book
by Corey Lewandowski,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.810
his former campaign
manager, just last week,

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.430
if you saw this.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.480
Donald Trump's regular
order for McDonald's was

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.060
two Big Macs, two
Filet of Fishes,

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.182
and a chocolate
malt slash shake.

00:10:32.182 --> 00:10:33.890
That's what he would
order at McDonald's.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:38.835
They say regularly, even
daily, which is fucking insane.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.112
That's insane.

00:10:43.112 --> 00:10:44.820
SPEAKER: I'm nauseated
thinking about it.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.730
JORDAN KLEPPER: He's
a 71-year-old man,

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.180
a grumpy old
71-year-old man who's

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.840
just inhaling this regularly.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.920
And so on the show, our
mind was sort of blown.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.120
And the questions
we were asking--

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.860
one is, this is
this guy is making

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.510
the most important
decisions on Earth,

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.970
and this is the
fuel that he has.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.960
And so we were like, let's do
a thing where I'm discussing.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.206
I'm having to make decisions.

00:11:08.206 --> 00:11:10.080
I'm having to discuss
what he was discussing.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.660
At that point, it was
the Jerusalem decision

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.824
where they were "moving"
our embassy to Jerusalem.

00:11:17.824 --> 00:11:18.990
SPEAKER: Just a minor thing.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.640
JORDAN KLEPPER:
Just a minor thing,

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.056
just dealing with
the Middle East.

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.160
So I decided to take
the MAGAMeal challenge

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.320
and eat his entire order
in the course of a segment.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.950
And that's a lot of food, guys.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.150
I would not recommend that.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.932
By the time you
shove a Big Mac in,

00:11:34.932 --> 00:11:36.390
it's the smell of
the Filet of Fish

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.401
that gets you a little
bit nauseous there.

00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:40.150
SPEAKER: You mentioned
that it was fishier

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.690
than you remembered.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:40.960
It was

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.418
JORDAN KLEPPER: It
was way fishier.

00:11:42.418 --> 00:11:45.061
I hadn't eaten that much
McDonald's in quite some time.

00:11:45.061 --> 00:11:46.310
And I was like, I can do this.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.393
And this one was real fun.

00:11:47.393 --> 00:11:49.851
We were writing the show,
and just before going out,

00:11:49.851 --> 00:11:50.850
trying to figure it out.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.130
I'm going to eat this meal.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.135
I'm going to try to do
it and kind of host,

00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:56.468
and we'll have somebody out
who's actually helping host.

00:11:56.468 --> 00:11:57.510
But how do I eat it?

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.604
What should I eat first?

00:11:58.604 --> 00:12:00.270
Will I be able to eat
all of this stuff?

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.228
And we had probably like
a 10 minute digression

00:12:02.228 --> 00:12:05.671
of whether it was possible
for a human being to eat this.

00:12:05.671 --> 00:12:07.170
And then we took a
step back, and we

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.840
were like, this is the
regular order of the commander

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.792
in chief right now.

00:12:10.792 --> 00:12:13.250
And we're like, I just don't
know if it's humanly possible.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.521
I just don't know.

00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:17.020
SPEAKER: Did you
actually finish it?

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.853
JORDAN KLEPPER: I
finished almost all of it.

00:12:18.853 --> 00:12:20.352
I still had like--

00:12:20.352 --> 00:12:21.810
I think I was 3/4
of the way there.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.090
I still had one Fillet of Fish.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:24.630
I mean it.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.930
I almost vomited
six times because it

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.200
is the smell of fillet of
fish shoved into your mouth.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.900
SPEAKER: There was kind of a
chartreuse hue on your face.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.358
JORDAN KLEPPER:
Yeah, you get where

00:12:35.358 --> 00:12:37.920
that color's coming from Donald
Trump when you eat his diet.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.330
You're like, oh, I see this.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.820
I also eat that, and I
don't want to get vile.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.620
But I'm like, that's
what that man eats.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.960
You know he's stressed.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.720
He's nervous because
everybody is coming at him.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:56.430
And can you imagine just the
Trump farts in a car with him?

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.770
Because that bag already
has its own order,

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.392
and you just have an
unhealthy 71-year-old man

00:13:01.392 --> 00:13:02.850
with the weight of
the world on him

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.490
who is just angry inhaling that.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.730
I'm like, that is the worst
place on Earth to be right

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.252
there.

00:13:10.252 --> 00:13:12.710
SPEAKER: That's actually the
most disgusting scenario ever.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.010
JORDAN KLEPPER: Can you just
imagine being in that car?

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.892
Oh, oh, OK.

00:13:17.892 --> 00:13:18.850
SPEAKER: But you're OK.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:20.266
I wondered if you
could even think

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:23.160
after that, because I would
imagine the brain fog, the food

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.180
coma.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.800
JORDAN KLEPPER: I
ended that segment.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.204
I did go backstage and
threw up a little bit.

00:13:29.204 --> 00:13:30.120
SPEAKER: A little bit?

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.328
JORDAN KLEPPER: A little bit.

00:13:31.328 --> 00:13:32.900
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] go in!

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.890
JORDAN KLEPPER: I
wanted more to come out.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.441
And then I came out, and I
interviewed astronaut Scott

00:13:38.441 --> 00:13:38.940
Kelly.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.480
That's the fun
thing of this job.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.230
And if you watch
that, my eyes are

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.920
so bloodshot in that
interview because I had just

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.570
thrown up nearly 2,400
calories and then sat down

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:52.320
with an astronaut.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.480
It's a fun job.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.605
SPEAKER: What's space like?

00:13:54.605 --> 00:13:56.850
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yeah,
tell me about space.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.200
How does that affect your body?

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:58.710
Tell me.

00:14:01.766 --> 00:14:03.140
SPEAKER: You grew
up in Michigan.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:03.973
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yup.

00:14:03.973 --> 00:14:05.450
SPEAKER: Michigan went to Trump.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.050
JORDAN KLEPPER: It did.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.700
SPEAKER: Do you have
any insight into that?

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.882
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yes, yes,
I have a lot of insights.

00:14:12.882 --> 00:14:13.465
SPEAKER: Good.

00:14:13.465 --> 00:14:15.131
JORDAN KLEPPER: Good,
let me share some.

00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:16.690
No, I grew up in
Kalamazoo, Michigan.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.840
Michigan is always right
on the line with that.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.420
I did a special
about the gun debate

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.920
that focused a lot on Michigan.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.090
And it's partially because
Michigan is very much

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.370
a microcosm of America.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.920
Kalamazoo has got a
couple universities.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.050
It's a fairly liberal town.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.940
You go 10 miles
outside of Kalamazoo,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.537
and you are in hunting town.

00:14:39.537 --> 00:14:41.620
And all you're going to
do is you're hunting duck.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.480
You're hunting quail.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.669
It has Calvin College,
which is 40 minutes outside

00:14:46.669 --> 00:14:47.210
of Kalamazoo.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.230
It's a very religious
little enclave as well.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.270
And you start to see
America is full of a lot

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:53.770
of different people,
a lot of things

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.210
they very much care about.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:15:00.130
And I think when I would go back
and talk to people in Michigan,

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.100
you see that, I think,
a lot of liberals

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.230
focused on this
election as something

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.982
that you are taking
the totality of Trump.

00:15:07.982 --> 00:15:09.940
And I think there's a
lot of people in Michigan

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.349
and places across the
country who take one issue,

00:15:12.349 --> 00:15:13.390
and they hold on to that.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.950
And it could have been
the Second Amendment.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.116
It could have been abortion.

00:15:16.116 --> 00:15:18.010
I think we see that
in Alabama as well.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.380
There's a lot of Trump voters
who are one-issue voters,

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.884
and that issue might have
just been, I want a change.

00:15:22.884 --> 00:15:24.550
And for me, that's
always been something

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.320
in Michigan whose had--

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.520
Michigan has had its issues.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.620
Detroit has had a really tough
time, is coming back right now.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.590
Flint has had a
really tough time.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.690
The automobile industry
has been up and down

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.340
and a little bit back
up again in a way

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.600
that people are frustrated.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.730
People are underemployed.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.010
And I think you look
at election as a way

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.770
to like vote for change.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:46.250
And at its simplest--
in this last election,

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.300
if you were unhappy about
where you were in life,

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.430
and you wanted a
change, the candidate

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.850
who was advocating
change was Donald Trump.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:58.310
And I think I could empathize
with that understanding.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.345
I was against that decision
for a lot of the reasons.

00:16:02.345 --> 00:16:04.720
But I could see that a lot of
people who were frustrated,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.094
who were down on their luck
and were like, I want change,

00:16:07.094 --> 00:16:09.520
to me, Hillary
Clinton is not change.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.950
Donald Trump, at least
it will shake things up.

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.060
SPEAKER: Even if change
is a dumpster fire.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.830
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yeah,
because I think--

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:16.990
change is a dumpster fire.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:17.485
SPEAKER: I don't care.

00:16:17.485 --> 00:16:19.070
JORDAN KLEPPER: It's different.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.880
But I do think at
it's basic, if you

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.150
are somebody who has
been down on their luck

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.000
and doesn't have a lot of faith
in what government can do,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.790
then the idea of, let's
blow up the government,

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.150
is not as insane as some
people might make it out to be.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.370
Again, not something
I advocate, but it is

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.054
something I can empathize with.

00:16:38.054 --> 00:16:39.470
SPEAKER: When you
were growing up,

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.920
were there certain comedians
who had an influence on you

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.630
and your sensibility?

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.490
JORDAN KLEPPER: I was
a huge Jim Carrey fan.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.120
But as far as
sensibility, I just

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.730
ripped off every line he said
in "Ace Ventura" and "Dumb

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.060
and Dumber," and just
regurgitated in my math class.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.060
SPEAKER: Did you really?

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.210
JORDAN KLEPPER: Oh, yes, I
was so annoying in math class,

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.430
just quoting "Dumb and
Dumber" line after line.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.750
SPEAKER: The teacher's just
like, Klepper, oh, my god.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.958
JORDAN KLEPPER: Just shut up.

00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.680
Let me go through this theorem.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.020
But I think "Monty
Python," British comedy,

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.430
was always really
exciting to me.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.920
"Monty Python," sketch
comedy, "The State,"

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.544
those were early things
that I really got into it.

00:17:14.544 --> 00:17:16.210
"Whose Line Is It
Anyway?" was something

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.060
that I fell in love with
watch on Comedy Central

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.762
and made me go and do
improv comedy in college.

00:17:21.762 --> 00:17:22.720
SPEAKER: Did it really?

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.890
JORDAN KLEPPER: It did, yeah.

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.765
I would come home after
school in high school

00:17:25.765 --> 00:17:28.329
and watch "General
Hospital" with my mom,

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:31.180
and then I would watch
"Whose Line Is It Anyway?"

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.387
on Comedy Central.

00:17:32.387 --> 00:17:33.220
And I would love it.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.900
I loved Ryan Stiles,
Colin Mochrie.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.350
And when I went to
college, I didn't know what

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.370
I was going to do with my life.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.970
And at orientation,
I walked onto campus,

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.357
and there was an ad up to
audition for the improv team.

00:17:46.357 --> 00:17:48.190
And I was like, oh,
that's such a fun thing.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:49.190
I've been a fan of that.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:50.640
Let's give that a shot.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.280
And it was a blast
and kind of segue

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.170
into me taking a real interest
in this idea of comedy

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.000
and the idea of performance.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.250
SPEAKER: I recently saw--

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.930
I finally caught up with
"The Big Sick," great film,

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:06.490
and it reminded me of
those gutting moments

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:09.340
of a comic up on stage trying
to get the crowd to laugh,

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.180
and things are just--

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.310
Have you had those nights?

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.810
JORDAN KLEPPER: No, no, I've
always had success with comedy.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.050
SPEAKER: Just home
run, batted 1,000.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.550
JORDAN KLEPPER: Almost, but
with improv, you'd be surprised.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.400
I'm always just knocking
them out of the park.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.820
SPEAKER: Just from the start.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.069
JORDAN KLEPPER: Right off
the bat, you'd be surprised,

00:18:28.069 --> 00:18:28.800
a real natural.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.830
No, that is part of
the quest, I think.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.400
Improv is full of those moments.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.210
I think, from an
outsider perspective,

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.312
it's almost entirely
those moments.

00:18:39.312 --> 00:18:41.020
From an insider, you
think you're killing

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.430
a lot more than you are.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:47.177
But I think that
feeling of you can fail

00:18:47.177 --> 00:18:49.510
and you're constantly getting
response from the audience

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:52.869
is part of what is so exciting,
but it never goes away.

00:18:52.869 --> 00:18:54.910
I think you're always
hoping that you are getting

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.490
the response that you want.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.022
But comedians, you're
always failing too.

00:19:00.022 --> 00:19:01.480
Again, that has
been something that

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.640
is a really worthwhile
lesson, especially

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.710
doing the job I
do right now where

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:07.021
you have to be responsive.

00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:08.020
We write a lot of jokes.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.020
We write a lot of shows.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.810
We're doing one every day.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:14.910
You can't be precious, because
that fear will lock it up,

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.160
and you won't create anything.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.950
And so I think that nugget
that I take from improv is--

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.870
try, be confident.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.364
If you fail, step over it,
and keep moving forward.

00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:27.280
SPEAKER: I would imagine
you can't get hung up

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.237
on one dead joke, one failure,
or you'd just be paralyzed.

00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:32.070
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yes.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.940
And you do.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.010
I'm not without
total fear and doubt.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.150
It happens for sure.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.444
The internet also
helps that too.

00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:41.360
You will have that moment
that didn't go well,

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.750
and the internet will find it,
and they will tweet it back

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.833
at you, which is really
nice to be like, remember,

00:19:45.833 --> 00:19:48.280
you're a failure.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.360
Thank you, good to know.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.310
SPEAKER: Just wanted to
let you know you suck.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:52.559
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:53.590
Thank you noted.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.614
SPEAKER: Right on.

00:19:54.614 --> 00:19:56.280
JORDAN KLEPPER: So
that is always there.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.750
But yeah, I think if you
get too caught up on it--

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.029
again, I'm lucky.

00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:01.570
I go into work the
next day, and it's

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.474
like, I've got to
focus on today.

00:20:03.474 --> 00:20:05.515
SPEAKER: Another question
related to your health,

00:20:05.515 --> 00:20:07.432
more your psychological
health, your balance--

00:20:07.432 --> 00:20:09.098
JORDAN KLEPPER: This
is like a physical.

00:20:09.098 --> 00:20:10.790
SPEAKER: I'm worried
about you, OK?

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.870
I'm worried about you.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.453
JORDAN KLEPPER: Am
I am on trial here?

00:20:13.453 --> 00:20:14.842
What's going to happen?

00:20:14.842 --> 00:20:16.050
SPEAKER: How do you get away?

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.460
You're swimming in these
conspiracy theories

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.880
all the time to feed the
show, to feed your character.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:27.100
You're in touch with the lunacy,
the batshitness of "Infowars"

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.240
and stuff like that.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.550
And how do you get away from it?

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:36.625
How do you escape just to
meditate and get some peace?

00:20:36.625 --> 00:20:37.500
You know what I mean?

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.580
Because I think it would infect
your dreams after a while.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.830
JORDAN KLEPPER: It does, yeah.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:42.940
Yeah, it does.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.500
I would say my
dreams are infected

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.910
by the conspiracy of it.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.670
Also I'm three
months into the show,

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.880
and the anxiety of putting up
a show is all encompassing.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.290
And so I think we are
inundated ourselves with news

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.560
and getting this job done,
and the mind is racing.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:05.540
What I have found is getting
new input is very important,

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.740
and I don't have a
lot of time right now.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.980
I had to move into Manhattan.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.980
I was a Brooklyn guy, and
I moved into Manhattan

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.438
because that's
where our studio is.

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:16.139
And so something I do now,
I wake up on Saturday.

00:21:16.139 --> 00:21:17.680
And it's like, I
can't read the news.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.580
I do it every morning, but I'm
not going to read it right now.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.080
I'm going to get
up, and I usually--

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.130
I go to art museums just for
an hour, an hour and a half,

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:28.060
to get a new input that
is not commentary, that

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.070
is not telling me about Trump.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.890
I can look at an
abstract painting,

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.684
and I can make it about
Trump, and I usually do.

00:21:36.684 --> 00:21:38.350
But I like the idea
of getting something

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:42.880
in that is just not modern
bickering, modern partisanship

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.590
or editorializing.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.600
For me, that's pretty important.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.581
It gets me a little
of the way there.

00:21:48.581 --> 00:21:50.830
SPEAKER: Because I would
suspect everyone in this room

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.630
can say there are
moments in our lives

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.050
when we're inundated with social
media and the flow of all this

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.900
to where it just
feels unhealthy.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.590
You're in it to the n-th power.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.109
JORDAN KLEPPER:
Yeah, I think it's

00:22:01.109 --> 00:22:03.400
part of our society right
now, this idea of turning off

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:03.899
your phone.

00:22:03.899 --> 00:22:04.730
It's hard.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:07.400
And I think now this is much
more a part of what my job is,

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.076
and I need to stay
up on top of it.

00:22:09.076 --> 00:22:10.450
But it doesn't
help with clarity.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.266
I think I find myself
losing perspective.

00:22:13.266 --> 00:22:14.890
Because every day,
we're making choices

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:16.431
about what we're
going to cover, what

00:22:16.431 --> 00:22:18.700
the story of the day, what
our show's story of the day

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.640
should be, and if you're
too glued to your phone,

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.850
there's 10 new stories coming up
all the time that can make you

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:25.630
lose perspective.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.540
But you have to ride that
line of being aware but also

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.080
not being lost.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.260
SPEAKER: As a creator of comedy,
when a character comes along

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.010
like Roy Moore, do you
do you dance a jig?

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:42.870
Are you just like,
this is comedy gold?

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:48.910
Or I mean the horse,
the little gun?

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:52.600
JORDAN KLEPPER: The potential
rape and pedophilia.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:57.940
SPEAKER: I mean, he's
repulsive, and yet, you

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.440
have to create comedy out of it.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.240
Do you react like this is
too much, it's too dark?

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.700
Or, actually, we can create
something very entertaining

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.200
out of it?

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.220
How do you react to it?

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.020
JORDAN KLEPPER: The reaction
is a guttural feeling.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.560
I react.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.910
I'm aghast at it.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.910
It isn't like we find
it, and that's the job.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.760
And it's amazing what
Donald Trump and Roy Moore

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.710
will do on a day to day basis.

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:24.970
I can't believe that.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.550
That is something
we can respond to.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.800
It's sad, becaused we watched
these videos, especially

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.500
as Roy Moore was coming on the
scene, and hearing the things

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:37.290
he talks about-- we are happy
we can find comedy in it.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.872
But we are saddened
by what we are

00:23:39.872 --> 00:23:41.080
seeing with these characters.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.220
So I do think--

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.810
people often ask
us, oh, you must

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:47.000
feel so happy that Donald Trump
and this era feels so crazy.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.330
And it's like, the
comedy comes out

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.670
of feeling frustrated and angry.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:56.400
I wish we didn't have this
clown in office right now who

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.860
is tweeting out Islamophobic
videos day in and day out.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.120
It's like, this is insane.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.600
SPEAKER: Well, for me,
that was a level of disgust

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.219
I reached it.

00:24:07.219 --> 00:24:08.760
I just felt like I
couldn't function.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.134
I was like, why
is he doing this?

00:24:10.134 --> 00:24:11.127
It's just horrible.

00:24:11.127 --> 00:24:11.960
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yes.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.370
SPEAKER: But then you
have to create a show.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:13.940
You see what I mean?

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.500
It's such an
interesting place to be,

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.510
where you have to take that
disgust, that repulsion,

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.500
that anger, and then
convert it into something

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.200
that is highly entertaining.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.200
Your show is great.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:22.790
It's weird.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.331
JORDAN KLEPPER:
What's fun about that

00:24:24.331 --> 00:24:27.320
is, because we play
this character,

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.020
for me, going into this
Trump era, what is fun

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:34.580
is the defensiveness,
how Trump has to defend

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.750
these noxious actions.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:41.230
And I think you can only throw
up your hands so many times.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.507
I'm like, you see what he did?

00:24:42.507 --> 00:24:43.340
You see what he did?

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.769
And so for us, it's
like, we saw what he did.

00:24:45.769 --> 00:24:47.810
Sarah Huckabee Sanders is
going to have to defend

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.250
this in an hour and a half.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.470
Kellyanne Conway is going
to have to twist this.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:54.560
Mitch McConnell is going to
have to find a way in which

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.490
to walk the line.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.967
And for us, that's the
bullshit that we can look at it

00:24:58.967 --> 00:25:00.800
and be like, look at
the way in which people

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.090
are bending over backwards
to support hate speech

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:09.240
or to "not offend"
their core constituents.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.060
It's like we get to
play in that world.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.430
We get to hide and go crazy.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:16.130
And I think the one saving
grace that I have is

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.860
I get to go to work with a bunch
of really smart, funny people,

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.710
and we get to throw up our hands
and then be like, all right

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:22.590
let's talk about it.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.490
Let's find a way to
find some light in it.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.880
SPEAKER: Do you have
any backstage rituals

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.810
before you go on?

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:32.060
Are there certain things
that calm you down?

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.310
JORDAN KLEPPER: Cocaine,
man, just you know.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.580
SPEAKER: Old school.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.580
JORDAN KLEPPER: Old school
comedy though, right?

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.500
SPEAKER: '70s,
'80s style, right?

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.430
Whatever works, man.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.888
JORDAN KLEPPER:
Whatever, you know?

00:25:41.888 --> 00:25:43.790
We are writing right
up until the end,

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:48.830
and so for me, it's
a very stressful day.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.740
It's 8-10 hour days of
putting together the show.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.240
But as soon as that
thing is locked,

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.900
sent to prompter, I go
and meet the guests.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.060
The ritual is the getting
ready for the show.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.670
I do a couple of little
improv things I used to do,

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:05.690
little warm ups just to kind of
get my mind like vocal warm ups

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.360
or physical things to
get my mind remembering

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.040
that I'm not writing
anymore, I'm performing.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.080
And then the crowd and
the energy of a room

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:19.550
awakens you to turn from being
producer to being performer.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:20.720
And then you just go.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.800
SPEAKER: Like with
the MAGAMeal, were

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.530
you saying before that you were
basically writing it 10 minutes

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.092
before you were fine tuning it?

00:26:26.092 --> 00:26:27.800
JORDAN KLEPPER: Well,
what we sort of do,

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.980
it's a race each day.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.530
And we write and rewrite
and throw stuff out

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:38.030
and keep creating, and then
we do a rehearsal usually

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.890
around like 3:30 each day.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.140
And that runs till 4:00-4:30.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.912
And graphics that
we're changing,

00:26:43.912 --> 00:26:45.620
everything is constantly
happening there.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:49.490
But at like 4:00-4:30, we grab
it, and we go into a room,

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.619
a handful of us, and we just
basically rewrite and go line

00:26:52.619 --> 00:26:54.410
the line and change
the stuff that we like,

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.660
add new stuff that's
happened during the day,

00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.460
until about 6:30, when
we give a thumbs up.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.140
And then usually, it's like
we get a 30 minute clock,

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.440
and then we walk out and do it.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:09.260
So it's a sprint
until the performance.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.610
It's a lot of adrenaline.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:11.470
SPEAKER: I bet.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:12.345
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yeah.

00:27:12.345 --> 00:27:14.750
SPEAKER: In the spirit
of the word "sprint,"

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.400
I was told that we
should do something

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.067
known as a lightning round.

00:27:18.067 --> 00:27:19.400
JORDAN KLEPPER: Ooh, Good segue.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.858
SPEAKER: But I got
my-- yeah, nice.

00:27:20.858 --> 00:27:24.379
I worked on that all week.

00:27:24.379 --> 00:27:25.670
JORDAN KLEPPER: Nice, all week?

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:26.400
SPEAKER: Yeah, man.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.608
JORDAN KLEPPER: That's great.

00:27:27.608 --> 00:27:29.529
That paid off.

00:27:29.529 --> 00:27:31.820
SPEAKER: I was waiting for
you to say a word like that,

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.820
and I thought,
I'll just move it.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.806
I'll just go.

00:27:34.806 --> 00:27:36.180
It's actually five
minutes early.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.055
I'm supposed to do the
lightning round later.

00:27:38.055 --> 00:27:40.014
But you said "sprint,"
let's do it now.

00:27:40.014 --> 00:27:41.180
JORDAN KLEPPER: Let's do it.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:42.021
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:27:42.021 --> 00:27:43.770
But I'm going to do
it a little different.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.134
I'm going to do a free
association kind of thing,

00:27:46.134 --> 00:27:48.800
because I feel like we're living
in this world that's absolutely

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.810
populated by super villains.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:55.700
It's amazing the
cast of characters

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.169
that grace our screens.

00:27:58.169 --> 00:27:59.960
So I'm just going to
throw out their names,

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.001
and I want to hear what
you think of each person.

00:28:02.001 --> 00:28:05.450
What comes to mind, free
association, Freudian?

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:06.440
And when I start--

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.398
JORDAN KLEPPER: Freudian,
I'm just going to go,

00:28:08.398 --> 00:28:09.222
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.

00:28:09.222 --> 00:28:10.410
SPEAKER: --just go straight in.

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:11.451
JORDAN KLEPPER: Sex, Dad.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.000
SPEAKER: MAGAMeal.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.530
Gmail

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.160
JORDAN KLEPPER: Indigestion.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.700
SPEAKER: Disheveled
drunk, Steve Bannon.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.400
JORDAN KLEPPER: Pus.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:31.607
Pus, collars, layers, sweat,
ETA a year and a half,

00:28:31.607 --> 00:28:33.440
then he's out of our
life-- fingers crossed.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.350
SPEAKER: You had me at pus.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.850
JORDAN KLEPPER: Oh,
you sound like my wife.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.990
I don't even know
what that means.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:46.970
SPEAKER: Yeah, let's move on.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.380
Joe Arpaio.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.970
JORDAN KLEPPER: Oh,
disaster, disaster.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:56.025
I was down there at
one of the rallies

00:28:56.025 --> 00:28:59.380
where Trump was talking
about pardoning Joe Arpaio.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.990
And I think that was just a
disaster, partisan disaster,

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:04.580
let's say that.

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.350
SPEAKER: Mike Pence.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.717
JORDAN KLEPPER: Hair.

00:29:07.717 --> 00:29:08.300
SPEAKER: Hair?

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.091
JORDAN KLEPPER: Hair,
just a little helmet,

00:29:10.091 --> 00:29:12.800
he just has a perfectly
coiffed helmet.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.500
SPEAKER: What's
underneath the hair?

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.700
JORDAN KLEPPER: A
hatred of homosexuals,

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.760
I think, at least the
last time I heard.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.394
I think it's just a body of
Christianity as a shield.

00:29:22.394 --> 00:29:24.310
That's what I think he's
got underneath there.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.496
Pus, let's say pus.

00:29:29.496 --> 00:29:31.550
SPEAKER: No, you
finally get pus once.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:32.260
JORDAN KLEPPER: I
only get one pus?

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.426
Oh, I didn't know the rules.

00:29:33.426 --> 00:29:35.550
SPEAKER: You can't keep--

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:37.580
Bernie Sanders.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:41.000
JORDAN KLEPPER: 2020.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.089
SPEAKER: Is that a hope?

00:29:42.089 --> 00:29:43.380
JORDAN KLEPPER: That is a hope.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:43.963
You know what?

00:29:43.963 --> 00:29:44.912
I will say this.

00:29:44.912 --> 00:29:46.620
I was not necessarily
on the Bernie train

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.550
this last election.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.580
But I look back to that,
and I am regretful.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.330
I think there was a lack
of media coverage of him.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.980
That I will say as
somebody who was

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.930
watching a lot of that stuff.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:01.080
That definitely affected my
perspective of his chances,

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.980
of how real his support was.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:09.600
And in one traditional way,
I think I looked at the race

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.230
for president.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:11.938
I think looking back
at that, I was like,

00:30:11.938 --> 00:30:14.220
oh, I think there was a real
opportunity there that I

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.010
definitely felt like I missed
giving him more of a chance

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:18.647
than I probably should have.

00:30:18.647 --> 00:30:20.730
I think it'd be really
interested if he ran again.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:21.218
I don't know if it will happen.

00:30:21.218 --> 00:30:22.800
SPEAKER: Did you
think he couldn't win?

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.716
JORDAN KLEPPER: I did.

00:30:23.716 --> 00:30:27.730
I think I knew a little
bit about Bernie Sanders

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:31.030
when he came out and when he
was introduced to the people so

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.029
early in that election cycle.

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:34.570
I think the tenor
of the conversation

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:38.240
was like, he's a socialist,
a joke candidate.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.460
SPEAKER: It'll never happen.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:40.020
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yeah.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.100
And in the same way everybody
talked about Donald Trump,

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.380
in a way that was like, these
are the joke candidates.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.249
It's Jeb.

00:30:45.249 --> 00:30:45.790
It's Hillary.

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:46.990
Let's focus on that.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.715
And I think, from
my understanding,

00:30:48.715 --> 00:30:51.340
the elections I had been through
and the people I talked to, it

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.360
was like, oh, that's--

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.266
guys, have fun with the fringe.

00:30:54.266 --> 00:30:56.140
But it's these two
people, let's focus on it.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.470
And so that's the way
the media covered it,

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:00.949
and it was always Hillary.

00:31:00.949 --> 00:31:02.990
But Trump was so enticing
that it was so Hillary,

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:05.710
it was so Trump, but
it's probably Jeb.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.722
And then I think
seeing that turn out,

00:31:07.722 --> 00:31:09.430
going to some of those
rallies and seeing

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:10.888
how excited people
for Bernie were,

00:31:10.888 --> 00:31:12.120
it was shifting in my head.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.953
But I was like, I think
the narrative really

00:31:13.953 --> 00:31:16.180
was this is not how
modern politics works.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.340
A guy like Bernie Sanders
won't become president,

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.940
and I think we thought that
times 10 for Donald Trump.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.830
And looking back,
I was like, yeah,

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.945
I think there was
missed perspective

00:31:25.945 --> 00:31:27.070
from the media's landscape.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:30.040
And I think I was
a victim of that.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.590
SPEAKER: I actually was
on the road the last week

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:36.100
of the election because I did
a cover story for "Esquire,"

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.022
about Pharrell Williams.

00:31:38.022 --> 00:31:39.480
And he was campaigning
for Hillary,

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.700
and there was an event in
North Carolina with Hillary

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.470
and Bernie and Pharrell.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.530
And I was talking to one of
Hillary's advisors there,

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:52.690
and I was like, you
have to win this.

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.480
Do I say, please, please?

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.270
I'm not taking sides,
but nevertheless.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.520
JORDAN KLEPPER: Feels like it.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.645
SPEAKER: You know, come on.

00:31:59.645 --> 00:32:01.140
He was like, oh, we got this.

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.230
Don't worry.

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.120
I'm kind of haunted by this.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.644
There was this
incredible overconfidence

00:32:06.644 --> 00:32:08.810
that I think maybe was
rooted in exactly what you're

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:11.547
referring to, all the
paradigms from the past.

00:32:11.547 --> 00:32:12.630
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yes, yeah.

00:32:14.605 --> 00:32:16.480
I would say that with
Trump, people are like,

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.430
are you so surprised with Trump?

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:19.030
It was like, I went to rallies.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.670
I saw up close the fervor
and the excitement people

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:23.360
had for Donald Trump.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.420
But what you can't get
even going to those

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.150
is that 36,000 foot view.

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:30.400
I didn't have the perspective.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.780
The media kept telling me,
yeah, this won't catch on.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.530
I was like, people
are way into Trump.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:37.840
There's a lot of
support, these rallies.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.710
It feels legitimate.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:43.280
But everybody is running
it through these--

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.474
this is how elections work.

00:32:44.474 --> 00:32:45.640
This isn't going to pay off.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.010
Oh, I think things
are different now.

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.830
And I do think
social media, I think

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.837
Facebook feeds the way
in which we get our news,

00:32:52.837 --> 00:32:54.670
the way in which we
interact with the world.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:56.440
It's like, we're not
just looking at-- no,

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.540
we're not all just
watching NBC telling us how

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.050
this election is playing out.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:04.570
We don't know one place to
look, and it's so disparate,

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:06.200
it's hard to get
that perspective.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.200
And I think going into
these next few elections,

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.680
we just don't know how
they're going turn out.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:15.480
SPEAKER: A couple more
names, Ivanka Trump.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.740
JORDAN KLEPPER:
Oh, disappointment.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.740
SPEAKER: Disappointment?

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:19.700
JORDAN KLEPPER: Disappointment.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.116
I didn't have a
huge hope for her,

00:33:21.116 --> 00:33:23.924
but I think the way in which
she talks about women's rights

00:33:23.924 --> 00:33:25.340
and things of that
nature, I think

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.250
she holds a place where she
can challenge her father.

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:31.830
I think she has in some
places with Roy Moore

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:32.580
and what have you.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.976
But I'd like to see her use
that platform a little bit.

00:33:35.976 --> 00:33:38.350
It feels like Donald Trumps
only trusts about two people,

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:39.680
and I think she's one of them.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.270
SPEAKER: But she spoke
against Roy Moore.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.270
JORDAN KLEPPER: She did.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.180
SPEAKER: And Trump, therefore,
supported Roy Moore.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.515
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yes, yes.

00:33:48.515 --> 00:33:49.850
SPEAKER: Did I read that right?

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.280
JORDAN KLEPPER: Well,
I think you did.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.220
I wonder what went
on behind the scenes

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.420
with that kind of a thing.

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.003
I think it was also
really interesting

00:33:58.003 --> 00:34:01.190
that Bannon came out and he
mocked Ivanka and the language

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.120
she used for going at Roy Moore
or going at the idea of people

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.470
who prey on children.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:09.769
I think it was a lightly
veiled comment that she made.

00:34:09.769 --> 00:34:10.310
I don't know.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.351
In the end, Donald Trump
only listens to himself,

00:34:12.351 --> 00:34:14.420
and I think it's
unfair to say, she

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.260
should be able to
control her dad.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.424
But I don't think she should.

00:34:18.424 --> 00:34:19.340
I don't think she can.

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.993
But I do think she
has his ear, and I

00:34:20.993 --> 00:34:22.909
wish she would talk a
little louder sometimes.

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:24.139
SPEAKER: Mitch McConnell.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:25.719
JORDAN KLEPPER: Oh, spineless.

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:26.860
SPEAKER: Right?

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.414
JORDAN KLEPPER: Spineless.

00:34:28.414 --> 00:34:30.080
SPEAKER: Do you ever
have folks ask you,

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.650
of all the super-villains, which
one do you loathe the most?

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:37.070
JORDAN KLEPPER: I mean, I'm
having that happen right now.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.653
SPEAKER: But I'm
asking the crowd too,

00:34:38.653 --> 00:34:40.900
because I'm just saying,
personally, for me,

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.852
just really McConnell
really gets to me.

00:34:42.852 --> 00:34:44.310
JORDAN KLEPPER:
What is it for you?

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.434
SPEAKER: Because he could--

00:34:45.434 --> 00:34:47.989
McConnell, because he
could stop all this.

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:53.959
He could stand up for
civility and reason and unity,

00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:54.500
and he's not.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:59.894
He's actually the stonewall
that allows all this to occur.

00:34:59.894 --> 00:35:00.560
You know I mean?

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.850
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yes.

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.350
There's some great
quote that I will

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:07.640
butcher about the idea of
the thing-- what is it?

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.860
Bad shit happens when good
people don't stand up.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.420
SPEAKER: Yeah,
something like that.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.020
JORDAN KLEPPER: Gandhi said it.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:15.686
SPEAKER: Gandhi.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.949
Two white guys trying
to figure it out.

00:35:21.949 --> 00:35:23.615
JORDAN KLEPPER: What
was it Gandhi said?

00:35:23.615 --> 00:35:25.460
And I'm sure it wasn't even--

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.080
But I do think that's--

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.170
there are reprehensible
things that Donald Trump

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.780
says and does.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.260
We talk about the video that
he tweeted out, for example.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.600
And I think there's
something about him that

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.090
is so infuriating,
and I think it's

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:40.620
just because he's so populist,
and he so needs to be loved.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.120
I don't know if it's--

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.710
I don't think he
less an evil guy.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.570
I think he's a guy
that just wants

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:48.227
to be loved so much that he
would go to such evil places.

00:35:48.227 --> 00:35:49.310
SPEAKER: It's a pathology.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:50.870
JORDAN KLEPPER:
Yeah, and I think

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:52.330
what you're talking about with
McConnell and all of these guys

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:54.660
is there is another
layer right there.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:58.100
It's the layer that shakes
what I believed and loved

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:58.892
about this country.

00:35:58.892 --> 00:36:00.683
I think it's still
there, but it scares me.

00:36:00.683 --> 00:36:02.330
Because it's like
stuff is shaking away

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:03.320
that we're like, oh, my god.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.060
Like stuff that's happening
in North Korea, some

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.090
of these things that he's
saying about women, some

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:09.330
of these things that are going
on with this Islamophobia

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:10.788
and stuff, it's
like, we're getting

00:36:10.788 --> 00:36:12.640
into dangerous
territory right here.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.650
If he fires Mueller,
we are discrediting

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:18.470
the FBI, the branch
of the justice system

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:21.230
that's supposed to
protect us, that's

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.870
supposed to be separate
from the presidency.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:27.091
The thing that will stop a crazy
man who just wants to be liked

00:36:27.091 --> 00:36:28.590
and doesn't want
to be made look bad

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:30.890
is other people in
positions of power

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.470
who can put aside
partisan bullshit

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:36.200
and stand up for the
betterment of this country

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.804
that they claim to love
so dearly that they keep

00:36:38.804 --> 00:36:40.970
a Constitution their pocket
to prove to other people

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:41.870
that they love it.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:43.850
And I think you see
people like McConnell

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:48.590
and people that level
just kowtowing to winning.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:50.800
And I think this American
culture of winning

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.990
is frightening, because
that's the ultimate ideology.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:57.170
And it's like, screw
you, Mitch McConnell.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:58.520
Support what is right.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.850
Protect this union and this
thing that you promised to do,

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:05.060
and don't protect the idea of
winning in your next election

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.880
or getting sponsors and money
so that you can move forward.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.230
I think that's the thing that to
me that is so frightening right

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.905
now.

00:37:12.905 --> 00:37:14.840
SPEAKER: Yeah, although the
winning feels pretty nice.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.280
JORDAN KLEPPER: I like winning.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:15.780
Trust me.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.132
SPEAKER: With Doug Jones?

00:37:18.132 --> 00:37:19.340
Did you like that transition?

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.510
JORDAN KLEPPER: That was good.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.677
Were you just waiting like,
he's got to say winning?

00:37:22.677 --> 00:37:23.635
I was thinking winning.

00:37:23.635 --> 00:37:24.950
I'll just move right into that.

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:25.560
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yeah.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.080
SPEAKER: Yeah, language is fun.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.490
found there was this
fizzy sense of, at least

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:38.969
on the social media, excitement
with Doug Jones that night.

00:37:38.969 --> 00:37:40.510
And then you wake
up, and you realize

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:43.572
that they stole the internet
while you weren't looking.

00:37:43.572 --> 00:37:44.530
JORDAN KLEPPER: Whoops.

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:45.613
SPEAKER: Sorry about that.

00:37:45.613 --> 00:37:46.587
Can Google stop that?

00:37:46.587 --> 00:37:47.920
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yeah, could you?

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.612
Yeah, no?

00:37:48.612 --> 00:37:49.820
SPEAKER: You guys are Google.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.111
JORDAN KLEPPER: Can you
please, net neutrality, can we?

00:37:52.111 --> 00:37:52.900
It is, right?

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.070
Everything moves
so quick with that.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:55.480
It was a day later,
it was like, oh,

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.230
this other thing we
weren't talking about.

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.438
SPEAKER: Hey, you having fun?

00:37:57.438 --> 00:37:58.778
We just took the internet.

00:37:58.778 --> 00:37:59.736
JORDAN KLEPPER: Dammit.

00:37:59.736 --> 00:38:00.486
SPEAKER: Ah, shit.

00:38:00.486 --> 00:38:03.460
JORDAN KLEPPER: We felt so
good that only nearly half

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:06.547
of Alabama still
voted for Roy Moore.

00:38:06.547 --> 00:38:07.630
That's what's still crazy.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:08.470
SPEAKER: Yeah, a lot of people.

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:10.435
JORDAN KLEPPER: A lot
of people still did.

00:38:10.435 --> 00:38:12.310
SPEAKER: OK, we're going
to do some questions

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:17.307
from the much smarter
folks, who are you.

00:38:17.307 --> 00:38:18.640
So there are microphones around.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.280
Just go on up and jump in.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.240
Hi-- oh, Rob.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.200
AUDIENCE: One of the Robs.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.684
SPEAKER: How many
Robs are there?

00:38:31.684 --> 00:38:32.350
Is that a thing?

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:34.370
It's like if your name
is Rob-- well, anyway,

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.515
the questions are for Jordan.

00:38:36.515 --> 00:38:39.390
AUDIENCE: The question is,
with political news shows,

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:43.260
I wonder is the goal
to create comedy

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:47.100
from news or a political
impact with comedy,

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.230
and how do you balance
the two of those?

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:52.620
JORDAN KLEPPER:
I think, for us--

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.260
I am a comedian.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.059
I am somebody who--

00:38:56.059 --> 00:38:58.350
I think people when people
often ask, they're like, oh,

00:38:58.350 --> 00:38:59.070
are you a journalist?

00:38:59.070 --> 00:38:59.730
Are you, what have you?

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:01.560
I think it's very clear with
these shows I'm a comedian.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.270
I didn't go to
journalism school.

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:04.335
I took improv classes.

00:39:07.555 --> 00:39:09.930
But that doesn't mean I don't
take my job very seriously,

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:11.737
and the people we
hire are comedians.

00:39:11.737 --> 00:39:12.570
We hire journalists.

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:13.980
We hire researchers.

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:17.730
The things that we put
out, we hold in high regard

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.140
and want to get it right.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.660
But I think it's very clear
that we are editorializing

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.590
on the news there.

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:24.048
And I think the
way in which we can

00:39:24.048 --> 00:39:27.279
do that is through
the prism of comedy.

00:39:27.279 --> 00:39:29.070
And I think we try to
stay in that lane of,

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:30.552
let's show up in the morning.

00:39:30.552 --> 00:39:32.010
What we can do is
talk about what's

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:34.210
happening in the news that day.

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:36.004
They're a bunch of
smart, thoughtful people

00:39:36.004 --> 00:39:37.420
who have different
points of view,

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.919
but let's get to the thing that
we are most frustrated about

00:39:39.919 --> 00:39:41.940
or care most about that day.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:45.900
And what we can do best is
try to find comedy and speak

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.790
to that thing.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:50.550
And so if we stay
that line, then

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:52.500
hopefully we can
get the end product

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.512
that we are ideally aiming for.

00:39:56.512 --> 00:39:58.220
AUDIENCE: Hey, growing
up in the Midwest,

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.055
I definitely know my fair
share of Trump supporters.

00:40:00.055 --> 00:40:01.804
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yeah,
where'd you grow up?

00:40:01.804 --> 00:40:02.971
AUDIENCE: Ohio and Michigan.

00:40:02.971 --> 00:40:05.012
When you were talking
about hunting towns outside

00:40:05.012 --> 00:40:07.370
of Kalamazoo, I literally
have been there many times.

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:08.704
I understand.

00:40:08.704 --> 00:40:11.120
I'm just wondering based on
the number of Trump supporters

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.370
you've spoken to if
their minds haven't

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:14.862
changed in the last year.

00:40:14.862 --> 00:40:16.820
Do you think that they're
ever going to change?

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.580
Do you think it's actually worth
even fighting that anymore,

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:23.930
or is that just a
battle that is over?

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:29.030
JORDAN KLEPPER: I do think the
idea of fighting for people--

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.280
you need to change your mind--

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.250
I think there are 30% of
people who the narrative is,

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.094
this is my guy, and
I'm going to fight

00:40:35.094 --> 00:40:36.260
for this guy no matter what.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:41.200
And I think that is
100% going to continue

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.020
and will continue into the next
election and what have you.

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.520
I do think there
are a lot of people

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.010
who are Trump supporters who
have their guard up but are

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:50.930
open to having a dialogue.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:52.420
And I think it is for people--

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.300
I think as we have that
dialogue, like what

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.140
we talked a little
bit about earlier,

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.450
it might be less about
Trump than we think, people

00:40:58.450 --> 00:40:59.110
on the left.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.519
We get so obsessed and so
Trump focused about all

00:41:01.519 --> 00:41:02.810
the little things that he does.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.615
It's like, look at
this giant conspiracy

00:41:05.615 --> 00:41:07.740
board of a million things
I've already seen him do.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.430
Isn't this all the proof?

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:11.050
Again, it might be about change.

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:13.850
It might be just about somebody
who feels like a winner.

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:16.510
And I think
sometimes engaging in

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:20.004
that conversation might
be a way in which to see

00:41:20.004 --> 00:41:21.170
if there is a middle ground.

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:24.160
But hopefully the people on
the left, hopefully Democrats,

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.810
can offer, and I
think they will be

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:30.130
able to offer in the next
election, that idea of change.

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:31.870
Because I think in
a couple of years,

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:33.456
that's what America
is going to want.

00:41:33.456 --> 00:41:35.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks.

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:37.750
AUDIENCE: Hey, Jordan.

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.420
Firstly, congratulations on
your new, "The Opposition."

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:41.020
JORDAN KLEPPER: Thank you.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.650
AUDIENCE: When I got to know you
were leaving "The Daily Show,"

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:43.691
I was kind of distraught.

00:41:43.691 --> 00:41:45.805
You were my favorite
correspondent on the show.

00:41:45.805 --> 00:41:46.600
JORDAN KLEPPER: Oh, thank you.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.433
I'll let Hasan know.

00:41:51.459 --> 00:41:53.500
AUDIENCE: You used to do
one of my favorite bits,

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.240
and it was called
"Fingers the Pulse."

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.130
And you used to go
to Trump rallies

00:41:57.130 --> 00:42:01.390
and question the voters
there and their supporters.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:03.220
So I wanted to know.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.550
There's been a lot of videos
online about you asking them

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:09.217
questions and them coming up
with ridiculous responses.

00:42:09.217 --> 00:42:10.300
How do you deal with that?

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.070
And what was your
experience in the rallies?

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:13.903
Did they know you were
from "The Daily Show"

00:42:13.903 --> 00:42:18.010
and you were presenting
the satiric angle to this?

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:20.710
And were they angry at you?

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:21.874
How do you deal with this?

00:42:21.874 --> 00:42:24.040
JORDAN KLEPPER: So I went
to a lot of Trump rallies.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.950
I actually just went
to one last week

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.760
to get a feel for how things
had changed and what have you.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.260
I think we're very open
about who we are there.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:34.990
Not a lot of people necessarily
know who we are there,

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:36.520
but we say, look, we want
to talk to you about what's

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.830
going on and what have you.

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:43.540
And I think I go into that, as
like in improv world, like I'm

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.660
"yes, and-ing" the ideas
that are already there.

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:48.580
And I think it's
like, you think this.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:51.040
Tell me more about this, and
let's hear more about this

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:51.790
and what have you.

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:53.441
And I think you
see a lot of people

00:42:53.441 --> 00:42:55.690
who are at those rallies who
are distrustful of media,

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:57.439
but a lot of people,
with "The Daily Show"

00:42:57.439 --> 00:42:59.920
and with "The Opposition,"
they want their voices heard.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.740
And so they're eager to
talk about that on camera.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.480
And so we try to
find those people who

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.930
are eager to talk about Donald
Trump, about what they think

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:11.560
about what's going on,
and we start chatting.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:15.520
It doesn't necessarily
get contentious.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.587
Sometimes people around here
are so anti-media that they're

00:43:18.587 --> 00:43:19.420
following us around.

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:20.440
They're yelling "fake news."

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.190
And they're right.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:24.400
We are fake news.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.534
SPEAKER: You're a fake
guy delivering fake news.

00:43:26.534 --> 00:43:27.992
JORDAN KLEPPER:
Don't talk to them.

00:43:27.992 --> 00:43:28.900
They're fake news.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.010
Yeah, that guy gets it.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:31.180
He does get it.

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.630
I will say a funny detail
that we got our last rally

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:38.974
right before the election.

00:43:38.974 --> 00:43:40.390
We were getting
followed by people

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:44.100
who were claiming that we
worked for Hillary and the FBI

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.567
and were Googling the initials
on the back of our battery

00:43:47.567 --> 00:43:49.900
pack, which was just the
initials of the rental company,

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.400
because they were certain we
were working for the government

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.610
and trying to spy on
everybody, covertly,

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:57.217
with a camera crew and mics.

00:43:57.217 --> 00:43:58.300
So they'll get you anyway.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.508
SPEAKER: That's the downside.

00:43:59.508 --> 00:44:01.330
I'm undercover as a comedian.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:04.510
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yes, with
two cameras and a producer.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:05.760
Yeah, you never saw us coming.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.354
SPEAKER: Shh, don't tell anyone.

00:44:07.354 --> 00:44:08.770
AUDIENCE: Jordan,
did you ever try

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.810
to reason with them once
the cameras went off?

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:13.450
Did the real Jordan
come out and try

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.180
to reason with them
about their thinking?

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.670
JORDAN KLEPPER:
Yeah, I think I try

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:21.700
to engage in conversation
in this character,

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.760
but a lot of times,
I come out within.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.380
And I think this
character that I play,

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:30.010
I think Jordan Klepper is
in there a lot as well.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:32.260
I think it's a hybrid of
you see this character,

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:35.530
but hopefully you also
see me underneath there.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:38.200
It was really frustrating over
the course of the election

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:38.980
to go to those.

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.150
And by the end,
it was pretty raw,

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:42.040
and there wasn't a lot
of veneer between how

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:46.120
I felt on what was going
on, because it was angry.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.210
I was tired of hearing how
much they hated Hillary Clinton

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.330
and what they wanted to
do to Hillary Clinton.

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:54.580
And I don't to paint the
brush that that was everybody

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:58.720
at those rallies, but there was
just such fear and anger there

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.250
that it would come out.

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:02.890
And I'd be like, I think
you're spewing hate,

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.600
and you're just
echoing something

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.290
that's happening in there.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:09.310
SPEAKER: And they're
like, that's not funny.

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:10.810
JORDAN KLEPPER:
Wait, wait, come on.

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.190
Let me just talk here.

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:16.570
But again, the great normalizer
was inside that arena.

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:20.200
And so I can talk
and argue with them

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.870
about these things and
about the media being biased

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:26.381
or about Hillary Clinton having
murdered these certain people

00:45:26.381 --> 00:45:28.380
and how she should be in
jail and what have you,

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.510
and how Obama is an
American citizen,

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:33.699
but I'm just a
guy with a camera.

00:45:33.699 --> 00:45:36.240
They walk in there, and the most
powerful person in the world

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.320
is normalizing that.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.184
And so I think that's who is
controlling that conversation

00:45:40.184 --> 00:45:42.350
and is still controlling
that conversation, I think.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:44.142
And that's what I kept
running up against.

00:45:44.142 --> 00:45:46.100
AUDIENCE: Thank you, and
good luck on the show.

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:47.183
JORDAN KLEPPER: Thank you.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:50.850
AUDIENCE: Hi, I also
grew up in Michigan,

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:52.122
in Brooklyn, Michigan.

00:45:52.122 --> 00:45:53.705
JORDAN KLEPPER: In
Brooklyn, Michigan?

00:45:53.705 --> 00:45:55.880
Where's Brooklyn?

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:56.380
Right

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.360
AUDIENCE: About here.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.890
JORDAN KLEPPER: Right in
the middle right there?

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.270
AUDIENCE: There's
a big NASCAR track.

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:01.478
JORDAN KLEPPER: Oh, is there?

00:46:01.478 --> 00:46:02.560
There you go.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.210
That's only about 40
cities in Michigan.

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:07.930
SPEAKER: You're going to
have to be more specific.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:09.760
AUDIENCE: In any
case, as such, I

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:14.870
have a lot of aunts
and uncles and my dad

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:16.930
and my brother who
voted for Trump.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:17.680
And I was curious.

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.070
How do you--

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:22.810
I see them posting things
on social media that's

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:24.790
becoming increasingly
detached from reality,

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:27.790
and they start to trust
institutions less and less.

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:28.870
I was curious.

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:32.700
How do you think it's
possible for people

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:36.990
to help others get their
faith in institutions restored

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:39.900
or increase that or point
them to better stories

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:43.830
without causing just insane
arguments or something

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:44.440
like that?

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:49.200
And also, do you see your show
as an evolution of "The Colbert

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.620
Report" and the time that
that existed with Fox News?

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.235
And now, you're focusing on
what's now the fringe of today?

00:46:56.235 --> 00:46:57.360
JORDAN KLEPPER: I think so.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.700
I think in regards
to interacting

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.310
with family members who feel
like they are getting news

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:04.560
elsewhere, I think
it's a tricky place.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.062
I don't know if I have the
answer or the suggestion.

00:47:07.062 --> 00:47:08.520
It's hard when
we're talking about,

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.137
how do we change people's minds?

00:47:10.137 --> 00:47:11.970
It's not one of the
most effective attitudes

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:12.895
to go into things.

00:47:12.895 --> 00:47:14.520
I want to make them
think what I think.

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:17.070
I think that is a prevailing
attitude that everybody

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.320
has right now, and
that's some of the issues

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.180
that we're having.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:23.160
And online, it's just a way
in which we can swirl that up.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.520
I do think it's old
school, but sitting down

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.040
conversations with
those people talking

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:32.820
about those things, where you're
coming from and what have you,

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.870
is a way to move things
a little bit forward.

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:36.630
Empathizing with
where they come from

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:39.810
can get you a step
or two closer.

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:42.990
But again, I think we are in
this culture where we seek out

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:45.330
what we want to see and
hear, and I think that that

00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:47.580
is difficult. So maybe get
in the way of that seeking,

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.760
and maybe you can get
a little bit farther.

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:54.630
As far as how we saw our
show, "The Colbert Report"

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:57.490
was such an incredible show,
and I was such a fan of it.

00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:00.990
I think what Stephen
showed is that you

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:02.970
can sustain a character
day in and day

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:06.570
out and filter a show every
day through a different

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:09.284
perspective, through totally
a satirical perspective

00:48:09.284 --> 00:48:10.450
and a character perspective.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.366
And so I think when we
were creating the show,

00:48:12.366 --> 00:48:16.200
we were like, let's try to
focus on what seems to be 2017.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.100
Let's look at this fringe.

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.940
It's less American
flag ideology,

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.790
and it's more like
anti-everything ideology.

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:25.586
It's more winning
as an ideology.

00:48:25.586 --> 00:48:27.210
And so I think that's
what we're trying

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:30.324
to build our show around.

00:48:30.324 --> 00:48:32.490
AUDIENCE: What or who has
surprised you while you're

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:34.000
making "The Opposition?"

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.270
JORDAN KLEPPER: What or
who has surprised me?

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:38.100
What or who has surprised me?

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:42.150
I will say Roy Moore
has 100% surprised me,

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:46.080
that he could get so far.

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.830
He lost by 0.8%.

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:54.660
And I think it does show--

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.270
the fact that Alabama
turned is an accomplishment,

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:58.980
and you are seeing a shift.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:04.560
But I think he ripped
away so much bullshit

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.040
around faux
Christianity in a way

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.400
that I think was really
interesting to see, this idea.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:14.250
We talk about this era,
the era 10 years ago,

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:17.010
the Christian right, this idea
like we want a moral leader.

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:17.730
We want somebody.

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:18.904
It's about what is inside.

00:49:18.904 --> 00:49:20.820
It's not about partisanship
and what have you.

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:21.528
And you saw that.

00:49:21.528 --> 00:49:23.270
It was like all
of that fell away,

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:27.000
and it was just about abortion,
or it was just about winning.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.110
It was just about your
team getting ahead,

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:33.690
and I think I was pretty
shocked at how blatant

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:36.670
that became with this Roy Moore.

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:38.940
Literally, we were
talking to people.

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.144
We did interviews with it.

00:49:40.144 --> 00:49:41.560
You've seen it all
over the place.

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.350
But the interviews
with supporters

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:45.720
were like, what do you
think about the allegations?

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.360
Yeah, I know,
potential pedophile.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:51.030
But I just don't want
a Democrat in office.

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:52.350
People kept saying that.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:53.130
It's like, well--

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:55.110
SPEAKER: I noticed
one episode of yours

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:57.930
that they were saying the
more that the mainstream

00:49:57.930 --> 00:50:00.240
media covered that,
the more inclined

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.680
they were to vote toward Moore.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:05.080
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yes,
they need an enemy.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.350
And I think that's so powerful.

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:10.369
Oh, we're not angry
at pedophilia.

00:50:10.369 --> 00:50:12.660
We're angry at the "Washington
Post" for coming in here

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.730
and poking around.

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:17.769
And that, to me, is
inanity, like insanity.

00:50:17.769 --> 00:50:18.810
Are those the same thing?

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:20.200
I don't quite know.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.030
Maybe kind of.

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.840
SPEAKER: What was
the first word?

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.270
JORDAN KLEPPER: Inanity,
like to be inane.

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.311
SPEAKER: Oh, inane, yeah.

00:50:24.311 --> 00:50:26.680
JORDAN KLEPPER: To be inane,
it kind of worked there.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.620
But I think I was--

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:28.620
SPEAKER: Inane in the membrane.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:29.500
JORDAN KLEPPER: Yeah.

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:30.180
Is that a segue?

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.780
Are we going into a
Cypress Hill segment?

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.380
SPEAKER: Yeah, see?

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:36.540
Now we're just going to--

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.850
OK, one more I think
we got time for.

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:39.610
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:41.250
I know "The
Opposition" is young,

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:42.840
but have there been
any segments that

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:46.200
have been just so absurd
where you just got

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.850
close or just an
idea that you just

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:51.540
cut off early that was just
too crazy to put on the air?

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:54.690
JORDAN KLEPPER: Too
crazy to put on the air--

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:57.075
what have we done that
has been too crazy?

00:50:57.075 --> 00:50:59.010
I'm trying to think right now.

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:01.200
We've tried to let
some crazy live.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.480
I think that's the freedom
of it being a young show.

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:06.990
It's like, it's a dumb
idea to eat a bunch of food

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:10.650
while talking about Jerusalem.

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:16.110
But you're like, all right,
let's give that a shot.

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:19.319
And a lot of them
do have to do with--

00:51:19.319 --> 00:51:20.610
it isn't even production stuff.

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:21.318
I can't remember.

00:51:21.318 --> 00:51:23.910
Let's dunk Jordan in a
giant thing of water,

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:28.220
or we've had some ideas of
like, let's do an entire show--

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.060
I think one idea
which I like and we're

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:33.310
pushing for weird stuff.

00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:36.810
When this Uranium
One deal went out--

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:41.730
"deal," like when it became the
counter argument with Hannity

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:44.724
and the fringe that we
shouldn't be talking about Trump

00:51:44.724 --> 00:51:46.890
investigations, we should
talk about Hillary Clinton

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:49.431
and her connection to Uranium
One, Hillary, Hillary, Hillary,

00:51:49.431 --> 00:51:50.340
Hillary, Hillary.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:53.310
We worked on an act where it was
just me saying the word Hillary

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:54.510
for eight straight minutes.

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:00.814
And we worked through
it a little bit.

00:52:00.814 --> 00:52:02.230
SPEAKER: That's
some Andy Kaufman.

00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:03.170
JORDAN KLEPPER: It
was a little bit.

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:05.390
That's where it was
like, I love that idea.

00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:08.360
And in the end, we
pulled the plug on it.

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.450
We used a portion of it
where I ranted in that way.

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:14.580
Partially because
it was like, I don't

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:17.130
know if we've introduced
our show enough

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:20.700
where people get
what we're doing yet,

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:23.520
but maybe partially because I
was just afraid to just fill

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.495
eight minutes with Hillary.

00:52:25.495 --> 00:52:27.120
But I'm hoping we
can get to that place

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.030
where I grow the balls enough to
make that choice in the future.

00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:30.840
SPEAKER: There's still time.

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:32.298
JORDAN KLEPPER:
There's still time.

00:52:32.298 --> 00:52:34.170
SPEAKER: We got a
sneak preview of that.

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:35.405
I'm looking forward to it.

00:52:35.405 --> 00:52:36.030
JORDAN KLEPPER:
Wait, what are you

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:37.665
referencing, me growing balls?

00:52:37.665 --> 00:52:39.060
Is that what you're--

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:40.485
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:52:40.485 --> 00:52:43.495
Anyway, no, the Hillary,
Hillary, that would be amazing.

00:52:43.495 --> 00:52:44.370
I'd love to see that.

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:45.600
That actually sounds great.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.870
JORDAN KLEPPER: I think that
story will come up again.

00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:50.820
SPEAKER: Yeah, well, that's
all they're fixated on.

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:51.600
It's bizarre.

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.654
JORDAN KLEPPER: She's
still a big, big enemy.

00:52:53.654 --> 00:52:55.570
SPEAKER: Well, they'll
impeach her eventually.

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:56.986
JORDAN KLEPPER: I
think they will.

00:52:56.986 --> 00:52:58.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.670
SPEAKER: Thanks for being here.

00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:02.697
That's it, I believe,
right, for now?

00:53:02.697 --> 00:53:04.030
JORDAN KLEPPER: Guys, thank you.

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:06.780
[APPLAUSE]
