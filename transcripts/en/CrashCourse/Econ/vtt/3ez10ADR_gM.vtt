Mr. Clifford: Hi, I'm Jacob Clifford and I'm
the host of Crash Course economics. Stan!
Adriene: Hi, I'm Adriene Hill and I'm the
host of Crash Course economics. Stan!

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.620
Stan: You're a team! You're co-hosts.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.800
Adriene: All right, awesome.
Mr. Clifford: Yeah, whooo!

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.960
Adriene: Well anyways, we're making our Crash
Course Economics series at the YouTube space

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.180
in lovely Los Angeles California because Mr.
Clifford and I are both from Southern California.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.760
Mr. Clifford: Yeah.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.759
Statler: Who are these no-names!?

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.999
Waldorf: Where are the Green brothers? If
there aren't any Greens, I'm unsubscribing.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.800
Statler: Wh-- how can you unsubscribe? What
is this, some kind of a moving newspaper?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.179
Mr. Clifford: Did we just get heckled by the
muppets?

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:30.060
Adriene: It sounds like it.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.629
Kermit: Hey guys, hey guys listen, don't feel
bad about not being green, OK?

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:34.570
Adriene: It's Kermit!

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.840
Mr. Clifford: That's crazy!

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.309
Kermit: Hi guys, uh listen, being green is
great and everything but being Adriene and

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.629
Mr. Clifford well, that's great, too! In fact,
you know guys, it's not easy being green.

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.329
I think I could sing a song about that.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.149
Adriene: Can I sing with you?
Kermit: Oh course, yeah.
Adriene: This is a dream. This is a dream.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.580
Mr. Clifford: No, no, no, we can't afford the licensing
agreement for that song guys, economics. Sorry.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.100
Kermit: Oh. Oh. Well, in that case, why don't
you guys just introduce yourselves?

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.820
Mr. Clifford: OK. I'm Mr. Clifford, and I'm
a high school economics teacher and YouTuber,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.560
and I'm going to focus on teaching you the theories
and graphs of economics. You know, the textbook stuff.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.560
Adriene: And I'm Adriene Hill; I'm a senior
reporter for the public radio show Marketplace,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.520
and I'm gonna focus on showing you the real
world applications of economics. You know,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.640
the good stuff. The really fun stuff.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.580
Mr. Clifford: Hey! We're both fun! We're definitely
not gonna teach economics like this:

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.840
Prof. Bunsen Honeydew: Welcome to CrashCourse
Economics (Beaker yawns) I am thrilled to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.130
be teaching you this fascinating subject.
(Beaker moans)

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.340
Mr. Clifford: I'm sorry Professor Honeydew, but that's
why people hate economics in high school and college.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.040
Adriene: Anyway, Statler and Waldorf have
a point, the most important question in economics

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.820
is "Where's John Green?" I mean everyone knows
he won a bronze medal in economics at the

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.300
Alabama State Academic Decathlon. Well, John Green
isn't hosting because economics. We'll explain later.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:52.820
[Theme Music]

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.380
Mr. Clifford: So let's start with the basics.
What is economics? Well it might be easier

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.040
to term it what economics isn't. Economics
is not the study of money or getting rich,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.990
although understanding economics can help
with that. Economics is not the study of the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.630
stock market. It's just not. And economics
is not primarily about men in bow-ties forecasting

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.690
what will happen in a given market or the
overall economy. Actually, a few economists

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.890
do that, but that's not the main focus of
economics.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.300
Economics is the study of people and choices.
The famous economist Alfred Marsh defined

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.760
economics as "A study of man (Adriene: And
woman!) in the ordinary business of life.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.790
It inquires how he gets his income and how
he uses it. Thus, it is on the one side the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.320
study of wealth and on the other and more
important side a study of man (Adriene: And woman)."

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.900
Adriene: So let's talk a minute about what
else econ is. Economics is an 18 year old

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.980
deciding whether to work or go to college and
how that affects her future income. Economics is

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.100
a company deciding whether to produce smartphones
or tablets and how that's influenced by what

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.960
we consumers want to buy. Economics is the
government deciding whether to increase its

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.340
spending when it's a recession and if it's
worth going into debt.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.920
So despite what you might think, economics
is not boring and dull. OK, some of it is,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.320
but it's not all like that I promise! It's
awesome. Understanding econ can forever change

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.170
the way you think and problem-solve. Our job
over the next 40 weeks is to teach you concepts

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.040
that will help you understand the world, and
hopefully make it a better place.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.090
No matter who you are, you will be using economics.
In fact, pewww! You are using econ right now,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.260
you made a choice to watch this video, that
means you must feel that the benefit outweighs

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.150
the cost. You might be thinking "This is YouTube,
there's no cost," but sure there is. You could

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.670
be watching videos of kittens or skaters falling
on their face or charlie biting fingers. Ow!

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.530
The cost of watching this video is the video you're
not watching, the value of the next best alternative.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.940
Economists call this your opportunity cost.
If you're still watching this video it means

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.910
that you believe it's the best use of your
time, or you wouldn't be watching it. "But

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.200
what if I'm watching this at school?" you
ask, "What if I'm forced to watch this?" Well,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.020
you weren't forced to go to school, you could
ditch, you could drop out, you could move

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.950
to a country that doesn't have compulsory
education. But the cost would outweigh the

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.120
benefit. Even if you are at school, you're
not forced to watch the video, you could close

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.989
your eyes or put your head down. No one's
gonna pry your eyes open, that'd be creepy!

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.930
Now let's talk about why John Green isn't
here teaching this course. John is an entrepreneur,

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.570
he writes books, runs DFTBA, Vlogbrothers,
and Mental_Floss and creates movies, but he can't

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.220
do everything he wants to do. He looked at the benefits
and costs of his choices, and in the end decided

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.359
to spend more time writing books, so Mr. Clifford
and I are jumping in to teach you economics.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.949
Mr. Clifford: And believe it or not, we just
covered the two most important assumptions

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.439
in all of economics. First, the idea of scarcity.
People have unlimited wants but limited resources,

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:35.029
and second, everything and I mean everything
has a cost. And if these assumptions are true,

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:38.499
then we need a way to analyze our choices
and get the most from our limited resources.

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:39.759
And that's economics.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.840
Adriene: Wait, but let's go back to the idea
of benefits and costs. About 30,000 people

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.069
a year die in car accidents in the US. Is
there a way to ensure there will never be

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:52.629
another traffic fatality? Yes! We can crush
all the cars, close all the roads, and force

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.539
everyone to walk. That would solve the car
crash problem. Do you want to decrease the

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.990
number of people convicted of murder? You
could decriminalize murder. You want to end

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.720
the unethical treatment of elephants? You could
kill off all the elephants, in an ethical way of course.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.309
But before you decide to tenderly euthanize
herds of beautiful elephants, think about

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:16.479
it for a second. Each of these solutions is
absurd because the cost clearly outweighs

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.120
the benefit. Traffic fatalities are tragic,
but we don't prevent them at all costs. You

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.020
know that driving has risks, that you might
get in a car accident, but you still drive.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.550
Why? Well first, who's gonna walk to the gym?
And walking home with groceries in the rain

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.039
is way worse than the teeny-tiny chance of
dying in a car crash. The point is, individuals,

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:40.819
businesses, and countries can't have everything,
so they're forced to weigh the benefits and

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:43.110
costs of their decisions and make choices.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.490
Let's look at another example. Military spending
in the United States is over 600 billion dollars

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.919
per year, that's close to what the next top
ten countries spend combined. There are a

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.960
total of about 20 active aircraft carriers
in the world, and the US has half of them,

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.569
and it's building more. The opportunity cost
of those aircraft carriers could be hospitals,

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:08.330
schools, and roads. So, is the US spending
too much on the military? Should the US focus

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.280
on making guns or butter? That is, weapons
or consumer goods?

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.460
Mr. Clifford: And notice the key word here
is "or," we can't produce an infinite amount

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.419
of weapons AND consumer goods because we don't
have an infinite amount of workers and farms

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.189
and factories and raw materials. Scarcity
means we must make a choice. The American

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:28.440
president Dwight D. Eisenhower explained this best
in 1953 in a speech about Cold War military buildup.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.740
"Every gun that is made, every warship launched,
every rocket fired signifies, in the final

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:37.629
sense, a theft from those who hunger and are
not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:41.379
This world in arms is not spending money alone.
It is spending the sweat of its laborers,

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:43.749
the genius of its scientists, the hopes of
its children."

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:47.240
And this is a good time to mention the role
of politics in economics; we're not pushing

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.189
some liberal anti-military policy here. We're
just pointing out that military spending has

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:55.709
an opportunity cost: The resources not being
used for social services like feeding the hungry.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.899
We're gonna try not to push a political agenda
on you. We're gonna show you both sides and

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:02.339
let you decide which one's best. So please
don't say "Mr. Clifford loves capitalism,

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.879
so he's just a pro-business conservative,"
or "Adriene's talking about environmental

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:08.240
regulations, so she's an anti-business liberal."

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.369
Yeah, we are pro-business and you are too.
I mean, where do you think your computer came

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:15.039
from? That computer was brought to you by
capitalism and the private sector. But that

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:18.619
being said, the security and laws, roads,
and that traffic ticket you got the other

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:20.119
day came from the government.

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:23.770
Conservatives and liberals fight over the
details, but the free market alone can't solve

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.360
all of our problems. And the government can't
solve all of them either. Government officials

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.159
use economic theory to guide public policy;
their effects are widespread and affect millions

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:35.909
of people. Sometimes a theory is flawed, but
many times a policy is flawed. Economists

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:40.869
adjust theories supported by data and understanding
of incentives. Having the right incentive is key.

00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:45.039
Adriene: But the right incentives can be hard
to figure out. Take for example public colleges

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:49.479
and universities. Many of them used to get
state money for each student they enrolled.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.159
That meant universities had financial incentives
to focus on recruiting as many students as

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:58.039
possible, but not actually helping them succeed
once they were in class.

00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:02.409
So states have started changing the incentives.
Now, more and more states reward schools for

00:08:02.409 --> 00:08:07.669
the number of students that complete courses
or earn degrees. And in some places this has

00:08:07.669 --> 00:08:12.260
worked; it's helped schools increase their graduation
rates by shifting money from marketing budgets

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:18.460
to programs to help students do better, but those
incentives can also backfire if they're poorly designed.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.659
A university that gets money for graduates
could push students through the program without

00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:26.949
giving them a good education. It might want
to only admit students who come in with super

00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:31.749
high test scores, instead of considering other
factors that might make them good candidates.

00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:34.751
It might push students into less-rigorous
majors.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.539
But incentives can help solve problems without
adding more resources. You just have to get

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:43.800
the incentives right. Many non-economists
assume that the way to improve things like

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.959
healthcare is to spend more money.

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:50.259
Economists would point out that the US already
spends almost twice as much per person as

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:54.990
other rich countries, and in many cases they
get worse health outcomes. Economists would

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.750
also say that rather than spending more money,
we need to make sure that insurers, doctors,

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.870
hospitals, and patients have incentives to
produce the most effective care possible at

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:08.630
the lowest cost possible. The point is, if you
mess up the incentives, the policy's not gonna work.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:14.040
When Vietnam was under French colonial rule,
the regime issued a bounty on rats to exterminate

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:19.230
them, giving money to people for handing in
rat tails. I guess because piles off rat bodies

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.920
were too gross. The plan backfired. To make
as much money as possible, the rat-catchers

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.420
cut the tails off the rats and released them,
allowing them to make baby rats. The policy

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.880
actually increased the rat population. It
made things worse. Eek!

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.800
We'll talk more about this idea of perverse
incentives in another video, when we talk

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.889
about the 2008 financial crisis. Eek again.
For now, let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:09:41.889 --> 00:09:45.759
Mr. Clifford: Speaking of 2008, people sometimes
criticize economists asking "Why didn't they

00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:49.759
predict the 2008 financial crisis?" or, "why
can't they agree on what the government should

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:53.380
do or shouldn't do when there's a recession?"
These criticisms fail to distinguish between

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.449
macroeconomics and microeconomics.

00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:59.019
Specifically, all these complaints are about
macroeconomics. Macro studies the economy

00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:03.980
as a whole; it looks at the whole nation's
output, unemployment, interest rates, government

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.170
spending, and growth. Macro answers questions
like "Will unemployment rise if there's an

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.519
increase in taxes?" "Will and increase in
the money supply boost output or just increase

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:15.359
inflation?" "Will a slump in European economies
cause the US economy to slow down?"

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.200
Macroeconomists get more airtime because they
predict the direction of the overall economy,

00:10:19.209 --> 00:10:22.540
and work with the media and businesses and
congress and the Federal Reserve, but less

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.720
than half of all economists are macro economists;
there's a whole other side of economics that

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.560
look at different questions. "How many workers
should we hire to maximize profit?" "If our

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.040
main competitor releases their product in
May, when is the best time to release our

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.519
product?" and "which is better for fighting
climate change, a gas tax, or increase in

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:41.790
fuel efficiency?" These are all microeconomic
questions. They're not about predicting GDP,

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.360
or measuring unemployment, but they are crucial
questions that economists must answer. Also,

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.380
if you don't know what GDP is or what a high or low
unemployment rate is don't worry, we'll get there.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.760
So macro and micro-economists are two different
groups asking different questions under one

00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:58.959
academic umbrella. If economics was biology,
macroeconomics would be ecology while microeconomics

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:03.269
would be cell biology. If economics was physics,
macro would be cosmology and relativity while

00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:05.449
microeconomics would be Newtonian mechanics.

00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:08.310
Thanks Thought Bubble! Stan, I've always wanted
to say that. Now I can cross it off my bucket

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.139
list. Now I have "ring the opening bell at
the New York Stock Exchange," "arm wrestle

00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:14.079
Ben Bernanke," and "swim in a giant pool of
money like Uncle Scrooge."

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.220
Adriene: Obviously we're glossing over the
details, but we promise to cover everything

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:22.240
in the next 40 weeks from supply and demand
to monetary policy, we'll cover it all. Except

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.819
for maybe the giant pools of money. We can't
promise you that learning economics will make

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:30.769
you wealthy, but we can promise that learning
economics will enlighten your mind and make

00:11:30.769 --> 00:11:35.369
you a more informed decision maker. And that
makes us all better off. Thanks so much for

00:11:35.369 --> 00:11:36.820
joining us. We'll see you next week.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.680
Mr. Clifford: Thanks for watching Crash Course
Economics. It was made with the help of all

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.259
of these nice people. They work on the show
because there's financial and implicit benefits

00:11:43.259 --> 00:11:46.600
that cover their opportunity costs. Now, if
you want to help them with those financial

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.339
benefits, consider going over to Patreon.
It's a voluntary subscription platform that

00:11:50.339 --> 00:11:54.019
allows you to pay whatever you want monthly
to help make Crash Course free for everyone,

00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:56.679
forever. Thanks for watching. DFTBA.
