00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.620
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.240
Super. Blue. Blood. Moon.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.360
I heard those words and I was like

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.840
"Mmhmm, that's my life now."

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.540
So, here's the deal.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.300
"Supermoon" refers to the fact that the Moon goes around the Earth in an ellipse.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.880
When it's closest to the Earth, that's called perigee,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.420
and when that coincides with a full moon,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.820
Bam, supermoon. Makes sense? Really big, really bright.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.880
"Blue moon" is the second full moon in a calendar month.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.600
A "blood moon" has two meanings.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.160
That's when the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.040
and the umbral shadow of the Earth is cast on the Moon,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.760
turning it red, and it looks all freaky and stuff.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.240
The second meaning for "blood moon" is when you're playing Zelda

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.020
and all the bad guys that you've killed respawn

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.940
and you've got to take them back down.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.940
Shout out to my boy, Link.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.080
I love that game! I have a horse named Elvis.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.840
So I live in Huntsville, Alabama. There's a re—

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.700
(Laughs)

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.700
—really cool model of the Saturn V rocket

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.860
on the side of the interstate at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.200
My goal is to get a photo

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.160
of the blood moon as it comes down.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.360
Bam. Right there.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.440
That's the photo I want.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.820
I just want that blood moon and a rocket.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.300
I just think it's going to be amazing, right?

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.460
So the first full moon of the month, I went out there

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.180
and tried my hardest to get photos.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.660
I tried to be aligned as the full moon rose,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.620
and they weren't that bad for a first attempt.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.580
But the problem was,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.280
that particular supermoon was a rising supermoon,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.920
meaning I could stand on a bridge just to the west of the rocket.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.580
Are your fingernails hurtin'?

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.240
Yeah.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.380
My fingernails— my knuckles hurt too.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.200
The super blue blood moon, however,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.480
was a setting supermoon.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.600
Meaning, I had to be on the opposite side of the rocket,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.760
deep in the heart of Huntsville,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.340
with no line of sight to the rocket

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.720
because there was no convenient bridge to stand on.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.080
I want to get it right.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.780
Obviously this requires math.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.420
You have to know where the Moon is setting;

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.580
you have to know where you are;

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.060
you have to know where the rocket is;

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.720
we're talking celestial alignment.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.860
So I called in the big guns.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.660
Do you remember Trevor, from the solar eclipse?

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.520
We did the math together.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.220
Three.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.080
Two.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.020
One.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.080
Transit.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.040
Oh! It happened! I saw it!

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.320
So I called him and said,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.800
"Dude, will you come down here?

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.860
Let's do some math together.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.560
And let's try to figure out what's going on."

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.160
We used a program called "The Photographer's Ephemeris"

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.480
that told us exactly where the lunar eclipse

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.080
was going to be behind the Saturn V.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.780
Okay, so my buddy Jared has a drone

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.560
we did the math

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.500
and we figured out exactly where the Moon

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.080
is going to set and how that lines up with the rocket.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.400
It's here at All Nations Church in Huntsville, Alabama.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.960
So, Jared is going to fly with his drone,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.960
and he's going to figure out how high we need to be

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.980
in order for us to see over these trees.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.800
(Whirring sounds)

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.500
Coming left. Yeah.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.880
The bad thing about this particular lunar eclipse

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.660
is that the sun was going to be rising in the east.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.940
And the problem is, that means the ambient light

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.260
was going to blow out the back,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.280
the rocket wouldn't be illuminated enough,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.200
so I called the people at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.360
and asked them if they would turn the rocket lights on.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.980
"U.S. Space and Rocket Center, this is (unintelligible name), how can I help you?"

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.840
"Yeah, we was going to cut them on about 5:00, but we can go ahead and cut them on right now, it will just take a couple minutes for my guy to get over there."

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.460
The people at the church were super awesome

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.600
and said I could do whatever I want

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.780
as long as I didn't tear up the grass,

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.500
so we had a sixty-foot boom lift delivered,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.300
and Trevor and I put on some harnesses,

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.500
got up in the bucket, and aligned ourselves for the shot.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.300
When we finally got sixty feet up in the air,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.060
the lunar eclipse was already underway

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.980
and all we had to do was wait for it to align with the rocket.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.620
The Moon is starting to get covered up

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.260
by the umbral shadow.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.300
And at this point, we are waiting to uh— for the thing to turn red.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.000
So we can get the shots with this and that.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.340
So this is the point of this video:

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.200
I was expecting a big blood moon like on Zelda,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.080
didn't happen, but what did happen

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.880
is a weird, optical phenomenon that I do not understand

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.520
and it's making me a little upset

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.000
because usually I have a pretty good grasp on these things.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.940
I don't know what I took a picture of.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.780
There's a line on the Moon.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.620
It happens right at the tip of the rocket,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.020
when the Moon comes down,

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.360
as soon as the very tip of the launch escape system,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.020
which is the rocket on top of the rocket,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.340
as soon as the Moon crosses that,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.260
you can see a line appear across the Moon.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.320
And I don't know what it is.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.740
Look, there's a line that shows up,

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.440
but it stays even with the tip of the launch escape system,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.360
the very top of the rocket.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.520
So you think if you planned something for a month

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.620
you'd be all excited the exact three seconds that it's happening

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.160
but I was confused.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.240
Like, I thought there was some kind of defect on my sensor

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.940
'cause I could see this line and then I was like,

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.140
"Wait no." I'm looking through my DSLR

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.020
so the optical path doesn't have the sensor in the way;

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.620
That's an actual thing I'm seeing.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.240
In fact, I commented on it the exact moment it happened.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.860
You see that line?

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.820
What's that?

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.020
The line? What do you mean?

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.100
It's creating this weird line.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.820
The sliver of it, you mean?

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.680
No, there's uh— there's an atmospheric something that's happening

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.740
right where it's touching the—

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.840
So this is my question, internet.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.600
I took photos of the lunar eclipse lined up with the Saturn V

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.140
because I thought "Hey this went to the moon, that's the moon

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.960
that would be a good photo."

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.140
What, instead I got,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.520
was a question.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.800
"What is goin' on?"

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.480
I think--is it a mirage?

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.420
How can it be a mirage if it's at an angle?

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.160
There's no cables at the top of the rocket.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.900
There were no airplanes in the area, this isn't a contrail.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.540
I thought it was a cloud but it's not there until the moon gets there.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.980
The tip of the rocket's here but it's causing a line over here.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.180
Why is it just at the tip and then what—?

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.060
It's not Schlieren. No, it's not Schlieren.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.340
I don't know.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.520
So, there. Internet. I have a question.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.220
"Why is there a line on my lunar eclipse photos?"

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.480
Specifically at the junction of the Launch Escape System on the Saturn V rocket.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.540
I don't know the answer. I would love for you to tell me the answer via Twitter.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.560
I have two Twitter accounts. I have @SmarterEveryDay

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.480
@DestinSandlin. No this is not an attempt to get you to follow me on Twitter.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.880
I really want to know the answer.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.220
So, like, if you actually know

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.800
if you could be like "Hey, I actually know."

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.860
and then tweet me the answer, I would greatly appreciate that.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.040
Thank you for making me Smarter Every Day. Thanks, bye.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.160
Alright, I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day. That is a difficult shot, because you've got the sun

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.000
coming up over the other side of the earth from the moon

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.060
and so you have the ambient light on the subject that you're trying to shoot.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.520
It's a hard, it's a hard shot! Would you agree, Trevor?

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.140
"I would, yes."

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.660
Yeah, so, if you want to try this, I would love to see your photos. The Moon is awesome!

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.680
We're going back to the Moon and I just want people to be excited about it.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.040
So if you wouldn't mind tagging me on Twitter @SmarterEveryDay any time you take really cool photos of the Moon, I would love to see your work.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.560
I'll leave links down below to all the math Trevor helped us figure all that out.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.400
I'll leave these images for the patrons on the Patreon feed. Please feel free to check it out. Feel free to subscribe to @SmarterEveryDay if you're into that sort of thing.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.780
Anyway, I'm Destin, and we gotta get off this thing because it is cold. Anyway, have a good one! Bye.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.140
"You guys have harnesses?" "We got harnesses so we don't fall out of the boom lift!"

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:13.440
If I put this at the very end of the video, we can say "Safety Last." (laughs) We should cut this off.
