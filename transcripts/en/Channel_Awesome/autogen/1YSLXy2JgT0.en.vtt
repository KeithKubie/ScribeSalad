opposite ends of the spectrum and he
 

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.420 align:start position:0%

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:21.430 align:start position:0%
pulls it off so well that I think if you
 

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
pulls it off so well that I think if you
looked<00:16:21.670><c> away</c><00:16:22.350><c> and</c><00:16:23.350><c> he</c><00:16:23.470><c> came</c><00:16:23.649><c> up</c><00:16:23.709><c> and</c><00:16:24.040><c> he</c><00:16:24.130><c> was</c>

00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:49.209 align:start position:0%
think that makes it in some ways even
 

00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:51.150 align:start position:0%
think that makes it in some ways even
trickier<00:16:49.899><c> to</c><00:16:50.110><c> make</c><00:16:50.260><c> a</c><00:16:50.290><c> connection</c><00:16:50.800><c> because</c><00:16:50.920><c> it</c>

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
trickier to make a connection because it
 

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
trickier to make a connection because it

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.010 align:start position:0%
is so over-the-top and so goofy but like
 

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.329 align:start position:0%
