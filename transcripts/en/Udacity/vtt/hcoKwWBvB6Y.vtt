00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[Narrator] And the answer is 0.0777 approximately,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and the way to obtain this is

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
for this particle to never to be drawn in the resampling phase.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We always have to draw 1 of the following 4 particles.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Those together have a probability of 0.6 to be drawn,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which contrasts to the 0.4 for P3.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So for 5 independent samplings to draw 1 of those 4,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we get a total probability of 0.6 to the fifth,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which is approximately 0.0777.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Put differently, there is about a 7.7% chance that this particle over here is missing,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but with almost 93% probability we'd have this particle included.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If we had, instead of P3, gone for P1 over here,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
which has a much smaller probability of being drawn,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
then this 0.07 will be as large as 0.59,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
which is 0.9 to the fifth.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now this means with about 60% chance

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
we will lose particle 1, and only with a 40% chance it will include it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Put differently, the particles with small importance weights

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
will survive at a much lower rate than the ones with larger importance weights,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.135
which is exactly what we wish to get from the resampling step.
