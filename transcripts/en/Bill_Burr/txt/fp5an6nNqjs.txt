Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Bur and It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and just checking in on you. What's going on now? Why Ya? Um, I'm fucking, ah, I didn't want to get into it. We're up to episode 10. I have no life. I'm trying to fucking, and I'm trying to get in a quick workout before I go to work because I am, I'm fucking right back up to where I was last year when I was like a buck 86 one 87. I am, I f you. It kills me. I've been working out. Why do you walk out? You still put on, um, you know, it is, it's late night. I'm coming home. I'm eating like a fat chick, you know, meeting like some sad fellow doesn't like himself. I just come home and I'm fucking fried. I get home at like seven o'clock at night and I go, ah, fuck it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       That's what I say. I get all the way to my street going, I'm going to get a salad. I've got to have a protein. I'm going to fucking eat the bag of beans or whatever, and then I just drive into my driveway and I go, ah, fuck it. Right. And I order a fucking pizza or burger, you know, or I have a beer or something like that and MIH had, that's it. That's it. I go to my looks, I got them on my fucking second trimester right now. Oh, is this my wife the other day and went to a fucking mall, which is something I never do. Go into a fucking mall. Right? You know, people go to a malls, people with children. I get it. You get them out there, they fucking watched the trolley go by and you know Santa Claus is there. Right? Just fucking sit there waiting for you to put your kid in his lap.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       You fucking Weirdos, right? Hey, let's keep the lie going to the point we put our child in some fucking perverts fucking lap. So they think he comes down, the Goddamn Chimi Mija gets, is there any wonder? So many people end up in cars they don't want to be, and that's, that's how you start out their life. You know, some fucking dude, we don't know, you know, don't really talk to sort of Godlike, you know, sort of culty right? Charlie Manson hair, all fucking A's fucking coming in and everything's cool. You go sit in his fucking lap, but don't talk to strangers. Right? I don't, I don't fucking, I'm just so whenever we go to this fucking thing and we're walking by the fountain, right? There's a trolley and a fountain. This is like the fucking gay, his place you could ever go to. And I don't mean gay in like the homophobic way.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       I mean, the way it used to mean like the 1890s, the gay nineties, as in, Oh my God, could a decade get any happier? Right? It was everything but fucking showgirls coming down, you know, like the end of the family guy song. That was the only thing that was missing. And it's, I just was like, what is all the excitement? We're fucking, everybody's here buying pants. Why are we having a fucking parade? You know? So I went in there and I, I took her to go see the, uh, the lives of pets, which I really enjoyed. Cause you know, I'm a dog, right? I love fucking dogs. And you know what, I was curious, what does my dog do when I leave? Evidently they have quite the adventures.

Speaker 2:          00:03:12       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       that was a fucking really good movie. I liked it. And that was a bunch of kids in there screaming and yelling and that's what I wanted. You know what I mean? And I went to the matinee show and, and just have a bunch of kids screaming and yeah, I wanted the full effect of watching that fucking movie. You know what I mean? It's like when you go to a horror movie, you gotta go see it and there's going to be a bunch of people yelling at the screen right at either that, that's part of the fucking experience. If you want to go see a movie, when everybody shuts the fuck up, you know, you got to do it in your house. Maybe slap a few people around before the movie starts, you know, set the tone. Daddy ain't putting up with this shit. All right. So anyways, long story short and I dressed up a little bit when I went down there. You know, I've been working a lot, so I'm going to take out my lady. So when we're walking out, we'll go and buy the fountain, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:04:05       And there's like all, you know, like the plane, like fucking Tony Bennett. If I ruled the world every day would be like the first day of spring. Every douche would have such a wonderful song to sing. If I ruled the world, what a wonderful world it would be. And everybody's just sitting there mesmerized, eaten this fucking ice cream and shit. Yeah, bide pants. It was fucking weird, man. It was like, when you go to this, you go to some of these fucking malls. It's like you're in a Christmas special. I'm telling you, I wouldn't be surprised if they got a fucking Mesta right. And they're putting some sorta like, like little little dopamine in the air and you get like this fucking high and all of a sudden you're like, you know what? I already have fucking nine pairs of pants. Uh, one more. I'm in the double digits seven days in the week. I want the overlap. I'm going to go over the bar line, right? Like Vinny call Yoda in a pet's way. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:05:03       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:04       So anyways, so I go, all right, I'm, I'm gonna, I don't know what had came over me. We walked by the fountain. I said, I need, let's get a picture. She's like [inaudible] she couldn't fucking believe it. I was going to take a picture next to, in front of a fountain at a mall. This is not me behavior. Right? Of course she's all over it. Women love that tie. Oh my God. That'd be so nice. Right. You just, it just makes you want to start crying like, oh, what happened to me? Right. So all I want to do is take a fucking selfie. Right, right. You know, get up fucking heads in it. My head taken up three quarters of it cause it's so fucking big and some Douche has to come along and be like, oh, you will all, we'll take the parish before you. And I'm thinking, no, I want you to, I don't want to prolong this moment. You fucking asshole. Where's your guy? Cold. Of course my wife goes, oh my God, that would be great. Right? So what does he do? He fucking takes one. Oh, let's get one more for right. Takes another one. Oh my God. And I look at this picture in the fucking horror that I see.

Speaker 3:          00:06:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       My fucking stomach pushing out the bottom of my button down shirt. And then when you really just know you're just getting fat is that fucking button right? Uh, right on your breast plate. It looks like it's doing the iron cross. Just trying to hold both parts of the shirt together. And uh, I looked so fucking bad. I almost got mad at my wife. Like you letting me walk around looking like that. It's like, I get that you love me, but you know, how about a little bit of tough love? You know, how about a little, hey, fatty cakes, you know, you really going to have waffles again this morning. Exhibit a right? And you're bust out a fucking photo you took of me. Nothing will make you lose weight. Like a bad fucking photo. Huh? Jesus Christ. You know, it's bad enough when they catch it in your own backyard, you know? But I'll tell you, you take a photo in public, in front of a fucking fountain at a mall that has a trolley while Tony Bennett's playing. I mean, I'm glad I didn't look at it until I got home. I would've fucking jumped in 10 a sailors dive right into the bottom of that fountain.

Speaker 3:          00:07:11       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:07:12       Yeah. I'm too vain to kill myself. I'll just hang around. Make everybody else miserable. That's what you do. That's what you do. Um, oh, by the way, I w I finally, I watched the, uh, the record of the, uh, the British Grand Prix, um, fascinating fucking race with all the rain there who's gonna go in and change the tires? Who's going to keep going? And by fucking lap seven, everybody changed their fucking tires, right? It kinda seems if you get Paul position, you're basically going to win the race. These guys are so good in the cars are so equal. You can't, I don't have, I've never seen nobody does this stroke, a race thing where you're way in the back and all of a sudden you know your past three people and you do the little Zz top fucking ole move. You know, remember fucking movie. He's, he goes by three cars that are all fucking in line drafting each other and I've watched enough NASCAR who has to scold bearing the Harry Gant car, right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       Darrell Waltrip, Cale Yarborough. I watched enough of that shit to know if two people that draft and they're going to slingshot around you, I'll tell you what, not when Burt Reynolds is there, I don't know what he did. Did he take off his two pains, stick his head out the window and make himself a little more fucking aerodynamic? Is that how he went by three cars? I don't know. Fastest chicken in the south. That shit does not happen in Formula One. If you're not one of the top three fucking drivers of the Illuminati, you're basically, as far as I can tell, the five races I've ever watched from star stat to finish, you're not going to win the Goddamn race, you know, unless the two guys up front don't like each other and they smash into each other. Jesus Christ, Louis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg right at the end of the fucking race. Lewis Hamilton wins it, right guys from fucking England, everybody island man. What? Everybody's going fucking nuts and a, as I mentioned before, those two don't like each other though. He smashing into each other, so in the end they always show the green room afterwards, after somebody one and

Speaker 3:          00:09:08       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:08       It was just like they didn't say one word to each other. Fucking meow fellows. They didn't say one five. I think the fucking Todo Guy. All I want to do and I wake up in the morning is feel your ass. When he fell, he fucking set the two of them down. He goes, listen, you [inaudible] all right. I know you went out there and you watched stroke arrays. I know you watch that Kenny Rogers movie where he adopts the six kids, but never really legally, and nobody had a fucking problem with that. I know you watch days at thunder. All right? This ain't that. This cost real fucking money. Stop smashing into each other. All right?

Speaker 3:          00:09:48       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:48       no, I'll take you back to Germany and I'll reopen the, I can't go that far. Uh, Oh, the Germans, you know, I'm telling you right now, if you take out about 10 years of their history, they're great people. Um, anyway, you pick one wrong guy. That's what's so scary about this fucking, this election. I think that they should make Trump and Hillary both put on a Hitler mask. Matt on the mask, put on a Hitler fucking mustache and whoever looks the closest, you vote for the other person.

Speaker 3:          00:10:21       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       You know what? The results may surprise you. Somebody make a clickbait. Fucking, I'm a clickbait fucking whatever the hell you call the meme or the, the, the, the fucking vine. You know, we put both the presidential candidates in a Hitler Mass, a Hitler mustache. Why can't I talk this morning and Hitler Mustache, the results may surprise you.

Speaker 3:          00:10:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       And just, you know, whoever you're for, you just make the other person, I guess. Yeah, I don't, I don't know how you, I don't know how you bring that one home. You know all you kids today. Oh, you fucking internet superstars. You know, I went into a place the other day to get some lunch of fucking salad with some chicken, right. Desperately trying to fucking bring down the belly. You know, fucking Moba Day is what it look like right now. You know, shaved head, fucking ghost, white body. You know, there's a lot of blubber on me right now. You know, if I was to swim in the ocean, my biggest fear would not be sharks. You know, it'd be some hipsters out there fucking whale hunting cause they thought, you know, they were taking it back. Right. Get fucking Harpoon there. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:11:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:29       The fuck was I talking about? Oh yeah. So I went in to go get this fucking salad and I'm standing there and there's a guy in line wearing a fucking Versace robe, gold, Versace robe. And slippers. So I text my wife going, there's a dude in here, you know? Yeah. Do you want me to take a picture? You gotta see this guy, right? So I fucking take a picture of the guy. And she was like, oh my God, my friend knows that person. He makes these vines, right? So then I clicked on his youtube page and the guys now, whatever Twitter page, the guy's fucking hilarious and I'm just sitting, they go is this fucking guy? He doesn't need to be in a writers room while he's has his own fucking show. And he gets to walk around his bath robe and slippers all day making cooking videos. God bless him. I don't know what the point of all this is. I think the point of all this is I need to get back on elliptical soon so I don't have a fucking heart attack before I go to, uh, I'm going to say the Middle East before I go to the fucking, um, go over to England. Uh, anyways, so yeah, I gotta fucking knock this shit. I gotta knock off this podcast and then I have a,

Speaker 2:          00:12:32       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       Actually I have some people coming over here because our kitchen's all fucked up. You know what's wrong bill? What's wrong with the kitchen? Oh, I don't know whether you put on the hot water or the cold water. The hot water still comes out, you know, problem. I fixed fucking nine times. You've got to shut off the fucking hot water. The handle comes off. Cupboards are all falling apart, you know, everything else in the house is pretty much nice. I probably shouldn't even say that shit. So, um, I got this, like the final fucking thing I have to do. You know what I mean? Cause I fixed up the rest of the house. I'm hoping it's the final fucking thing I have to do. But if for the most part I fixed up the rest of the house. And so now like the kitchen has become like this ice I saw, you know, it'd be like if you bought a brand new suit and they had these old shitty shoes, you know, and people looked down and they were just like, you know what, I was going to get in business with this guy, but what the fuck is with those shoes?

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       See you. What are you fucking Willy Loman there? You fucking Willy Loman. Um, so that nightmare project is about ready to start. People coming over today with their ideas. I have an idea. Like what if we just took everything out and put new stuff in, in the exact same place except for a couple of things and it costs you fucking three zillion dollars. How about that? I could be rustic yet modern yet postmodern, but kind of our deco ish, but doesn't compromise the integrity of the structure.

Speaker 2:          00:14:04       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:14:07       I'm signing up for that shit again. Um, but you know what though, you know that they can probably put it into six weeks. In other words, in about nine months, I think it ought to be done breathing. And a bunch of dust. I'll have fucking, um, coal miner's daughter, lung, whatever the fuck they call it. I have no idea. Um, we don't have any Goddamn, um, I don't have any questions on this one. And I also don't have any advertising. You know, I will do some advertising here. Uh, Tuesday night I went back to the troubadour and I saw wheeler walker jr right. You say it's over. Pack up your stuff. Something, something you've had enough. I'm that fuck you bitch. You broke my heart. Fuck you Franz. Tearing us apart. Fuck your dog open. Never comes home. I saw that guy fucking live, man. It was what?

Speaker 1:          00:15:04       I wonder what a fun fucking show. I'm just great in the bands killer. The Bass player actually plays in one of my favorite fucking bands, truth and salvage company. He's on the road with them, had a killer band and the dude comes out, wheeler walker jr he fucking murdered it. Absolutely fucking murdered it. Um, I didn't know what to expect when I went down there. You know, when somebody goes down there, they're doing funny songs. You're like, go, I don't know what's gonna happen here. Is this going to be like a one joke song and then you fucking like still standing there for another 45 minutes. It was, it was great and he was fucking hilarious in between songs, his band or what the crowd, what I'm saying is if you get a chance to see wheeler walker jr he's coming to a fucking club near you theater near you arena.

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       Fucking a amphitheatre a a car port. I don't know. I'm trying to think of every structure I can think of. Definitely go out and see him. He's, he's, he's absolutely worth the money and uh, and the band sounds great. And he had, uh, on another band open up in front of him, two ladies with guitars. They were great just to fucking kill a show. And I ran into a bunch of comics when I was there, ran into Doug Benson and all these other guys. Look at me dropping names here, dropping fucking names and I sat there in the back of the club and I just drank water all night cause I'm fucking fat. All right. I'm not gonna lie to you. I had one whiskey, you know, you've got to have one. You know, even John Wayne would have one, you know, before he ate half a fucking cow that he barely cooked. Isn't that what happened to him?

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       You know, that's what, you know what happened? All those guys back in the day, they just kept eating red meat because back then it was all about, Whoa, you know, why would I eat hamburger when I got steak at home? Right? Isn't that what they said? And weren't they literally talking about food considering what most of them died of? I know that was about their ladies. Um, but anyways, uh, back then, right, if you will like a guys guy, you are eating steak. If you were fucking, if you were successful, it was considered the highest cut of fucking meat and all that. You didn't realize it was tearing apart your fucking guts and back then there's no way you let another man fucking look in your ass to make sure you weren't going to die of ass cancer. Right? There's no fucking way you could do that.

Speaker 1:          00:17:24       And then get on a horse and call yourself a cowboy. That's not what it was about. All right. He kept eating steak then. Yet when you, when you would, your wife was done making the steak, you fucking fucking wrapped it with the frying pan. I said, clean it up, right? Then you went over and you put butter on the steak and then that was it. And I think it was better for the environment back then. You know what I mean? Women were being beaten, so they were drinking themselves to death. So they died earlier and guy's fucking ate themselves to death. And you know, people got out of the way and there was only like fucking a couple billion people on the planet. Now look at everybody. Everybody's doing yoga. Nobody's beating their wives, right? Everybody's having a fucking salad. And now there's seven and a half billion people on the fucking planet.

Speaker 1:          00:18:15       You know? And I think it's high time that we go back to the way it was, you know, oh, whatever. We'll let Hillary becomes president. And at the end of her 48 year run, then it goes back to the fucking dark ages. We go back to a feudal system, the real one, you know, where you're actually aware of what was happening rather than now where it's just banker's fucking silently sucking the life out of the fucking middle cloud. Jesus. Bill, you're going to get on a fucking, you know, fucking kills me. Bernie Sanders, arguably the scientists from back to the future fucking endorses Hillary Clinton. Get it. Can you fucking any of them? Can any of them just fucking have a point of view and just stick with it? They're always like, this is what I'm above. You could vote for me because I'm above this. Right. And then the second, all of a sudden they start taking on water or this or the thing that's working. Speaking of water. Do you know there's more shark attacks than ever

Speaker 1:          00:19:15       and they're doing fucking stories about what should we do about this? It's like, well, you know, you could not swim in the ocean. You'd dumb con. There's plenty of fucking, there's plenty of lakes. You know what I mean? You know, Shit, fill up your bathtub, you know, have make a day in it, you know, but a snorkel on it. Stare at your balls. I mean, do whatever you gotta do, but don't go in the fucking water. Right. Why do you think there's more shark attacks now? Well, two reasons. One, there's more fucking people until we're eating all the fucking fish. So the menu is becoming more limited. You know, back in the day, shark could be like, oh look at that fucking surfboard. Or Eh, you know, like the fucking bore gets between my teeth. It's not that that tougher mate. You know, he's still in politeness. And I had quote and I'll look at that, the school of tuna,

Speaker 1:          00:20:01       Toro, Toro, right? I'm going to go over there and fucking have some total. All those options aren't there anymore. And these people still go out there and that boogie boards, right? If you've got on a boogie board, you're like a slider, like children, children on Boogie boards. That's like a slider now for a fucking shark. And then you get to the a, you get to the bigger people. You know, I'll tell you right now how fat I am. There's no fucking way I would go out there. They'd think I was a fucking sea lion, an albino sea lion that got shunned by the rest of the herd. You know, is there anything worse than watching a fucking animal on one of those animals shows getting shunned by the rest of the herd. You know, animals are like super fucking racist. I don't know what it is to second somebody, a fucking albino. They show a little bit a weakness. I mean, they're really people and you never hear Peter Bring that up.

Speaker 3:          00:20:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:52       I mean sure they sit there and they talk about how bad human beings are. Hey, you know, guilty as charged. You're looking at it. I'd be, I've gone down to fucking Kentucky Fried Chicken. I've eaten their beatless chicken. You know, all walking around roided up like McGuire and fucking Sosa fallen on their fucking faces. Cause people like the white meat more. You know, I've eaten that shit guilty's fucking charge. But what they don't talk about is how those fucking chickens, if they were allowed to keep their beaks, you know, and not have chest so big that they fell down, they would be bullying the fucking weak as hen, you know, you don't deserve to have children, right. Just go over and they'd pack her to death and they never, you know, they go, you know, that's just how they are.

Speaker 3:          00:21:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:36       You know, it's survival of the fittest and all that shit and then all of a sudden human beings start doing it, right. Some fucking nerd gets thrown into a locker and all of a sudden it's this national fucking story. I think when human beings is going to turn it around as the day, we just admit that we're just a bunch of fucking animals. You know? I have no idea what I'm talking about. I just, I have not looked at any news. I don't know what this fucking Pokemon thing is about. Everybody's talking about it. I finally asked somebody at work, I know that there's like,

Speaker 3:          00:22:09       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:22:09       I know it was a movie. I know kids were in toward, I guess just people running around with their phones, trying to find the pokemons to, to capture them in the middle of the fucking day. We were in the writers room and these kids ran up to this dumpster and it was like a fucking Wednesday afternoon. It's like, don't you have to go to work? Shouldn't you be somewhere right now? You know what I mean? She'd be out there blaming your parents for something. Um, I don't know. It's really making that pope Pokemon things really making me feel old.

Speaker 3:          00:22:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:42       Everybody like is going around. A lot of people going around doing it and then there's people watching people doing it. So it's like they're not doing anything and then you're watching them doing nothing. It's kind of fucking weird, right? It's like, I saw this thing the other day, you know, on roller coasters now that some of the new roller coasters, they're having people get on the roller coaster and then you put on virtual reality glasses, right? And it's like, it's not enough to be on the roller coaster and then you gotta be on the, put the glasses on and you go up the hill and then as you go over the top and you had that big drop, they make it feel as though you're falling off of a building or something. It's like, well, you know, you're kind of doing that in real life. Why don't you take them off and enjoy it? I don't, you know what it is, it's all of us just slowly but surely working our way to robots, you know, having a robot, mom and dad and these fucking, you know, I ran into some nerd the other day that was into fucking robotics, believe it or not.

Speaker 3:          00:23:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:41       Did this benefit for a, that tragedy there in Orlando, right? Do you guys remember that tragedy or is there have been 52 more fucking shooting since then that people don't even remember it. Right. So we did a benefit for that and um,

Speaker 3:          00:23:57       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:23:57       I'm standing out in the alley afterwards having a fucking cigar, right? And this kid comes up, I call him a kid. That means he was like 26 years old and he was fucking talking about how he's into robotics and all this type of shit. And I was just like, why are you doing that? What about in way he wasn't in a robotics? What the fuck was he into?

Speaker 3:          00:24:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:18       It was into some shit that would just basically gather information on the user without the person really knowing it. And it's just like, why? Why are you doing that? You know? And he's going, well, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I just kept hammering them with the questions and hammer them with the questions. And at the end of the day, the only way he could defend what he, what he was doing was he, he basically said this, well, you know, if I didn't do it, someone else would right there. That's the devils. That's the devil song right there. Hi, how high? How if I didn't do it, someone else would it does it rhyme? Who gives a fuck? I hope. Let's go fucking do something evil. That's might've been the worst song ever. If you have to justify your fucking job by basically say, you know, if I didn't do it, somebody else would. What jobs are those spying on people dealing drugs,

Speaker 3:          00:25:09       right?

Speaker 1:          00:25:11       Fucking, I don't know what shooting porno, dropping bombs. I mean, anytime. The only way to justify your job is if I didn't do it, somebody else would, uh, you know, I dunno.

Speaker 3:          00:25:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:26       But these fucking assholes making these robots, man, they, they're making them too good. I used to do a bit about it. You know, that basic, you know, I don't mind if you make the fucking thing super smart. Just don't have it be able to run like fucking Bo Jackson, which is what they're doing. Cause they keep trying to improve it and they're fucking competing with somebody out some other con, uh, companies, fucking robot and they're just making the thing into the $6 million man. It's like, guys, guys,

Speaker 3:          00:25:54       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:25:54       you're already stuck every fucking answer to any question ever. And it between, it's fucking non-existent. Metal fucking ears, I guess. It has metal lists, non-existent human years and now you're going to be able to make it run a fucking four 40 you know like this, this thing knows the answers to everything.

Speaker 3:          00:26:11       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:26:13       You Know Anna, Anna can make the fucking Seahawks secondary at that. That's what the fuck you're building and you don't think that that's going to come back and bite us in the ass. It knows the answer to everything. So it basically knows how to do open heart surgery and also how to load and fire an AK 47 fly an f six stayed. I mean it's limitless. Like you remember those fucking action movies where like the fucking, this the, the hero, the movie. I don't care. Kind of mode of transportation of fucking boat and helicopter, a motorcycle, this space shuttle. This fucking guy knows how to use it. No preflight, you just start the fucking helicopter. Ropy yanked the guts out of it. You know, I took a ride in a fucking ace star the other day and there's no fiber. I wouldn't be able to figure out how to fucking start that thing up.

Speaker 1:          00:27:05       I got over it. I got, I got 120 hours flying a Robinson 22. You stick me in an a star. It's like, hey kids, a little help. These fucking Rambo guys, these Steven Seagal guys, these muscles from Brussels guys, Chuck Norris, right, Eddie D's, all of them. They just fucking ran up and could just do it and used to always laugh going, that's fucking bull. Anybody, you know, if you had a boat, you'd just be like, wow, what if, what do you know where the fucking keys were? Just jumps right in. The fucking keys are right there. And he knows exactly where the fucking throttle is. He doesn't have to look around and get his bearings like, hey, this is this. That's that. He just fucking jumps in like it's his boat. And it always makes you laugh going, yeah, that would never happen in real life. Well, guess what?

Speaker 1:          00:27:54       In 2016, that's going to happen. These fucking robots. I don't know why they would be running away and they're not going to be running away from us. They're going to be running after us. And, uh, you know, they get sick of fucking running, which why would they, they don't have a respiratory system as long as they're charged up like a fucking Tesla. They're never gonna stop, but it doesn't make a difference. What mode of transportation, what weapon is nearby? That was another thing with those action heroes, whatever. Fucking they, they'd pick up a goddamn garden and hoe and all of a sudden this spinning around like Bruce Slick. It's like, Jesus, we will you in band. You when you were a major red too, you went time to fucking master all the martial arts. Learn how to use not only every mode of transportation, every fucking aberration of that fucking mode of transportation.

Speaker 1:          00:28:43       Is that the right word? You know, every style of fucking boat. I don't give a fuck if it's sailing. If it's a submarine or a fucking cruise ship, you know how to get that fucking thing going and to docket and tie it off all at the same fucking time. Right? These robots can do that, but at least Rambo, at least ramble. Bled. He had to take time to fucking sell himself back up. These robots don't leave. He completes. We can kill it. The fucking robots don't bleed. You know what I mean? And you know these fucking nerds, you know, back in the day you poured a Dixie Cup of water on down their back, you know, and they didn't do like a person lift their shoulders up and go, all right, they don't, they fucking short circuit out and then they fall down. So you know what these nerds are doing? They're like, well, we can't have that. You know, the competition's robot. If you dump a little bit of water down, it's back at shorts out and it goes fucking a zillion dollars worth of technology. You know, that they're making, they're gonna make these full fucking robots. They're going to make them be able to swim, right? Do everything is going to be just like that fucking movie.

Speaker 4:          00:29:46       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:29:46       well that guy at all, those fucking lady robots and he was fucking them and shit, right? And then the one kid gets locked in the breezeway and he's screaming like, I thought you loved me. And she just goes away with the expression, this look on her face. That's what they're going to do. I guarantee, I bet you right now, as I'm talking, somebody somewhere is fucking a robot.

Speaker 4:          00:30:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:07       Then got the lab coat on and shit. So he makes him feel like he's doing research and there's a bunch of other scientists watching him fucking the robot. Right. And then afterwards he's going to give the feedback. Oh No. You know what it is? It's a fucking, it's probably just some regular person who has like Hep-c, but can't afford that 1090 $5 a pill to get rid of it or somebody's HIV positive. So they go, hey man, you want that fucking pill? You got to come in here and fuck this robot on film.

Speaker 1:          00:30:40       Oh, this is last thing I'll tell you and I've got to go to work. Did you fucking see, uh, have you seen this? Evidently, I don't know if this is fucking true, but ever since Bentley, the pharmaceutical lobbyists, any states where weed is legal, that going after, uh, the legalization of weed because any, any state where weed is legal, um, the prescriptions go down. I don't know if this is true, but somebody told me it was and I never looked up any information, so I'm going to say it's true and I owe a big apology to all the fucking weed smokers out there. Evidently you are right. Um, so anyways, but I'm going to keep drinking. I'm too far down this fucking road. All right. I gotta get Outta here. I gotta go to fucking work and knock out this last fucking one for Christ's sake. Um, that's the podcast should cons. I will talk to you on a Thursday. I'll check in on you. All right, go fuck yourselves and I'll see you Thursday.

Speaker 4:          00:31:43       [inaudible] when those get to use it all to Cuba, we have to [inaudible]. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:32:26       Hey, what's going on? It's bill.

Speaker 5:          00:32:28       And uh, this is the Monday morning podcast for the week of July 10th, 2008 is it July 10th? I have no idea. I just got off a plane coming back from, uh, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I flew us there. I sat in seat 18 a and. M there were two people about, Oh, I dunno, 19 rows behind me talking really loudly. You know, those people, they, they laugh at everything that they say and they never say anything funny. Four hours of that shit for fucking hours of that. People just going, you know, how many hours are left on the flight? I don't know. Four and a half. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:33:12       he just start laughing. It was fucking killing me was, it was torture the whole flight. I ended up, you know, I ended up doing, I got a new battery from my, uh, made of wood laptop, so I was able to watch good fellas. Song's able to drown her out for a w how long has good fellas? Huh? So like two hours long or some shit. So I had that on. I had Goodfellas on cranked as high as I could, you know, we did, but we won it. We were wise guys. I had that fucking crank is high as I could to try to drown out this Widdicombe plus group of people. I don't know. I, you know what I mean? Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm so fucking miserable, you know? Am I so miserable that I actually need something to be funny to laugh at it?

Speaker 5:          00:34:01       You know? I mean, I was sitting there and the end of it trying, you don't want to, and they finally, you know, I actually, I didn't even watch the end of and end up good fellows. I hate when he's, when he fucking becomes a Druggie, you know what I mean? He just pisses me off, you know? And then he, then he feels like all, he feels like he's the victim, you know, 6,000 bucks for a life of work. He gives me six grand. You're lucky you didn't fucking blow your brains out right there. He told you not to fuck with the drugs, the exact fucking thing he told you not to do. You went out and you did it. And then he ends up going to jail and dying in jail. You piece of shit. I fucking hate at the beginning of that movie is great, right up through the was the Lewenza fucking robbery. That movie is awesome. And then the second is second, he gets that co core and that flopped house apartment. And then he's got that retard with the attitude though the girl, they're the fucking babysit. And I got to get my hat.

Speaker 5:          00:35:01       I Dunno. I Dunno. So anyway, that's what I was doing. I was fucking listening to that movie on 10 Janice Lassie as though I had that fucking blasting in my ears. One of my ears is ringing right now. I already have tinnitus in one ear from playing drums years ago and fucking, it's going to be ringing even more because of these fucking idiots, man. It's just, I dunno, does anybody, you know, you got anybody who does that shit. They just, you know, they come walking up and you know the only be sit standing there waiting for an elevator and they just go, hey, how you doing? You're like, good. And they're like, Eh, good. Yeah. You know, if you go to anybody fucking Lou does that at work. Just discreetly leave a book on self confidence in their little cubicle area, something, you know what I mean? People either do that or though they sit, oh they hum songs. I think I already joked about that about 28 podcasts ago, but for those of you who are new to my podcast, I used to work with a guy. You have to work with someone who uh, hums a tune that doesn't exist. You know what I mean? Used to walk around the office,

Speaker 6:          00:36:11       Eh,

Speaker 5:          00:36:14       boot or Doodoodoo

Speaker 6:          00:36:17       duty

Speaker 5:          00:36:17       all fucking day long. And I used to be like, what the fuck? That's not a song. Right. It's not a stuff sound like a song when I hummed it. Yeah, exactly. But that's a dead on rendition of his fucking, you know, it just, it went on forever. Like one of those progressive prog rock bands or Dave Matthews, I saw him in concert and fucking was this terrible. Somebody hooked me up with tickets and it was one of those, those bands that you get after fucking a song and a half. And then there's a black guy playing a fiddle, which is, which is weird, you know, I usually like random shit like that, you know, like seeing a fat Asian, you know, just don't see that too often. You know, black guy playing a fiddle, you know, she'll be like, she'll be, you know, isn't that, but you think that he would, he would do it the black guy way, you know, where all of a sudden he teaches white people that have fiddle can actually be cool as opposed to some, you know, redneck instrument or a, I guess in classical music it's cool.

Speaker 5:          00:37:17       But you know what I mean? I mean, black people made happy birthdays, make a cool sound, you know, cool song. You'd pick it. You know? That's what I, that's when I saw a black guy with a fiddle. That's what I thought. Okay. He's gonna, he's gonna, he's gonna break it down. I thought something was gonna happen and he just was playing that skip to my loo spin. Your partner ran to a rat deck that that style. I think the black guy who plays the saxophone in the Dave Matthews band, I bet he doesn't talk to the black guy that plays the fiddle. I bet he thinks she's a Cielo. Just coming up some heavy show, you know, motherfucker is bad enough. You'd be playing a mother fucking violin. You'd be doing that shit every night in front. All these motherfucking white people. How do you think that makes me feel? That was the worst impression of a black saxophone player in a band that I don't like, that I'll ever do, but I don't give a fuck. I let he just got off of Goddamn playing, cut me some slack. I listen to people laugh, you know? It was like a nightmare fucking comedy show. You know what I mean? Where all of a sudden it didn't, it didn't make sense anymore. Like you just said anything like, Hey, can I get up? I need to need to go to the bathroom. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:38:23       All right. Anyways, let's get on with the podcast here. Uh, what do we got here? What am I going to do this week? And I'm going to start with the question. It's not fucked in. I'm going to, I want to height the shit first. First of all, I just got that the Improv in Pittsburgh, unbelievable turnout and 99.9% of that has to go to a, the Jim and Randy show on WTV. Those guys totally hooked me up. They let me come in on a Wednesday on a Thursday and on a Friday I did like nine hours a fucking radio with those guys letting everybody know that I was going to be over at the stacks, the mall over there. And uh, other than the fact that a couple people got shot and one was murdered, um, I think it was a good week over there at the mall.

Speaker 5:          00:39:06       Get an happen one week, one night we were out drinking and uh, all of a sudden we couldn't leave the mall cause somebody got shot. This is fucking unbelievable. Stand within a stone stove. We have a stone store, no pun intended, a cold stone creamers. That's not supposed to happen, isn't it? When you, you know, when you see a fid Rutgers, right. I just don't, I just don't associate that with violence. But anyways, I had a great week out there and I want to thank all the guys over at a DV for hooking me up and everybody who came out to see me, I'm also once again to remind you, I have a one hour special coming out on comedy central August 23rd. All right. Set your Tivo six weeks ahead. For some reason, my fucking CD comes out before the special, which makes no sense to me, but I believe that's in stores on August 5th.

Speaker 5:          00:39:56       And then the DVD DVD comes out I think September 14th. I know, it's bizarre. You guys are going to be sick of me by mid September, but anyways, please check it out. I'm really proud of this special we shot at ourselves. Uh, tell your friends to watch it and uh, whatever. Hopefully they become fans of what I do and then they show up at my shows and someday I can afford to take a private jet, or at the very least set up in first class where I can afford those Bose headset where I can drown out people if they fucking, uh, uh, laughing about shit. That isn't funny. All right, let's get on with the podcast questions. If you new to my podcast, this is what I do every week. I babble. I bitch about people in airports. I answer questions. I riff about the Dave Matthews band and I hide my shit.

Speaker 5:          00:40:45       I'm, no, I don't, I don't riff about the Dave Matthews Fan. I don't even know any of these fucking songs. I just know, uh, I know crash into you. Yeah, they, they, um, and then I come into you, he really is like disgusting lyrics when you really think about it, but he thinks he thinks of nicely. I don't like that little James Brown fucking Jig. He does either. When he's sitting in with his Acoustic Guitar, I never really noticed how much I didn't like that, man. You know what? I'm going to have to think about this. I'm going to get back if you have to get back to you guys on this one. Listening. I'm stuttering. I'm so fucking annoyed from that flight. Maybe I'm really just pissed at the people on the plane and uh, I'm taking it out of the Dave Matthews band. Misdirected anger. All right, let's get into the questions here.

Speaker 5:          00:41:32       People. I got to make this one a quick one cause I got a bunch of bull shit I gotta do today and one of them is the fix my attitude. All right, question number one, Bill. Um, I have a question for you podcast. Why don't you just ask it? Okay. That's like, people go, let me tell you something. He said, he's just fucking saying it. I said, I think I do that. All right. I have a question for you. Podcast. Being a comic from New York City, which coast do you think is best for stand up comedy? First of all, I am not a comic from New York City. I'm a comic from Boston, Massachusetts who then moved to New York City. I'm okay. Uh, I will. What's the question? Which coast do I think is best for standup comedy? Uh, Christ. I don't know. I ain't go, how's that for fucking a bad answer?

Speaker 5:          00:42:19       Um, New York City, if you just want to become a great comic, there's nothing better than New York City. It's gotten like 9 million clubs. He can do like 10 sets a night. If you want. Not 10, you could do 10. But I think realistically you do seven or eight. Once you ran with all the clubs, at least you could back in the day. Just keep digressing with everything I'm saying. So I would say New York was great. And then there's other, other cities that are good to start out in, which is, uh, Boston was great. Houston's always have a good scene. Denver, San Francisco, Seattle's bunch of funny guys there. Minnesota's got a great scene. Um, yeah. You know what I mean? I worked in Atlanta. I don't know if you funny, just get your shit together, but I guess you're asking me should you move to New York City or la?

Speaker 5:          00:43:05       Um, you, I would visit both places before you went out there because, uh, I don't know, New York City just felt like home when I went there and when I went to La, you know, the weather was great and everything was cool, but it was a, you know, I stood in line for fucking nine hours to do a, a to sign up for a three minute spot at the laugh factory and he had a fucking sunburn. I got there at nine in the morning for a sign up that was at six at night. This is no bullshit, right. Sat right there on sunset avenue. They take you guys down, memory lane, some sitting there and uh, I just remember there was these two fat chicks and fucking Utah, something that had really bad tattoos. I was third in line by nine in the morning. That's all I remember.

Speaker 5:          00:43:52       And uh, yeah, I, and then I wasn't down there with anybody else, so I couldn't leave other than quickly to go take a bathroom break. Like there was literally a whole system. It was a fucking nightmare. Right. Ended up getting a sunburn right on my huge forehead and uh, went home after I signed up, it's six, went back to the kids, a problem where I was staying, showered really quickly, came back down and had to do three minutes of stand up, which is practically impossible. You know what I mean? That's like trying to finish a bowl of cereal and like two scoops, you know. So I went down there and I don't know how the fuck I did it, but I went on stage and I absolutely fucking destroyed for three minutes. I did a tight three minutes set that had a beginning, a middle and an end probably cause I only had like a half hour of material.

Speaker 5:          00:44:42       I knew I figured out how to do it. So I'm sitting there going like, Oh man, I got off stage. I was like, that's it. I'm in at this club. I'm going to get a manager. This is, you know, everything's going to happen. And then I went upstairs and uh, I met the infamous Jamie Masada who calls everybody body. So I'm sitting there and he had his table and I sit down at his table. I'm thinking, this guy is just going to kiss my ass. You know, I'm some young buck. I went up there fucking destroyed. I was better than, you know, the two fat chicks from Utah. This is it. It's over, right? So I sit down, you know, my ego's through the fucking roof and he's just like, I don't mean he set this stared at me for a second. He had his hands together like not in a fist, but sort of like a, he's doing the church and the steeple thing set.

Speaker 5:          00:45:31       All these things are up and he had his index fingers up on his mouth and he just goes, you're very funny. And I was like, oh, thank you very much. I'm like, okay, here comes sit, comes here comes, he's going to have to manage me. Right? And he's like, uh, you know, you, you, you talk, you talk a lot about [inaudible] about your father. Yeah. I go, yeah, yeah. You, and he said, you should do more. You should do mono, buts, do modal Butts, your father. And I'm like, Oh yeah, yeah. You know, I, I got a ton of stuff about my dad. I got some more stuff about my mom. And as I'm saying that, he holds my, his hand up to silence me, at which point I literally shut the fuck up and he just goes, you'll father, let me ask you a question. How does it make you feel when your father yells?

Speaker 5:          00:46:20       And then he leaned back in his chair, right? And it was like, I felt like he was gonna give me the answer. So all my standup questions in the form of a riddle, and immediately I, I began grabbing the legs on the back of the chair because I was going to smash it over his fucking head because I was so fucked. I was so pissed. I was like, you gotta be, I just fucking killed for three minutes and now you're going to act like you're this standup Guru, you Jack Ass. And that's exactly what he did. He didn't ask to manage me.

Speaker 5:          00:46:56       He just gave me a little, how does it make you feel when your dad yells, Jamie, I hope you listen to this cause I'm playing you club this week. How do you think it made me feel? Made me feel like, let me feel sad. Is that what you wanted to hear? Jesus Christ. This guy came at me like one of those guys. You ever see those interviews when they interview somebody after like a tornado hit their house and killed their favorite dog, you know, and they sitting there interviewing them and they want them to cry and then not clients. And then they gotta ask. They gotta sit there and ask them questions to try and make them fucking cry. I think that's what he was trying to do to me. So I literally was grabbing the back of the chair, the legs on the back. I distinctly remember doing that and I was like, fuck this guy.

Speaker 5:          00:47:38       Fuck La. I'm going to New York. That's how I ended up in New York. One three minutes set after nine hours in a second degree, sunburn on my forehead. I decided that the east coast was the place I needed to be. You know what I mean? And a, you know, I worked out well for me. You know what? You know it's funny. Somebody who's probably gonna fucking tell Jamie than I actually said that shit just so they can try and get a three minute audition on Tuesdays. So this week when I go down there, Jamie's going to be like, buddy Bobby, what do you, what are you doing buddy? I actually love Jamie now man. And I'm not kissing his ass either cause I don't give a fuck. But he said the funniest shit to me the like three weeks ago I'm working as club and I'm standing in the lobby and these two gorgeous girls, you know la to fucking gorgeous. So I'm looking at him, you know, I'm bugging out of my head and Jamie's like, buddy, buddy, buddy. Well what are you doing man? What do you, what? What do you like? What do you mind? I go, what do you mean? What am I doing? My Go, I'm looking at the girls. He goes, yeah buddy, but what? Why? Why are you looking at the girls? I go, cause they're beautiful. I go, why wouldn't I be looking at the girls? And he goes, cause you're a fag.

Speaker 5:          00:48:52       I think I butchered that. He said it even better. It was the fucking, he said he totally set me up, son of a bitch. And if you live in La, I'm going to be down there Tuesday night, Thursday night, Friday night and Saturday night, all on the 10 o'clock show and I'll be having a good time down there. All right. So there you go. See that? I Trust Jamie. Then I tell a funny story where he trashes me and then I hype his club and then it's all good. Huh? Who the fuck's in show business? I am. I know how to do it. I know how to escape the fucking line. All right, so that's what I would do, son. I would, I would go to New York and La and figure out which one you want to be in. All right. That's it. All right. Question number three. Have you ever had any thoughts about doing a European tour of your show?

Speaker 5:          00:49:35       Absolutely. I feel that I'm in conspiracy theory. I feel like they're crashing the dollar and all these corporations, they're all going global, so I'm going global with them. I'm not going to be caught flat footed with a pocket full of currency that isn't worth the Goddamn peso. So I'm actually setting up a European tour for the beginning part of next year, or at some point in 2009, I should say I'm going to go over to England, Sweden. Uh, I did some shit one time in, uh, the Netherlands. It's really disappointing when I went to no Netherlands when I got off the plane and the first thing I saw was like a fucking Dunkin donuts, you know what I mean? And like a McDonald's, it just, it just really is a, I understand why people find America so annoying is because the urban sprawl of our fucking corporations, you know what I mean? I literally think that I could to like fucking Ah, let me pick a movie. Pick a fucking nice obscure country that I don't even know where it is on a map. Let me think of something.

Speaker 5:          00:50:38       Bosnia. No, I know why that's fucking eastern Europe, Olivia and it was one of those blah blah. That's in South America. Whatever you go to fucking Bolivia. You think going to go down there and see that fucking that guy from the tee shirt that everybody wears che go viral, Gutierrez, whatever his name is. Balance Way Ala that fucking guy. And you'd go down and he'd get off the list. The first thing you see Carl Sanders on a big bucket of fucking chicken. I think that's what you go chop is his big fucking, I love that guy, man. That guy is the shit. You know what I mean? Those guys, they remind me like Tony Montana, that's what you go. Chavez is stupid Chavez taken on the u s knowing full well that we could fucking Newcomb anytime we wanted to talk and shit about us at the UN.

Speaker 5:          00:51:24       He's like in his early Tony Montana years, you know, um, for Jesus Christ is on annoying. Even as early Tony Montana years, like right before he a, he gets the, uh, the Cadillac with the leopard skin. You know what I mean? When he's still washing dishes with that, that fucking Robin Williams Hawaiian shirt. That's what Hugo Chavez is right now. All right, question number four. This is very, a little jet lag here. People, sorry, let me fucking blow through these and they'll stop wasting your time. All right, question. I'm a for a, Oh God. This one has a backstory. Yesterday I attempted to renew my Norton Antivirus. I'm like, I want me to sing a song about Microsoft. I can't, I can't remix this songs, dude. Unless they have a song. You know what I mean? You gotta, you gotta, you gotta pick one. You gotta pick a product that annoys you, that actually has a song, and I will do a fucking puff daddy remix of it that has the word continent and it'll make you feel better.

Speaker 5:          00:52:19       All right? All right, question number five. Hey Bill, here's a question. Have you ever had people bring their kids to your shows? And I'm not talking 18 years old. I mean like five years old. Absolutely. I've had people bring babies and I've been in the middle of talking about something really, uh, I don't know evil talking about going to a titty bar and now I hate that, you know, regular girls go to titty bars now, you know, cause they killed the perverted vibe of the club. I was doing that bit talking about how strip clubs are for horizontally and then I can feel comfortable leering at a stripper when I'm sitting next to Melissa, you know, doing that joke and all of a sudden you just hear this baby babies that's crying in the back and then it, you know, something, it's even more awkward when they bring a kid that can speak, you know, why don't I just say a five, five years old or over rather than having you guys picture mutes or something.

Speaker 5:          00:53:17       Yeah. I've actually, I've had people bring kids, I'm trying to think and hasn't happened in a while. There was a girl this week in Pittsburgh. She laughed like a little kid, so it was weird. She sounded like a little kid, so it was freaking all the comics out. And then it turned out she wasn't a little kid. She was just an adult with a really annoying voice. And then she came up to me afterwards and she had these huge titties and she was saying, come on down to plush, which is some strip club in Pittsburgh. And she had that classic, a Anna Nicole Smith. I'm going to overdose in a hard rock cafe voice. So if she's listening, I hope you're still alive.

Speaker 5:          00:54:01       He didn't. Oh d that I had to tell you that story. I played the same hard rock cafe, the fucking in and Nicole Smith died in and I gotta tell you something that's been there for three fucking days. I get it. I think she killed herself. I don't think it was an overdose. I think you know an accidental, I think she did it on purpose because a, that place sucks. All right, question number seven, Bill. I recently went to an open mic at my local comedy club the first time just to watch the club, just to watch Jesus Christ. Nobody puts capital letters anymore or punctuation. I just went right to the next sentence. Bill. I recently went to open mic night and my local comedy club for the first time just to watch the club only has open mic night once a month, which is gay, but I can't do anything about it anyway.

Speaker 5:          00:54:49       I figure most of the, most of the comments that got up with suck and bomb, maybe a few would do okay. But there were about 14 and 13 of them ended up doing really well. This was discouraging to me because I figured most open micros would suck, which would make me feel better about myself and my comedy. Comedy. Is this how open Mike was for you? Please share your wisdom with me. Alright. I'll show you my stories. Wisdoms going a little too far. Yeah, that's what it's like. You go down there and there's people who are still doing open mics, but they're, they're better than being open micros at that point. Um, but they still need the stage time and uh, you know, sometimes you know, features and sometimes even a headline on my drop and that's Kinda how it is. And uh, yeah, your first few open Mike.

Speaker 5:          00:55:35       So lonely, but uh, you just got to see the humor and it just go up there the first time you do it. It's not even about doing well whether it, you don't judge it whether you did good or bad. The first time you go on stage is just all about having the balls to go up there when they call your name, you know, and if you have the balls to go up there, then you know, you got more balls than 95% of people in that situation. So just take that as a victory tape. You said keep it, you know, lock it away in a safe and then some day when you're good at it, you can take it out and just laugh your ass off at the shit that you, that the, the shit that you attempted. I wish I'd take my first one. I did.

Speaker 5:          00:56:18       I mean just to give you, to make you feel better. I was supposed to do five minutes. I think I did about three. I walked up there and the second I saw the microphone, I forgot everything I was going to say. And I started in the middle of the shift that I wanted to say and then brought it back around to the front kind of, I followed the same pattern of pulp fiction. You know what I mean? Well, they start with that. Oh you mother fuckers get on the ground on that bullshit. And then he goes to the beginning and then fucking, you end up seeing that scene. Oh, like Goodfellas. Same fucking thing. That's how I, that's how my first stand up set went. Except unlike those awesome movies. Mine was terrible. So just picture, if they was that the happening, if m m night Shambhala Ama Dingdong made that fucking movie, the way they made pulp fiction that, you know, that's the way my friend, I'm trying to tell you, my first set sucks, so don't worry about it.

Speaker 5:          00:57:11       Don't worry about it. Just go up there and this. I get it. You got to find the humor and bombing. There's nothing funny than bombing. It's fucking hilarious. It's just something undeniably funny about standing in front of a room full of people and just putting it out there. Especially if you're high energy and you and your joke fucking bad at bat and everybody's just fucking staring at you this. Yeah. You just, just, there's no other way to describe what a fucking tool you feel like, but everybody's been there, you know, bring some water up there. You're going to get dry mouth. All right. And just, just do it, man. It's, you know, you'll be fine. You'll be fine. Fuck it. Alright, last question. All right. Yes. It's actually a story, um, which I actually find really interesting. Kay. Hey Bill. And on, what the fuck happened?

Speaker 5:          00:58:00       My email last week, a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. All right, here we go. Okay. A lot of damage related. This is a real fucking long one. Let me try to get to the meat of this thing. Um, okay. This is an auto damage related story. All right. I must preface this story with the fact that I find it very difficult to contain my temper already. I like this story with even I really difficult to contain my temper with even the most meaningless shit, such as stubbing my toe or getting cut off while driving. Anyways, uh, when something of actual meaning happens to me having something of mine stolen, let's say I really lose my shit. All right. A few months ago I had an expensive set of knives missing from my kitchen and I flew into a rage through deductive reasoning. I concluded it must've been stolen by one of two people.

Speaker 5:          00:58:53       Now listen to the descriptions. You can guess where this story's going. Uh, it was either a, the sketchy Jewish kid who lived upstairs, or B, the Mexican repairment who still had a, had a key since I just moved in. Well, the reasoning part of my tamper tantrum was taking place. A few racial slurs may have slipped out and as one made to Deuce, a temper tantrum is often accompanied by loud screaming, oh, that's great. They're okay. The screaming is most often followed by regret, usually concluding with embarrassment. Anyhow, the following day I went out to my car, which was parked out front to gather some belongings in the trunk. When I got to my car, I noticed that some thoughtful neighbor who obviously heard my screaming the day before notched a large swastika in the center rear of my car.

Speaker 5:          00:59:54       After a few moments of careful contemplation, I left and decided to keep it there for shameful posterity. This swastika remains as a painful reminder for me to get a handle on my anger. The steak knives were never found. All right. You know what, I find that fucking really to be an interesting story because the guy actually, he seems like, you know, he's trying to improve himself as a person. You know, he knows he has a temper and he knows what he did was wrong. And uh, I would, this is a question I have for you guys. If somebody flies in cause you know, they're, they always say that, you know, I dunno like your, your real thoughts come out in anger. I don't know if I like 100 a hundred percent believe that. I think when you get angry sometimes it isn't like you have this deep seated hate.

Speaker 5:          01:00:46       Sometimes it just, it just trying to hurt the other person. You know, like they get mad at some you fucking cock sucker. I mean, do you really think that they're out there sucking dick? You know what I mean? But then he got the other side is all of a sudden when somebody goes into the, in the actually, you know, racial slurs that's like above and beyond. I don't know. I don't, I dunno about that one dude. I, that's what I'm asking is, you know, like if somebody, if somebody gets mad at me, yeah, you fucking Dick. Like, I don't think that they really think I'm a dick. I think that they're mad at me and they called me a dick. Now there's, does anybody think that it's possible? Because this guy seemed like good dude, he left this, wants to go on it. He realized, all right, I'm a fucking ass on. I gotta you know, keep my temper in check. Does anybody think, is it possible? That's what I want to know to lose your shit. And you start yelling racial slurs and you still stick it in the same category of like, I was just mad. It's he just calling, just calling, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:01:52       I Dunno. I don't fucking know work. You know what, be thankful. You're not famous. You know what I mean? You would ended up like a Kramer. You wouldn't have to go on a, actually, you wouldn't have gone on Al Sharpton show you where I had to go on. Uh, Jesus Christ, who's a Jewish guy with a bad perm to a Mexican guy with a bad perm. You know how shocked would do a lot more for his credibility if you would really get rid of that pimp haircut. You know what I mean? I always felt he looked like boss hog. Like if, if they ever did like the black boss Hog, you know what I mean? Need all that. So that's like the hacky thing to do in Hollywood. Like once you write it, ideas, you just take, you know, a sitcom like it's Alice, but it's black.

Speaker 5:          01:02:36       And then it'll was, I didn't know what the fuck I'm talking about this point. Anyways, I got shit to do here. Okay. There's a long ass podcast as always a once again thanks to everybody came out to my show in Pittsburgh, man. It's fucking unbelievable.
