&gt;&gt; Well, I think I don't believe in superpowers,
to be honest.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.469
But I think India has the soft power to contribute
globally and for

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.869
example, there are lot of innovations coming
out of India.

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.490
And if it succeeded in India, it will probably
succeed in most parts of

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.949
the developing word.
So in a way, a lot of solutions are coming

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.449
out of India and that could
be the base for India's soft superpower status.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:32.200
Thank you.
