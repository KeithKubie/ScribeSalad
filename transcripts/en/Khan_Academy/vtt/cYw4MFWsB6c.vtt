00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.374
Let's say we have the simplest

00:00:02.374 --> 00:00:03.769
of arithmetic sequences

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:05.436
and probably the simplest of sequences

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:06.667
one, two...

00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:07.773
we're going to start at one

00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:08.660
and just increment by one

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.659
one, two, three

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:13.643
and we're going to go all the way to n

00:00:13.643 --> 00:00:14.905
And what I want to think about is

00:00:14.905 --> 00:00:17.907
what is the sum of this sequence going to be?

00:00:17.907 --> 00:00:20.249
And the sum of a sequence, we already know

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:21.842
we call a series

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:23.433
so what is the sum

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:25.075
and I will just call it Sn

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:26.436
what is this going to be equal to

00:00:26.436 --> 00:00:30.905
one plus two plus three plus

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:34.909
going all the way to n

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.041
well, we're going to do a neat little trick here

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:38.661
where I'm going to rewrite this sum

00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:42.799
so I will write it again as Sn

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:44.436
but now I'm just going to write it in reverse order

00:00:44.436 --> 00:00:47.910
I'm going to write it as n plus n minus one

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.107
plus n minus two

00:00:51.107 --> 00:00:53.904
all the way to one

00:00:53.904 --> 00:00:56.572
and now I'm going to add these two equations

00:00:56.572 --> 00:00:58.409
So we know that Sn is equal to this

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.506
so we are adding the same thing to both sides of this equation up here

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:05.902
So on the left hand side we're going to have Sn plus Sn

00:01:05.902 --> 00:01:08.441
is just two times Sn

00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:10.036
and on the right hand side

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.835
and this is where we start to see something kind of cool

00:01:12.835 --> 00:01:15.916
you have a one plus an n

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:18.769
which is just going to be n plus one

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:22.501
you have a two plus n minus one

00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:25.332
which is... well two plus n minus one

00:01:25.332 --> 00:01:27.108
is going to be n plus one again

00:01:27.108 --> 00:01:29.913
plus n plus one

00:01:29.913 --> 00:01:32.976
you have a three plus n minus two

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:36.706
well that's going to be n plus one again

00:01:36.706 --> 00:01:38.437
I think you see what is going on here

00:01:38.437 --> 00:01:42.990
And we're going to go all the way to this last pair

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.664
I guess you could say, or call it these last two terms

00:01:47.664 --> 00:01:50.970
and we have an n plus one again

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.580
plus n plus one

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.168
So how many of these n plus one's do we have?

00:01:56.168 --> 00:01:57.700
well we have n of them

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.836
there were n of these terms in each of these equations

00:02:00.836 --> 00:02:03.077
one two three... all the way to n

00:02:03.077 --> 00:02:06.909
So, we can rewrite this thing as two times Sn

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.577
is equal to, and you have n (n+1) terms

00:02:10.577 --> 00:02:14.642
so we could write it as n times n plus one

00:02:14.642 --> 00:02:17.702
n times n plus one

00:02:17.702 --> 00:02:21.991
and now to solve for Sn to solve for our sum

00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:26.835
we can just divide both sides by two

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:31.640
And so we are going to be left with the sum from one to n

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.582
this arithmetic sequence where we're just incrementing by one

00:02:34.582 --> 00:02:41.416
starting at one, is going to be equal to n times n plus one over two

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:45.993
And this is neat because now you can quickly find the sum

00:02:45.993 --> 00:02:47.747
let's say from one to a hundred

00:02:47.747 --> 00:02:51.769
it will be 100 times 101 over 2

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.903
So very quickly you can find these sums

00:02:53.903 --> 00:02:56.835
And what I'm curious about and what we will explore in the next video

00:02:56.835 --> 00:02:59.768
is can we generalize this for any arithmetic sequence

00:02:59.768 --> 00:03:01.299
we started with a very simple one

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.749
we started at one, we just incremented by one

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.799
And it looks like

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.170
so if I were to write it this way

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.969
this is n times (n + 1) over 2

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.709
So this right over here, this n

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.102
this is the nth term in our sequence

00:03:20.102 --> 00:03:21.768
and this right over here, this one

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:23.836
was the first term in our sequence

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.769
So at least in this case it looks like I took the average

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.168
of the first term and the nth term

00:03:29.168 --> 00:03:31.769
so this right over here

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.911
this is the average

00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:39.502
this right over here is the average

00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:42.909
of a1 and an

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.663
and then I'm multiplying that times n

00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:48.041
and what I'm curious about is whether this is going to be true

00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:49.325
for any arithmetic sequence

00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:51.659
that the sum of it is going to be the average of the first

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.659
and the last term times the number of terms
