00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer happens to be the square foot costs $30,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but there is a constant cost added of $2000.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you plug this in, you'll find, for example, that 1700 times 30 gives $51,000,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but if you add the $2000, you'll correctly get $53,000.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Do it again with 2100 square feet over here multiplied by $30, add your $2000.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You get $65,000 and so on.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, again, arriving at those numbers is nontrivial.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I wouldn't be surprised if you weren't able to complete this exercise.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But if you did, you're quite amazing, because that is the relationship between the price

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and the size in my example.
