00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.469
As much as I hate to say it,

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.771
we are not done talking
about Big Publishing.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.940
They're the ones responsible
for getting second graders

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.644
hooked on Popper-fueled
bestiality orgies.

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:12.946
Shame on you,
 Mr. Popper's Penguins.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:15.883
Now, the bookistas have aimed
their sharpest pencils

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:18.619
at one of our great
conservative thought warriors,

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.355
former Breitbart senior editor,
Milo Yiannopoulos.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.190
Now, if you don't know Milo,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.792
you clearly haven't been living
under the correct rock.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.194
(laughter)

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:29.429
He's the alt-right's
premier agent provocateur,

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.431
who effortlessly
triggers liberals

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.800
with un-PC comments like these.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:52.052
I know what you're thinking.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:55.255
"I gotta hear more 
from that guy."

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.125
And bigwig publisher
Simon &amp; Schuster agreed,

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:00.360
giving Milo
a six-figure book deal

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.429
shortly after Trump was elected.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.765
Now, a few months later,
those literary cuck-teases

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:06.366
killed Milo's book deal.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.502
Why? Left-wing media bias.

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:09.770
Take a look.

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:36.430
Yeah. Milo is the same
as Amy and Lena.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.699
Between the three of them,
they have an Emmy,

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:41.368
a Golden Globe
and a lifetime Twitter ban

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:43.437
for racistly trolling
Leslie Jones.

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.006
Exactly the same.

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:48.375
But Milo will not be silenced.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.410
Like the free-speech
crusader he is,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.646
Milo is suing
those book-loving bastards

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:54.614
for $10 million.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.116
But here's what just dropped.

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.851
Simon &amp; Schuster's
public court filings,

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:00.253
which include Milo's
original manuscript

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:02.356
with the editor's notes.

00:02:02.356 --> 00:02:05.792
Last week those notes hit
the Internet, and they are...

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.462
mildly unflattering.

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:09.997
(laughter)

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:12.633
But now, snowflakes and SJ-dubs

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:14.601
are having a field day
on social media,

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.770
celebrating like Whole Foods
is having a clearance sale

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.705
on matcha tea.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:22.042
Here to talk more about Milo's
persecution by the left

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:24.778
are citizen journalists
Josh Sharp and Aaron Jackson.

00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:27.014
-Thank you, guys. Thank you
for coming. -Thank you.

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:28.448
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Jordan.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:31.118
-(cheering-, applause) -The libs
are soaking their panties

00:02:31.118 --> 00:02:33.854
over this editor's shady notes,
but the truth is,

00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:37.124
giving Milo an editor
in the first place was fascist.

00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:39.192
Yeah. He's a freethinker.

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:42.329
He shouldn't be bound
to totalitarian publishing ideas

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.365
like common decency
or basic book structure.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.868
Yeah. Aaron and I have
never used an editor.

00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:50.570
We just quickly write down
what we want to say,

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.139
feed it into the teleprompter,

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.107
and then say back
whatever is ribbon on here.

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:58.045
Yeah. That's what FreeSpeak
is all a-pouch.

00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:00.814
Heh. I puddin'
agree moron, guys.

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:03.483
Yeah. And while the soy boys
on social media

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:06.019
are going gaga
with this editor's "takedown,"

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.222
the truth is that a lot of
these notes are pretty standard

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:10.924
in the mainstream
publishing industry.

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:12.993
So let's go through some
of these notes

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:14.694
-Milo got from his editor.
-Yeah.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.329
(both clearing throats)

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.598
Okay, here's the first one.

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:24.438
-Hmm.
-That's a totally standard note.

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:27.541
The editor on Little Women 
said the same thing.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:30.243
The character of Beth
was originally in blackface

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:32.012
-for the whole book.
-Yeah.

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:33.947
Or how about, uh, this note.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.018
Okay, everybody gets this one.

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:40.387
It was one of the early notes
on Animal Farm.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.689
It's actually why Orwell decided
to make them animals.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.492
-Mm-hmm. -The first draft was
just about Nazis on a farm,

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:47.861
-and it was called Nazi Farm.
 -Yeah.

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:50.564
Some more editorial feedback
Milo got when he wrote

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:52.165
about Pizza-Gate.

00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:01.241
(laughter)

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.677
You know who got this note
all the time?

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:05.212
Dr. Seuss.

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:07.114
(laughter)

00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:09.549
Here's an early 
 Cat in the Hat draft.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.592
(laughter)

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.093
-I love that.
-Mm-hmm.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.728
-And it's great for kids.
-Yeah.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:23.964
Okay, now,
Milo got lots more notes,

00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:25.432
but, again,
they're all standard.

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.868
-Stuff like...
-Standard note.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.036
Standard note.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.508
A classic.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:41.815
-Hello! That is so (bleep)
standard. -Yeah.

00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:44.885
I know I ask you guys this
all the time,

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:48.488
but when is the time and place
for a black dick joke?

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:51.024
Now that the book is canceled,
we'll never know.

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:52.893
Oh, God. Injustice, right?

00:04:52.893 --> 00:04:54.694
I can't believe they pulled this
book just because

00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:56.930
he made some pithy observations
about women,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.565
Muslims, trans people,
black people,

00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:00.433
fat people, gay people,
people with disab...

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.335
Oh, no, no, no. Jordan, no.
The book got pulled

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:04.004
because Milo made some rather
provocative comments

00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:05.472
-about pedophilia.
-Yeah.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.574
All that hate speechy stuff
is the reason

00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:09.576
he got the book deal
in the first place.

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:12.145
Yeah. So you can cool it with
your woke Twitter parades

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.548
about the Simon &amp; Schuster
clapback, libs,

00:05:14.548 --> 00:05:16.449
because these notes
were not written

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.752
-by some heroic social justice
warrior. -No.

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:20.854
They were written by a
professional editor

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:23.990
who was part of a team willing
to pay Milo gobs of money

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.793
for his ideas,
so that Simon &amp; Schuster

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:29.863
would make gobs and gobs of
money off of Milo's ideas.

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:32.432
Gobs and gobs, Jordan.

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:34.367
All right, Jordan,
we have to go.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.770
We're off to read the racy
unedited version

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.838
-of Hop On Pop to some kids.
-Yeah.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:41.074
And, yes, Jordan,
it's about exactly

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:42.442
-what you think it is.
-Uh-huh.
