00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] Now let's go back to the things that we need to operate a network.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We need a way to encode and interpret messages.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We saw that we can encode any message we want in bits,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and then we can encode the bits on the wire.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
How that encoding actually works is pretty complicated.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's not something we're going to talk about in this class,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but there are lots of different ways to do it, but we're figuring out ways for each 0 and 1

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to encode that as something that we send along a wire or it could be wireless.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What we haven't talked about, which we are going to talk about soon,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is what these high-level messages are.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We need ways to send messages that can be interpreted and understood at the other side,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and so what we'll talk about next is how that works on the internet.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
As far as the way to route messages for the internet,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
all of the routers along that path--well, a message comes in; it has a destination.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The routers have to figure out next destination to go to,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and that's also quite a challenging problem.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's something we're not going to get into more detail in this class,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but you can imagine different ways you might do this.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
A router might have a table that says, "Well, if you're in California

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and you want to send a message to Boston you should first send it to Nevada

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
because that's going in the right direction."

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That's not quite the way things work because

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we saw that there was actually just 1 message.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
That really what you want to do is send it to San Jose

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
where we've got a big strong pipe that goes all the way to Boston.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Finally, you need ways to decide who gets resources,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and on our Greek network we assume that the general could decide.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The internet is much more of a wild West than that.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
In the internet there aren't any real rules for who gets resources.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Everywhere along the network gets to decide on its own how to do that,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and what we really got on the internet is just what we call best effort service.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If you're message needs to go over the same link as some other message,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the router can only send 1 message at a time.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It's up to the router to decide what to do.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
There are different policies that differ routers follow.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
There's no general rule that is enforced on the whole internet,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and this means that sometimes your packet might just get dropped.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
There's no guaranty when you send a message on the internet that it actually gets to where you want it to.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We're not going to talk more about these 2 in this class.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I will encourage you to take a future networking class that will get into those details.

00:02:08.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We are going to talk a little bit about how the messages work for the web.
