00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.810
I’m going to try and make it through an
episode about lightning without making a single

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.819
electricity pun.

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.410
I know, shocking.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.000
Welp, I tried.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.650
Hey there, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.080
Odds are at some point in your life you’ve
seen a thunderstorm but you’ve probably

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.730
never taken part in one.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.760
The chances of being hit by lightning in the
US in a given year are about 1 in a million,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.360
so unless you’re one of the few who has
been singled out by Zeus, you’ll never know

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.279
what it’s like to have a stormcloud personally
bully you.

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.700
Lucky for you, I can tell you all about it,
in agonizing detail.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.700
Now of course on DNews we've talked about lightening in past in the past

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.100
and how it works but to jolt your memory I'll just re-explain that

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.920
The conventional wisdom on lightning is it’s
caused when a static charge builds up in a

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.920
cloud.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.850
It’s still debated how exactly, but the
simplest explanation is ice descending from

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.730
the top of the cloud strips electrons from
water droplets ascending from the bottom,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.840
and after a while there’s a massive negative
charge at the base.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.710
The negati ve charge is so strong it actually
repels electrons on earth, pushing them down

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.280
into the ground, and the surface of the earth
becomes positively charged.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.930
Like teenage lovebirds, opposites attract,
and eventually the air, which serves as the

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.230
stern parents in this analogy, can’t keep
the charges apart.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.980
They overcome the insulative properties of
the air, and a stream of electrons shoots

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.150
down to the ground and sparks fly.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.800
Isn’t science romantic?

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.210
But if someone’s in the middle, they’re
going to get hurt.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.659
Delivering up to a billion volts and billions
of watts, a bolt of lightning can be fatal,

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.649
and 10 percent of the time it is.

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.329
There are a few different ways a jolt from
the heavens can finish you off.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.070
A number of your bodily systems rely on an
electrical rhythm, and a zap from God’s

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.320
shock collar can throw those out of whack.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.430
One of the leading causes of death is cardiac
arrest, though respiratory arrest and seizures

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.890
aren’t uncommon either.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.689
Even if your brain doesn’t misfire, it can
still be cooked by the intense heat of the

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:44.689
bolt.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.780
If you’re not killed, that same heat will
probably leave third degree burns at the points

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.149
the lightning entered and exited your body.

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.939
It could set your hair and clothes on fire.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.180
And any metal you’re wearing like necklaces
or belt buckles will also become superheated,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.430
leaving burns.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.840
Lightning also heats the air around you, up
to 20,000 degrees celsius, or over three times

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.109
hotter than the surface of the sun.

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.549
That rapid heating causes the air to expand.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.290
If you’re farther away, you would hear it
as a sound wave, aka a crack of thunder.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.990
But if you’re standing in the middle of
it, that expansion is actually a shock wave.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.290
It can send you flying, burst your eardrums,
tear your clothes to shreds, and literally

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.510
knock your shoes off.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.470
Yes, apparently being struck by lightning
is excruciatingly painful with a touch of

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.990
slapstick comedy.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.390
Effects of being struck by lightning can linger
long after the storm has passed, and unless

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.020
you’re Tony Cicoria, who got a bolt to the
face and became a piano virtuoso, usually

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.300
they’re not superpowers.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.380
Chronic pain, headaches, personality change,
difficulty concentrating, and muscle twitches

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.130
are just a few of the long term effects reported
by lightning strike victims.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.980
Not to mention the physical scars, which in
the case of Lichtenberg figures, actually

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.060
resemble lightning itself.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.550
On the plus side, that’s about a million
times more badass than getting a barbed wire

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.550
tattoo.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.230
But did you know that lightning can also happen
INSIDE A VOLCANO?

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:16.700
We have more about how lightning forms and
how the heck this volcano lightning happens

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.700
here.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.890
Statistically one of you watching has been
struck by lightning.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.879
If you have or know someone who has, tell
us about it!
