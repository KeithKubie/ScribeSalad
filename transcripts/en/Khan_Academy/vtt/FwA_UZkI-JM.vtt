00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.920
So we're in the home stretch.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.850
Let's see if part C is true, and
I'm running out of real estate.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.610
So let me copy and
paste it actually.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.290
Actually, maybe I could do
it over here to the left.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.390
I had some doodles here.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.060
Let me clear those out.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.620
So let's see if we can do
it over here to the left.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.750
Part C. So we have
this determinant,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.420
and it's claiming
that it equals 0,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.930
so we have to see
if that's true.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.263
And so we can actually try
to multiply these out and see

00:00:27.263 --> 00:00:30.690
if anything interesting happens,
but we could even better

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.759
leverage some of the
algebra that we've already

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:43.040
done for part A. In part A, we
figured out that z minus z1 is

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.220
equal to t times z2 minus z1.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.750
So this thing right
over here, this

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.779
is the same thing as
t times z2 minus z1,

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:58.320
and the reason why
that's interesting

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.520
is I have a z1 minus
z1 here, so I'm

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.400
starting to have similar things.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.560
And then this thing
over here-- so

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.140
if I take the conjugate of each
of these, the conjugate of z

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.730
minus the conjugate
of z1, this is

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.920
going to be equal to t
times the conjugate of z2

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.350
minus the conjugate of z1.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.430
And I know that
because when I do this,

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.830
I'm swapping all of the
signs on the imaginary parts

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.182
of the complex numbers.

00:01:26.182 --> 00:01:28.390
So if you were to go through
this entire process just

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.300
swapping the imaginary
parts of the complex number,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.230
the end result would have
it's imaginary parts swapped,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.150
and that's exactly
what we have over here.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.880
We have the imaginary
parts swapped over here.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.310
So if you want to work it out,
set this equal to A plus BI

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.390
or set this equal to A1 plus
B1, you can work it out,

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.070
but I think it's a pretty
intuitive idea that we're just

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.170
making all of the-- we're
just swapping the signs on all

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.300
of the imaginary parts of
each of these complex numbers.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.920
Now, with this said,
this determinant

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.840
becomes pretty simple.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.980
This becomes t
times z2 minus z1.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:13.370
This becomes t times the
conjugate of z2 minus z1.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.300
This down here is z2 minus z1.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.340
And then this over here is
the conjugate of z2 minus z1.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.760
And so what is this determinant?

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.520
It's going to be
this times this.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.440
So it's t times z2
minus z1 times z2

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.730
minus z1 times the
conjugate of those.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.840
So it's that times that
minus this times this, so

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.220
minus t z2 z1, z2 minus
z1 times the conjugate

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.880
of z2 minus the conjugate of z1.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.410
Now, this is exactly
equal to this.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.750
These things are obviously
going to cancel out,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.930
and we're clearly
going to get 0.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.870
So C is also true.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.540
So the correct answers
to this original problem

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.138
were A, C, and D.
