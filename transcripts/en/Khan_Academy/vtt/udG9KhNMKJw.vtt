00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
 

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.330
So let's start again
with a fair coin.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.060
And this time, instead of
flipping it four times,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.060
let's flip it five times.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.677
So five flips of this fair coin.

00:00:12.677 --> 00:00:14.510
And what I want to think
about in this video

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.831
is the probability of
getting exactly three heads.

00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:23.330
And the way I'm
going to think about

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.740
it is, if you have five flips,
how many different equally

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.169
likely possibilities are there?

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.460
So you're going to have the
first flip-- let me draw it

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.736
over here-- first flip.

00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:33.235
And there's two
possibilities there.

00:00:33.235 --> 00:00:34.680
It could be heads or tails.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.550
Second flip, two
possibilities there.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.080
Third flip, two possibilities.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.900
Fourth flip, two possibilities.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.590
Fifth flip, two possibilities.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.720
So it's 2 times 2 times
2 times 2 times 2.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.840
I hope I said that five times.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.750
Or you could view that as
2 to the fifth power.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.970
And that is going
to be equal to 32

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.710
equally likely possibilities.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.510
32-- 2 times 2 is 4, 4 times
2 is 8, 8 times 2 is 16,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.870
16 times 2 is 32 possibilities.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.450
And to figure out
this probability,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.575
we really just have to
figure out how many of those

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:10.780
possibilities involve
getting three heads.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.870
We could write out all
the 32 possibilities

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.386
and literally just
count the heads.

00:01:15.386 --> 00:01:17.010
But let's just use
that other technique

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.760
that we just started to
explore in that last video.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.610
We have five flips here.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.920
So let me draw the flips--
one, two, three, four, five.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.800
And we want to have
exactly three heads.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.100
And I'm going to call
those three heads-- let

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.859
me do it in pink-- heads
A, heads B, heads C,

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:40.900
just to give them a name.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.790
Although what we're going
to see later in this video

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.140
is that we don't want to
differentiate between them.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.270
To us, it makes no difference if
we get this ordering-- heads A,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.090
heads B, heads C, tails, tails.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.020
Or if we get this
ordering-- heads A,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.660
heads C, or heads
B, tails, tails.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.910
We can't count these as
two different orderings.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.474
We can only count this as one.

00:02:05.474 --> 00:02:06.890
So what we're going
to do is first

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.681
come up with all of
the different orderings

00:02:08.681 --> 00:02:11.640
if we cared about the
difference between A, B, and C.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.490
And then we're going to divide
by all of the different ways

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.530
that you can arrange
three different things.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.980
So how many ways
can we put A, B,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.900
and C into these five buckets
that we can view as the flips,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.490
if we cared about A, B, and C ?

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.110
So let's start with A.
If we haven't allocated

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.260
any of these buckets to
any of the heads yet,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.940
then we could say that A could
be in five different buckets.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.550
So there's five possibilities
where A could be.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.440
So let's just say that this
is the one that it goes in,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.390
although it could be in
any one of these five.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.692
But if this takes
up one of the five,

00:02:46.692 --> 00:02:48.400
then how many different
possibilities can

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.120
this heads sit in?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.090
How many different
possibilities are there?

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.530
Well, then there's only going
to be four buckets left.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.640
So then there's only
four possibilities.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.480
And so if this was
where heads A goes,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.500
then heads B could be in
any of the other four.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.260
If heads A was in
this first one, then

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.054
heads B could have been
in any of the four.

00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:06.470
I'll just do a
particular example.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.950
Maybe heads B shows
up right there.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.680
So once we've taken
two of the slots,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.740
how many spaces do
we have for heads C?

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.611
Well, we only have three
spaces left, then, for heads C.

00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:19.610
And so it could be in any
of these three spaces.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.200
And just to show a
particular example,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.550
it would look like that.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.900
And so if you cared about order,
how many different ways can

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.760
you, out of five
different spaces,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.160
allocate them to
three different heads?

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.750
You would say it is
5 times 4 times 3.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.410
5 times 4 is 20, times
3 is equal to 60.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.760
So you would say there
are 60 different ways

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.250
to arrange heads A, B, and C
in five buckets, or five flips,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.770
or if these were
people, in five chairs.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.762
And obviously, there
aren't 60 possibilities

00:03:55.762 --> 00:03:56.720
of getting three heads.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.920
In fact, there's only 32
equally likely possibilities.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.550
And the reason why we got
such a big number over here

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.980
is that we are counting this
scenario as being fundamentally

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:13.220
different than if this was
heads B, heads A, and then

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.310
heads C over here.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.060
And what we need to
do is say, well, these

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.351
aren't different possibilities.

00:04:18.351 --> 00:04:21.180
We don't have to
overcount for all

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.960
of the different ways
you arrange this.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.750
And so what we need
to do is divide this

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.320
by all of the
different ways that you

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.830
can arrange three things.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.060
So if I have three things
that are in three spaces.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.800
So here I have a heads in
the second flip, third flip,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.890
and fifth flip.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.360
If I have three things in
three spaces like this,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.900
how many ways can
I arrange them?

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.140
And so if I have three
spaces, how many ways can I

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.520
arrange an A, B, and C
in those three spaces?

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.150
Well, A can go
into three spaces.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.580
It can go into any of the three.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.670
 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.230
Then B would have two spaces
left, once A takes one of them.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.300
And then C would
have one space left,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.880
once A and B take two of them.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.050
So there's 3 times 2
times 1 way to arrange

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.310
three different things.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.180
So 3 times 2 times
1 is equal to 6.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.480
So the number of possibilities
of getting three heads

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.110
is actually going to be
this 5 times 4 times 3.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.310
Let me write this
down in another color.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.550
So the number of possibilities--
let's write "poss" for short--

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:47.170
is equal to this 5 times 4
times 3 over the number of ways

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.820
that I can rearrange
three things.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.420
Because we don't want to
overcount for all of these,

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.057
viewing this arrangement
as fundamentally

00:05:55.057 --> 00:05:56.390
different than this arrangement.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.820
So then we want to
divide it by-- I

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.440
want to do that same orange
color-- dividing it by 3 times

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.360
2 times 1.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.740
 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:18.210
And which gives us, in the
numerator, 120 divided by 6.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.270
Oh sorry, that's not--
it's 60 divided by 6.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.845
This is 60.

00:06:20.845 --> 00:06:23.010
5 times 4 times 3 is 60.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.600
It gives us 60 divided
by 6, which gives us

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:34.020
10 possibilities that gives
us exactly three heads.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.080
And that's of 32 equally
likely possibilities.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.460
So the probability of getting
exactly three heads-- well,

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.980
you get exactly three
heads in 10 of the 32

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.790
equally likely possibilities.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:50.990
So you have a 5/16
chance of that happening.
