00:00:07.886 --> 00:00:09.010
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: Perfect.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.410
Good afternoon.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.282
Thank you all for being here.

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:13.490
My name is Arun Venkataraman.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.040
I am a member of the
News Lab at Google.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.710
It's our pleasure to have at
Talks at Google here with us

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.810
today, James Crabtree.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.110
Mr. Crabtree is the former
bureau chief of the "Financial

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.400
Times" in Mumbai, currently a
professor at the Lee Kuan Yew

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.530
School of Public
Policy at the National

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.890
University of Singapore.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.670
And he's written
this fantastic book,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.560
"The Billionaire Raj, a Journey
Through India's Gilded Age."

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.510
The book has received
fantastic reviews

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.310
from "Publisher Weekly."

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.890
"Washington Post" called it
one of the seven business

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.010
books that won't put you to
sleep at the beach this summer.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.500
And having read it on vacation
the last couple of weeks,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.990
I can certainly attest to that.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.300
It's a fantastic
book, a fantastic look

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.050
at India in this
moment, as you call it,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.950
of where it faces its
kind of national remaking.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.110
I think we'll jump
straight into it.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.035
And I kind of want
to start off with you

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:16.700
do this really great job
of setting up the broader

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.860
evolution of the Indian
political economy,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.990
from the British
Raj before 1947,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.900
the License Raj between '47
and liberalization in '91,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.900
and leading to the
current moment, which

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.140
is the rise of the
billionaire Raj.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.070
Would love for you
to kind of talk

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.300
through kind of the evolution
of that Indian political economy

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.850
and why we should think
about the billionaire Raj

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.440
as the defining characteristic
of the current Indian economic

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.075
moment.

00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:47.450
JAMES CRABTREE:
OK, so thank you.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.370
Thank you very
much for having me.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.070
I moved to India in 2011
as a foreign correspondent

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.570
for the "Financial Times."

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.460
And so I landed in Mumbai,
the financial capital,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.620
one morning in
November of that year.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.790
And I was picked up by a driver,
as often happens in India.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.250
And so we wound our
way through Mumbai,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.980
through the sort of past the
slums outside of the airport

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.640
fence, down through the city,
which for those of you who

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.160
don't know it, is a very
fast and exciting city, much

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.410
like New York, the
financial capital.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.210
And as we came
down into midtown,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.330
the driver sort of
slowed the car down

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.230
and started pointing excitedly
out of the window up ahead.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.180
And what he was pointing
to was this building

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.680
on the front cover of the book,
which is called Antilia, which

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.890
is the home of Mukesh Ambani,
who is India's richest

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.090
man and now Asia's richest man
as well, with a fortune of $44

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.670
billion at last count.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.449
And so this house is a family
home for Mr. Ambani, his wife,

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:52.490
and their three children.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.310
It's 170 meters tall.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.990
It has 2/3 of the floor space
of the Palace of Versailles,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.350
even though it's set on a plot
of not much more than an acre.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.840
It has an extraordinary
range of interior features--

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.360
hanging gardens,
an ice room, which

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.700
is like a sauna in reverse,
where apparently you

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.950
can escape from
the heat of Mumbai,

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.870
has six floors of parking.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.990
It has a sub-basement in which
they have an indoor football

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.211
pitch and a basketball court.

00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:26.960
And beyond all of those
things, it sort of

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.490
has stood for the excess of
what I call the billionaire Raj.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.600
Because even in a world of
galloping inequality here

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.590
in California, this is a
problem that people talk about.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.000
It's true in China.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.556
But nowhere else in the world
is there a house of this kind.

00:03:49.556 --> 00:03:53.570
This is known as the Billion
Dollar Home in India's press.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.160
And it's particularly
sort of galling,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.960
I suppose, in a
city like Mumbai,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.450
where half of the
population live in slums.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.980
And so that in a sense, it
has become the icon of what

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.150
I call the billionaire Raj.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.590
And there are three fault
lines in India's society

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.770
that I identify as being
associated with this,

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.380
one of which is the rise of
a new class of super wealthy

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.400
that have risen up, partly
since 1991, as you suggest,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.480
but actually really in
the last 10 or 15 years.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.080
And so the sort of story
of India's recent history

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.260
is one of re-globalization.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.160
Up until 1991, for the 40
years since independence,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.290
India closed itself
off from the world

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.510
and developed a not
terribly successful

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.880
socialist planned economy.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.130
It tore that down in 1991.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.260
But it was really only in
the middle of the 2000s,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.140
around the time of the long
economic boom in this country

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.725
and China's rise,
that India fully

00:04:56.725 --> 00:04:59.590
reintegrated with
the global economy.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.500
And that meant you
had a large number

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.370
of people who became very
rich for reasons that we

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.930
can get into.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.520
But in the middle
of the 1990s, India

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.990
had only two billionaires.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.990
Now it has something like 120.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.930
It has created wealth at
the very pinnacle of society

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.690
more quickly than almost any
other country in history.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.579
You can compare what's happened
with Russia in the early 1990s.

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:28.120
And so while India has a pretty
good record of lifting people

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.470
out of poverty, and hundreds
of millions of Indians

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.809
have been lifted out of poverty
over the last 10 or 15 years,

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:40.600
nonetheless, it's
created an economic model

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.310
where most of the
proceeds of growth

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.650
have gone shooting up
to the very, very top.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.160
And this remains a
quite poor country.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.060
Average income in India
is still only $1,700.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.502
To enter the 1%, you only need
an income of about $38,000,

00:05:57.502 --> 00:05:58.210
so not very much.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.668
So what we're
talking about here is

00:05:59.668 --> 00:06:02.570
the real top, top, top,
top, top of the tree.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:08.050
But for those people like
Mr. Ambani and the 0.0001%,

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.070
they have wealth that is
comparable to the very

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.770
richest in the world
and in a country that

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.900
remains rather unequal.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.330
Along with that have been two
other problems that we could

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.540
get into, one of which is the
rise of crony capitalism, which

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.740
again is wound up in
India's re-globalization,

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.390
that as the economy
became more valuable,

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.340
then what had previously been
an endemic but small-bore form

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.686
of corruption developed into a
really big form of corruption

00:06:38.686 --> 00:06:40.060
in the middle of
the last decade.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.220
And that has been
a big battle in

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.380
the Indian political and
business system about how

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.490
you deal with crony capitalism
that is still being fought.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.350
And then there's a
third fault line,

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.610
which relates to the way India's
industrial economy works.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.790
There was a huge boom
around the same time

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.760
that this building
was being built

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.220
before the global
financial crisis.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.450
That boom ended in a
bit of a jarring crunch.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.004
And India has since
been trying to recover

00:07:09.004 --> 00:07:10.670
from the problems
that were caused then,

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.920
which are excessive debt taken
on by its new tycoon class

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.850
and over-leverage in
the banking system.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.830
And so these three fault lines
are what I discuss in the book

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.451
and what I say are the sort of
challenges of the billionaire

00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:26.950
Raj.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.000
This is an optimistic
book, at least in theory.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.530
Because I see no
particular reason

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.337
why India can't overcome
these challenges.

00:07:34.337 --> 00:07:35.920
But I suppose the
argument in the book

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.222
is that it's not going
to happen by accident.

00:07:38.222 --> 00:07:40.180
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: And
you talk about, in fact,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.860
in the book I think, there's
a $150 billion in bad assets

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.280
that the banks currently
own from this tycoon class.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.020
Getting to the dual reasons
of this boom and bust cycle

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:56.890
and then the crony capitalism
that you kind of position

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:01.270
as being the primary reasons for
fueling the rise of this tycoon

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.360
class or the billionaire Raj
over the last 10, 12 years.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.520
Why is that fundamentally
problematic for India's

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.220
development writ large?

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:17.000
Why is it an issue that you
have crony capitalism as rampant

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.500
as it is, a boom and bust cycle?

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.572
And how does that hinder India's
ability to grow going forward?

00:08:21.572 --> 00:08:23.780
JAMES CRABTREE: Well, if
you compare India to China--

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.330
so China has executed a sort of
once-in-a-lifetime trick over

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.799
the last 30 years, which is it
has grown pretty much unbroken

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:36.429
over 7% for about two decades.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:39.130
And that's unprecedented
in economic history.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.919
Almost no country
has ever done that.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:45.400
And nonetheless, India is
trying to do something similar.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.924
The quicker you grow at a high
rate uninterrupted, the more

00:08:48.924 --> 00:08:51.340
quickly you move out of poverty
and become a middle income

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:51.850
country.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.127
As I say, what China has
managed to do is very unusual.

00:08:55.127 --> 00:08:57.460
Typically what happens is you
can grow fast for a while.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.620
And then you sort of,
you get found out.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.540
And you fall over.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.240
And so in a sense, the problem
with India's boom and bust

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.930
cycle is it impinges
on its development.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.270
But it raises a sort of
more interesting question.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:15.940
So there's been a big change in
the way India's economy works.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.680
The simplest way
I can explain it

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.950
is that before the
reforms in 1991,

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.170
and to some degree for
the 10 years after that,

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:28.820
you had a situation where
capital was expensive,

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.960
but politics was easy.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.556
So it was hard to raise money.

00:09:33.556 --> 00:09:34.680
You couldn't get financing.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.055
There were no
international banks

00:09:36.055 --> 00:09:38.790
so you had to rely on a
kind moldy state banking

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.620
system, which was
locked up in all sorts

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.870
of ridiculous restrictions.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.430
But if you were a
businessman, you

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:49.390
learned how to work the
system, the good ones.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.876
Some people call
it crony socialism.

00:09:51.876 --> 00:09:53.500
Your friends in
politics helps you out.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.660
You bend the rules a little bit.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.243
The people who
prospered were the ones

00:09:56.243 --> 00:09:58.950
who knew how to work
the political system.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.180
And what happened
after the mid 2000,

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.942
and particularly after you had
a range of corruption scandals,

00:10:04.942 --> 00:10:06.150
was that flipped on its head.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.580
So capital became much cheaper,
much easier to raise money.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.390
And so the tycoons raised
huge amounts of money,

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.250
borrowed mostly from
state bank banks.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.850
But then suddenly, politics
became very difficult.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.830
Because in the aftermath
of the corruption

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.240
scandals of the mid 2000s,
India is a democracy.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.510
It has a free press.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.690
It has an independent judiciary,
which is at its upper levels,

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.500
at least broadly
impartial and not corrupt.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.210
It has a vibrant civil society.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.290
And all of these groups--

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.830
and it has a growing, if
still small, middle class.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.280
All four of those groups became
very attuned to corruption.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.860
And so it became much more
difficult for the tycoons

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.184
to work the political system
as they did in the past.

00:10:47.184 --> 00:10:48.600
And that was
especially true after

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.150
the current prime
minister, Narendra Modi,

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.240
was elected in
2014 in a landslide

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.380
election in which he stood on
an anti-corruption platform.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.560
And so this new environment
that India finds itself in,

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.660
in which capital is
much easier to get

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.880
than it was before,
or at least has been,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.960
but the political system is much
more difficult. What it means

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.420
is the old system
that India was using

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:18.600
to build steel mills and mines
and toll roads is now broken.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.920
But there isn't a new system.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.336
And that's a big
problem if you're

00:11:21.336 --> 00:11:24.780
a country in the early
stages of industrialization.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.540
Because while
people look at India

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.650
and they see its tech
economy, for instance,

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.310
the cities like Bangalore
and Hyderabad, which

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:37.580
have vibrant startups and
big outsourcing companies,

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.750
but in the end, you can't
develop with just that.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:46.730
You need to have the basic
infrastructural development

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.804
in roads and sewerage
and ports and railways

00:11:49.804 --> 00:11:51.470
that every other
developing country that

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.590
has moved from poverty to
middle income status and onwards

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.940
towards rich economy
status has managed.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.720
And so if India's
industrial engine

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.904
is broken or problematic,
then that's a big issue.

00:12:04.904 --> 00:12:06.320
ARUN VENKATARAMAN:
That brings up,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.710
I think, a comparison that
you draw between the moment

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:14.300
that India is currently in
and let's say that the United

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.470
States was in during the
Gilded Age or England

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:22.010
was in in the time of Dickens,
where you kind of have

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.300
this very interesting dynamic.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:28.580
Because with two, three,
sorry, primary stakeholders,

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.280
the state institution
or state apparatus

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.890
fails to provide basic needs and
basic services infrastructure

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.740
to its people.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:41.690
Opportunistic politicians
kind of seize that kind of gap

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.930
by providing patronage or
providing those resources

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.490
in exchange for votes.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.050
And then those
kind of politicians

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.050
are being supported
with resources

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.300
from the moneyed class
and kind of fueling

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.402
this situation in
which politicians

00:12:55.402 --> 00:12:57.360
in the moneyed class
might continue to do well.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.070
But the basic needs of
people go on being unmet.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.170
And it kind of speaks to some
of the ways in which I think

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.230
crony capitalism has manifested
to make it difficult for India

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.340
to develop in the ways that I
think we'd all hope it would.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.270
What does it take to
break through that?

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:22.370
What do you need to break this
toxic web of interdependency

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:26.380
between these three stakeholders
in Indian political society?

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.380
JAMES CRABTREE: I mean,
that's a great question.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.490
So Francis Fukuyama,
the social theorist

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:35.180
and political scientist, writes
a lot on corruption and trust

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.870
and says that actually, the
move from a society based

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.820
on patronage to one that is
based on neutral rules applied

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.080
evenly between groups is much
more complicated than moving

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.895
from poverty to
middle income status,

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:52.010
that this is an incredibly
difficult development

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.590
challenge.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.810
I mean, one of the reasons why
I say this is an optimistic book

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.870
is that, in a sense, if you
were sitting not necessarily

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:03.110
here in San Francisco, but if
you were sitting in Manhattan

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.640
in 1880 and you had looked at
the situation of the United

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.700
States at that time, you would
have been pretty depressed.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.050
This was a moment in which
America had a venal billionaire

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:21.210
class that had taken much of the
wealth that had been generated

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.630
after the Civil War and
had pocketed it for itself

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.380
and used that to build
beautiful mansions in New York

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.830
and on the cliff tops of
Newport, Rhode Island.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.390
And they were
working hand-in-glove

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:38.580
with machine politics at
the city or local level that

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:44.100
was rapacious and not
interested in ordinary people.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.810
And you might have
been fairly depressed

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.010
about America's prospects.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:51.000
But within 10 or
20, 30 years, you

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.640
have the move that is commonly
called the move from the Gilded

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.310
Age to the Progressive
Era, which is

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:57.720
a complicated set of changes.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.770
But the middle class began to
assert control over politics.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.320
You had the
development of a kind

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.050
of free press that went on to
become one of the world's most

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.750
admirable, a range
of other developments

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:14.520
that gradually meant that a
political movement that busted

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.680
up some of the
monopolies that were

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.270
held by the moneyed
class at the top.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.600
And so you had a range
of different changes

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.150
that changed America
very fundamentally

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.070
in this early stage
of industrialization.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:30.480
I see no particular reason why
that can't happen in India.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.430
The sort of nexus
that you're talking,

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:37.170
about, however, it is
difficult to break.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:41.550
You need to build up
state services that

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.890
are of reasonable quality
so that people don't have

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.350
to rely on things that are
provided through patronage

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:47.430
networks.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.190
You have to drain the swamp
of the political funding

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.752
system, which is--

00:15:51.752 --> 00:15:53.460
we can talk about this
more if you like--

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.530
sort of the original sin
of the Indian system,

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:59.400
that it has a very expensive
political system, which

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.440
is almost entirely
funded under the table

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.360
with illegal donations.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.930
And you have to create a
much more competitive market

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:12.960
economy, so one that is a sort
of rules-based economy rather

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.780
than a--

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.360
pro-market rather
than pro-business

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.970
is one of the ways
people describe it,

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.400
so not one where the political
class is doing favors

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.950
for particular businesses but
by which everyone has to play

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.501
by the same competitive rules.

00:16:25.501 --> 00:16:26.750
But those things are not easy.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.280
It's sort of easier
said than done.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.330
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: It definitely
gets to the idea, I think.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.640
And it's a quote that you
mentioned in the book,

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.500
that more than the
type of government,

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.140
the degree of government is
what's most important, I think.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.050
It's initially
from Fukuyama also.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.620
I guess in terms of
things that could

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.070
be done to supercharge
or accelerate

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.770
the degree of government--

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.550
we are at Google,
so I feel compelled

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.300
to ask, what role do you feel
technology companies could

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.590
play or should play?

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.950
Should they have a role in
supercharging or accelerating

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.110
the efforts of building
out a more robust state

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.433
apparatus that can meet
the needs of its people?

00:17:03.433 --> 00:17:05.099
JAMES CRABTREE: I
think there's two ways

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.050
of answering that
question, both of which

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.960
are reasons for optimism.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.810
So the first thing is this
book focuses mostly on what

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.450
you might call bad guys.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.970
But India is not Russia.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.460
The reason why I'm much
more optimistic about India

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.250
in the medium to long
term is that there

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.109
are large parts of the
Indian economy that

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:27.869
are, broadly speaking,
sort of market

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:29.850
competitive and innovative.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.600
And the tech sector, both its
heritage outsourcing but also

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.390
its newer startup
culture, are part of that.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.407
And they have produced
a lot of rich people.

00:17:40.407 --> 00:17:42.240
And there's absolutely
no problem with that.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.000
The same is true with
generic pharmaceuticals

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.150
manufacturing, or bits of
the automotive supply chain,

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.420
or there's a whole bunch
of bits of finance.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:58.530
The private sector finance
economy banks are high quality,

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.090
competitive institutions.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.460
And to the extent
that these guys have

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.580
made an absolute fortune, as
long as they pay their taxes

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.594
and are sort of reasonably
socially responsible,

00:18:07.594 --> 00:18:10.010
I don't think any of us should
have any problem with that.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:13.410
And so one way in which the tech
economy can kind of play a role

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.810
here is by simply
continuing to grow

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:21.635
and crowding out the rest of
the people in a different part

00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:22.260
of the economy.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.840
That, however, is
not a perfect answer.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.560
Because you can't simply create
a prosperous middle income

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:34.240
economy only by looking
at the tech sector.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.240
You know, you need growth
that is broadly-based.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.400
And ideally, you want
all of your sectors,

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.010
including extractive industries
and property, the traditionally

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.860
very corrupt sectors,
you want them also

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.060
to have high
governance standards.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.620
And so well, what
can technology do?

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.370
Partly one of the ways in which
the government of Narendra

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.110
Modi, the prime
minister, has begun

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.200
to tackle some of the
corruption in India

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:07.750
is by moving official
processes online.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.910
So literally in India, if you
need to go and get a vehicle

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:16.730
license, you have to go
to some moldy old office

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.424
in some distant
part of the city.

00:19:18.424 --> 00:19:20.090
And unless you are
very lucky, someone's

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.300
going to ask you for a bribe.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.490
There's sort of
the any individuals

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:23.540
have lots of discretion.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.680
And that's true
with all sorts of--

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.040
they call them permissions
in India, the sort of box

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.001
tick you need to get if
you need to do something.

00:19:31.001 --> 00:19:32.750
And so if you're trying
to run a business,

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.890
you often need thousands,
tens of thousands,

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.800
sometimes millions, of
these things if you're

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:41.350
a very large enterprise, to do
with property, the environment,

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.240
air quality,
whatever it might be.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.960
The more of these
you can move online

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.580
and the more you
take discretion away

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.940
from individuals who can
then use it as an opportunity

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.280
to sort of extract
money, and make

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.680
this a kind of mutual
rules-based system.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.910
And there's a lot
of power in that.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.220
And so India has already--

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.780
and other countries
in Asia as well--

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.470
have already shown that that's
a quite effective corruption

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.120
reduction strategy.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.920
And so that, I think,
is one way in which

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.870
technology can play a big part.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.745
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: What
is your sense of some

00:20:10.745 --> 00:20:12.830
of the more ambitious or
kind of grander schemes,

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.370
like Aadhaar, for
example, that are kind of

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.890
trying to use
digitization or next-level

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:24.710
technology to make state
functions a little bit more

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.100
efficient?

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.620
JAMES CRABTREE:
Yeah, so Aadhaar,

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.160
which is a biometric
identification system that

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.070
was the idea and
was pushed by a guy

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.770
called Nandan Nilekani,
who's the founder of Infosys,

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:40.100
one of the heritage
outsourcing companies--

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.770
and in a sense, he
is an absolute emblem

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:45.110
of what you might call the
good billionaires as opposed

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.680
to the bad.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.320
I mean, he personally is as
honest as the day is long.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.430
He has a deep commitment
to public service.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:56.690
And the Aadhaar, which
he helped to set up,

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.502
has become a great
success story.

00:20:59.502 --> 00:21:01.460
It's the sort of one of
the layers in what they

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:05.360
call the India stack, which
is a range of technology

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.310
applications which
makes it much easier

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.460
to connect individual users,
particularly those who are very

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.100
poor, into the banking
and financial system

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.810
and then onwards
into products that

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:17.180
require that, like
mobile payments

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.970
and that sort of thing.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.420
And actually, I mean,
it's been very successful.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.580
It's now used by more
than a billion people.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.850
So it's very
difficult now in India

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.610
to do anything without
an Aadhaar card.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.530
And so if you're
a startup and you

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.990
want to do something
which requires

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:36.140
quick and easy
identification, verification,

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:39.290
and then access into
banking and other sorts

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.390
of financial products,
it's vastly easier

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.400
than it was even two
or three years ago.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.070
You know, this system
has its critics.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.600
There are some people who
worry not so much about Aadhaar

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.690
itself, but about the
security and data protection

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.420
of the wider ecosystem of
companies that are now building

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:54.620
things off the back of it.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.140
But typically, I think
that's a good example

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.750
of what the Indian
state can achieve

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.830
if it puts its mind to it.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.100
The problem is that that is
a rather isolated example

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:04.730
of success.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.740
And there are whole
swathes of other areas

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.440
that are pretty much as
hopeless as they used to be.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.960
So in a sense, you need
to take that rather

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.500
inspirational example
and then move it around

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.451
much more broadly.

00:22:16.451 --> 00:22:18.200
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: And
apply it at scale--

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.360
it strikes me that--

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:24.530
I mean, I think the grand
conclusion or recommendation

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.350
from the book is
doing what it takes

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.810
to usher in this
progressive era that

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.500
might be able to move
India from the Gilded Age

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.780
to higher levels of development.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.720
It strikes me that one of the
components of that you need

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.330
is a kind of a fierce,
independent kind

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.870
of muckraking media class
or journalism class.

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.780
And I'm putting on my News
Lab hat a little bit here.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.120
You have this really
fascinating chapter

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.690
in the book about of the rise
of Arnab Goswami over the course

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.470
of the last 10 years.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.850
And I think it's kind
of a nuanced chapter

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:05.030
where you suggest, is
this newly activist media

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:11.540
class emblematic of
yellow journalism in the--

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.810
not just the Pulitzer but
the world model in the 1890s?

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.850
Or is it like
muckraking journalism,

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:20.000
like Upton Sinclair's
"The Jungle."

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.020
I mean, what's your sense of
how it's treading that line?

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:27.290
And as you see journalism
move increasingly to digital,

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.410
is it more susceptible to
being yellow journalism

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.132
than the muckraking
variety it needs?

00:23:33.132 --> 00:23:35.340
JAMES CRABTREE: Yeah, so
it's another great question.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.830
And I could talk
about this for hours.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.330
Because obviously,
I'm a journalist.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.020
And so I love this question.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.350
I mean, my starting position
with the Indian media

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:46.270
is I live in Singapore.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.530
And I would much rather
have the Indian media

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:52.580
than the Singaporean or many
other of the East Asian medias.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:24:00.020
I admire the fearless, messy,
often wholly inaccurate

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.530
but spirited South
Asian press more

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.700
than the much more restrained,
deferential East Asian press.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.340
I think if you come from
an Anglo-Saxon background,

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.890
you take the Indian media over
an East Asian media any day

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:13.632
of the week.

00:24:13.632 --> 00:24:15.590
That, however, is not to
say that there are not

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.110
very substantial issues.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:23.780
And I think there has been a
degradation in the Indian media

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:28.400
ecosystem that is
partly to do with what

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.390
you might call the Fox
Newsification of broadcast

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:33.420
news.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.330
So in the book, I
focus on a gentleman

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.720
called Arnab Goswami, who's
kind of the Sean Hannity or Bill

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.220
O'Reilly of India.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:45.960
He's a very outspoken
evening talk show host.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.880
He's quite right wing,
although he initially

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.820
found his feet as an
anti-corruption campaigner.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.479
And he claims, I think
with some justification,

00:24:55.479 --> 00:24:57.020
that he is sort of
personally liberal

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.230
and sort of speaks out on things
like women's and gay rights.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.300
But increasingly,
he is associated

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.990
with something that would be
quite similar to a sort of Fox

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.210
News agenda, a right
wing nationalism that

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.010
is very supportive
of Narendra Modi

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.340
and spends its time beating up
on Pakistan on the evening news

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.750
and that sort of thing.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.960
That's one problem.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.140
You then have a problem
of social media.

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.290
I should watch my words
carefully in this audience.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.990
But increasingly, I view
social media in India

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.270
as a complete cesspit.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:36.860
I mean, Twitter in particular,
it's a very tough environment

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.300
and one where established
norms of behavior

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.050
that you would have
in other forms of life

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.050
increasingly don't exist.

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:48.980
And I am increasingly troubled
by that, as are many people.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.560
And it's unclear to me
quite what you do about it.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.810
But the social media genie
has many positive sides.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.750
But there's clearly
a lot of negatives

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.870
in terms of what it does to
public discourse in a country

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.620
that has deep preexisting
social divisions of particularly

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.990
religion, but also caste and
all sorts of other things.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:10.280
And India, with the
best will in the world,

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:15.320
does not have the strongest
existing media institutions.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.520
So it does have a reasonable
suite of broadcast newspapers,

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.380
broadsheet newspapers.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.900
But it doesn't have a kind
of "New York Times" or a BBC

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.030
or a "Le Monde" or
something like that.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.470
And then you have
a problem, which

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.200
will be core to what you're
looking at in News Lab, which

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.016
is a business model problem,
which is at the moment.

00:26:34.016 --> 00:26:35.390
I think it's a
trick of the light

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:38.870
that the Indian press appears
to be doing quite well.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:41.330
You have a huge population
it's growing and learning

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:43.610
to read for the first time.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:44.934
Illiteracy rates are falling.

00:26:44.934 --> 00:26:46.100
People are becoming wealthy.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.710
And so the newspapers,
on the surface,

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.410
look like their business
models are reasonably robust.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.810
But I'm 100% convinced that
that is a trick of the light.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.810
And exactly the
same tsunami that

00:26:56.810 --> 00:27:00.837
has washed over the media
industry in the West

00:27:00.837 --> 00:27:02.420
is going to wash
over the Indian media

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.030
industry with almost twice
the force, because it's going

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.770
to happen much more quickly.

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:10.877
The shift from people
not having smartphones

00:27:10.877 --> 00:27:13.460
to having smartphones and using
them for absolutely everything

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.930
is happening with
enormous speed,

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.180
much more quickly than it
did in the UK and the US.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.850
And so I think a lot of these
heritage media institutions

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:21.860
are just going to get
completely swamped

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.770
unless they adapt
even more nimbly

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.110
than the best of the global
institutions have managed.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:30.780
So I think the Indian ecosystem
is an interesting one.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.550
But it raises a bigger question
and a much bigger picture

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:38.070
issue about why we should
all care about India.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:42.370
In this audience, you're
part of the Indian diaspora.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.890
Many of you have
connections to India.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:49.000
But in a sense, look
up from 50,000 feet.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.340
China is clearly heading
in the wrong direction.

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.380
China is sliding
backwards into a form

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.570
of neo-Leninist autocracy.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.030
The notion that China is
going to become even a country

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.520
like Singapore in the
next 10 or 20 years

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.480
now seems to be almost
beyond possibility.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:09.400
Russia, Turkey, many of the
most important developing

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.135
economies in the world are
slipping backwards into forms

00:28:13.135 --> 00:28:13.720
of--

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.650
even the United States
to some degree--

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:19.270
into forms of nationalism
that those of us

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.820
who believe in a kind of
liberal, multicultural

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.980
worldview find
rather regrettable.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.030
India remains the
swing superpower.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.650
It is at the earliest
stage of its development

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.030
of any of these countries.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.360
Its story is the one that
is yet to be written.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.390
And it remains a
parliamentary democracy

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.689
with a constitution
that enshrines

00:28:39.689 --> 00:28:41.230
liberal rights of
the sort that would

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:44.770
be very familiar to people in
the United Kingdom or United

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:45.850
States.

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:47.156
It's a multi-faith democracy.

00:28:47.156 --> 00:28:49.780
And it's perfectly possible that
by the middle of this century,

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:53.440
India will be a sort
of upper middle income

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:58.450
parliamentary democracy in
which various faiths in a very

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:02.020
complicated society live broadly
in harmony with one another

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.070
in a market economy.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.740
And that would be not just
a good thing for India

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.210
in my view, but a good
thing for the whole world,

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.570
particularly our bit of it.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.750
And so in that sense, one of
the underlying arguments in this

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.840
book-- and it links to the point
about having a democratic free

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.740
press as opposed to China
in particular and some other

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.870
countries in Asia--

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:24.910
we all have a huge
stake in the success

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:29.620
of the current Indian model and
should be watching developments

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.789
there very closely.

00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:33.580
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: It
strikes me, I think--

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.250
and it's a question that you
position at the very beginning

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:37.080
of the book--

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.610
India is in a moment
of national remaking.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:43.660
And it can kind of double
down on the liberal democratic

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:48.760
values that you just
highlighted are its strengths.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.210
It seems to me that you also
hear, as a part of the broader

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.670
conversation, that India
maybe should course

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:59.380
correct and take on a more
right wing, autocratic--

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:04.720
kind of go the way of China, or
to a lesser extent, Singapore.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.740
And that might grease
some of the inefficiencies

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.390
of the Indian state.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:14.830
Kind of taking a step back,
it can go the progressive era

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:15.470
mode.

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:18.220
Or it can take a more
kind of like strongman,

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:23.620
autocratic leadership that
builds a very efficient state

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.940
apparatus sort of direction.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.060
Do you sense that
that is the right way

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.670
to frame the two directions
that it could potentially

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:36.621
go moving forward to address
some of these broader issues?

00:30:36.621 --> 00:30:38.620
JAMES CRABTREE: I mean,
I understand the impulse

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.960
behind that
suggestion, which comes

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:46.420
from a place of frustration,
which is that as recently

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.990
as 1990, 1995, India
and China were basically

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.990
in the same place from
a kind of economic size,

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:54.370
GDP per capita sense.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:57.600
And then China raced
away and is now

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.832
a vastly richer country than
India and much more successful.

00:31:00.832 --> 00:31:02.290
And so I can
understand the impulse

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.748
to say, well, if our political
system was a little bit more

00:31:04.748 --> 00:31:07.210
like theirs, then if we
weren't a messy democracy

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.870
and that meant that we didn't
have to put up with people,

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.620
we could just bulldoze
them out of the way

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:15.730
like the Chinese did, then
we could build more roads.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:18.350
We'd get more done.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.115
And that would make it easier.

00:31:20.115 --> 00:31:21.490
And so I understand
that impulse.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:27.040
I'm not sure it is the
best example to go for.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.530
Many European and
American countries

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.140
have managed to build
good infrastructure

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.830
without requiring
a dictatorship.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.470
Equally, China is a much
more homogeneous society

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.070
than India is-- not
a very good model.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:43.790
The Han Chinese make up
the vast majority of China.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.690
India is a stunningly diverse
society in all of its ways.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:52.570
It seemed much more like Europe
than the heritage United States

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.640
or China.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:32:00.360
And the risks of, in a sense,
a more majoritarian politics,

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.820
which in a country that is
80% Hindu inevitably means

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.610
a majoritarian
Hindu politics, it

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:08.440
comes with a number of risks.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.530
I mean, in the end, social
divisions are not always

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:19.450
good for economic growth,
not simply because--

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:23.560
but the risk is you have
periods of social unrest.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.180
So anyway, I think India
would be better advised

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:30.240
to stick with a
system that protects

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.090
the rights of its
minorities and simply

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.610
tries to work on making
its state work better.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:39.300
There's nothing really wound
up in the world of democracy

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:44.430
per se, which is limiting India
from improving what people

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.290
tend to call state capacity.

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.300
And state capacity,
underneath all of this,

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.120
is really the answer
to India's problems.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.730
It has a weak state.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:52.980
It's poorly resourced.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.740
It doesn't have
enough smart people.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.020
It is corrupt.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.940
And there's nothing
inherently about democracy

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.180
which stops you from building
high-quality state capacity.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.750
It was done in many
other countries.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.810
And so I think this
notion that India can only

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.790
succeed if it sort
of gradually cleaves

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.910
towards a form of
authoritarianism is risky.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:20.850
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: You
mentioned in the book

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:23.670
that part of the difficulty
with implementing grand change,

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.160
despite even, for example,
the ambitions of the Modi

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.680
government over the course
of the last five years,

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.440
is the inherent kind
of fractious nature

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.990
of India's political
and cultural landscape.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:36.840
The changes that you propose
in the book or the changes

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.370
that you propose
India needs to make

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:43.690
are huge, not insignificant by
any stretch of the imagination.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:49.380
And yet you remain
optimistic that India

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:53.190
can go in that direction.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:57.030
Given how divided and fractious
this political cultural

00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:01.140
environment is,
what gives you, I

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:06.720
guess, faith that India is going
to retain its democratic roots

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.750
and still find a way
to strengthen its state

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:13.710
capacity to ameliorate
some of the broader issues

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:14.374
that it faces?

00:34:14.374 --> 00:34:17.040
JAMES CRABTREE: Well, I think my
optimism about India, as I say,

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.310
is based on historical precedent
from other countries that

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.330
have managed to do this.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:25.199
It's also based on the
stronger and more innovative

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:31.590
parts of India's economy.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:36.900
I see examples of where
the Indian state is

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.230
very successful.

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:39.659
So you mentioned Aadhaar.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:41.530
People point to its
electoral system.

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:44.489
So Indian elections
are a great miracle.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:46.739
They're, broadly-speaking--
all sorts of problems with

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:49.000
the Indian democratic system--

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.820
but the elections
themselves, these mass

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:54.480
festivals of democracy that
happen every four or five

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.290
years, they're always
the largest election

00:34:58.290 --> 00:34:59.610
in human history.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:06.090
They're run fairly efficiently
on a shoestring budget.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:09.810
People point to the Indian Space
program, which has sent rockets

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:11.620
into space at almost no cost.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.607
So there are plenty of examples
of when the Indian state puts

00:35:15.607 --> 00:35:17.940
its mind to it, that it can
achieve extraordinary things

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:18.610
at low cost.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:21.417
And the talent of
the Indian people

00:35:21.417 --> 00:35:22.750
is a remarkable thing to behold.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.840
You only have to look at
the strength of the diaspora

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.430
population here in
the United States.

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:28.860
Hinduism is America's
richest religion.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.520
We're here in Silicon Valley,
where the Indian diaspora is

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.550
overwhelmingly the most
successful of immigrant groups.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:39.450
If you look at
immigrant-founded businesses,

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:43.120
technology businesses,
then it isn't even close.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.015
Indians found more successful
technology businesses

00:35:46.015 --> 00:35:48.640
here than all of the rest of the
immigrant groups put together,

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.306
including the Chinese
and the Taiwanese,

00:35:50.306 --> 00:35:52.930
who are the second
and third most

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:55.530
sort of impressive groupings.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:58.120
And so I see no particular
reason why this can't happen.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.245
But as I say, it's not
going to happen by accident.

00:36:00.245 --> 00:36:02.794
And I don't want to
underestimate the challenge.

00:36:02.794 --> 00:36:04.710
I suppose what I would
say is that someone who

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:08.802
lived in India for five
years, my son was born there--

00:36:08.802 --> 00:36:10.510
my son, as we were
talking about earlier,

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:12.930
has an Indian middle name--

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.090
and as with many
people who visit India,

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:17.880
I emerged in a sense
very fond of the country.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.696
I think that's not
always true of people

00:36:19.696 --> 00:36:22.320
who go to live in China, foreign
correspondents who live there.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.050
They find it a more challenging
and frustrating experience

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:27.570
because of the nature
of the political system.

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:30.240
Again, that is not to downplay
some of the rougher edges

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.170
of Indian society.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:35.397
But I think you come
out sort of admiring

00:36:35.397 --> 00:36:37.230
the strengths of the
Indian political system

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:38.310
and wishing it well.

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:41.250
And in a sense,
as an outsider who

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.800
decided that I wanted to write
a book about India because I

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:49.230
thought I had some experiences
there that were worth

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.440
sharing, that's the
perspective that I come from,

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.650
sort of a friend who's tried
to make a few contributions

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:59.760
to a much broader debate
about how India moves out

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.740
of poverty and through
middle income status

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.330
and towards being
a rich economy,

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.271
as many other countries
have done before.

00:37:05.271 --> 00:37:07.270
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: No, I
mean, it's interesting.

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:09.060
Even though you were
exposed certainly,

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.270
I'm sure, to the darker
underbelly of Indian society,

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.790
that you've still sort of
emerged out of the process

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.550
feeling optimistic
about its future,

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.500
which I think is nice
for those of us who

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.210
are part of the Indian
diaspora, and just

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:22.190
like humanity writ
large and recognize

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:25.830
the stakes of bringing
hundreds of millions of people,

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:31.730
if not a 1.7 billion people's
potential to fruition.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:35.580
I want to open it
up to questions now.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.377
Oh, sorry, there's a mic
in the back you guys can--

00:37:39.377 --> 00:37:41.210
AUDIENCE: Do you want
me to walk over there?

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:44.440
JAMES CRABTREE:
Yeah, I believe so.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.060
AUDIENCE: So it's
interesting that you

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:50.290
called India kind of
like a swing country

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:54.290
when you compare it to
countries like Turkey and China,

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:58.040
which are more falling towards
more authoritarian regimes.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:02.570
Because it seems
like Narendra Modi

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:03.935
was elected with a landslide.

00:38:03.935 --> 00:38:09.690
But he is stoking a little
bit of a nationalistic India,

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:15.510
like Hindus versus Muslim
kind of tension in order

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:19.360
to forward the BJP's
control over the country

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.970
or the political system.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:22.720
So could you talk more
about your thoughts

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:30.130
on Narendra Modi, what you
think he signifies for India,

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.960
and if there are pros and
cons about what he's done

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.450
and what he represents?

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:36.390
JAMES CRABTREE: Yeah.

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:38.730
So it's a great question.

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:42.600
Narendra Modi is the dominant
figure of the age in India.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.616
And although I set
out to write a book

00:38:44.616 --> 00:38:45.990
about the rise of
the super rich,

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:48.482
I very quickly discovered
that it's basically impossible

00:38:48.482 --> 00:38:50.190
to grapple with the
state of modern India

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.620
unless you have an account
of Modi, who he is,

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.400
and what he stands for.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.570
He's a remarkable figure
in a number of ways.

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:58.570
For those of you who are
less familiar with him,

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:02.160
he was born in poverty.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.110
He's from the lower castes.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.090
He's famously a
self-described son

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:09.354
of a tea seller, a chaiwala.

00:39:09.354 --> 00:39:10.770
And so in the book,
I go and visit

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:13.140
the village that he grew up
in in the state of Gujarat.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:18.030
He's immensely controversial
because he presided over

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:21.360
an episode of ethnic violence
in the early 2000s in which

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.960
many thousands of Muslims died.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.256
And his critics say
that if he did not

00:39:25.256 --> 00:39:26.880
exacerbate this
violence that he didn't

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.150
do nearly enough to stop it.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.510
So he was banned for the
best part of a decade

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:32.640
from traveling to
the United States.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.210
He wasn't welcome in
most Western countries.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:38.550
And then he's a contradictory
figure, as you say.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:40.920
So on the one hand,
he won election

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.540
on an anti-corruption
platform and is

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.560
seen to be a pro-growth,
pro-market, pro-jobs sort

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.310
of leader.

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:48.270
He's a technocrat.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.760
He believes in building big
infrastructure projects.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.320
He's obsessed with bullet
trains and solar parks.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.580
And he loves technology.

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:58.470
He has nearly as many Twitter
followers as Donald Trump.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:01.130
When Donald Trump met him, he
rather graciously pointed out

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:04.830
that Narendra Modi had
the second largest number

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:08.520
of Twitter followers
of anyone in the world.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:13.560
And yet as you say, he
is a Hindu nationalist.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.780
In his younger days,
he was, in a sense,

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:20.820
a sort of proselytizing
religious figure

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:24.540
for a right wing,
Hindu nationalist,

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.790
civil society group
called the RSS.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.830
And he would--
this was in the era

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:30.690
before India's
economy opened up--

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:34.950
and so he would walk or take
a scooter from town to town.

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:37.770
This was in an era really before
any Indians had televisions.

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:39.380
And so he would
preach the good news.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.130
He would go and have
meetings with people,

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:42.796
sit around kitchen
tables, and tell them

00:40:42.796 --> 00:40:45.150
about what the Hindu
nationalists thought was

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:46.090
going on in the world.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.230
And so he stands
against the tradition

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:54.420
that I talked about earlier,
the values of secularism that

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:58.500
are enshrined in
India's constitution.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.990
And so that's when I say that
India is a swing superpower.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:03.220
I suppose I mean
that this is in play.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:07.590
It doesn't seem to me that India
is sliding inevitably backwards

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.380
into a form of populist
nationalism along the lines

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.920
that Turkey or certainly
Russia has followed.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.920
China is a different case
but equally depressing.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.800
Nonetheless, I think
fair-minded people

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.620
could agree that the
secular tradition in India

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:26.040
is in a pretty weakened
position at the moment.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.460
The Congress Party that
was the standard bearer

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.400
of that tradition for
most of India's existence

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.620
has been reduced to
a parliamentary rump

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:37.260
of less than 50 seats.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:41.650
Its leadership is not popular.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:44.580
And so it's sort
of unclear where

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:48.900
the future of that strand
of India's politics

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:49.659
is made up from.

00:41:49.659 --> 00:41:51.450
And then there are all
sorts of other forms

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.430
of nationalist
identity-- caste-based

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.170
politics, religious
politics in India.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:58.500
It's a very complicated
and combustible society.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.380
Nonetheless, I don't think
that there is as much reason

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.090
for pessimism as
there are in some

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:05.550
of these other
autocratic countries.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:08.400
And so when I say that it's a
swing superpower, what I mean

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.007
is that it could go, to some
degree, one way or the other.

00:42:12.007 --> 00:42:13.590
I don't think India
is going to become

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:17.850
a new version of Russia, a
kind of oligarchic kleptocracy.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:19.950
I think there was a risk
of that 10 years ago.

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:22.770
I think that risk has
thankfully receded somewhat.

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:25.140
But there is a future in
which India would remain,

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:27.690
and it's already probably
the most unequal country

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:32.130
in the world, right up there
with South Africa and Brazil.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:34.820
But it's reached that point
at a much earlier stage

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.040
in its economic development.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.820
And so the risk is if
it continues to grow

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.370
and the proceeds of that
growth are taken overwhelmingly

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:44.040
by people at the top, you
have a potential future

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.140
in which India becomes
unprecedentedly

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.840
unequal for a large economy.

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.840
And you can also get a situation
in which Indian politics

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.870
becomes much more combustible.

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:58.800
This is a country that has
nearly 300 million Muslims.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:02.760
And so if that
substantial minority

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.150
begins to feel that
they have no protection

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.820
within the political system,
then that is a big problem.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.650
And it's not just that
particular minority.

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:13.420
There are lots of other
minority groups as well.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.590
And so that, in a sense,
is why many, I think,

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:19.789
outsiders to India look at
the values that were enshrined

00:43:19.789 --> 00:43:21.455
in the constitution
and say, well, look,

00:43:21.455 --> 00:43:23.180
this is a pretty
good place to start.

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:23.910
It's not perfect.

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:25.493
But you don't want
to throw this away.

00:43:25.493 --> 00:43:28.524
Because with a country
as diverse as India,

00:43:28.524 --> 00:43:29.940
this is the sort
of thing that you

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.241
need to keep things
relatively stable.

00:43:32.241 --> 00:43:33.240
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: Yeah.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.601
I think one of the interesting
parts of the book, one

00:43:35.601 --> 00:43:37.350
of the parts that
really jumped out to me,

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:40.830
was when you talk
about the ghettoization

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.070
of the Muslim
population in Ahmedabad

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:46.140
in the aftermath of the
Godhra riots in 2002.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.800
And I think it
speaks to a kind of--

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.000
when you say it's
a swing state, it

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.330
could veer the
opposite direction.

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:56.040
But it's kind of a
crucible moment for India.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.460
JAMES CRABTREE: I mean, that's
a really good example of what--

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:00.480
so if you go to--

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.690
Narendra Modi grew up in the
northwestern state of Gujarat.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.310
And it's a sort of
interesting example

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:09.120
of a theoretical
question, which is,

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.210
do economic growth
and social harmony

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:14.430
necessarily go hand in hand?

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:17.490
In theory, people
in this room and me,

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:20.130
too, we like to think, let's
be nice to one another.

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:22.080
That will be good for growth.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.100
We'll all get along.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.900
And then the economy
will grow fine.

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.550
But actually, the
Indian lesson of that

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:28.030
is not necessarily the case.

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:32.100
So Gujarat has been one of
India's most successful states.

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.440
It's the closest that India
has to the Pearl River

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.020
Delta in China.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.240
It is industrialized.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.610
It's relatively corruption-free.

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:43.650
It attracts a lot of
foreign investment.

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:45.410
You have huge factories.

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:48.540
Ford have a huge
factory there, GE.

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:51.059
So it's sort of an
economic model for India.

00:44:51.059 --> 00:44:52.600
And many people look
at that and say,

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.099
OK, well, if we could have that
economy across all of India,

00:44:55.099 --> 00:44:56.560
India would be in
a great position.

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.100
You know, India is
already more like,

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:02.850
in many parts of the country,
so in that part of the country,

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:05.430
in Tamil Nadu where
your parents are from,

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.770
much more like a middle
income Southeast Asian country

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:09.860
than they are a sub-Saharan
African country.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.360
In fact, the bits of India that
look like sub-Saharan Africa

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.650
are really shrinking.

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:16.557
And pretty soon, extreme
poverty of that sort

00:45:16.557 --> 00:45:18.390
is going to be purely
an African phenomenon.

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.240
You're not going to see very
much of it even in South Asia.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:27.810
But the problem is that Gujarat
has really terrible politics,

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:32.310
very caste-based
politics, but particularly

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:34.200
brutal for the Muslim minority.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:38.130
And you see that in Ahmedabad,
where Muslims in Ahmedabad

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:40.530
live in a literal
ghetto, so not a ghetto

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:44.070
like you get in American
cities, which is somewhere

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:45.390
that only poor people live.

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:47.940
It's a ghetto like you
got in 19th century

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.910
European cities, where everybody
of that particular faith

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:54.840
lives-- so the Jews
in the Prague ghetto.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.760
In Ahmedabad, every
Muslim in the city

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.600
pretty much lives in one area.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.250
And they all moved there.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:02.290
It was already a sort
of heritage Muslim area.

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.630
But people flocked together
for strength in numbers

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:06.760
after the events in
2002 because they just

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.330
didn't believe
that the state was

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:09.580
going to protect their rights.

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:14.890
And so from the poorest chaiwala
to the guy who owns the BMW

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:17.900
dealership, they all
live in this area,

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:19.570
which is a couple of
kilometers square.

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:23.320
And that's a real
indictment of Modi's record

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.790
as a chief minister
and those who

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:27.250
have come after him,
that minorities feel

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:32.750
so unsafe, both in the capacity
of the state, the police

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:35.330
and other forces, to protect
them in instances of violence

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:40.430
but also their suspicion of
the motivations of the ruling

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:41.250
majority.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:45.440
And so that sort of thing
is potentially very damaging

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.130
in the medium term.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.620
But it doesn't
necessarily stop you

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.920
building factories and
export-focused manufacturing.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.860
So this is one of
the tensions I think

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:58.030
that India has to deal with.

00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:59.405
ARUN VENKATARAMAN:
You, go ahead.

00:46:59.405 --> 00:47:01.677
Looks like we have
another question.

00:47:01.677 --> 00:47:02.260
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.790
Thanks for coming here today.

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:07.210
So I actually moved
here five years ago.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:10.060
And the questions that
you raise here right now,

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:16.130
I kind of asked myself this
while growing up back in India.

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:19.360
And what was clear to me was
that, while the state itself

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:24.190
promises a lot of benefits
to close the gap of income

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:26.750
inequality and have a lot
of benefits for the farmers,

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:28.840
for the poor, but
somewhere in the line

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.710
of a lot of bureaucrats,
these benefits get lost.

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:36.280
And they never even reach
farmers or poor people

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.540
who they were intended
for basically.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.540
And so there's
this cycle, which I

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.670
think hasn't been broken
yet-- or I don't even

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:45.560
know if it can be broken--
of the state being corrupt,

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.040
like people not getting
economic mobility,

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:51.700
not having literacy, and
hence again backing up

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.760
politicians who exploit them
based on caste or religion.

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.700
And so the cycle
keeps on continuing.

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.920
So I don't see an end
in sight as to how

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.745
this cycle can be broken.

00:48:01.745 --> 00:48:03.370
Do you have any
thoughts on this matter

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:08.650
as to how economic mobility
can actually happen and break

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:12.290
this chain of caste-based
and religion-based politics?

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:15.280
I think that's the only way
forward for India to move

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.500
in a scalable, progressive way.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.140
But I don't see an end
in sight right now-- just

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.725
wanted your thoughts on that.

00:48:22.725 --> 00:48:24.100
JAMES CRABTREE:
Well, so I think,

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:30.680
again, my bias is to try and
look for reasons for optimism.

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.070
And I think you can find them.

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:33.300
Where are you from in India?

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:34.060
AUDIENCE: New Delhi.

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:34.976
JAMES CRABTREE: Right.

00:48:34.976 --> 00:48:35.960
So there we are.

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:39.190
So if you're from the north,
things always look bleaker.

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:43.210
But if you go to Southern India,
Southern India is by no means

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.920
perfect.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.600
But it's much better
than the north

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.070
in terms of economic
development,

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:49.780
in terms of the way
the state works.

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.180
Southern India, Southern
and Western India

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:57.550
look much more like Thailand
than, I don't know, Congo.

00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:01.910
The problems are very
North Indian issues.

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:05.650
So there are parts of
the country that perform

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:06.989
much better than others.

00:49:06.989 --> 00:49:08.530
And so that suggests
that if you have

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:11.890
different institutional
arrangements,

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:13.810
things can improve.

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:16.720
I mean, there are just
things about the way

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.670
the Indian political
system works, which

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:21.010
are quite hard to grasp.

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:24.430
You will understand them, but it
took me a while as an outsider.

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:26.860
One thing which surprises
you as soon as you go there

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.294
is, in Britain or America,
the upper middle classes

00:49:30.294 --> 00:49:31.210
vote in great numbers.

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:33.910
But the poor, those who
have less advantage,

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:36.532
often vote much less because
they see the system doesn't

00:49:36.532 --> 00:49:37.240
deliver for them.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.250
In India, it's precisely
the other way around.

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:42.250
Some of the lowest
voting figures

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:44.530
come from the richest
constituencies in the country,

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:46.030
in South Mumbai
and Central Delhi,

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:47.650
whereas if you're
a slum dweller,

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:49.690
you vote as a ritual act.

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:52.150
Absolutely everybody votes.

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:55.417
And that actually, in some
ways, entrenches the cycle

00:49:55.417 --> 00:49:56.500
that you're talking about.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:01.900
Because people attach themselves
to particular politicians.

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.530
Equally, tensions in
India, caste tensions,

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:09.200
religious tensions, do not
cause tensions in politics.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.700
It's typically the
other way around.

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:13.370
It's the cycle of elections
which cause these tensions.

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:17.470
Politicians whip up
fervor amongst their base.

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:21.760
This is not unknown amongst
politicians in this country

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.160
to sort of manipulate
and whip up fervor

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.710
amongst their base for
political mobilization purposes.

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:29.170
That happens a lot in India.

00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:32.710
I think in the end,
technocratic fixes

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:35.530
can begin to improve this.

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:40.390
So Arun, you mentioned
Aadhaar and what technology

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:41.530
can do to help.

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:43.990
I mean, in the end,
in the administration

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:48.510
of the beginnings of the
Indian social welfare state--

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:55.540
so giving money to people who
need it to feed their children

00:50:55.540 --> 00:51:00.154
or subsidies for fuel to
cook or free school meals--

00:51:00.154 --> 00:51:01.570
the administration
of these things

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:04.750
is often hopelessly corrupt.

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:07.120
But if you can move to
a system of, let's say,

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:11.440
direct cash transfers using a
combination of these identity

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.320
systems, mobile phones,
and bank accounts,

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.660
you could wipe out
almost at a stroke

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.120
all of the graft that
goes into those systems

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.250
and begin to create the
beginnings of a much more

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:22.330
supportive welfare state.

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:25.210
Now we're already
halfway down that road.

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:28.110
Now that won't make it
perfect, but it's an example

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:29.110
of what can be achieved.

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:34.930
But again, that's not to
underplay the distance

00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:36.310
that India still has to go.

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:40.191
I mean, it's very hard to do
what a country like Singapore

00:51:40.191 --> 00:51:40.690
did.

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:44.056
But even in Singapore,
it took 50 years.

00:51:44.056 --> 00:51:45.430
And so in a sense,
you're talking

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:48.250
about kind of
generational-long effort

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:51.850
to introduce the systems
and the governance reforms,

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:54.520
to invest in public
administration,

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.680
to think about how
technology can help,

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:57.810
but not just technology.

00:51:57.810 --> 00:51:59.810
Technology isn't going
to solve this on its own.

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:02.235
You need to pay public
officials good salaries

00:52:02.235 --> 00:52:03.610
so that they don't
feel they need

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:06.590
to take things under the
table, all sort of things.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:09.100
But other countries
have done this.

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.380
South Korea was
endemically corrupt.

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:16.000
So was Singapore when
Lee Kuan Yew took over.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.620
Other countries have managed
gradually to break this cycle,

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:21.910
as America did before it.

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:24.790
So again, with
wise public policy,

00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:26.880
it ought to be
possible to do it.

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.170
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: Do we have
time for one more question?

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:29.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think we
have time just for maybe

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:30.513
the two of us.

00:52:30.513 --> 00:52:32.096
I have a quick
question from the Dory,

00:52:32.096 --> 00:52:35.530
from Ramesh up in San Bruno.

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:37.670
Ramesh says, you had
mentioned, quote,

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:39.880
"radical options
have been ignored,

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.430
notably the privatization
of struggling public sector

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:43.750
lenders."

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:46.164
This is often discussed in
the media as the only option

00:52:46.164 --> 00:52:47.830
to save public sector
lenders, which are

00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:50.090
the backbone of rural India.

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:51.400
Why not other approaches?

00:52:53.611 --> 00:52:55.860
JAMES CRABTREE: Well, so
what we're talking about here

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:58.830
is the nature of India's
financial system, which

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:00.150
is fairly state-dominated.

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:02.370
3/4 of assets in
the financial system

00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:05.480
are held by state-backed banks.

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.410
A quarter are held by
private sector banks.

00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:10.750
Broadly speaking, the private
sector banks are pretty good--

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:11.940
not all of them.

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:12.930
They have their flaws.

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:14.940
But some of them are very good.

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.100
And they're the darling
of Western investors.

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:19.050
Broadly speaking, the
state-backed banks

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:20.992
are pretty hopeless.

00:53:20.992 --> 00:53:22.450
And so well, what
are your options?

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:25.280
You don't necessarily have
to privatize these things.

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.170
In fact, there are
theoretical risks

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:30.690
from doing mass
privatization programs.

00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:34.360
And I wouldn't actually
recommend that per se.

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:37.260
But some of them
can be sold off.

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.060
Some of them can
simply be reformed.

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:41.630
You introduce better
management, different.

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:44.940
You make the
governance independent.

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:50.600
You can sell down the stake that
the state holds to below 50%.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.150
So Singapore still has
substantial state holdings

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:57.020
of many of its formerly
state-run assets.

00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.650
You have a sort of golden share.

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:00.600
But you don't need
to control and run

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.394
the whole thing by bureaucrats.

00:54:02.394 --> 00:54:03.810
You can hand it
over to people who

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:05.530
actually know how to run banks.

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:10.670
So I don't think privatization
is the only answer.

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:12.870
I'm not a kind of
mad libertarian

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:15.900
who believes that you only
need to go down that route.

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:18.500
Nonetheless, India does have
a very unusual banking system

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:19.000
now.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.750
Only really China
and maybe Vietnam

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:24.420
have a banking system that is
as state-dominated as India.

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:27.877
Across the rest of the emerging
world and the rich world,

00:54:27.877 --> 00:54:29.460
typically you have
a different balance

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:30.780
between the state
and the market.

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.390
And the strategy that India is
following to reform its banking

00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:35.098
system at the moment
is clearly the worst

00:54:35.098 --> 00:54:37.407
of all worlds, which is
they've sort of given up

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:38.490
on the state-backed banks.

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:41.820
But they can't summon the
political will to reform them.

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:44.530
And they're just sort of
waiting for them to die.

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:46.350
And then the private
sector gradually,

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:49.770
by a sort of attritional
process, will win market share,

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:52.080
as it has been over
the last 10 years.

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:56.130
So it's sort of creeping up
from a fifth to a quarter

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:57.384
to a third.

00:54:57.384 --> 00:54:59.550
That's a terrible way to
reform your banking system,

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:01.140
because it takes an
awfully long time.

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:04.112
And in the end, the wastage,
as opposed to the alternative

00:55:04.112 --> 00:55:06.570
strategy, which is taking the
state-backed banks and either

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:08.986
aggressively reform them or
move some of them into private

00:55:08.986 --> 00:55:10.340
ownership, something--

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:13.680
introduce new forms
of banking that

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:16.320
have a heavy technological
component as well--

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.900
India is about to go through
the same sort of payments

00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:20.880
revolution that China
has been through--

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:25.420
then there's much quicker and
more optimistic set of reforms.

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:28.470
But at the moment, I have to say
the Indian government has not

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:30.670
covered itself in glory
on banking reform.

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:32.910
It's one of the weaker
areas of its reform agenda.

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:35.940
And so I think hopefully whoever
wins the next election, that

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:37.020
will be a big priority.

00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:38.760
Because it seems like a very--

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:44.460
it's a potential quick
win to unleash investment

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:47.170
in the economy.

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:47.820
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:49.830
Thanks for coming.

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:52.892
One thing I'd like to talk
about is patrimonialism.

00:55:52.892 --> 00:55:54.600
I mean, Mukesh Ambani,
who you mentioned,

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.100
his father was a
big businessman.

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:58.530
And there are large sections
of the political class

00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:03.100
who are there thanks to the
family connections or whatever.

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:05.710
And even in Bollywood,
it's the same.

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:08.070
So do you see that
as being something

00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:10.740
typical of economies that are
in this stage of development,

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:13.289
or is that unique to--

00:56:13.289 --> 00:56:14.580
what are your thoughts on that?

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.620
JAMES CRABTREE: Yeah, it's
interesting, isn't it?

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:22.170
You're right that in
politics, the lock hold

00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:26.250
of dynastic politics in India
has actually in some ways

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:30.480
got stronger over the
last 10 or 20 years.

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.520
So you have the
Nehru-Gandhi dynasty,

00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:36.360
which is famously the kind of
dynasty of the Congress Party.

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:38.610
One of the reasons why
Narendra Modi is so interesting

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:41.250
is he's not a dynasty.

00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:43.250
He doesn't have any children.

00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:45.540
And so he's not trying
to build a dynasty.

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:50.200
But for various sort of
sociological reasons,

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.380
many of which are
wound up in corruption,

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:55.770
having these dynastic
regimes in politics

00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:57.390
has become more common.

00:56:57.390 --> 00:57:00.840
And it's certainly a
feature of Indian capitalism

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.850
that the family-owned
conglomerate

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:07.080
remains the dominant form
of business ownership.

00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:09.450
And predictions
of the decline of

00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:13.794
the family-owned conglomerate
are often made by outsiders.

00:57:13.794 --> 00:57:15.210
And they very
rarely come to pass.

00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:18.900
In actual fact, it seems in many
ways as if that-- and its true

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:20.850
across Asia-- that
the conglomerate

00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:25.710
as a form of business remains
as dominant as ever it was.

00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:28.110
And so you mentioned
Mr. Mukesh Ambani.

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:31.710
His company has become
more conglomeratish

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:33.090
over the last five or 10 years.

00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:33.990
It's got broader.

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:35.550
And he's moved into more areas.

00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:41.540
I tend to think that
in the medium term--

00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:47.360
again, some of these factors
will decline a little bit.

00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.310
Part of the reasons
why conglomerates

00:57:49.310 --> 00:57:52.700
and family-owned conglomerates
are so dominant in India

00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:55.594
are because you need
to keep functions

00:57:55.594 --> 00:57:57.260
within the business
that typically would

00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:58.850
be done outside in other areas.

00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:02.090
So you need to recycle
capital within the business.

00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:07.280
You don't trust the legal
system to guarantee trade

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.160
with other companies.

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:10.580
So you keep them within
your own company.

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:14.390
As India moves towards a more
neutrally-administered sort

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:18.970
of pro-market, well-regulated
economy, some of that

00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:20.750
will dissipate.

00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:24.650
And again, if you can
fix parts of the funding

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:27.650
of the political system,
then some of the reasons

00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:30.579
for keeping all of the money
in the financial system,

00:58:30.579 --> 00:58:32.870
within the political system,
within different families,

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:34.380
will dissipate as well.

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:39.590
But I don't think India
is going to, in a sense,

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:42.740
end up where America
and Britain are.

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:45.680
The notion that the
form of modernity

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.527
that India is moving towards,
this sort of Francis Fukuyama

00:58:48.527 --> 00:58:50.360
model that we're all
going to kind of end up

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:53.177
with a form of Western
politics and capitalism,

00:58:53.177 --> 00:58:55.260
I think that's pretty
clearly not going to happen.

00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.890
And so wherever India
ends up is going

00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:59.830
to be its own form
of these things.

00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:03.224
And so I suspect some
form of dynastic politics

00:59:03.224 --> 00:59:04.640
and conglomerate-based
business is

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:07.156
going to be with us for
a long time to come.

00:59:07.156 --> 00:59:08.280
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: Amazing.

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:10.080
The book is called
"The Billionaire Raj."

00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:11.620
I'd highly, highly recommend it.

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.640
I think you do a phenomenal job
in just a series of portraits

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:17.670
of the billionaire Raj,
kind of this class,

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:20.160
really getting at a lot
of the thorny issues that

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.100
are central to India's
development over the course

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:24.890
of the next half century.

00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:26.140
Thanks, James, for being here.

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:26.550
JAMES CRABTREE: Excellent.

00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:27.091
Thanks a lot.

00:59:27.091 --> 00:59:28.590
It's a great thrill to be here.

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:32.240
