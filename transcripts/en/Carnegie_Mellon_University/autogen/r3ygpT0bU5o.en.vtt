00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.420
emerging technology so how can we help
it come together and how can we get out

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:00.430
it come together and how can we get out
 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.490
it come together and how can we get out
of the way because honestly doing our

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:02.500
of the way because honestly doing our
 

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.010
of the way because honestly doing our
governmental equity thing is sort of the

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:05.020
governmental equity thing is sort of the
 

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.810
governmental equity thing is sort of the
opposite like the Venn diagram of being

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:06.820
opposite like the Venn diagram of being
 

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.120
opposite like the Venn diagram of being
creative in government that's us

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:09.130
creative in government that's us
 

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:13.140
creative in government that's us
so how can we connect this really big

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:13.150
so how can we connect this really big
 

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.880
so how can we connect this really big
base of passengers and become the most

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:14.890
base of passengers and become the most
 

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.950
base of passengers and become the most
attractive place for anybody in the

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960
attractive place for anybody in the
 

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.870
attractive place for anybody in the
country especially here in Pittsburgh if

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:18.880
country especially here in Pittsburgh if

you're doing something new with

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:19.630
you're doing something new with
 

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.060
you're doing something new with
transportation you

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:21.070
transportation you
 

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.680
transportation you
should never have to leave to give it a

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:22.690
should never have to leave to give it a
 

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.590
should never have to leave to give it a
test drive so that's the nutshell and

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:25.600
test drive so that's the nutshell and
 

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.120
test drive so that's the nutshell and

well thank you all for having me here as
 

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.330
well thank you all for having me here as
well you know as we as we think about

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:36.340
well you know as we as we think about
 

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.100
well you know as we as we think about
smart cities and public-private

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:38.110
smart cities and public-private
 

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.770
smart cities and public-private
partnerships you know to what Leah said

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:40.780
partnerships you know to what Leah said
 

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.210
partnerships you know to what Leah said
a little bit earlier we kind of approach

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:42.220
a little bit earlier we kind of approach
 

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.200
a little bit earlier we kind of approach
it from what's the problem we're trying

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.210
it from what's the problem we're trying
 

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.780
it from what's the problem we're trying
to solve and then put the teams together

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:45.790
to solve and then put the teams together
 

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.370
to solve and then put the teams together
to figure out what the solution is so

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:47.380
to figure out what the solution is so
 

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.830
to figure out what the solution is so
setting that aside you know as we think

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:49.840
setting that aside you know as we think
 

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.680
setting that aside you know as we think
about smart cities and how that may play

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:52.690
about smart cities and how that may play
 

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.440
about smart cities and how that may play
into a public-private partnership it's

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:55.450
into a public-private partnership it's
 

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.820
into a public-private partnership it's
what the each of the parties bring to

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:56.830
what the each of the parties bring to
 

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.500
what the each of the parties bring to
the table and when we think about smart

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:58.510
the table and when we think about smart
 

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.360
the table and when we think about smart
cities you know we think about what are

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:00.370
cities you know we think about what are
 

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.580
cities you know we think about what are
the three pillars that kind of underpin

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:02.590
the three pillars that kind of underpin
 

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.740
the three pillars that kind of underpin
what's going to be required to make that

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:04.750
what's going to be required to make that
 

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.080
what's going to be required to make that
successful you know the first pillar we

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:07.090
successful you know the first pillar we
 

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.670
successful you know the first pillar we
think about it's got to cost-effectively

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:08.680
think about it's got to cost-effectively
 

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.860
think about it's got to cost-effectively
gather all the data that's out there so

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:10.870
gather all the data that's out there so
 

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.510
gather all the data that's out there so
that's infrastructure intensive and

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:12.520
that's infrastructure intensive and
 

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.010
that's infrastructure intensive and
that's a lot of devices that have to go

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:14.020
that's a lot of devices that have to go
 

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.840
that's a lot of devices that have to go
in the field the second thing that we

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:15.850
in the field the second thing that we
 

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:17.070
in the field the second thing that we
think about is you got to deliver the

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:17.080
think about is you got to deliver the
 

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.690
think about is you got to deliver the
data to the cloud so what's the

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:18.700
data to the cloud so what's the
 

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.160
data to the cloud so what's the
communication backbone and

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.170
communication backbone and
 

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:21.750
communication backbone and
infrastructure it's only get it up to

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760
infrastructure it's only get it up to
 

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.940
infrastructure it's only get it up to
the cloud then the third pillar we think

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:23.950
the cloud then the third pillar we think
 

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.980
the cloud then the third pillar we think
about is the application development

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:25.990
about is the application development
 

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.360
about is the application development
who's going to develop the apps how are

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:27.370
who's going to develop the apps how are
 

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.650
who's going to develop the apps how are
they going to have access to that data

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:28.660
they going to have access to that data
 

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:29.760
they going to have access to that data
how are they going to turn that into

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:29.770
how are they going to turn that into
 

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.560
how are they going to turn that into
meaningful information that could really

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:31.570
meaningful information that could really
 

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.660
meaningful information that could really
you know add value at the end of the day

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:33.670
you know add value at the end of the day
 

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.460
you know add value at the end of the day
so when we think about it you know

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:35.470
so when we think about it you know
 

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.950
so when we think about it you know
things that we do is a utility that we

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:37.960
things that we do is a utility that we
 

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.470
things that we do is a utility that we
think we do well is we build and operate

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480
think we do well is we build and operate
 

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.870
think we do well is we build and operate
networks we have a lot of assets in a

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880
networks we have a lot of assets in a
 

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.230
networks we have a lot of assets in a
field now we have polls that can be used

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240
field now we have polls that can be used
 

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.990
field now we have polls that can be used
for various devices depending on the

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.000
for various devices depending on the
 

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.700
for various devices depending on the
nature of the municipality the city of

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:50.710
nature of the municipality the city of
 

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.170
nature of the municipality the city of
Pittsburgh owns their own streetlights

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:52.180
Pittsburgh owns their own streetlights
 

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.640
Pittsburgh owns their own streetlights
but we own the streetlights and all of

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:53.650
but we own the streetlights and all of
 

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.230
but we own the streetlights and all of
the other municipalities are out there

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:55.240
the other municipalities are out there
 

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.270
the other municipalities are out there
so we have those assets that are into

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:57.280
so we have those assets that are into
 

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.360
so we have those assets that are into
the field we have a lot of Technology

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:00.370
the field we have a lot of Technology
 

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.400
the field we have a lot of Technology
across our system we're really good at

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:02.410
across our system we're really good at
 

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.800
across our system we're really good at
operating the SCADA system that we have

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:04.810
operating the SCADA system that we have
 

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.660
operating the SCADA system that we have
with thousands of devices that are

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:06.670
with thousands of devices that are
 

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.130
with thousands of devices that are
measuring in real time the flow of

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:08.140
measuring in real time the flow of
 

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.040
measuring in real time the flow of
electrical energy and then switching you

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.050
electrical energy and then switching you
 

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.020
electrical energy and then switching you
know switching schemes to you know run

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:13.030
know switching schemes to you know run
 

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.030
know switching schemes to you know run
this system very reliably and very safe

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040
this system very reliably and very safe
 

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.290
this system very reliably and very safe
and then we have the communication

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:16.300
and then we have the communication
 

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.210
and then we have the communication
backbone that goes across that as well

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:18.220
backbone that goes across that as well
 

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.760
backbone that goes across that as well
that takes all that data back you know

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:20.770
that takes all that data back you know
 

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.500
that takes all that data back you know
to our control rooms and to where we

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:22.510
to our control rooms and to where we
 

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.870
to our control rooms and to where we
apply logic to it we're deemed a

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880
apply logic to it we're deemed a
 

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.550
apply logic to it we're deemed a
critical infrastructure company so other

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560
critical infrastructure company so other
 

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.200
critical infrastructure company so other
things you think about is the security

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:28.210
things you think about is the security
 

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.390
things you think about is the security
of the data so you know we have really

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:30.400
of the data so you know we have really
 

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.970
of the data so you know we have really
perfected a lot of practices internally

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:32.980
perfected a lot of practices internally
 

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.800
perfected a lot of practices internally
to keep the system secure

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:34.810
to keep the system secure
 

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.710
to keep the system secure
or cyber secure so to speak so I think

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:37.720
or cyber secure so to speak so I think
 

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.600
or cyber secure so to speak so I think
as we think about public partnerships

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:39.610
as we think about public partnerships
 

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.860
as we think about public partnerships
there'll be a lot of us sitting here at

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:40.870
there'll be a lot of us sitting here at
 

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.450
there'll be a lot of us sitting here at
the table they bring different assets of

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:42.460
the table they bring different assets of
 

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.310
the table they bring different assets of
the table I think we have to think about

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320
the table I think we have to think about
 

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.830
the table I think we have to think about
how do we not replicate what's in the

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:46.840
how do we not replicate what's in the
 

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.510
how do we not replicate what's in the
field how do we take advantage of

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:48.520
field how do we take advantage of
 

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.790
field how do we take advantage of
existing assets that are there in such a

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800
existing assets that are there in such a
 

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.410
existing assets that are there in such a
way that we can leverage them you know

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:52.420
way that we can leverage them you know
 

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.150
way that we can leverage them you know
to make this become a more of a

00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:58.560
you look at the regulatory model when
 

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.370
you look at the regulatory model when
you start to venture into areas that

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:01.380
you start to venture into areas that
 

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.620
you start to venture into areas that
generate additional revenue when you go

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:03.630
generate additional revenue when you go
 

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.570
generate additional revenue when you go
in for your base business they use that

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:05.580
in for your base business they use that
 

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.760
in for your base business they use that
as a revenue offset what which you would

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:07.770
as a revenue offset what which you would
 

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.050
as a revenue offset what which you would
be requiring with the rate increase

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:09.060
be requiring with the rate increase
 

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.180
be requiring with the rate increase
which theoretically major taking on more

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:11.190
which theoretically major taking on more
 

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.980
which theoretically major taking on more
operational risk and you get no reward

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:12.990
operational risk and you get no reward
 

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.720
operational risk and you get no reward
for that operational risk so the model

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:14.730
for that operational risk so the model
 

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.970
for that operational risk so the model
has to change to attract the capital

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:16.980
has to change to attract the capital
 

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.310
has to change to attract the capital
from our investor base to be able to

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320
from our investor base to be able to
 

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.410
from our investor base to be able to
leverage infrastructure that we have

already in the field I think from the
 

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.430
already in the field I think from the
city standpoint we're obviously a fairly

city standpoint we're obviously a fairly
 

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.340
city standpoint we're obviously a fairly

where our street lights are mounted but

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:42.540
where our street lights are mounted but
 

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.810
where our street lights are mounted but
we have many decorative light poles that

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:44.820
we have many decorative light poles that
 

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.850
we have many decorative light poles that
we own we have public buildings that we

we own we have public buildings that we
 

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.100
we own we have public buildings that we
own all over the city so we have a lot

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:49.110
own all over the city so we have a lot
 

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.560
own all over the city so we have a lot
of infrastructure that's well spread out

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:51.570
of infrastructure that's well spread out
 

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.090

across the city that could be leveraged

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.100
across the city that could be leveraged
 

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.240

smart corridors I think the challenge

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:05.340
smart corridors I think the challenge
 

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.480
smart corridors I think the challenge
for us is in kind of our interest is

making sure that the data backhaul is is
 

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.490
making sure that the data backhaul is is
there and it's something that is

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:14.500
there and it's something that is
 

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.920

part of that process
 

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.270
part of that process
we're opening the door for future

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280
we're opening the door for future
 

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.530
we're opening the door for future
implementations and providing an

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:31.540
implementations and providing an
 

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.300
implementations and providing an
infrastructure that will provide the

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:33.310
infrastructure that will provide the
 

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.880
infrastructure that will provide the

implementations and not just considering

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:37.750
implementations and not just considering
 

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.980
implementations and not just considering
this one particular use case around the

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:40.990
this one particular use case around the
 

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.690
this one particular use case around the
the streetlight conversion so that's

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:42.700
the streetlight conversion so that's
 

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.160
the streetlight conversion so that's
that's kind of been a challenge for us

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:44.170
that's kind of been a challenge for us
 

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.870
that's kind of been a challenge for us
is figuring out the right way to go

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880
is figuring out the right way to go
 

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.830
is figuring out the right way to go
forward with that I can talk a little

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840
forward with that I can talk a little
 

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.510
forward with that I can talk a little
bit about where we're coming from as a

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520
bit about where we're coming from as a
 

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.790
bit about where we're coming from as a
technology provider about some of the

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:53.800
technology provider about some of the
 

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.920
technology provider about some of the
sensors for example videos so there was

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:55.930
sensors for example videos so there was
 

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.900
sensors for example videos so there was
a lot of talk today about what video can

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:57.910
a lot of talk today about what video can
 

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.400
a lot of talk today about what video can
do I mean it's not just a video I think

00:19:59.400 --> 00:19:59.410
do I mean it's not just a video I think
 

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.500
do I mean it's not just a video I think
really it's the edge computing that was

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:01.510
really it's the edge computing that was
 

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.240
really it's the edge computing that was
talked about even the cloud computing

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:03.250
talked about even the cloud computing
 

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.800
talked about even the cloud computing
but I think it's really the analytics

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:04.810
but I think it's really the analytics
 

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.170
but I think it's really the analytics
that you can derive in the data that you

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:07.180
that you can derive in the data that you
 

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.120
that you can derive in the data that you
can derive from sensors like video

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:09.130
can derive from sensors like video
 

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.070
can derive from sensors like video
cameras and I'm not talking the video

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.080
cameras and I'm not talking the video
 

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.480
cameras and I'm not talking the video
itself it's what we would call the

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:12.490
itself it's what we would call the
 

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.190
itself it's what we would call the
metadata so I think it was described as

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200
metadata so I think it was described as
 

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.680
metadata so I think it was described as
little pixels and those devices but

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:16.690
little pixels and those devices but
 

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.540
little pixels and those devices but
things like counting people you know we

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:18.550
things like counting people you know we
 

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.030
things like counting people you know we
can do traffic counting we can also do a

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:21.040
can do traffic counting we can also do a
 

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.680
can do traffic counting we can also do a
lot of different things but what we

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:22.690
lot of different things but what we
 

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.420
lot of different things but what we
would provide as the technology

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:24.430
would provide as the technology
 

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.130
would provide as the technology
solutions provider is the the data

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:26.140
solutions provider is the the data
 

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.560
solutions provider is the the data
source so our sensors that would be put

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:28.570
source so our sensors that would be put
 

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.990
source so our sensors that would be put
up on whether its utility poles or its

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.000
up on whether its utility poles or its
 

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.270
up on whether its utility poles or its
street lights can provide the data input

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280
street lights can provide the data input
 

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.460
street lights can provide the data input
and a lot of these sensors to be quite

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:35.470
and a lot of these sensors to be quite
 

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:36.660
and a lot of these sensors to be quite
honest have come from our mobility

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:36.670
honest have come from our mobility
 

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.540
honest have come from our mobility
sector and that is our largest business

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:39.550
sector and that is our largest business
 

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.550
sector and that is our largest business
sector within the Boche group a lot of

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:41.560
sector within the Boche group a lot of
 

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.320
sector within the Boche group a lot of
these sensors are very robust they've

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:43.330
these sensors are very robust they've
 

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.170
these sensors are very robust they've
been developed for extreme environments

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:45.180
been developed for extreme environments
 

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.610
been developed for extreme environments
but they're also very cost effective

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:47.620
but they're also very cost effective
 

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.980
but they're also very cost effective
because the the base micro sensors that

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:49.990
because the the base micro sensors that
 

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.320
because the the base micro sensors that
go into them are built in volumes of

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:52.330
go into them are built in volumes of
 

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.060
go into them are built in volumes of
millions in some cases tens of millions

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:54.070
millions in some cases tens of millions
 

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.790
millions in some cases tens of millions
so where we see we can offer for a more

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:56.800
so where we see we can offer for a more
 

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.040
so where we see we can offer for a more
cost-effective solution again is taking

00:20:59.040 --> 00:20:59.050
cost-effective solution again is taking
 

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.810
cost-effective solution again is taking
advantage of the existing infrastructure

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:00.820
advantage of the existing infrastructure
 

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.120
advantage of the existing infrastructure
adding these additional sensors but it's

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.130
adding these additional sensors but it's
 

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.890
adding these additional sensors but it's
really deriving the data that other

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:04.900
really deriving the data that other
 

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.720
really deriving the data that other
policies and planning decisions could be

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:06.730
policies and planning decisions could be
 

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:12.600
policies and planning decisions could be
made so in the past years one of the big

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:12.610
made so in the past years one of the big
 

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.730
made so in the past years one of the big
topics in transportation is why can't

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:14.740
topics in transportation is why can't
 

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.440
topics in transportation is why can't
you do more business with uber and lyft

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:16.450
you do more business with uber and lyft
 

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.480
you do more business with uber and lyft
and and they have an excellent

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:18.490
and and they have an excellent
 

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.940
and and they have an excellent
application and we can't we shouldn't

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:20.950
application and we can't we shouldn't
 

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.110
application and we can't we shouldn't
compete with that because they just do

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120
compete with that because they just do
 

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.700
compete with that because they just do
it better but it's been very challenging

it better but it's been very challenging
 

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.070
it better but it's been very challenging
for entities that do partner with them

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.840
to get data back
because you know from my perspective

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:28.850

their value is in the data that they're
 

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.150
their value is in the data that they're
collecting like there's not a thing

about me that lyft doesn't know and and

about me that lyft doesn't know and and
 

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.250
about me that lyft doesn't know and and
that's that's got a lot of value

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:37.260
that's that's got a lot of value
 

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.690
that's that's got a lot of value
especially if it follows me past the end

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:38.700
especially if it follows me past the end
 

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.910
especially if it follows me past the end
of my location so of course that's their

of my location so of course that's their
 

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.350

so so we've we've had discussions with a

so so we've we've had discussions with a
 

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.350
so so we've we've had discussions with a
lot of partners in Pittsburgh about we

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360
lot of partners in Pittsburgh about we
 

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.660
lot of partners in Pittsburgh about we
have terabytes of data to move how can

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:35.670
have terabytes of data to move how can
 

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.090
have terabytes of data to move how can
you help us now terabytes is a little

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100
you help us now terabytes is a little

you help us now terabytes is a little
beyond Wireless at this point but it

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:39.630
beyond Wireless at this point but it

beyond Wireless at this point but it
won't be beyond Wireless

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:40.710
won't be beyond Wireless
 

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.279
won't be beyond Wireless
ever and that's where the fiber assets

00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:43.289
ever and that's where the fiber assets
 

00:23:43.289 --> 00:23:44.720
ever and that's where the fiber assets
that we've talked about come into play

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:44.730
that we've talked about come into play

that we've talked about come into play
so having a part of the partnership is

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:47.250
so having a part of the partnership is
 

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.430
so having a part of the partnership is
building a regulatory environment that

building a regulatory environment that
is not without regular dilation I'm

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:51.630
is not without regular dilation I'm
 

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.970
is not without regular dilation I'm
certainly not arguing for that at all

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:52.980
certainly not arguing for that at all
 

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.049
certainly not arguing for that at all
but just getting to the point where

00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:54.059
but just getting to the point where
 

00:23:54.059 --> 00:23:56.450
but just getting to the point where

transactional and repetitive right and
if we can get a construct in the policy

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:01.289
if we can get a construct in the policy
 

00:24:01.289 --> 00:24:03.350
if we can get a construct in the policy
that enables infrastructure to be ployed

kickoff to the discussion I mean so

00:24:15.139 --> 00:24:15.149
kickoff to the discussion I mean so
 

00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:17.870
kickoff to the discussion I mean so
there are two sort of points being made

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880
there are two sort of points being made
 

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.289
there are two sort of points being made
I think one relates to sort of a

00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:21.299
I think one relates to sort of a
 

00:24:21.299 --> 00:24:24.680
I think one relates to sort of a
different approach to regulation on the

but from our perspective that the data
 

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.770
but from our perspective that the data
can also mean new business models so

app but you can do the process so it's a
 

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.050
app but you can do the process so it's a
multi-modal approach now it's not

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:21.060
multi-modal approach now it's not
 

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.090

and a good example of this in San

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580
and a good example of this in San
 

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.149

00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159
Francisco Bay Area Transit Muni just
 

00:28:29.159 --> 00:28:31.880
Francisco Bay Area Transit Muni just
post all their open-source data and then

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:31.890
post all their open-source data and then
 

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.350
post all their open-source data and then
they let people build all the apps that

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360
they let people build all the apps that
 

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.510
they let people build all the apps that
they want which goes into a security

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520
they want which goes into a security
 

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.730
they want which goes into a security
constraint and a security concern of how

you investing in your firewalls and your
 

00:28:41.159 --> 00:28:43.279
you investing in your firewalls and your
cyber security and is it worth it to do

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:43.289
cyber security and is it worth it to do
 

00:28:43.289 --> 00:28:44.990
cyber security and is it worth it to do
that to leave the data open I'll leave

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000
that to leave the data open I'll leave
 

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.549
that to leave the data open I'll leave
that up to the folks who who know what

standard for the data that we're pushing
 

00:28:57.149 --> 00:28:58.370
standard for the data that we're pushing
out and then that we have to bring back

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:58.380
out and then that we have to bring back
 

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.710
out and then that we have to bring back
to consume that would that would save a

to consume that would that would save a
 

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.210
to consume that would that would save a
lot of your tax dollars and to the point

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:02.220
lot of your tax dollars and to the point
 

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.919

on data ownership our philosophy is if

on data ownership our philosophy is if

on data ownership our philosophy is if
tax payers have funded it it belongs

mean that an individual person wants to
have all our data no but they should be

have all our data no but they should be
 

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.220
have all our data no but they should be
able to get it from us in a really

able to get it from us in a really

because you've already paid for it I
would add that in this this will be a

would add that in this this will be a
 

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.480
would add that in this this will be a
little bit of the negative side of the

something to add to this because that's

something to add to this because that's

no no no I'm just saying if you think
 

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.460
no no no I'm just saying if you think
about our early computers there was no

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:23.550
and I'm just talking to censors I'm not
 

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:24.980

even talking date of the date everything

even talking date of the date everything
 

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:26.480
even talking date of the date everything
said about data I completely agree with

said about data I completely agree with

said about data I completely agree with
but just even that the protocols and the

but just even that the protocols and the

but just even that the protocols and the
security of the devices were putting out

security of the devices were putting out
 

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.620
security of the devices were putting out
there is a real significant concern and

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:33.630
there is a real significant concern and
 

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:34.460
there is a real significant concern and
they're met there are a lot of people

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:34.470
they're met there are a lot of people
 

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:36.620
they're met there are a lot of people
working on that but it is it is by no

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:36.630
working on that but it is it is by no
 

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.660
working on that but it is it is by no
means settled science at this point I

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:38.670
means settled science at this point I
 

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.549
means settled science at this point I
guarantee everyone in this room has had

00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559
guarantee everyone in this room has had

that thing where you're talking to

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:41.550
that thing where you're talking to
 

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:42.830
that thing where you're talking to
someone and you think of your phone to

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840
someone and you think of your phone to
 

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.570
someone and you think of your phone to
Google and your phone is already telling

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:44.580
Google and your phone is already telling
 

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.520
Google and your phone is already telling
you what you were looking for mmm we've

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:46.530
you what you were looking for mmm we've
 

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:48.260
you what you were looking for mmm we've
all had that that's just coincidental

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:48.270
all had that that's just coincidental
 

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:52.370
all had that that's just coincidental
right yeah what I would add is that what

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:52.380
right yeah what I would add is that what
 

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.690
right yeah what I would add is that what
we have targeted is all of our

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:53.700
we have targeted is all of our
 

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.460
we have targeted is all of our
electronic devices will be connected by

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:55.470
electronic devices will be connected by
 

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:57.530
electronic devices will be connected by
2020 and we're talking millions of

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:57.540
2020 and we're talking millions of
 

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.350
2020 and we're talking millions of
devices so we've actually I think it was

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360
devices so we've actually I think it was
 

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.180
devices so we've actually I think it was
in 2012 we bought a company called s

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:02.190
in 2012 we bought a company called s
 

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:04.040
in 2012 we bought a company called s
crypt which was a small startup out of

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:04.050
crypt which was a small startup out of
 

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:05.840
crypt which was a small startup out of
Germany and their focus is cyber

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:05.850
Germany and their focus is cyber
 

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.360
Germany and their focus is cyber
security and so we've this is another

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:08.370
security and so we've this is another
 

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:09.980
security and so we've this is another
company that again it was developed and

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:09.990
company that again it was developed and
 

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.590
company that again it was developed and
bought in regard to the mobility sector

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600
bought in regard to the mobility sector
 

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.820
bought in regard to the mobility sector
because we were connecting all the

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:13.830
because we were connecting all the
 

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.950
because we were connecting all the
vehicles and connected cars but now

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960
vehicles and connected cars but now
 

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.690
vehicles and connected cars but now
we're looking at it in exactly the light

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:17.700
we're looking at it in exactly the light
 

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.919
we're looking at it in exactly the light
you're saying is that all of these

00:31:18.919 --> 00:31:18.929
you're saying is that all of these
 

00:31:18.929 --> 00:31:21.020
you're saying is that all of these
devices will be connected it's not only

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:21.030
devices will be connected it's not only
 

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:23.150
devices will be connected it's not only
the the security purposes but there's

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:23.160
the the security purposes but there's
 

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.610
the the security purposes but there's
privacy so an amenities so once we

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:25.620
privacy so an amenities so once we
 

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.560
privacy so an amenities so once we
collect all of this data it should be

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:27.570
collect all of this data it should be
 

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:29.450
collect all of this data it should be
anonymous data and so one of the areas

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:29.460
anonymous data and so one of the areas
 

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.100
anonymous data and so one of the areas

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:33.010
better that took more than a year and a
half to really hone the processes but

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:33.020
half to really hone the processes but
 

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.050
half to really hone the processes but
once we got it right we had very few

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:35.060
once we got it right we had very few
 

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.730
once we got it right we had very few
instances where we were making

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:36.740
instances where we were making
 

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.010
instances where we were making
investments and then having the Conny or

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:39.020
investments and then having the Conny or
 

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.350
investments and then having the Conny or
the city coming in and with the decision

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:41.360
the city coming in and with the decision
 

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.880
the city coming in and with the decision
to widen a road that they knew about at

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:42.890
to widen a road that they knew about at
 

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:44.110
to widen a road that they knew about at
the time we were doing it and then we'd

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:44.120
the time we were doing it and then we'd
 

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:45.850
the time we were doing it and then we'd
have to move that infrastructure so if

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:45.860
have to move that infrastructure so if
 

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:46.780
have to move that infrastructure so if
you think about it's all the same

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:46.790
you think about it's all the same
 

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:49.120
you think about it's all the same
constituents right so at the end of the

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:49.130
constituents right so at the end of the
 

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:50.890
constituents right so at the end of the
day that causes our costs to go up which

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:50.900
day that causes our costs to go up which
 

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.690
day that causes our costs to go up which
are the same constituents the city you

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:52.700
are the same constituents the city you
 

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.430

word for you really just just a quick
story and this was a project that and we

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880
story and this was a project that and we
 

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.610
story and this was a project that and we
use it internally as a lessons learned

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:06.620
use it internally as a lessons learned
 

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.130

that was done in Singapore where we

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:09.140
that was done in Singapore where we
 

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.720

stood up an electric vehicle charging

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:10.730
stood up an electric vehicle charging
 

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:14.020
stood up an electric vehicle charging
network with multiple charge point

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:14.030
network with multiple charge point
 

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.900
network with multiple charge point
operators and I think in the in the end

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:16.910
operators and I think in the in the end
 

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:19.720
operators and I think in the in the end
it was 74 different charging point

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:19.730
it was 74 different charging point
 

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.150
it was 74 different charging point
stations I think it was three or four

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160
stations I think it was three or four
 

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.070

was very happy but the problem was there
 

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:32.930
was very happy but the problem was there
was no electric vehicles

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:32.940
was no electric vehicles
 

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.940
was no electric vehicles
[Laughter]

internally as the lessons learned and we
 

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:50.240
internally as the lessons learned and we
hope to take some of those lessons

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:50.250
hope to take some of those lessons
 

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:52.220
hope to take some of those lessons
learns and deploy those in cities so
