00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.710
PAUL KINLAN: Hi, guys.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.250
I'm Paul Kinlan, I'm a developer
advocate at Google

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.540
working on Chrome.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.500
I've also worked on the
Web Lab project.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.090
And we're going to talk
about it today.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.400
So I'm with Roger and Mattias.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.150
I keep getting your name
slightly wrong,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.430
every single time.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.420
So I apologize for this.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.030
Well, yeah anyway, so these are

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.580
engineers from the project.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.460
You're at B-Reel.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.210
Try and give yourselves a brief
introduction, to tell

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.020
people what you do.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.900
ROGER PALA: I'm Roger.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.560
I'm a creative technologist at
B-Reel, and I've been the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.540
technical leader
of the project.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.130
MATTIAS EKENDAHL:
And I'm Mattias.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.960
I'm also a creative
technologist, also at B-Reel.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.900
And I've been mostly focused on
the orchestra, but that's

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.930
for another day.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.960
PAUL KINLAN: So another time.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.790
I was going to say save the best
for last, but they're all

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.970
equally good.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.870
So anyway, today's
experiments.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.790
You know what, I'll jump
back a little bit.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.745
I'll tell everyone what
Web Lab is case it's

00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:05.780
your first time here.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.410
So Web Lab is a series of five
real world Chrome experiments

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.670
built at the British Science
Museum, but are also

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.810
accessible online as well.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.670
So over the past couple of
Hangouts, we talked about some

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.580
of the other experiments, and
today we're going to talk

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.340
about Data Tracer.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.850
Do you guys want to give a brief
overview of the Data

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.345
Tracer project?

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:29.240
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah, so it's
a visualization of where

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.730
stuff is located on the
internet, and how fast it goes

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.620
for you to find it.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.060
It's about finding the images.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.860
ROGER PALA: Yeah, the whole
concept about Web Lab is

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.290
revealing kind of
like the inner

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.670
workings of the internet.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.740
So there's things that we
usually do on the internet.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.035
Sometimes for example, when
you look for an image in

00:01:53.035 --> 00:01:57.870
Google search, and it
comes instantly.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.620
Sometimes when it takes a
little bit longer you're

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.540
already a bit annoyed
about it.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.640
And you don't really realize
that what is actually

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.669
happening behind it
is so amazing.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.190
And it's like that is
what is happening.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.420
It goes to a place like very,
very far away and it comes

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.890
back to you.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.940
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I think
that's one of the things that

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.310
people on the internet--
well people on the

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.110
internet, the internet!

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.960
A lot of people don't understand
how data gets to

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.700
the machine that's
on your computer.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.090
And the thing I like about
this project at least it

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.490
literally is the underpinnings
of the internet.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.430
People think you can just go
straight to the machine and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.850
pull it out.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.000
And that doesn't
happen, right.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.130
You don't have a direct
connection.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.940
You have to go through one, two,
three, four, 20 different

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.710
hops just get the data back.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.260
20 different machines on
the internet just to

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.320
get the data back.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.540
And this is there to help
visualize that.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.330
So this is an experiment, a
physical experiment in the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.120
British Science Museum
and also online.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.210
Shall we just have
a quick look.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.026
It'd be a pretty boring Hangout
if we didn't have a

00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:04.155
quick look.

00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:06.400
And again my common theme.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.130
I love these little animations
I think they're beautiful.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.050
And they were done in Flash
originally and imported

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.440
through via Swiffy,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.900
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yep.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.820
PAUL KINLAN: There we go.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.790
So every Hangout you're
going to see is me

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.460
talking about this.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.480
[LAUGHS]

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.770
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.670
So this is the is Data
Tracer project.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.590
Do you want to kind of give us
a little understanding of

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.170
what's happening on it?

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.345
It's quite visceral.

00:03:22.345 --> 00:03:25.940
ROGER PALA: Yeah, so here we can
see the beginning of the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.760
generation of the world map that
we use to visualize all

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.050
the trace routes.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.890
It is done in WebGL.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.760
And this map is generated
dynamically.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.000
We used a map from NASA to get
the elevation from each of the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.210
areas of the world.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.350
And then we tweak it a little
bit because there were some

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.950
regions that weren't
looking that nice.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.050
PAUL KINLAN: Quite flat?

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.080
ROGER PALA: Yeah
some very flat.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.650
PAUL KINLAN: I can imagine quite
a lot of places at sea

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.690
level where they might look
like the sea, right?

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.890
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.960
We had to do it this kind of
model with the sea as well.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.390
PAUL KINLAN: This actually looks
like some of the games

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.410
I've played online quite
a while ago.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.120
They were pretty cool.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.585
Looks actually beautiful.

00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:14.570
So I mean how does this directly
relate to the real

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.399
world experiment
in the museum?

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.500
Because there's a model at the
museum isn't there as well?

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.490
ROGER PALA: Yeah, so this map
was generated online using a

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.210
browser and WebGL.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.660
Basically coding.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.570
And then from this 3D model
generated with WebGL, we

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.800
generated--

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.330
we used [INAUDIBLE], basically,
to generate the

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.480
real map that we use
in the museum to do

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.940
some projection mapping.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.130
PAUL KINLAN: So like the real
world map is based off the

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.410
WebGL digital representation
that you made.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.030
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.940
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.920
It's a pretty big map, right?

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.890
So I take it you printed small,
was it smaller pieces

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.090
like little chunks and then kind
of assemble them up or

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.210
was it like-- would you build
Australia in one go?

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.660
ROGER PALA: I'm not
entirely sure.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.590
This was done by our
partner Tellart.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.980
PAUL KINLAN: Tellart.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.820
ROGER PALA: They were in charge
of the instruments in

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.350
the museum.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.780
All of the experiments
in the museum.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.250
And I'm not sure, yeah.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.485
PAUL KINLAN: It's pretty cool.

00:05:14.485 --> 00:05:16.160
I remember seeing-- it's
huge in the museum

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.790
as well, isn't it?

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.270
ROGER PALA: It is,
it is very big.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.330
PAUL KINLAN: We can see on the
screen now it's like four--

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.080
this a live stream and it's
relatively late at night so

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.720
there's no one there
at the moment.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.570
Yeah, but we have four consoles
where you can kind of

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.630
select an image.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.750
I think they're hand-selected
images aren't they, I think?

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.050
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.210
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.830
PAUL KINLAN: I didn't want
people searching for--

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.787
well, whatever.

00:05:33.787 --> 00:05:36.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.960
ROGER PALA: It's basically the
same experience, but using

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.980
this kind of tablet instead
of a computer.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:41.690
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.520
So it's all touch sensitive
screens and stuff isn't it?

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.980
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:45.770
PAUL KINLAN: So let's
scroll back in.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.680
And so this is the actual Web
Lab, the visualization

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.970
that we have now.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.110
And as we can see these blue
lines, why are they coming out

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.420
of the screen at the moment?

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.900
ROGER PALA: These are searches
from users, from other users

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.270
at the moment.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.230
And we can see that one
interesting thing is that we

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.330
highlight Web Lab on the map.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.890
And this is because how the
tracing works is that it needs

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.900
to always go through a server
that is located in the museum.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.450
So when you look for an image
what we are really

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.730
tracing is not from--

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.210
so it's not from our location
in the moment.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.730
It's always from the
science museum.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.270
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.240
I kind of like how it all
seems to go across the

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.140
Atlantic into pretty
much New York.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.180
You know, I think is it the
Port Authority building or

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.650
something there.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.790
It seemed like in the late 90's
that was one of the most

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.720
connected buildings on the
internet, as well.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.360
Pretty crazy.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.480
I like as well how the routes
dart backwards and forwards

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.466
across the country and
a lot of the stuff's

00:06:48.466 --> 00:06:49.430
based America it seems.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.700
But you don't realize when
you're searching for something

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.290
where you're actually getting
the data from and how it

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.045
actually travels across.

00:06:57.045 --> 00:06:58.100
It's pretty cool.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.570
Oh there's an image
as well, nice.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.455
Should we do a little search?

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:02.830
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.630
PAUL KINLAN: What shall
we search for?

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.840
Something British?

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.350
We haven't prepared
this beforehand.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.960
ROGER PALA: Fish and chips.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.570
PAUL KINLAN: Fish and chips.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.760
That's a really good idea.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.410
Fish and chips.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.940
I'm going to say watch
the results come in.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.190
They'll be the worst
results ever now.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.380
I can't remember which one.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.490
It's the first one,
let's have a look.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.180
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: This is
absolutely not prepared.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.040
PAUL KINLAN: This is absolutely

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.240
not prepared, honest.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.610
PAUL KINLAN: So yeah, something
British we get from

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.570
England, and let's see
where the data goes.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.430
It must be somewhere inside
the UK that we're bringing

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.870
this image from, right?

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:42.470
This is pretty cool.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.720
So it's tracing the route
of the image.

00:07:46.225 --> 00:07:47.220
Oh, interesting.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.120
ROGER PALA: So you can see the
camera following there.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.160
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: It
goes to the States.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.990
PAUL KINLAN: Tempe, El Segundo,
back across to

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.530
Herndon there, back
across again.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.520
That's a pretty insane route.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.220
I mean, I think the thing that
for me that this highlights is

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.330
that the routing system
is designed to

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.180
be resilient, right?

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.446
And which means it's not
always optimized

00:08:12.446 --> 00:08:13.790
for the best path.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.400
The best path route.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.970
This actually might be the
cheapest route, cost per

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.260
carrier for instance.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.620
I always remember doing in
like university we'd talk

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.140
about how the [? BGP ?] routed
and how all these types of

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.990
kind of routing protocols
work.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.450
And you sometimes think it's the
quickest route from A to

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.150
B. It's not always, right?

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.490
It's like the cheapest
route sometimes.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.870
If you've got a paid connection
with another

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.289
provider, you'll send it out
that way because it's cheaper

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.440
to send data across that link
than say another link that you

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.300
aren't paid with.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.390
I don't know, but we don't
know whether that

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.230
happened in this case.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.990
But it's kind of interesting
that it took 0.4 seconds to

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.530
get across 16,000 kilometers,
which is pretty cool.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.003
And I kind of looked at the
little stats that you have.

00:08:54.003 --> 00:08:57.310
Your trace route took 0.42
seconds to reach its

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.150
destination.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:04.120
That's 400,000 times faster than
a Formula One car It just

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.980
shows you even though we're
separated by this huge expanse

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.556
of the world, essentially,
you can actually--

00:09:11.556 --> 00:09:13.460
ROGER PALA: Access
data very easily.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.720
Really quickly.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.330
PAUL KINLAN: I always think it's
kind of interesting there

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.806
are some like theoretical
limits, there

00:09:17.806 --> 00:09:19.200
is a speed of light.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:19.650
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.560
PAUL KINLAN: And all this
type of stuff we

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.666
can't quite get around.

00:09:22.666 --> 00:09:23.180
But let's just turn back.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.783
So we'll zoom out you can kind
of roughly see the path that

00:09:25.783 --> 00:09:27.033
that was going across.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.180
Yeah I find it kind of
quite interesting.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.880
Some of the stuff that I
find most interesting--

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.410
which I don't know whether
this is kind

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.580
of Tellart or not--

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.000
is the traceroute protocol.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
We should probably explain
traceroute, shouldn't we?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.340
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.140
PAUL KINLAN: So a lot of people
watching this are

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.510
probably quite technical, and
you probably know about ping

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.020
and traceroute, these commands
that you use to assess the

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.310
network health essentially.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:56.930
Ping will normally--

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.160
basically you're saying I need
to ping google.com, and then

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.400
it will fire a packet
of data, a piece of

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.270
data across to Google.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.580
And if it doesn't reach Google,
it basically says

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.390
network unreachable, and you
know there's a problem

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.630
somewhere on the internet.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.580
But you don't know
where, right?

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.990
You don't know whether it's any
one of those 10 hops to

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.520
get to Google, or whether it's
just your connection, or

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.120
whether it's the entirety
of Google, or

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.720
some other the service--

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.300
I probably can't say
Google too much--

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.496
is down.

00:10:23.496 --> 00:10:24.820
And then traceroute
is designed to

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:25.660
complement that, right?

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.880
Traceroute sends a packet
straight across to your

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.613
server, another.com.

00:10:32.613 --> 00:10:35.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.800
PAUL KINLAN: It sends it out
to these different places.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.320
But what it does is, it doesn't
send it straight away.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.980
There's a thing called a
time-to-live value on each

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.850
packet of data that you send.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.410
And this is basically to ensure
that the data doesn't--

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.680
we saw it bounce
around, right?

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.280
We sent a packet across
to get an image.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.050
And we saw it bounce around
America a couple times before

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.660
it actually got to
the image itself.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.750
Now there are some controls
and make sure that packet

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.220
doesn't always bounce
around the internet.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.630
It might get stuck in some
weird loop of routing.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.765
If like one router says, send it
that way, and then another

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:08.320
router says, send it back
because that's the cheapest

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.660
route to get to the network.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.250
There's like some weird things
going across in the networks.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.940
It's very unlikely for that
to happen, I must say.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.055
But there's a thing called TTL
which is basically on each

00:11:17.055 --> 00:11:21.085
packet that says how many hops
can each packet make across

00:11:21.085 --> 00:11:22.480
the internet.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.180
I can't remember if it's 25.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.140
I don't know what
the default is.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.225
Essentially if it was 25, you
could go through 25 different

00:11:29.225 --> 00:11:31.620
routers before the packet would
just be discarded, and

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.890
said it didn't reach the host.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.670
To cut a really long story
short, traceroute basically

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.320
sets TTL to one.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.100
So that the first router it
reaches sends the response

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.790
back saying basically,
it reached here.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.590
Which means that you can kind of
see the IP address that it

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.880
reached before it got canceled,
essentially.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.775
And then once you have
that packet back, it

00:11:54.775 --> 00:11:55.210
sets the TTL to two.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.240
So it goes two hops down the
chain of routers, and it goes

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.570
out and out and out and out.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.910
The point I'm trying to make is,
that's not accessible in

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:03.570
the browser, right?

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.490
So do you know how this
was actually--

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.776
I could have really asked this
question a lot easier.

00:12:08.776 --> 00:12:09.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.370
PAUL KINLAN: I'll have
to give some kind of

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.010
[? presentation ?] at least.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.150
So traceroute isn't available
directly in the browser.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.650
Do you know how this
was built?

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.080
I hope you do, otherwise--

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.720
PAUL KINLAN: --otherwise, I
spent 10 minutes talking about

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.410
traceroutes.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.470
ROGER PALA: Well, Tellart
did this bit, so we

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:27.910
don't know the details.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:35.330
But I know that they were
using Python, I think.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.940
PAUL KINLAN: So they used
basically a Python server to

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:37.690
simulate traceroute--

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:38.530
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:39.560
PAUL KINLAN: --from everything
that I understand.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.890
So how did you hook that up
into the visualization?

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.610
I mean did they do the entire
traceroute and then give you

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.170
the data back, or did they
give you kind of

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.680
one hop at a time?

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.930
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: No,
it's all at once.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:51.700
PAUL KINLAN: Okay.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.020
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And just
because of cache because it's

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.320
a lot of traceroutes going
on and it takes a while.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.840
So if millions of people are
doing it at the same time, it

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.350
would get stuck in the system.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.930
So it's the whole thing, and
then it's cached for an hour

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:07.340
or something.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.660
PAUL KINLAN: Which is probably
why fish and chips worked

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.120
quite well.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.522
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:13:10.522 --> 00:13:11.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.100
PAUL KINLAN: That's cool.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.140
So the point I was going
to say before was, the

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.990
visualization themselves, how do
you know where in the world

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.960
to plot them?

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.825
I mean because on traceroute
we have an IP address, and

00:13:24.825 --> 00:13:26.630
that IP address--

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:30.110
ROGER PALA: So we have a system
to transform this IP

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:34.070
address into latitude and
longitude coordinates.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:37.180
And then we just easily
place it on the map.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.050
PAUL KINLAN:So you basically
just do a transform, kind of

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.930
put it into world coordinates,
from real world coordinates

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.240
into model world coordinates,
I suppose.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.420
ROGER PALA: So one of the
reasons that we use the NASA

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:54.030
map to generate the 3D map was
because it was easy to place

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.200
in the exact location that
we were receiving the

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.260
coordinates.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.700
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.760
Looks really nice.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.200
I kind of like how
small the UK is.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.800
I'm always amazed by
the size the UK.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.570
Like the entirety of the UK
fits into California.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.290
It's absolutely crazy.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.960
And I could go into a long thing
about why I don't travel

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.780
anywhere in the UK.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.820
It takes too long.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:17.940
And then you go across
America, and

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.620
it's absolutely fine.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.180
But I won't.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.750
So that's pretty cool.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.210
So is there anything else that
you want to kind of tell us

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.740
about this project?

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.040
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: It's quite
an interesting mix, if you

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.000
look at the graphics here.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.290
So we have the map in WebGL
running in the background, and

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:34.490
then the small dots here, and we
saw an image pop up and the

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.145
Web Lab is actually in 2D.

00:14:37.145 --> 00:14:37.950
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, so
the image is that

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.350
pop-up when you search?

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.200
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: In 2D so that
they are interactive as

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.610
normal HTML, and we get the nice
font rendering without

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.020
doing sprites.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.200
PAUL KINLAN: That's pretty cool
because I know, I keep

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.350
mentioning Paul Lewis.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.960
Hello Paul.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.130
We do recordings in the studio
sometimes and we're

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.730
two Pauls in a pod.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.650
But I was going to say something
interesting.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:02.550
Well that wasn't it.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.220
We were talking the other day
about kind of aliasing effects

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.020
with fonts in WebGL.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.250
Because you can never actually
position it as

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.120
accurately as you want.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.000
You can position it accurately
in the scene, but not in user

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.650
visible space.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.430
Essentially, it's really
hard to do text.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:18.240
It's kind of interesting.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.450
I really like it how
everything seems

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:23.190
to go across America.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.930
That's insane.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.750
Yeah, so I think we're probably
done with this one.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:29.350
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.040
PAUL KINLAN: So if you like this
experiment, try it out

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.470
chromeweblab.com the Data
Tracer experiment.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.630
And also visit the museum, where
it's actually a physical

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.120
installation.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.075
Which I'll just double click in
here again, and you'll be

00:15:42.075 --> 00:15:44.020
able to see the live stream,
with no one there at the

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.436
moment, because it's
late at night.

00:15:46.436 --> 00:15:48.320
Yeah, thanks guys for coming
in, by the way.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.540
It's kind of, it is
getting late now.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.630
It's pretty cool.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.970
But yeah, go and see
it at the museum.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.730
And you'll see just how it's
mapped from the real world to

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.540
what we know as the digital
world, essentially.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.790
Cool.
