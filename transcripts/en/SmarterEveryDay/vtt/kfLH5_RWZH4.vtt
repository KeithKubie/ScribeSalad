Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.050
So today we're in Peru. It's pretty awesome. We've assembled a team of people,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.080
and we're gonna capture Machu Picchu in the highest resolution photo

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.100
that's ever been made of it. We're gonna let you see Machu Picchu cause lets face it,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.160
it's pretty cost prohibitive to get here, so the majority of you probably won't make the trip.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.190
The idea is to let you make the trip with me.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.210
I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Check it out.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.230
[music]
(Destin) If we get it right there.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.250
(Jeff) It's a GigaPan Epic Pro. And we're gonna level it out first.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.280
Set this up right.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.320
So a normal photo

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.350
takes a wide angle. What we're gonna do here is we're gonna take a lot of really tight angles.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.430
[camera shutter]

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:16.530
    

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.560
So we're getting roughed up because the camera looks professional, so we have to show that we went through

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.570
all the proper channels and got a permit.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.590
(Destin) [in Spanish] Does it work?
- [in Spanish] Cultural Ministry.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.610
(Destin) [in Spanish] Thank you.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.620
That's why we've been planning this for months,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.640
because of that dude right there.
- Success, success.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.680
I would have argued for so long, the picture would have been done. When I was done arguing.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.710
[laugh]
- This is Jeff's dream come true.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.720
I just started coordinating with him and we started.. How would you say, what is

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.720
my role in this? I'm motivation basically?

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.730
- No, I just thought you're a cool dude and I thought you'd come down and enjoy taking a high res photo of Machu Picchu, honest to God.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.750
- Sweet, that's awesome. Well thank you very much, this is great.
- You got it.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.760
[music]

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.880
[laughs]
(Destin) Check this out.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.920
This is a type of masonry called Ashlar, used by the Incas here at Machu Picchu.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.950
They would basically polish all the stones so that they would fit together perfectly.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.970
And what's cool about that is that if you have to support the weight of this stone on

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.990
this one, the more contact area that you have, the less stress there is

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.020
on the rocks. It's pretty cool. We do this with mortar,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.050
usually, in today's construction.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.090
[music]

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.120
[camera shutter]

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.180
(Destin) There you go man.
- Wow.
- The moment you've been waiting for.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.220
[relieved sigh]
[laugh]

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.270
[music]

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.300
So Jeff and I decided to hide in this panorama

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.360
somewhere, see if you can find us. Jeff's image ended up being awesome. If you want to see what you can find,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.420
go check out the link in the description. Anyway, I'm Destin. Getting Smarter Every Day.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.440
Please subscribe. Have a good one. We're gonna take the highest resolution photo

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.460
of Machu Pic... [heavy breathing] [laugh]

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.480
Can't breathe. Oh man. [laugh]

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.500
This is the wall that seems to be made with the most care. You can see it's very long,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.510
very tall and very straight. And if you want to see that, I'll leave the link in

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.510
the video description and you can go click on it and explore the wall for yourself and see if you can figure out what they did.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.540
This is Gordon. He's been doing the sound for Smarter Every Day for years. This is the first time we've

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.560
met, but it's in Peru, pretty crazy.
- It's awesome. We're fitting you up with a binaural microphone.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.610
Binaural microphones are stereo microphones that take into account

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.630
the fact that you have a head, which most stereo microphones do not.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.690
If I have a sound coming in from the left there's a 500 microsecond delay before it gets to my other ear,

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.710
and they should be able to hear that?
- They should be able to hear that as if it's surround sound, IF you put your

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.750
headphones on.
- Oh ok, so go throw your headphones on, and we're gonna walk around

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.770
Machu Picchu.
