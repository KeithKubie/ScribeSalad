00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.120
perfectionism is the unreasonable and
self-defeating ambition of getting

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.640
something absolutely right - which makes
us difficult to be around and punishing

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.820
to live within. The origins of
perfectionism lie in the imagination.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.279
In the ease with which we can conjure up a picture of an ideal state of affairs

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.960
compared with the monstrous difficulty
of bringing such a state into being by

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.989
ourselves. The sickness of perfectionism
just states in a fertile gap between our

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.170
noble visions and our mediocre reality
and yet our problems do not ultimately

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.010
arise just in our love of perfection.
They lie in our reckless tendencies to

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.780
under-budget for the difficulties of
achieving perfection. The proper target

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.409
for gentle criticism is premature
perfectionism. How accurately we budget

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.510
for time and effort is always dependent
on a proper grasp of the inherent

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.090
difficulty of any task. If we fully
recognize something to be exceptionally

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.480
difficult
we don't panic when our first efforts are

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.410
weak and progress slow. It's difficult
but we knew it would be. High standards

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.120
only become a problem when we think
something might and should be

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.230
substantially easier than it turns out
to be and when we read our struggles as

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.400
marks of our own ineptitude rather than
as an inevitable part of a legitimately

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.320
lengthy journey. Perfectionism is only a
problem because we have under-budgeted

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.960
for difficulty not because we are aiming
high. It strikes when we imagine we might

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.659
write a good novel in six months or have
a good career by the age of 30 or have

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.170
worked out spontaneously how to have a
successful marriage.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.420
our perfectionism starts to torture us
when we lack information on how hard

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.399
others had to work and how much they had
to suffer before reaching their ideas of

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.349
perfection. In a better world culture
would endlessly draw to our attention

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.450
the first draft and hidden labors of
other people and properly alert us to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.239
the true horrors exacted by anything
worth doing. We would not then be so

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.150
impatient and such sickly perfectionists.
We would be patient resilient Questers

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.000
for excellence. The problem isn't that
we're aiming for perfection. It's that we

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.709
don't have an accurately redemptive idea
of what perfection really demands. At the

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.569
School of Life we believe in developing
emotional intelligence to that end we've

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.670
