00:00:00.412 --> 00:00:03.805
Let's say that we're
looking to borrow $50.

00:00:03.805 --> 00:00:06.604
We can say that our principal is $50.

00:00:06.604 --> 00:00:09.413
We're going to borrow it for 3 years.

00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:13.746
Our time, let's say T in years is 3.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:15.870
Let's say, we're not going
to just compound per year.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.939
We're going to compound 4 times a year,

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.335
or every 3 months.

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:26.937
Let's say that our interest rate ...

00:00:26.937 --> 00:00:30.337
if we were to only compound once per year,

00:00:30.337 --> 00:00:31.830
it would be 10%.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.472
Since we're going to
compound 4 times a year,

00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:34.938
we're going to see ...

00:00:34.938 --> 00:00:36.914
We're going to divide this by 4

00:00:36.914 --> 00:00:38.671
to see how much we compound each period.

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.605
10% is the same thing as 0.10.

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:43.402
Let's write an expression.

00:00:43.402 --> 00:00:44.937
I encourage you actually
to pause this video

00:00:44.937 --> 00:00:46.470
and try to write an expression

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.920
for the amount that you
would have to pay back

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.521
if you were to do this.

00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:53.788
If you were to borrow $50 over 3 years,

00:00:53.788 --> 00:00:55.789
compounding 4 times a year,

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.188
each period you would be

00:00:57.188 --> 00:01:00.854
compounding 10% divided 4%.

00:01:00.854 --> 00:01:04.253
How much would you have
to pay back in 3 years?

00:01:04.253 --> 00:01:05.836
Let's write it out.

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:08.670
$50, that's your principal.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.790
You're going to multiply that,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.122
so you could compound it.

00:01:14.122 --> 00:01:15.504
Each time, each period,

00:01:15.504 --> 00:01:17.921
each of these 3 x 4 periods.

00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:18.835
You have 3 years,

00:01:18.835 --> 00:01:21.003
each of them divide into 4 sections,

00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:22.855
so you're going to have 12 periods.

00:01:22.855 --> 00:01:28.454
Each of them you're going to
compound by 1 plus this R.

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:30.190
I'll write that as a decimal.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.083
0.10 divided by the number of times

00:01:35.083 --> 00:01:39.749
you're compounding per year to the ...

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.331
Well, you would be raising
it to the nth power,

00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:43.187
if this was only over a year.

00:01:43.187 --> 00:01:44.120
There's 4 periods

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.251
and you would raise it to the 4th power

00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:46.250
if it was only a year,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.749
but this is 3 years.

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:51.333
You're going to be doing this 3 x 4.

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.921
You're going to have 4 periods, 3 times.

00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:54.986
Let me write this.

00:01:54.986 --> 00:01:57.455
It's going to be 4 ...

00:01:57.455 --> 00:01:59.082
Actually, instead of N right over here

00:01:59.082 --> 00:02:01.917
let me write the 4, so you
can see all the numbers.

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:10.187
You're going to do this 4
x 3, to the 4 x 3 power.

00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:12.333
I encourage you, if you want,

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:13.520
you could pause the video

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.664
and you can use your calculator

00:02:14.664 --> 00:02:16.545
to actually calculate what that is.

00:02:16.545 --> 00:02:18.397
The whole point of this is
just to use real numbers

00:02:18.397 --> 00:02:20.378
to see why this actually makes sense.

00:02:20.378 --> 00:02:21.462
This is your principal.

00:02:21.462 --> 00:02:23.731
Each time you're going
to be multiplying that

00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:27.627
times 1.025.

00:02:27.627 --> 00:02:32.462
You're going to be growing it by 2 1/2%

00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:34.294
and you're going to do this 12 times,

00:02:34.294 --> 00:02:36.129
because there's 12 periods.

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.212
4 periods per year times 3 years.

00:02:39.212 --> 00:02:41.795
This is going to be how
much you have to pay back.

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:42.596
If we wanted to write this

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:44.546
in a little bit more abstract terms,

00:02:44.546 --> 00:02:50.712
we could write this as P(1 +).

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:53.930
I'll do this a close parentheses,
since it's the same color.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:05.730
R over N to the N x T power.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.794
You could pick your P,
your Ts, your Ns and your R

00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:09.544
and you could put it here

00:03:09.544 --> 00:03:10.462
and that's essentially how much

00:03:10.462 --> 00:03:12.630
you're going to have to pay back.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.597
An interesting thing,

00:03:13.597 --> 00:03:14.962
and you saw that we had this up here

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:16.212
from a previous video,

00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:19.044
where we took a limit as
N approaches infinity.

00:03:19.044 --> 00:03:20.063
Let's do the same thing here.

00:03:20.063 --> 00:03:21.546
Let's think about what that would mean.

00:03:21.546 --> 00:03:24.627
If we took the limit as
N approaches infinity,

00:03:24.627 --> 00:03:29.546
if we took the limit of this
as N approaches infinity,

00:03:29.546 --> 00:03:32.878
what is this conceptually?

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:36.878
We're dividing our year into more

00:03:36.878 --> 00:03:37.996
and more and more chunks,

00:03:37.996 --> 00:03:39.462
an infinite number of chunks.

00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:40.263
You could really say,

00:03:40.263 --> 00:03:41.663
"This would be the case where we're doing

00:03:41.663 --> 00:03:44.546
continuous compound interest.

00:03:44.546 --> 00:03:45.861
Which is a fascinating concept to me.

00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:48.664
You're dividing your time period

00:03:48.664 --> 00:03:50.794
in an infinite number of chunks

00:03:50.794 --> 00:03:51.996
and then compounding just

00:03:51.996 --> 00:03:54.378
an infinitely small extra amount

00:03:54.378 --> 00:03:55.729
every one of those periods.

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:58.378
You can actually come up
with an expression for that.

00:03:58.378 --> 00:04:00.212
As we see, that this actually doesn't

00:04:00.212 --> 00:04:02.397
just go unbounded and
give us crazy things,

00:04:02.397 --> 00:04:03.796
that we can actually use this

00:04:03.796 --> 00:04:05.399
to come up with a formula

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:07.294
for continuously compounding interest.

00:04:07.294 --> 00:04:10.663
Which is used heavily
in finance and banking

00:04:10.663 --> 00:04:12.330
and, as you can imagine,
a bunch of things,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.733
actually many things outside
of finance and banking,

00:04:15.733 --> 00:04:18.330
exponential growth, etc., etc.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.878
Let's see if we can
actually try to evaluate

00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:24.128
this thing right over here.

00:04:24.128 --> 00:04:26.331
The one thing I am going to do

00:04:26.331 --> 00:04:27.598
to simplify this,

00:04:27.598 --> 00:04:29.730
is to do a substitution.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.670
I'm going to define a variable.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.632
The whole goal is so that
I can get it into a form

00:04:34.632 --> 00:04:36.431
that looks something like this.

00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:39.931
I'm going to define a variable X.

00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:43.263
I'm going to say that X is
the reciprocal of R over N,

00:04:43.263 --> 00:04:45.263
so that I can get a 1
over X right over here.

00:04:45.263 --> 00:04:47.847
I'll write that as N over R.

00:04:47.847 --> 00:04:52.681
X is equal to N over R,

00:04:52.681 --> 00:04:54.126
or we could write this as

00:04:54.126 --> 00:05:04.977
N is equal to X x R.

00:05:04.977 --> 00:05:06.259
If we make that substitution

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:07.463
the limit is N approaches infinite.

00:05:07.463 --> 00:05:10.194
If we make the limit as
X approaches infinite,

00:05:10.194 --> 00:05:12.333
then N is going to go to infinite as well.

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:13.261
If N goes to infinite,

00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:15.331
then X is going to go to infinite as well.

00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:17.222
R, right over here, is just a constant.

00:05:17.222 --> 00:05:19.459
We're just assuming that that's a given,

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:21.789
that N is what we're
really seeing what happens

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:22.988
as we change it.

00:05:22.988 --> 00:05:25.678
We could rewrite this
thing right over here.

00:05:25.678 --> 00:05:26.519
I'm doing it.

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:28.010
I'm not being as super rigorous,

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.322
but it's really to give you an intuition

00:05:29.322 --> 00:05:32.054
for where the formula we're
about to see comes from.

00:05:32.054 --> 00:05:38.523
Let's rewrite this as the
limit is X approaches infinite.

00:05:38.523 --> 00:05:42.385
The limit of constant
times some expression.

00:05:42.385 --> 00:05:43.786
We could take the constant out.

00:05:43.786 --> 00:05:44.718
We could say that's going to be

00:05:44.718 --> 00:05:51.354
P times the limit as X
approaches infinite of 1 plus.

00:05:51.354 --> 00:05:54.518
R over N is 1 over X.

00:05:54.518 --> 00:06:01.105
1+1 over X to the ...

00:06:01.105 --> 00:06:03.518
N is X x R.

00:06:03.518 --> 00:06:06.322
N is X x R, so let me write that,

00:06:06.322 --> 00:06:15.460
to the X x R, R x T power.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.441
All of this business is
the exact same thing.

00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:20.395
Let me rewrite this.

00:06:20.395 --> 00:06:24.794
Let me copy and paste
this part right over here.

00:06:24.794 --> 00:06:25.994
Copy.

00:06:25.994 --> 00:06:28.397
This is the same thing.

00:06:28.397 --> 00:06:31.866
This is equal to P times

00:06:31.866 --> 00:06:33.837
(let me put some parenthesis here)

00:06:33.837 --> 00:06:39.840
times (maybe that's too
big) times the limit.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.670
This limit right over here.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.099
If I raise something to
the product of these,

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:48.016
I'm taking X x R x T,

00:06:48.016 --> 00:06:48.805
that's the same thing as

00:06:48.805 --> 00:06:50.202
doing this whole thing to the X

00:06:50.202 --> 00:06:55.017
and then raising that to the RT power.

00:06:55.017 --> 00:06:58.349
This comes from exponent properties,

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:00.469
that you might have learned before.

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:01.766
These 2 things are equivalent.

00:07:01.766 --> 00:07:03.932
I'm doing a couple of
steps in the process here,

00:07:03.932 --> 00:07:08.599
but hopefully this seems
reasonably intuitive for you.

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:10.599
I'm really just using the property.

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:19.325
The limit as, let's say,
X approaches C of F of X

00:07:19.325 --> 00:07:25.384
to the, let's call it, to the XRT power.

00:07:25.384 --> 00:07:29.467
This is the same thing as the limit

00:07:29.467 --> 00:07:34.583
as X approaches C of F of X to the X

00:07:34.583 --> 00:07:38.250
and then all of that
raised to the RT power.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.315
What is this stuff right over here?

00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:42.848
What is all of this business
that's inside the parentheses?

00:07:42.848 --> 00:07:44.714
We've seen that before.

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:50.800
All of this, all of that is equal to E.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.634
We can write this.

00:07:51.634 --> 00:07:52.549
This is exciting.

00:07:52.549 --> 00:07:56.982
This is formula for continuous
compounding interest.

00:07:56.982 --> 00:07:58.467
If we continuously compound,

00:07:58.467 --> 00:08:04.921
we're going to have to pay
back our principal times E,

00:08:04.921 --> 00:08:11.491
to the RT power.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.462
Let's do a concrete example here.

00:08:13.462 --> 00:08:19.698
If you were to borrow $50,
over 3 years, 10% interest,

00:08:19.698 --> 00:08:22.366
but you're not compounding
just 4 times a year,

00:08:22.366 --> 00:08:25.198
you're going to compound
an infinite times per year.

00:08:25.198 --> 00:08:27.948
You're going to be continuous compounding.

00:08:27.948 --> 00:08:30.730
We can see how much you would
actually have to pay back.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:38.615
It is going to be 50 x E to the ...

00:08:38.615 --> 00:08:41.329
Our rate is .1.

00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:42.615
Just let me put some parentheses here.

00:08:42.615 --> 00:08:48.329
0.1 x time, so times 3 years.

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:49.327
T as in years.

00:08:49.327 --> 00:08:50.729
We assumed it was in years.

00:08:50.729 --> 00:08:51.463
We get ...

00:08:51.463 --> 00:08:53.865
You would have to pay back $67.

00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:57.865
If we're to round ...
$67.49 if you were to round.
