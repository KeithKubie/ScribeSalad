00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.230
so genetics is a broad descriptor but

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240
so genetics is a broad descriptor but
 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.420
so genetics is a broad descriptor but
specifically I think we can use the

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430
specifically I think we can use the
 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.970
specifically I think we can use the
molecular biology revolution that is the

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980
molecular biology revolution that is the
 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.210
molecular biology revolution that is the
manipulation of genes and they have been

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220
manipulation of genes and they have been
 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.790
manipulation of genes and they have been
crucial in helping us understand both

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800
crucial in helping us understand both
 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.140
crucial in helping us understand both
disease and design better vaccines so by

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150
disease and design better vaccines so by
 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.450
disease and design better vaccines so by
isolating genes that encode proteins

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460
isolating genes that encode proteins
 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.860
isolating genes that encode proteins
from infectious organisms we can then

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870
from infectious organisms we can then
 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.860
from infectious organisms we can then
take those jeans and express them to

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870
take those jeans and express them to
 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.310
take those jeans and express them to
make new proteins in various different

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320
make new proteins in various different
 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.170
make new proteins in various different
organisms and that way we can generate

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180
organisms and that way we can generate
 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.540
organisms and that way we can generate
very large amounts of protein with which

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550
very large amounts of protein with which
 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.380
very large amounts of protein with which
to use as a vaccine genetics have also

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390
to use as a vaccine genetics have also
 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.380
to use as a vaccine genetics have also
been used as a way of finding new

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390
been used as a way of finding new
 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.250
been used as a way of finding new
proteins for infectious organisms

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260
proteins for infectious organisms
 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.979
proteins for infectious organisms
recently a managing a meningococcal B

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989
recently a managing a meningococcal B
 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.680
recently a managing a meningococcal B
vaccine has been developed where the

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690
vaccine has been developed where the
 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.930
vaccine has been developed where the
whole genome for that bacterium was

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940
whole genome for that bacterium was
 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.609
whole genome for that bacterium was
deciphered and new proteins identified

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619
deciphered and new proteins identified
 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.859
deciphered and new proteins identified
which could be associated or correlated

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869
which could be associated or correlated
 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.990
which could be associated or correlated
with protective immune responses and

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000
with protective immune responses and
 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.899
with protective immune responses and
from that identification again those

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909
from that identification again those
 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.609
from that identification again those
proteins were cloned through molecular

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619
proteins were cloned through molecular
 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.910
proteins were cloned through molecular
biology and used as the basis of a

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920
biology and used as the basis of a
 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.210
biology and used as the basis of a
vaccine which is proving very promising

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220
vaccine which is proving very promising
 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.330
vaccine which is proving very promising
again in clinical trials so genetics

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340
again in clinical trials so genetics
 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.940
again in clinical trials so genetics
have been really quite revolutionary

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950
have been really quite revolutionary
 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.390
have been really quite revolutionary

with our ability to design vaccines in
 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.899

what I'd like to think both a safe and a

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909
what I'd like to think both a safe and a
 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.570
