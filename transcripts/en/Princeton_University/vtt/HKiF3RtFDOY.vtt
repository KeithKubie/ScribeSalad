00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.770
JOHN RITTER: Imagine
if you're a diabetic

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.210
and you can measure your blood
glucose level using a laser

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.110
rather than pricking
your finger,

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.550
instead, a person
can put their wrist

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.410
in front of a laser to
take the measurement.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.650
Princeton researchers
are working

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.120
to solve real world problems
in health, technology,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.800
and the environment.


00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.580
University research can
have a meaningful impact

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.460
on people's lives.


00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.600 position:97%
 


00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.700
CLAIRE GMACHL: We develop
new, tiny semiconductor lasers

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.060
that are engineered to emit
light in a very special way.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.090
We can use them to
detect chemicals

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.110
for applications in the
environment, in health,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.650
and security.


00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.320 position:97%
 


00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.540
JOHN RITTER: Professor
Gmachl is exploring new ways

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.400
to use lasers to detect blood
sugar levels in diabetics.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.670
A person could put a
device, like a wrist watch,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.010
on their body that
would continually

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.940
measure their blood
glucose level.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.360
CLAIRE GMACHL: We
do want to build

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.730
technologies that serve people.


00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.580
So we look at society, we look
at the environment, and ask,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.780
what are important
questions to answer?

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.130
Fields where there are
open questions, where

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.030
one can have impact,
and kind of do good.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.070
On the other hand, I
wouldn't be a real scientist

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.480
if I wasn't also just motivated
by creating something new.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.190
JOHN RITTER: Our
researchers are also

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.650
exploring ways in which humans
can more effectively interact

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.470
with computers.


00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.140
For example, Professor
Verma and his team

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.590
are developing technologies
to make it easier for people

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.930
to interact with computers,
or other electronic devices,

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.860
using hand gestures instead
of typing on a keyboard.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.610
NAVEEN VERMA: So the
technology that we're

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.320
interested in creating,
in some sense,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.180
really focuses on
enabling interactions

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.180
between electronics,
or computers,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.370
and the physical world.


00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.050
A part of our research is
really interested in enabling

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.440
interfaces between
humans and computers

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.060
that are much more compelling.


00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.690
Possible applications
for this technology

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.610
are extremely wide
and very diverse.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.240
In operating theaters
for hospitals

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.140
where surgeons, once again,
in very constrained spaces,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.470
need to be able to interact
with information that's

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.640
being provided to
them via display,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.040
and things like gestures,
are very compelling ways

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.440
for them to interact with this
sort of information technology.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.400
Because of course here we
also face the constraint

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.910
where infection can be
transferred if surfaces

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.920
are touched while a surgeon
is engaged in some surgery.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.630
And in some sense,
these are applications

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.090
that we didn't
really think of when

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.450
we started working on this
technology, which are now

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.150
sort of coming to surface.


00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.830
JOHN RITTER: All
of these projects

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.560
involve students
doing basic research.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.910
For example, students in
Professor Kang's laboratory

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.760
are studying a gene
that is involved

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.100
with the spread or
metastasis of cancer.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.720
YIBIN KANG: One of
the research efforts

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.100
that we have been doing
as of the past 10 years

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.030
is to find out
what kind of tumors

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.910
are aggressive based on
their molecular features.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.980
And more importantly,
find driver genes

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.060
that make those
tumors aggressive

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.500
because that's the first
step towards treating them.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.640
So in the end, we are now
able to tell the patients

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.160
whether they have a bad
tumor, but furthermore, we

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.590
can tell them that even
though they have a bad tumor,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.440
we have a way to treat them
to stop them from spreading.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.300
JOHN RITTER: The thing
that separates us

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.090
from other institutions
is our world class faculty

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.470
and researchers.


00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.110
This is about research
that can benefit society.
