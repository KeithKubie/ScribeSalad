00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.700
Problem 77.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.690
If Miss Smith's income was 20%
more for 1991 than it was for

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:22.860
1990, how much was her
income in 1991?

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:31.210
Let's call it income 1991,
is 20% more than 1990.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.870
So that means 1.2 times
income in 1990.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.390
I hope you get that.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.650
If something is 20% more than
something else, it's going to

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.210
be 1.2 times that.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.800
12 is 20% more than 10.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.230
And 12 is 1.2 times 10.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.920
Or you could view it as income
plus 20% of income, which is

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.190
1.2 times income.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.600
Either way.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.660
So let's see what
they tell us.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.650
Well, what do we have
to figure out?

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.610
OK, we were trying to figure
out this, income in 1991.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.330
Statement number one.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.519
Miss Smith's income for the
first six months of 1990 was

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.980
$17,500, and the income for the
last six months of 1990

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.470
was $20,000.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.450
So they're telling that she made
$17,500 in the first six

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.140
months of 1990, and her income
for the last six months of

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.040
1990 was $20,000.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.420
Well, they're essentially
telling us the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.270
total income for 1990.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.630
The first six months and
the last six months.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.060
There are 12 months in a year.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.540
So her total income for
1990 was $37,500.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.050
That equals income for 1990.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.430
So clearly, if we know this is
this, we just multiply that

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.200
times 1.2, and we get
the income for 1991.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.880
So this statement alone
is sufficient.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.790
Let's see what they give us
for statement number two.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.120
Miss Smith's income for
1991 was $7,500

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.120
greater than for 1990.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:11.000
So they say income of 1991 was
$7,500, so it equals income

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.210
for 1990 plus $7,500.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.470
Well, this alone does help
us, because they've

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.720
already given us this.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.340
So we have two linear
equations, right?

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.690
This is one linear equation
and two unknowns.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.670
This is another linear equation
and two unknowns.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.890
So we have two linear equations
and two unknowns.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.980
We can solve this.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.120
Probably the easiest way is just
to substitute, depending

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.050
on what you want to solve for.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.590
But we've done that
multiple times.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.950
You could substitute 1.2
times 1990 here, and

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.980
then solve for it.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.010
Or you could do the other way.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.530
You could divide by 1.2 here and
then substitute it there.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.950
But either way, this is trivial
algebra, hopefully, by

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.810
this point, to solve.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.400
But this and this is definitely
enough information

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.060
to solve the problem.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.640
So two equations with
two unknowns.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.610
And you can do that in your
spare time if you don't

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.890
believe me.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.490
So both statements alone are
sufficient for this one.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.280
78.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.960
In the figure above-- so
I think I have to draw.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.620
This is the y-axis, and
that's the x-axis.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.300
And then they have a line.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.520
Let's see what I can do.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.030
The line looks something
like that.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.730
And then they tell us--
what do they tell us?

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.580
This, of course, is y.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.000
This is x.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.130
And then they say this is P.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.440
And this right here is Q.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.015
And then they draw this.

00:03:54.015 --> 00:03:57.600
They call this point
right here R.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.990
And they draw-- that's
like that.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.150
And this Q is at point c, d.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.680
And P is at point a, b.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.550
And then they say, in the figure
above, segments PR and

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.589
QR-- so let me draw that out
a little bit better.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.500
--are each parallel
to one of the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.580
rectangular coordinate axes.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.400
OK, fair enough.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.500
This is parallel to
the y-axis, PR is

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.600
parallel to the x-axis.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.840
Fair enough.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.440
Is the ratio of the length
of QR:PR equal to 1?

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.970
So is the ratio of
QR:PR equal to 1?

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.450
So they want to know QR/PR,
is that equal to 1?

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.270
And immediately this should
trigger something

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.170
from Algebra 1.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.680
They're asking you, essentially,
is the slope of

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.760
this line equal to 1?

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.100
Right?

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.970
Is the ratio of QR:PR, so rise
over run, is the slope of this

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.800
line equal to 1?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.890
So let's see what we can do.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.000
And slope is just change
in y over change in x.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.630
So what's this point,
first of all?

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.370
You actually don't have to know
anything about slope.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.630
I don't want to make you
feel like you have to

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.660
memorize some formulas.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.280
What's this point going to be?

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.040
So it's going to be-- actually,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.480
let's do it even better.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.210
What is the length of
QR going to be?

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.020
I haven't looked at any of the
data points right now.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.340
What is length of QR?

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.910
Well, it's going to
be this height.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.500
So it's this y, which
is d, minus this y.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.390
This y is going to
be b, right?

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.950
Because all of this is y is
equal to b, right here.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.350
So QR is going to be
equal to d minus b.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.660
And PR is the length
on the x-axis.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.890
It's going to be this x.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.190
What is this x?

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.220
Well, this x is right here, c.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.050
x equal to c.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.160
It's going to be this
x minus this x.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.520
Well, here, x is equal to a.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:09.450
And so the ratio is equal to
d minus b, over c minus a.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.750
Which is, if you remember,
the formula for

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.420
the slope of a line.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:22.110
You just take the y1 minus
y2, over x1 minus x2.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.130
But we didn't have
to memorize that.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.380
It's intuition.

00:06:27.705 --> 00:06:32.160
See the x-coordinate is c and
the y-coordinate is b.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.460
So hopefully that gives
you intuition.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.450
Now let's look at
the statements.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.150
You wouldn't have to do
that on the real GMAT.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.210
That would all be
a waste of time.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.690
Statement number one tells
us, c is equal to 3 and

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.350
d is equal to 4.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.820
So that by itself, that
just gives us the

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.270
first part of this.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.990
That doesn't help us figure
out this entire ratio.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.830
So this by itself isn't
that useful.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.240
Maybe in conjunction with
what else they give us.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.440
Statement two.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.800
a is equal to minus 2, and
b is equal to minus 1.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.600
Well, if you used both of these
statements together,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.340
then we have everything here.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.690
We have d, we have b, we
have c, and we have a.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.010
So we can solve it.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.630
So both statements together
are sufficient for knowing

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.410
whether the ratio
of QR:PR is 1.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:26.090
Or essentially, is the slope
of this line equal to 1?

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:33.930
Next problem, 79.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.920
While on a straight road, car x
and car y are travelling at

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.660
different constant rates.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.430
If car x is now 1 mile ahead
of car y, how many minutes

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.065
from now will car x be 2
miles ahead of car y?

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.980
So x is here.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.100
y is here.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.590
And they're going at
constant rates.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:04.170
1 mile.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.430
So they've been traveling for
some amount of time and x is 1

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.370
mile ahead.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.340
And they're saying how long is
it going to be before x is--

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.490
how many minutes before
x is 2 miles ahead?

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:13.810
And they're at constant rates.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.786
So if they started off-- and
let's just think about it-- if

00:08:16.786 --> 00:08:18.610
they started off at the same
point and it took 10 minutes

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:22.090
for x to get 1 mile ahead, it
would take another 10 minutes

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.010
for it to get 2 miles.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.270
Well, that's how I'm
thinking about.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.920
Let's see what they give
us for the statements.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.490
Statement number one.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.370
Car x is traveling at 50 miles
per hour, and car y is

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.440
travelling at 40
miles per hour.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.445
Well, that seems to be pretty
good information.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.700
So essentially, car
y is moving away

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.010
from car x at what?

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.150
It's moving away 50 minus
40 miles per hour.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:57.190
So from car y's point of view,
car x is always pulling away

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.340
at 10 miles per hour.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:00.640
Right?

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.670
Does that make sense?

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.240
If car x was going at 40 miles
per hour, you wouldn't be

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.250
pulling away at all.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.500
If it was going at 41 miles per
hour, it'd be pulling away

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.670
at a increment of
1 mile per hour.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.260
And as long as we're not
approaching the speed of

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.830
light, we can assume Newtonian
classical physics, and we

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.590
could just take the difference
between the two.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:24.270
So how long does it take for it
to pull away another mile?

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.120
Well, if you're going 10 miles
per hour, relative to

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.990
something else, how many
minutes does it

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.150
take to go a mile?

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.760
Well, one, you know you
can figure that out.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.710
But let me figure that
out for you.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:37.400
So you know distance is equal
to rate times time.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.480
So if your distance you want
to know is 1 mile, and your

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:49.670
rate is equal to 10 miles per
hour, times time, what's the

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.460
time going to be equal to?

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:59.740
Time is going to be equal to
1/10 of an hour, or 6 minutes.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.800
So that's the answer
to number one.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.825
One alone is sufficient.

00:10:01.825 --> 00:10:04.170
Or the answer to number 79,
one alone is sufficient.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.500
Let's see what they give
us for number two.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.640
Statement two.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:13.900
3 minutes ago, car x was 1/2
mile ahead of car y.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.440
OK.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:22.375
So 3 minutes ago, the state of
affairs was this: y was here,

00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:24.380
x was here.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.020
And it was a 1/2 mile
difference.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.020
So what does that tell us?

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.650
That's actually pretty
good information too.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.670
3 minutes ago, car x was 1/2
mile ahead of car y.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.940
Now car x is 1 mile ahead.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:53.380
So in 3 minutes, x pulls away
by 1/2 a mile, right?

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.810
And they're going at constant
velocities.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.560
So the relative velocities
between the two don't change.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.400
So if it takes 3 minutes for x
to pull away by 1/2 a mile, it

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.660
would take 6 minutes for x to
pull away by a mile, right?

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:06.400
You just multiply them by 2.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.400
They're all going at the
same constant velocity.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:17.780
So in 6 minutes, x pulls
away by 1 mile.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.320
And that's actually what
they're asking.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.320
Because they say how many more
minutes does it take x to pull

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.950
away by another mile?

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.410
They've probably been traveling
for 6 minutes

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.580
already, and then in another 6
minutes x would pull away by

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.410
another mile.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.790
So two alone is also
sufficient.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.740
So each of them independently
are good enough

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.380
to answer this question.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.240
See you in the next video.
