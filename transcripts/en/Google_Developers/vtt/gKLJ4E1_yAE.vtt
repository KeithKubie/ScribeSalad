MATT ROGERS: Hey,
how's it going?

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.440
I'm really excited to be here
and talk about the next API.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.660
It's a long time coming.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.510
How many of you guys signed
up to hear about this probably

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.160
about eight months
ago at this point?

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.660
Exactly.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.290
OK.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.290
Waiting for a long time.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.550
And I'm really glad to be
able to talk about it now.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.299
We've been working on
it for about a year.

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:30.790
And I think we have fully
thought through this,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.830
kind of built an entire
comprehensive program.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.050
And we're going to talk through
quite a bit of it today.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.050
So things we're
going to go over.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.880
We're going to go over details
of the API, kind of high level

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.213
what the features are, and
also go through some examples

00:00:44.213 --> 00:00:45.410
as to how to build to it.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.790
Mark's actually going to walk
through some sample code.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.340
Design.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.320
Some design
guidelines as well as

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.240
some tips of the
trade of things we've

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.698
learned over the
last couple years.

00:00:53.698 --> 00:00:56.200
And some details on
how we should test,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.830
and how we are going
to test your apps.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.670
So when did this all begin?

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.580
It began in a garage.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.950
So we started in a garage about
three years ago in Palo Alto,

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.460
off Alma Street.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.072
And this is back in the
day when hardware was dead.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.030
No one was going to build
anything in hardware.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.400
No one was going to fund
anything in hardware.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.350
In fact, I think the story was
that the days of the hardware

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.980
startup were long over.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.810
But we've grown.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.880
And we've built a business.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.560
We've grown
considerably since we

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.060
started three and
a half years ago.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.760
And we have a whole campus now.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.540
So if you're down in Palo Alto,
there are three Nest buildings.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.905
And actually, we've
totally filled them up now.

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:40.320
It started with a thermostat.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.290
And people laughed
once upon a time.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.840
Like can you build a company
reinventing a thermostat?

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.660
It turns out you can, and you
can do really well doing it.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.640
It started with
the idea of can we

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.160
reinvent these
unloved categories?

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.660
Can we bring design,
technology, connectivity,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.155
learning to a category
that has none of that?

00:01:59.155 --> 00:02:01.780
And it's really exciting to see
that there's an entire industry

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.674
now around reinventing these
unloved things in the home.

00:02:06.674 --> 00:02:08.090
Actually, how many
of you guys are

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.604
interested in building
products for the home?

00:02:10.604 --> 00:02:11.920
See, that's amazing.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.830
If I had asked that
question four years ago,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.840
probably three hands
would have gone up.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.550
So that's amazing.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.100
An industry has
been created now.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.340
And I think we're in
a really good place

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.130
to work together on this.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.250
I think with Nest critical
mass and your brains,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.490
I think we could build
some really cool stuff.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.200
So taking the
thermostat Nest Protect,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.620
about a year ago we decided
we really need to do an API.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.750
We're hearing from you guys.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.790
We're hearing that
it's time to do it.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.630
There's an untapped
set of products

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.840
that we can never go build.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.870
Nest can only do so
many things on our own.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.370
Yes.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.510
Nest will continue to
build great products.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.436
And we've got a ton in
development right now.

00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:49.810
I'm really excited
to share soon.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.050
But as you can
imagine, there's a lot

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.320
we could do with just
what we have today.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.570
So what is the
Nest API all about?

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.250
So one, of course, it's
about controlling thermostats

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.887
and things like temperature
control, home comfort.

00:03:04.887 --> 00:03:06.470
And there's a lot
of things that we've

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.720
done so far with home comfort.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.690
And we've added
features continuously

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.700
since we launched the company.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.180
But there's a lot
more we could do

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.280
and things that I hope that
people will go pick up.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.920
Protect event.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.070
So we launched Nest
Protect last fall.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.070
And it's really about safety.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.997
And this is a brand new
category for us and things

00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:26.080
we've thought a lot about.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.650
And I think for this
first generation of APIs,

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.800
being able to listen
to Nest Protect events

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.310
and figure out other things
you do with those events.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.476
So I don't know if you guys
saw some of the examples

00:03:36.476 --> 00:03:38.510
that we've launched,
but these guys LIFX who

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.760
have built a connected
LED light bulb

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.042
listen to Nest Protect events
and flash the lights red

00:03:44.042 --> 00:03:45.500
when there's an
alarm in the house.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.510
I think it makes a lot of sense.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.051
I'm curious what
other kind of things

00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:50.020
we're going to come
up with with this API.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.480
Home and Away,
extremely powerful.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.830
And this is something that
we've taken years to develop.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.730
We have automation
around Home and Away

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.150
where people don't have to go
and push a button to do it.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.130
So being able to
listen to those events

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.900
and know when people are gone
from the home automatically, as

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.830
well as with the user's
input saying, hey, I'm gone.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.830
Things can happen at my
house now that I'm away.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.190
And when I'm coming home,
do something for me.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.880
ETA.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.734
So piggybacking
on Home and Away,

00:04:13.734 --> 00:04:15.150
but actually
providing some input.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.940
So a really popular example
that we've heard from users,

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.740
and that we've launched
now with the API

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.709
is, hey, I'm driving home.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.150
Why can't my house know that?

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.860
So we partner with
Mercedes Benz.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.960
They were kind of an
early beta of the API.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.680
And what they've done
is the super cool.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.330
So as you're driving
home, the car

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.380
tells Nest, hey,
Matt's on his way home.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.610
He'll be there in 30 minutes.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.940
Make the house
comfortable for him.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.606
It's super cool.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.950
So it's all about the home.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.454
And everything about
Nest is about the home.

00:04:44.454 --> 00:04:45.870
I guess we get a
lot of spillover.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.275
People use our products
in light commercial,

00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:50.390
and small businesses, and
restaurants, and shops.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.660
But most of this program
is about the home.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.510
And most of what we
do is about the home.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.500
So we've built an entire
program around revolutionizing

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.110
the home.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.410
So some high level
details of the program.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.360
So all the information on
developer.nest.com, very, very

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.150
detailed specs.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.840
So we've had an
entire team working

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.590
behind the scenes for
the last four months

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.350
documenting the APIs,
building sample code,

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.980
going through examples, really
getting into the details

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.690
so that you could pick
it up and just go.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.510
We're available.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.640
We actually have an entire
developer support team

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.150
behind the scenes now,
ready to answer questions.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.234
And we've actually put
something up on Stack Overflow

00:05:26.234 --> 00:05:27.400
for people to ask questions.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.620
So a simple answer.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.870
But we put a lot of resources
on developer.nest.com

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.330
for people to learn more.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.700
We're working with anybody.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.000
So not just large companies like
Whirlpool and Mercedes Benz.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.500
But small developers, too.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.082
Individuals who have an idea
who want to get started.

00:05:42.082 --> 00:05:43.040
We work with everybody.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.500
And we've designed the program
to be extremely cross-platform.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.430
So any connected product-- be
it a hardware products, iOS,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.994
Android, the web, a pure
service, the Nest API

00:05:53.994 --> 00:05:55.160
should work with everything.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.260
We've designed it to be
extremely cross-platform.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.170
To the point of, not
just cross-platform but

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.226
cross-product and
across industries.

00:06:03.226 --> 00:06:05.600
Here's some examples of some
of the early partners who've

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.683
been working with us behind
the scenes on the beta

00:06:07.683 --> 00:06:09.450
to make sure this
program is rock solid.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.950
For the last four
months, these guys

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.430
have been working with
us behind the scenes,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.610
and I think what they've
done is really cool.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.070
How many of you guys were able
to check out some of the demos?

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.310
We had an event on Tuesday.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.330
Anyone check out the demos?

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.830
Nope?

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.372
Couple of you guys?

00:06:24.372 --> 00:06:26.580
We actually put together a
video that I'll go through

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.310
in a bit kind of explaining
what some of these integrations

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.130
were able to do.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.910
Super cool stuff.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.868
And things that we could
never have done alone.

00:06:33.868 --> 00:06:35.870
So we have lots of ideas.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:36.680
You guys do, too.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.260
I'm really curious when
we put our ideas together,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.301
what we'll be able to do.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.910
So completely cross-platform,
companies big and small,

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.720
and also no hardware
changes required.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.576
Like any internet
connected product

00:06:52.576 --> 00:06:53.950
should be able to
work with Nest.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.658
I think this is a
really important thing.

00:06:55.658 --> 00:06:59.560
And you may have heard about
other home ecosystem platforms

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.560
that are emerging, like
something from the fruit

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.840
company down the street.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.010
And you may imagine that
some of these things

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.636
are light on details,
but I can imagine

00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:09.218
it's not going to work with any
hardware out of the box today.

00:07:09.218 --> 00:07:11.770
I think this is really important
for especially products that

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:12.479
exist today.

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:14.020
So with a software
update, you should

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.103
be able to work with Nest.

00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:17.080
I think that's really important.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.970
It's also open today, so unlike
other products down the street,

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.762
you could go and
work with Nest today.

00:07:22.762 --> 00:07:23.720
You don't need to wait.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.320
So Nest is in three
countries today.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.940
US, Canada, and UK.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.340
We're expanding rapidly.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.050
And this program,
will expand with us.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.659
So we expect that as Nest
expands, and will expand,

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:38.950
throughout Europe, throughout
Asia, throughout the rest

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.324
of the world, the Nest developer
program will go with us.

00:07:41.324 --> 00:07:43.520
And we'll establish
developer communities

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.950
throughout countries as we go.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.010
It's an incredibly
comprehensive program.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.970
I think we've thought
it through end to end.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.990
So it's not just about the
APIs and the documentation.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.380
It's about marketing
and about logo assets,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.840
so you could put
things on your box

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.150
or on your website to
say you work with Nest.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.440
It's about having resources
that are behind the scenes

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.660
to help you build
your ecosystem.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.220
And also, I don't know if you
guys saw that, we announced

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.140
a fund with some of
Nest's early investors,

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.670
that I'll talk about in a bit,
to help small companies get

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.330
started in this industry.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.700
And, again, we will work
with everything from apps,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.090
to connected appliances,
to connected coffee cups.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.040
I'm sure some of you
guys are probably

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.050
working on connected
coffee cups right now.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.020
We will work with everything.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.561
And we're really excited to see
what those products could do.

00:08:34.938 --> 00:08:38.315
All around the
world, the home is

00:08:38.315 --> 00:08:41.270
the center of people's lives.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:46.040
It's where you start your
day and end your day.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.070
It's where you raise a
family and make memories

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.326
with the people you love.

00:08:51.326 --> 00:08:54.590
So wouldn't it be cool if our
homes could be more aware?

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.626
If our homes could learn from
us and help take care of us?

00:08:58.626 --> 00:09:01.040
At Nest, we do just that.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.680
It all started with the
Nest Learning Thermostat.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.886
Then came Nest Protect.

00:09:05.886 --> 00:09:08.174
But for us, that was
just the beginning.

00:09:08.174 --> 00:09:09.590
Our goals has
always been to bring

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.960
this kind of thoughtfulness
to the rest of your life.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.790
That's what Works with
Nest is all about.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.910
Works with Nest makes it
possible for your Nest

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.493
thermostat and smoke
alarm to interact

00:09:17.493 --> 00:09:19.695
with the things
you use every day.

00:09:19.695 --> 00:09:22.070
Because we make connections
between these different parts

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.830
of your life, we can deliver
personalized comfort, safety,

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.817
and energy savings without you
having to do a bunch of work.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:29.775
We've been working with
companies big and small

00:09:29.775 --> 00:09:30.770
to make this a reality.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.517
And we're very excited about
what we've been able to do.

00:09:34.517 --> 00:09:36.350
TRAVIS BOGARD: UP is a
combination of a band

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.570
that you wear around your
wrist and an application

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.940
on the phone that,
together, help track

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.410
your movement
throughout the day.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.270
By connecting your
UP and your Nest,

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.840
you can have this complete,
effortless experience.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.550
Because UP's right
on the body, we

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.330
have this rich, contextual
set of information

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.305
about what the person's
doing in the moment.

00:09:54.305 --> 00:09:56.430
And so that means those
days that you might wake up

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.010
a little bit earlier, before
you even get out of bed,

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.780
we can let Nest know that, so it
can then adjust the temperature

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.040
in the room to start
to be for my daytime.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.700
This Is about technology,
not for technology's sake,

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.000
but technology in
service of a better life.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.370
Helping us be more human.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.897
Allowing us to live
our lives better.

00:10:14.897 --> 00:10:17.480
MARC BITZER: Why would we ever
bring the thermostat and washer

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:17.980
together?

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.770
That's a good question.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.770
If you look at it from
the perspective of energy

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.810
consumption, it's an easy one.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.349
These are big energy
consumptions at the home,

00:10:26.349 --> 00:10:28.390
and they are also ones
which require a lot of day

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.160
to day interaction
with the consumer.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.330
If you have already the
thermostat communicating

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.580
to your utility company,
it's much easier

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.950
for one signal
going to the Nest,

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.450
and that is disseminated through
the house to all appliances

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.180
to basically reduce consumption
now, because we're at the peak.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.850
It's just a tremendous
consumer benefit

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.349
that just happens
in the background.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.830
PHIL BOSUA: LIFX
is a LED light bulb

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.092
that you control
with your smartphone.

00:10:54.092 --> 00:10:56.300
When we first heard about
the Nest developer program,

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.940
we were really excited
to be a part of it.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.135
With Nest Protect and LIFX,
when the smoke alarm event

00:11:02.135 --> 00:11:05.670
is triggered, we can
pulse your lights red,

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.200
which can help you
see in the dark

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.764
as well as give extra
notification that there's

00:11:09.764 --> 00:11:12.180
a problem in the house, which
is especially good if you're

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.780
hearing impaired.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.360
Nest brings this whole
other dimension to LIFX.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.525
Who would have thought by
combining Nest products

00:11:18.525 --> 00:11:20.980
and LIFX products, we
could help save lives.

00:11:22.762 --> 00:11:24.470
JOHANN JUNGWIRTH: The
automotive industry

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.470
is in a very deep change.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.290
I foresee that in
the next 10 years,

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.170
the changes are going
to be more substantial

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.230
than in the last 50.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.720
Likely, your car today
interfaces with your home

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.480
through the garage door opener.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.500
After learning about the
Nest developer program,

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.100
we thought about, how can we
take this is the next level?

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.530
How can we integrate the
car better with your home?

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.080
As you get into your
car and drive home,

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.560
the car will, in the background,
send the estimated time

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.600
of arrival of your
Nest thermostat

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.480
so your home can be at
the right temperature

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.410
as you arrive at home.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.850
Taking workload
off of customers,

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.565
it will improve safety,
it will increase comfort,

00:12:07.565 --> 00:12:09.190
because people just
don't have to think

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.310
about all these things.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.310
It's just great, like
magic in the background.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.970
MATT ROGERS: At Nest, we
believe these experiences

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:22.740
are the future.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.717
We're able to connect things
inside and outside your home

00:12:25.717 --> 00:12:27.050
to better anticipate your needs.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.900
We're doing some pretty
incredible things,

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:29.805
but this is just the beginning.

00:12:29.805 --> 00:12:31.346
And we can't wait
to see what's next.

00:12:41.409 --> 00:12:42.450
Pretty cool stuff, right?

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.640
So you can see what we
mean by building out

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.720
the conscious home.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.630
It's not just about
building connectivity.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.800
It's not about just
building products

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.924
that connect to each other.

00:12:54.924 --> 00:12:56.290
It's about building experiences.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.601
And as some of these
early partners can show,

00:12:58.601 --> 00:13:00.600
there's some amazing
things that we could build.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.080
So I'd like to invite
up Mark McBride.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.680
So Mark McBride leads
the development team

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.430
that actually has built the
Works with Nest program.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.763
And he's going to talk to you
about some of the examples

00:13:07.763 --> 00:13:10.050
and how to build apps.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.490
MARK MCBRIDE: Hello.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.720
Thanks for coming.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.850
Is Matt said, we're
going to talk about some

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.452
of the specifics around the API.

00:13:17.452 --> 00:13:19.410
We'll talk about how
we're authenticating users

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.080
and protecting user information.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.690
Walk through some sample code.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.280
Talk about some UI guidelines.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.180
And talk about some
of the testing tools

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.720
we've built to make
putting together

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.000
client applications super easy.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.370
As Matt covered, right now,
Nest sells thermostats and smart

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.787
smoke and CO detectors.

00:13:36.787 --> 00:13:38.620
And these two things
have a primary function

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.700
that they execute in the home.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.080
The smoke detectors,
monitoring your environment

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.200
for smoke and CO and
setting off alarms.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.658
The thermostat's doing the same
with the actual environment

00:13:48.658 --> 00:13:50.240
and controlling HVAC systems.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.910
But given the sensors
they have, there

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.390
are secondary functions
they can perform as well.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.520
And we use that to determine
things about the home itself.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.200
So our data is not
just device specific,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.226
but it's also home specific.

00:14:02.226 --> 00:14:04.850
The other thing that we thought
about when we were building out

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.800
this program is you're
not always at home.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.424
When you're outside
the home right now,

00:14:08.424 --> 00:14:10.070
Nest has some capabilities.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.270
But our partners can
offer us a lot more.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.250
And so we built the ETA API
as something totally new

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:20.030
that allows partners to tell
us when they're coming home.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.412
We'll talk about some of
the specific devices now.

00:14:22.412 --> 00:14:23.870
The thermostat has
about what you'd

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.820
expect from an HVAC
control system.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.880
You can monitor current
environment of the house

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.980
that it's in.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.970
You get access to target
temperature controls.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.965
To HVAC modes, you can operate
the fan if one's in there.

00:14:33.965 --> 00:14:36.340
And all the things you'd expect
from a regular thermostat

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.589
control.

00:14:37.589 --> 00:14:39.130
What's interesting
about HVAC systems

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.350
is they're surprisingly
complicated.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.009
You'll notice in the
API documentation

00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:45.050
that current temperature
is not a writable field.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.440
That one's read-only.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.350
Target temperature's writable.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.590
There's a variety
of systems that we

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.340
operate to make sure that target
temperatures are achieved.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.970
There's emergency heat, there's
multi-stage compressors,

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.290
there's heat pumps,
there's radiant heating.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.610
All of those things
work together

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:02.980
to make your home comfortable.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.021
But there's things you
can do to them to put them

00:15:05.021 --> 00:15:08.290
in situations that are
pretty nonsensical.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.820
It's a lot of power, it's
a lot of responsibility.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.820
Where possible, we're trying
to absorb that responsibility.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.009
So our API has
safeguards built in.

00:15:16.009 --> 00:15:18.050
If you try to put the
environment in a state that

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.716
doesn't make sense,
you'll get an error.

00:15:19.716 --> 00:15:21.920
We won't let you do something
dangerous to the home.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.570
So when you're building these
integrations, just watch out

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.230
for things to come back and say,
you're not allowed to do this.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.813
There's usually a
textual descriptions

00:15:28.813 --> 00:15:32.320
that you can interpret and make
sure you don't do that again.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.650
Also with the thermostat,
and we realized

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.020
about a year and a
half, two years ago,

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.390
that we had access to a device
that controls the largest

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.870
energy consumption
source in the house.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.080
So we partnered with
energy programs, utilities,

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.580
around the country
to provide what's

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.156
called rush hour rewards.

00:15:50.156 --> 00:15:52.430
On hot days,
usually, when there's

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.930
going to be peak
demand on the grid,

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.420
an energy company
can tell us, we

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.800
would like some load shed
between certain hours

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.270
so that we don't have to
start up coal burning, usually

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:03.162
dirty, power plants
to meet peak demand.

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:05.120
We've made this available
to our partners, too.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.320
Because while HVAC is the
largest energy consumer,

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.560
it's not the only one.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.860
And we'll talk about some
demos and some integrations

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.190
our partners have done around
that a little bit later.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.970
The Protect right
now is pretty simple.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.070
It has alarm states, it
has battery level states,

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.310
and it also has an
overall device state.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.340
So in our UI, we paint the
smoke detector a single color.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.312
We don't have lights for
smoke, and CO, and battery.

00:16:28.312 --> 00:16:29.770
Rather than have
all of our clients

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.895
try to interpret those
three different alert levels

00:16:31.895 --> 00:16:33.561
and try to come up
with the right color,

00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:35.880
we have an additional field
that's overall device state

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.810
that you can use to keep
your UIs in sync with ours.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.500
We don't have a
lot of constraints

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.940
around how you use our data.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.010
But in particular with Nest
Protect, it's a safety device.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.480
And when users are looking
at data from this device,

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.640
it's likely an emergency.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.570
And we don't want
people to be confused.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.960
So we do ask that the alert
levels provided by the API

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.490
are the ones you use in
your client applications.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.492
Don't try to reinterpret these
as, get up, get out, et cetera.

00:17:01.492 --> 00:17:02.950
Just use the text
we have in there.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.670
So we talked about the primary
and secondary device functions

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.640
we have.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.640
The most prevalent
or probably the most

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.990
used one we have right now is
what's called Home and Away.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:21.780
So we have PIR sensors or motion
detectors on the thermostat

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.290
and on the smoke detector.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.290
And using those, we can
make pretty good guesses

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.760
about whether somebody
is in the house or not.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.289
So our structure has a
field that's called Away.

00:17:31.289 --> 00:17:33.080
There's two different
subdivisions of this.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.780
There's manual
away and auto away.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.620
Manual is exactly
what you think.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.240
The users has explicitly
said, I'm home, or I'm away.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.810
We won't use sensor data to
override any of those states.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.120
The user said what it is,
we take their word for it.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.250
There's another state
called auto away.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.060
And if this is
enabled on devices,

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.400
if we don't sense motion for
a certain period of time,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.240
we put the house into auto away.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.990
And the difference
between that and manual

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.260
away is when we do
sense motion, we

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.320
take the structure out of away
and put it back into home.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.550
Currently, we use this
to control temperature.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:05.950
If people aren't
in the house, we

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.450
have secondary
target temperatures

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:09.664
that are usually more
efficient but less comfortable.

00:18:09.664 --> 00:18:11.080
And we'll revert
to those settings

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.600
until somebody comes
back to the house.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.122
You can use that for a wide
range of things-- turning off

00:18:16.122 --> 00:18:18.080
the lights when people
leave, turning on lights

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.110
when people get home.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.440
But we do ask that you respect
kind of manual away versus auto

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:23.970
away.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.810
Auto away is an algorithm
that we've built,

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:27.354
and we've put a
lot of work into.

00:18:27.354 --> 00:18:29.020
So while we're giving
you the capability

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.920
to set home and
away explicitly, we

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.590
ask that you do that at the
specific request of the user.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.450
Not to try to duplicate
a secondary auto

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.820
away algorithm outside of Nest.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.190
So we talked about ETA.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.523
And this is something that's
brand new for the developer

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:45.470
program.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.170
The ETA API is effectively
a stream of arrival time

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.100
estimates that come
from a partner.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.750
So this makes a lot of sense
in the context of automotive.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:53.910
You have a nav system.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.210
You have a waypoint.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.274
If that waypoint
is the home, you

00:18:58.274 --> 00:18:59.940
have a stream of
estimated arrival times

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.310
that come from GPS, et cetera.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:03.940
You keep giving us streams.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.220
We evaluate that stream
for confidence levels.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.700
If people veer off
course, they stop for gas,

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.334
they have something
else to do, we

00:19:10.334 --> 00:19:12.250
want you to keep streaming
us those so that we

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.532
can take action when
it's appropriate.

00:19:14.532 --> 00:19:15.990
When we trust that
somebody's going

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.440
to be home at a specific time,
we'll take appropriate action,

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.244
make sure the home's
comfortable when people arrive.

00:19:23.244 --> 00:19:24.160
This is an indication.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.740
As the car moves
closer to the house,

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.940
we want arrival times to
continue to be streamed.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.710
Once we see that
it's in the range,

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.190
and we trust the estimate,
we'll take action

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:34.785
to take the house out of away.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.160
So we've talked about
the APIs we're providing.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.659
Let's talk a little bit about
how we're protecting user data

00:19:43.659 --> 00:19:45.790
and making sure that all
of this stuff is secure.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.873
The data we're providing
is pretty personal stuff.

00:19:47.873 --> 00:19:49.750
It tells you whether
you're home or away.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:51.791
It tells you what temperature
it is in the house,

00:19:51.791 --> 00:19:53.750
whether there's alarm states.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.850
We're using industry standard
OAuth2 for communication.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:58.080
Everything's over SSL.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.490
There's no opportunity
to do cleartext.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.530
Every user that's exposing
data has to explicitly do so

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.540
with a fine grain
set of permissions.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.500
So as a client, you can't
get access to all the data

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.040
unless you explicitly
say, my client

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.370
needs access to all the data.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.090
You can instead ask for, I
need to read thermostat control

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.840
data, which gives the user
a more comfortable feeling

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.472
that you're not asking
for away states.

00:20:19.472 --> 00:20:20.930
You're not asking
for alarm states.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.940
All you really want to do
is look at temperature data.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.270
In addition to the standard
OAuth2 mechanisms for this,

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.800
we're also requiring developers
to provide justifications

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.609
for each scope they need.

00:20:30.609 --> 00:20:32.400
So in a case of Whirlpool,
who needs access

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.540
to rush hour rewards events,
they would say something like,

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.047
we would like this data so
that we can put the washers

00:20:38.047 --> 00:20:40.630
and dryers into a more efficient
mode during rush hour rewards

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.650
events.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.900
We're also providing a very
high level of transparency

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.620
to what clients are
doing to user's accounts.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.590
And so in our energy view, we
will decorate all modifications

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:55.540
that clients make to target
temperatures, to Home and Away,

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.400
with the client
application name.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.670
So if my Mercedes sets
an ETA on a home, when

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.400
we pull the structure
out of away,

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.110
it will say, done by
Mercedes Drive Style.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.700
And this gives users
great visibility

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.030
into which clients are
integrated, because sometimes

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.190
people forget.

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.230
And what they're actually
doing to the account.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:14.970
For integrations that
are more passive,

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.100
we also have an
activity log per client.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.460
So users, at any time, can go to
Settings in their applications,

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.200
see all the integrated
clients, and see the last time

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.349
they connected to
the Nest service.

00:21:26.349 --> 00:21:28.640
So here we're going to walk
through the typical sign-up

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.140
flow.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.540
If people have
used OAuth before,

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.830
this should look
incredibly familiar.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.980
Here we're starting from
a Whirlpool smart app

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.470
or an illustration of the app.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.387
This will say something
on the Whirlpool side,

00:21:40.387 --> 00:21:42.803
would you like to connect your
Whirlpool devices with Work

00:21:42.803 --> 00:21:43.380
with Nest?

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.200
Here is the awesome stuff you're
going to get once you connect.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.830
This takes us to
the Nest site, where

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.163
you see that Whirlpool would
like to see the temperature

00:21:51.163 --> 00:21:52.540
and settings on your thermostat.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.956
And the light gray
text underneath

00:21:53.956 --> 00:21:56.170
is text provided by
Whirlpool to justify

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.970
why they need
access to this data.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.680
Scroll through all that.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.760
If the user says yes,
we authenticate them.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.250
Make sure that
this user actually

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.172
has permission to
expose that data.

00:22:08.172 --> 00:22:10.380
And then it'll return you
to the Whirlpool app, which

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.171
has settings for that
specific integration.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.730
So that's how we secure data.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.521
We'll talk a little
bit about the mechanics

00:22:18.521 --> 00:22:20.460
of actually getting to the data.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.991
We wanted this to be real time.

00:22:21.991 --> 00:22:24.240
And this was something that
we talked about internally

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.440
quite a bit.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.470
The easy way to do most of
these APIs is typical REST.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.890
RPC, connect to the
service, tell me information

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.822
about the thermostat, I'll
do some stuff with it.

00:22:33.822 --> 00:22:35.780
But that's not what we
do for our applications.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.530
If you look at the
Nest applications,

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.050
when you change target
temperature on a mobile device

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.270
and watch the thermostat,
that interaction

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.892
takes place in
less than a second.

00:22:43.892 --> 00:22:46.100
In fact, customers call
support when it takes longer.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.702
So we can see
service degradation

00:22:47.702 --> 00:22:49.660
through customer support
calls, because they'll

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.246
call up and say, hey,
it took me 20 seconds.

00:22:52.246 --> 00:22:54.450
For the thermostat,
it's a convenience.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.290
For the smoke detector, it's
not so much a convenience.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.350
It's more critical
safety feature.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.829
When the smoke
detector goes off,

00:23:00.829 --> 00:23:03.370
we want to be able to relay that
information as quickly as we

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.800
can to all the integrations
around the house.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.260
It would be a little weird in
the LIFX integration example,

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.980
if your smoke detector went
off, and 30 seconds later,

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.616
when the polling hit, the
lights started blinking red.

00:23:13.616 --> 00:23:15.240
So we wanted to
provide this capability

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.410
to our client developers.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.697
But real time APIs
are usually harder.

00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:21.280
And we didn't want to do it at
the expense of having everybody

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.070
have to learn a new, complicated
network programming model that

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.736
was going to have a
steep learning curve

00:23:25.736 --> 00:23:28.260
and be fragile at
best on both sides.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.234
So we looked around.

00:23:29.234 --> 00:23:31.650
And Firebase happened to be
doing something almost exactly

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.300
like what we do for our clients.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.508
And we thought it would be
a great opportunity for us

00:23:35.508 --> 00:23:39.000
to work with fairly standard,
open, documented, well

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.550
supported clients that we didn't
have to deliver ourselves.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.360
In cases where Firebase
clients don't work,

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.800
we do provide a REST interface.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.410
We also provide an event
source based interface.

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.250
So you can still be
real time, if you're

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.200
willing to adopt a slightly more
complicated programming model.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.030
This gives us the capability
to work almost anywhere.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:00.860
If you can use SSL,
you can use our API.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.500
So this is a picture
we have today.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.230
Typical clients,
developed with Firebase,

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:06.940
talk to Firebase servers.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.440
With the Nest
developer program, you

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.180
use the same Firebase clients
on iOS, Java, JavaScript,

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.430
you just talk to Nest servers.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.370
All right.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.150
So we'll go through
some example code.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.750
And this is pulled from
some of the early people we

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.647
worked with to
flesh out the API.

00:24:23.647 --> 00:24:25.730
And so some of the use
cases you saw in the video,

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.230
we'll go through
sample code to show

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.214
how you can implement
that yourself.

00:24:29.214 --> 00:24:31.630
I will preface this by saying
I'm like the world's leading

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.550
authority on not being
good at JavaScript.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:36.770
So don't judges this
so harshly on style.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.280
But I think it's
indicative of what people

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.070
can do with a little bit
of spare time and access

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:45.520
to the Nest developer program.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.170
So Whirlpool.

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.330
Large appliances, large
energy consumption,

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.015
listening to rush
hour rewards events,

00:24:51.015 --> 00:24:52.390
putting things
into a more energy

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:53.980
efficient mode when
peak periods hit.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.890
Most of our samples
start off like this.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.490
I make a connection to the Nest
developer API using a Firebase

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.230
client, and I
authenticate with a token

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.250
that's been provided
by the user.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.670
We use this ref.on to set
up a listener for changes

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:11.419
to data at a location.

00:25:11.419 --> 00:25:13.460
So you see in this case,
we've connected not just

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.980
to the developer API root
API, but we've actually

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:21.930
connected to a specific
structure that that user owns.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.670
Here we say, get me the peak
period start and end times,

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.970
get the current date, and
then just compare times.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.120
If we're in a peak period,
I log into the console

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.070
and see peak period.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:34.630
You do something amazing to
remove energy from the grid.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.330
If the peak period
is not in effect,

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:37.830
we just log that
it's not in effect.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:38.913
So pretty straightforward.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.990
Mercedes, different use
case with the ETA API.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.457
In this case, we have
a car going home.

00:25:48.457 --> 00:25:50.040
Something on the
index system pops up,

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.200
says 30 minutes from home.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.460
We say heat it up, confirm.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:04.690
And then the thermostat takes
appropriate action, preheating.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.190
So this example is
a little bit more

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:07.564
complicated,
because like I said,

00:26:07.564 --> 00:26:09.804
we have to send this
stream of ETA times.

00:26:09.804 --> 00:26:11.470
So it's not just going
to be a one shot,

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.470
go through, set a value.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.260
But we'll try and
walk through it.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.130
Same thing.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.360
We connect to Firebase.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.401
Here, once again, we're
connecting to a structure

00:26:19.401 --> 00:26:20.860
and authenticating.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.930
We have people set
a unique trip ID,

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.790
because multiple people may be
coming home to the same house.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.960
So we want a unique
set of arrival

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.770
streams so we can take
the house out of away

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:32.599
at the appropriate time.

00:26:32.599 --> 00:26:34.140
We're going to set
up a function here

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.100
that takes an array of
estimated times of arrival.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.600
Pop the first
element off the list.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.540
Create an estimated time that
that person's going to arrive.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:46.160
This is an array of
n minutes from now.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.190
Then we take a trial value
of the structure called ETA,

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.940
and we set a value
with the trip idea

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.660
as the unique one we calculated.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.960
And the arrival window begin and
end to the same estimate time.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.530
We do allow the
flexibility to have

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:00.890
a window of arrival time
in case you're not sure.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:02.570
In the case of a
car nav system, they

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.782
don't provide much
delta on either side.

00:27:04.782 --> 00:27:06.740
And then we just set up
a timeout in JavaScript

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.370
to set the ETA for
the rest of the array.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.120
And so this just calls
itself recursively,

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.869
popping elements off
the list every minute

00:27:13.869 --> 00:27:15.589
to set arrival times.

00:27:15.589 --> 00:27:17.130
And then we just
call the whole thing

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.970
with a simulated set of
arrival time streams.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.960
Little more complicated,
but not crazy.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.670
Jawbone's use case is pretty
straightforward as well.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.510
The wristbands know
when you go to sleep.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:30.720
They know when you wake up.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.722
With Nest devices, we
have motion sensors

00:27:32.722 --> 00:27:34.180
around the house,
but typically not

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.407
in the bedroom in a
real time capacity.

00:27:36.407 --> 00:27:38.615
So this allows you to get
better presence information

00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:41.310
or activity information
into the Nest API.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.430
So the comfort of
your home can be

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.890
set earlier than it
would be if you just

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.690
walked by the thermostat.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:52.780
So in this case, we sense
motion on the Jawbone wristband.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.370
That makes a call
to the Nest service

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:57.620
and sets a target temperature.

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.155
So let's walk through this.

00:27:59.155 --> 00:28:01.440
This should look very
familiar by this point.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.520
Connect to Firebase,
authenticate with a token.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.920
I'm going to compute
a wake up time.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.846
This is setting an alarm
earlier in the evening.

00:28:09.846 --> 00:28:11.220
Set the timeout
for when I should

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.530
set my target temperature.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:13.950
And pick a target temperature.

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.200
Usually this is presented
in the UI of the integration

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.602
we're doing.

00:28:17.602 --> 00:28:19.060
This call's a little
bit different.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.620
This is not ref.on,
this is ref.once.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.280
So Firebase also allows
you to just get data

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.595
once and process it.

00:28:25.595 --> 00:28:27.470
This won't be called
every time data changes.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.505
This will just be
called the first time.

00:28:29.505 --> 00:28:30.880
And this shows
how you would walk

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.600
through all the
thermostats in a structure.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.830
So for each thermostat, set a
time out to change the target

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:42.210
temperature at the time
I'm going to wake up.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:45.270
Pretty straightforward.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.780
The last one we have is LIFX.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.780
This one is using
the Nest Protect APIS

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.390
to respond to changes
in alert state.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:55.400
When it senses smoke,
it can change the lights

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.780
to blink red, which gives people
better visibility in smoke

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.669
and also provides
visible queues for people

00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:01.710
who are hearing impaired.

00:29:03.814 --> 00:29:05.480
So again, this will
look really familiar

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.440
for the first couple lines.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:06.740
Oh, no.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:07.380
It changed.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:07.940
Look.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.856
Here we're going to set
up some functions that

00:29:09.856 --> 00:29:12.170
set lights and blink lights,
but now it looks familiar.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:16.114
So we connect to Firebase, then
authenticate with our token.

00:29:16.114 --> 00:29:17.410
All right.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:18.960
There's more code.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.200
Here we call once again.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.074
And we're going to walk
through all the smoke

00:29:22.074 --> 00:29:24.317
detectors in a structure.

00:29:24.317 --> 00:29:25.900
And here, we're
actually going to say,

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.560
for each smoke
detector, I'm really

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.420
just interested in
the smoke alarm state.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.244
So set my callback
just on that one.

00:29:31.244 --> 00:29:32.910
I don't care when
battery level changes.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:34.330
I don't care when CO changes.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:35.990
Although we probably should
blink lights in that case

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.515
as well.

00:29:36.515 --> 00:29:38.640
But this shows that you
can listen to specific data

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.670
elements in this
document and not

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:42.839
have to respond to
the whole thing.

00:29:42.839 --> 00:29:44.630
And here, I basically
say, if it's warning,

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:45.880
why don't we blink
the lights yellow.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.710
If it's emergency,
set the lights to red.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:51.420
If it's all clear, set
the lights back to white.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.891
So it has four integrations.

00:29:52.891 --> 00:29:54.640
Somebody who's not
very good at JavaScript

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.690
was able to whip this out
in 30 to 60 minutes total.

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:00.044
I actually ran them in a
browser, and they worked.

00:30:00.044 --> 00:30:01.710
But they're pretty
compelling use cases,

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:04.900
we think, for integrating with
data provided by Nest devices.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.070
And really, really
extending the reach

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.460
of what we can do with
a more responsible home.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:13.850
Next we'll get into
user interface.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:16.220
We have a detailed
section on UI guidelines

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.620
on developer.nest.com.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.130
And we'll just touch
some high points here.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.960
We don't want you
to build Nest apps.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.650
We built those.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:24.080
We think they're pretty good.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.480
We'd like you to build your
apps based on Nest data.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.570
The only things that
we ask you to respect

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.340
are there's a few key things.
home and Away are very critical

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.090
concepts.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.390
And so we prefer that
those stay Home and Away.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:37.681
And Nest Protective Event
States, like we talked about.

00:30:37.681 --> 00:30:40.757
Those are security
things, safety things.

00:30:40.757 --> 00:30:43.090
We don't want to confuse users
in the case of emergency,

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.381
and don't try to be too cute
with the house is on fire.

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:49.660
There's also a
list of trademarks.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.650
Logo usage, et cetera.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.916
There's a whole page on
it at developer.nest.com.

00:30:53.916 --> 00:30:57.750
When you get ready to launch,
I suggest going through that.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.680
Testing.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.230
Nest devices are really, really
simple from a UX standpoint.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.290
Really, really
complicated for the kinds

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:07.290
of hardware they actually
have to work with.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:09.290
And we touched a little
bit on the complications

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:10.820
of HVAC systems earlier.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.887
But when we're thinking about
this, if we hand developers

00:31:13.887 --> 00:31:15.720
a physical thermostat
and say, why don't you

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.020
test all the corner cases?

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.750
You're going to have to
wire the back plates to like

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.520
75 different combinations of
has cool, has heat, doesn't

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.610
have cool, has a common wire.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.170
So we've created
a Chrome extension

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:28.410
that allows you to create
what we call virtual devices.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:30.890
And the capabilities
of virtual devices

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:33.340
are extended to allow
you to physically

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.060
modify the wiring--
not physically.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.900
Virtually modify the
wiring of the device.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.930
So I can create my fake
device, I can set it up

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:41.940
with an air conditioner,
run my tests.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.681
I can take away the
air conditioner,

00:31:43.681 --> 00:31:45.180
which on the actual
thermostat would

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.013
be the equivalent to
pulling it off the wall

00:31:47.013 --> 00:31:48.104
and removing a wire.

00:31:48.104 --> 00:31:50.270
Which allows me to test a
wide range of permutations

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:55.310
of hardware without having to
set up a really crazy test lab.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:58.839
We also have measures in place
to protect both the devices

00:31:58.839 --> 00:32:01.380
and the service, to make sure
they're available for everybody

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.470
all the time.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:05.870
And so we have two different
types of rate limits.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:08.540
The first set of rate limits
are designed to protect devices.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.120
Our devices are
highly constrained,

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.020
they're stealing power from the
HVAC system at really, really

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.360
low current levels.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.620
And so you can't make
an unlimited number

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.540
of modification
requests to thermostats

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.890
and expect them to
continue to function.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:24.100
So when we think the device
is getting into a state

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.530
where it may not be able to
execute all its functions,

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:28.830
we'll start rejecting
developer requests.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:30.906
So if you see something
that's a 429 response,

00:32:30.906 --> 00:32:32.530
or an error code in
Firebase that says,

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.613
device can't services this
at this time, it's time

00:32:34.613 --> 00:32:36.290
to back off.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:39.010
These rate limits, because
they're protecting the device,

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.949
are shared across all
client integrations.

00:32:40.949 --> 00:32:42.490
And so this is a
little bit different

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.800
than a lot of the
ways rate limits work.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.330
If a customer has
100 integrations,

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:48.980
in each one's making one
request a minute, a lot of them

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.599
are probably going
to get rejected.

00:32:51.599 --> 00:32:53.140
The second set of
rate limits we have

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.290
are to protect the
service itself.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:59.520
And these are per client,
or per access token.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.340
These are typically
around the REST API.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.559
We do have a limited number
of modification requests

00:33:03.559 --> 00:33:04.100
you can make.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.500
Those are device specific.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.764
But forget requests
on the REST API.

00:33:07.764 --> 00:33:09.180
Each connection
that's established

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.060
burns a little bit
of CPU and bandwidth,

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.170
and so we limit you
to a reasonable number

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.759
of requests per access token.

00:33:15.759 --> 00:33:17.550
The nice thing about
Firebase, because it's

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.640
a long-lived connection,
is you are effectively

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.270
unlimited for read
requests because you should

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.019
establish a single
connection and just let

00:33:23.019 --> 00:33:25.590
that ride for a pretty
long period of time.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:28.280
So we encourage
you to go that way.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.040
Things to look out for
while you're testing.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.740
Cover the expected cases.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.177
That includes things like
users have multiple structures.

00:33:35.177 --> 00:33:36.760
You should let them
pick which one you

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.432
want to turn the
lights on in, probably.

00:33:39.432 --> 00:33:41.515
Users may have multiple
thermostats per structure,

00:33:41.515 --> 00:33:42.820
although a lot don't.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.150
Users may have
multiple Nest Protects.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.470
And like we talked about before,
the thermostats themselves

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.060
have a variety of wiring
combinations that provide,

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.230
some have fans, some
have air conditioners,

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:56.170
some have heat pumps, some
have stage two heat pumps.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:58.620
But you should test as wide
a range of permutations

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:02.560
of physical hardware as you
can using the virtual devices.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.420
Also make sure you
handle the unexpected.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.660
So network connectivity
gets disrupted,

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.679
clients disconnect,
clients reconnect.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.360
Make sure you take
that into account.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.350
Rate limits can occur.

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:17.570
We don't have a fantastic story
for simulating rate limits.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.600
But if you do get a 429
response for rate limit,

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.389
make sure you handle
that appropriately.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:24.050
Once you get above
a certain size,

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.900
we do have a lightweight
client review process in place.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.550
And this isn't to
stifle innovation.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.008
This is just to
make sure that once

00:34:30.008 --> 00:34:31.780
people get above sort
of mass market size,

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.780
that we have some review
that people are meeting

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.784
UI guidelines, that the
thing actually works,

00:34:35.784 --> 00:34:37.659
that it's not totally
detrimental to the Nest

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:39.440
service.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.760
This is the token cap
request that comes into us.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.100
We look at things.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.550
If it passes muster, then
we up your token limit

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:48.122
to however much you need.

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.080
If it's not covered
before, all this stuff

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.909
is available right now
at developer.nest.com.

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:55.960
You can go there today.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.204
We have many, many
developers already signed up.

00:34:59.204 --> 00:35:00.120
You create an account.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.670
You can create your clients.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:05.030
Provide the scopes you need and
the justifications for those.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:07.860
There's a detailed set
of documents on testing.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.745
There's guidelines
for deployment.

00:35:09.745 --> 00:35:12.285
And there's also forms to
go request more tokens when

00:35:12.285 --> 00:35:15.450
your app gets above
a certain size.

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:17.722
The documentation we
provided is pretty extensive.

00:35:17.722 --> 00:35:19.930
We've worked with a lot of
people for reviewing this.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:21.540
We've done a lot
of work internally

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.410
to have people inside Nest
come try to build integrations

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:25.762
on the Nest platform.

00:35:25.762 --> 00:35:27.220
So we think we have
is pretty good.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.032
There's a ton of it there.

00:35:29.032 --> 00:35:30.990
If you don't get your
questions answered there,

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:33.010
we also have the Stack
Overflow Nest API tag.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:35.309
We will be happy to answer
any other questions.

00:35:35.309 --> 00:35:35.850
Thanks, guys.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:37.725
I'm going to hand it
back to Matt to wrap up.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.138
MATT ROGERS: Thanks, Mark.

00:35:43.138 --> 00:35:43.946
Yeah.

00:35:43.946 --> 00:35:45.070
Pretty exciting to be here.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:46.780
And pretty excited to see what
you guys are all going to do.

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.555
And as he said, we put together
a pretty comprehensive program.

00:35:49.555 --> 00:35:52.180
There's a reason why it took us
the better part of eight months

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:53.355
to get here.

00:35:53.355 --> 00:35:55.730
We wanted to think about the
whole end to end experience.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:56.980
Think about authentication.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.040
About user privacy,
about being transparent.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.920
I think we may be one
of the first companies

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:01.587
to ever do this.

00:36:01.587 --> 00:36:03.544
Everyone uses OAUTH, but
most of the time, when

00:36:03.544 --> 00:36:05.170
you use OAUTH, it
says, hey, this app

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:06.890
wants access to
your contact list.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:08.600
And well, why does it want that?

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.840
So I think putting
the extra mile

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.310
in having developers
say what they

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:13.867
want to use the
data for, I think,

00:36:13.867 --> 00:36:16.200
gives users that additional
comfort about their privacy.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.680
And I encourage everyone to
be honest and open about this.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.900
Because we're going to
be auditing it, too.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.062
So again, everything,
as Mark said,

00:36:25.062 --> 00:36:26.520
is available on
developer.nest.com.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.396
We went through kind
of extensive review

00:36:29.396 --> 00:36:31.020
internally with our
early beta partners

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.700
to make sure we have a really
comprehensive set of documents

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.640
for you guys to use.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.220
Big and small.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.390
Anybody can work with Nest.

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:43.140
Any platform, iOS, Android, web,
hardware, software services,

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.640
the whole gamut.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.940
No hardware changes required.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.490
And you guys can start today.

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:51.050
Again, summing it up.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:52.230
Thermostat control.

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.271
Working with Nest Protect
and listening for those

00:36:54.271 --> 00:36:55.060
alarms states.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:57.100
Home and Away, ETA.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.900
I think these are really
powerful concepts.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.870
And I'm really excited
to see what we do.

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.930
I mean, this is just
the beginning for Nest.

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:05.430
There's going to be hopefully
thousands of applications

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.770
that we haven't even
thought of and things you

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.747
guys are going to build
over the coming year.

00:37:09.747 --> 00:37:11.580
Really excited to see
what you guys will do.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.720
And again, this is
just the beginning.

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.610
I can see this being
a platform that we use

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:18.880
and we leverage as
we add more products.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.250
What other cool
features will we add?

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.140
Again, thank you
all for being here.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.760
I really appreciate it.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.550
One last thing.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:30.840
So we had a long history
getting to where we are.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.042
And Nest is doing really
well, and being part of Google

00:37:34.042 --> 00:37:34.750
has been amazing.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:36.447
But getting here
was a long road.

00:37:36.447 --> 00:37:38.780
And I can imagine for a lot
of you guys getting started,

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.220
you don't necessarily
have all the networks

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.440
that we had to get started.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.680
So thinking about that,
my co-founder, Tony, and I

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.400
were talking about,
well how can we

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.434
make this program
completely comprehensive?

00:37:48.434 --> 00:37:50.850
So we partnered with some of
our early investors, Kleiner,

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:52.474
Perkins, and Google
Ventures, to create

00:37:52.474 --> 00:37:54.307
a fund for Nest developers.

00:37:54.307 --> 00:37:55.890
So as you guys are
building your apps,

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.056
if you think you need funding
to build your company,

00:37:58.056 --> 00:37:58.980
that's available.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.990
And applications are online.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:03.290
Thoughtfulthingsfund.com.

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:06.477
And the KP and GV guys are
going to check it out and start

00:38:06.477 --> 00:38:08.060
funding companies
that work with Nest.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.200
So I think it's a
really good thing.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.080
I think it's one of
the first times this

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.163
has been done in the home.

00:38:12.163 --> 00:38:14.720
So I'm really excited to see
what kind of new companies come

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:14.900
out.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.316
Again, as I asked
earlier, there's

00:38:16.316 --> 00:38:18.090
a lot of things
that could be built.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:19.465
And a lot of
companies that could

00:38:19.465 --> 00:38:20.670
be started in this industry.

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.020
So thanks again for coming.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.660
And I'm really excited to
see what you guys build.
