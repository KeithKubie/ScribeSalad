00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.270
In this segment, we'll be
talking about how to obtain a

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.960
developer key to make YouTube
API calls and

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.770
run the sample code.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.746
To do this, we'll need a
registered Google account.

00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:21.805
The first thing we want
to do is browse at

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:23.550
a Google API console.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.530
We can find this at
code.google.com/apis/console.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.110
Or we can just search for
Google API console in a

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.220
favorite search engine.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.990
We'll need to create
a project the first

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.170
time we open the site.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.030
Projects are groupings of APIs,
and it may make sense

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.230
for us to create different
projects for every new

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.200
application that we write.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.160
For running the sample code, we
only need one project and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.810
one set of API keys.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.950
After we enable our project,
we'll need

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.250
to enable some services.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.270
Let's click through to Services
menu, if we're not

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.680
already on this page,
and scroll down.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.200
We'll want to enable the YouTube
Data API and the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.910
YouTube Analytics API first.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.592
Let's toggle the YouTube Data
API from off to on.

00:01:11.592 --> 00:01:14.130
The very first time we do this,
we're presented with the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.385
Terms of Service.

00:01:15.385 --> 00:01:18.560
We want to read the Terms of
Service and accept if we want

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.810
to be able to use the API.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.020
Now, when we scroll down, we'll
see if the YouTube data

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.935
API has been accepted
and enabled.

00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:33.047
We'll click On to also enable
the YouTube Analytics API.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.790
The Search by Topic code sample
requires the use of

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.600
Freebase API, so we'll need
to enable that as well.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.530
There's a separate Terms of
Service that we'll need to

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.780
read and accept.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.520
Once this is done, we'll need
to access our API keys.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.009
We can do this by clicking API
Access in the navigation menu.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.120
There are two types
of API access--

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.610
simple and authorized.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.460
If all we want to do a search
for videos, channels, and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.830
playlists, all we need
is simple API access.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.470
The key is already provides
to us in our project.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.630
However, if we want to write
applications that can act on

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.850
behalf of users and upload
videos, manage playlist, or do

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.250
anything else that a user
can do when logged into

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.270
YouTube.com, we'll need to
create an OAuth 2.0 client ID

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.480
and secret pair.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.910
We do this by clicking the
button that says Create an

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.130
OAuth 2.0 Client ID.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.500
We'll need to give us
a product name.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.880
We may want to update logo
and homepage URL.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.140
Click Next when we're done.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.570
Select Web Application.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.720
We'll need to provide
a site or host name.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.970
We can edit this later.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.900
Since we're running sample
applications, we'll set it to

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.480
Local Host to point it
to our own computer.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.560
Click Create Client
ID one more time.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.780
Once this is done, we'll have
both a simple API key as well

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.520
as a client ID and secret pair
for making OAuth 2.0

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.710
authorized API calls.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.620
Now let's go ahead and
run some sample code.
