Hello I’m Simon Whistler, you’re watching
Today I Found Out, and in the video today,

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.430
we’re looking at how big rain drops can
be and why they don’t get arbitrarily large.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.460
Let’s get started.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.930
No no no no no.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:11.930
Come on now.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:12.930
But it’s working!

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.139
Oh come one, you don’t even have a British
accent and that beard color, what is that,

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.520
it’s all wrong.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.440
It’s all wrong.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.770
At only about half as wide in diameter as
a U.S. penny, the largest raindrops ever recorded,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.080
between 8.8 mm and 1 cm, were observed by
scientists in the clouds above Brazil (1995)

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.390
and the Marshall Islands (1999).

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.139
It is unknown, however, if these bad boys
ever reached the ground at that size.

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:37.890
So why can't raindrops grow to arbitrarily
large sizes?

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.339
To begin with, let's talk a little about how
raindrops actually form.

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.219
Raindrops are more than just water; the vapor
in a cloud has to have something to condense

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.909
around, without which there would be no rain.

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.859
Called condensation nuclei, little particles
in the air, from dust, smoke or even salt,

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.530
sit at the center of the tiny droplets that
begin to form in a cloud.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.789
These tiny droplets, usually between 0.001
and 0.005 mm in diameter, at first form a

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.430
nearly spherical shape thanks to the relatively
strong cohesive forces between the water molecules.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.759
As the water drop is buffeted around in the
air, it collides with other drops, and these

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.720
small drops coalesce into larger and larger
droplets.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.670
Ultimately the water drop will become large
enough to fall to earth.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.200
When this happens, the surface tension of
the water that keeps the drop more or less

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.490
spherical is partially overcome by the airflow
pressure on its lower surface as it falls.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.220
This causes the bottom of the drop to flatten
out, while the top retains its rounded shape.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.219
Thus, contrary to the popular perception of
a teardrop shaped raindrop, thanks to the

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.530
various pressures the water drop is subjected
to as it falls to the ground, the raindrop

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.549
actually tends to look sort of like a kidney
bean or the top of a hamburger bun.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.810
For very large droplets, it can even start
to look something like a jellyfish bell, with

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.710
this usually happening when a raindrop reaches
around 4 mm across.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.819
When the droplets get larger than this (at
around 5 mm), the air pressure will ultimately

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.329
overcome the surface tension of the water
completely and the raindrop will split apart.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.070
As the drop continues to fall, it can continue
to grow or shrink as it bumps into and absorbs

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.879
or is broken apart by other droplets.

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.250
Thanks to this process, the average raindrop
that actually makes it to your head is only

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.709
around 1 to 2 mm across.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.590
That said, scientists began recording significantly
larger drops in the 1980s while studying clouds.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.099
For instance, in 1986, cloud physicists, using
the staple of all awesome science- lasers-

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:36.160
recorded raindrops as large as 8 mm in a tropical
storm over Hawaii, which was shocking since,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.650
at the time, to quote them, "there had been
a kind of consensus that raindrops would never

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.560
get bigger than about 2.5 mm."

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.670
Even factoring in that these large drops were
buffeting about in the clouds instead of falling

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.640
to earth, the scientists were surprised to
find that they could last long enough to grow

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.791
that big without being broken apart; rather,
during that early research in Hawaii, they

00:02:56.791 --> 00:03:02.550
found that the average lifespan of a 5 mm
drop was around a remarkable 20 minutes.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.019
For the aforementioned 8.8 mm and 1 cm record-holding
raindrops found in the clouds over Brazil,

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.370
scientists opined that they were the product
of relatively large ash particles from fires

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.220
burning in one of Brazil's rainforests- the
larger the condensation nuclei, the larger

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.610
the raindrop can potentially be, at least
to a point.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.500
As for the similarly sized raindrops observed
in 1999 on a relatively clear day in the Marshall

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.790
Islands, they hypothesized that these droplets
formed around salt nuclei and that there must

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.459
have been an unusually high content of liquid
water in a narrow area of clouds which caused

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.050
the droplets to collide more frequently, but
without breaking, forming these mega-drops.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.670
