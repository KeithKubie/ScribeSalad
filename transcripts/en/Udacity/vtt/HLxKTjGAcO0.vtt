00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.080
When a user taps inside the Emoji
text field, any existing text clears.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.150
So one could guess that it happens where
textFieldDidBeginEditing is called.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.310
Both the Emoji text field and
the Colorizer text field

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.465
are manipulating user generated text,
so we can guess that

00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:20.360
their delegates both implement
should change characters in range.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.830
We also know that in the Colorizer,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.400
the keyboard dismisses
upon pressing return, so

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.870
we can guess that the colorizer delegate
implements text field should return.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.640
Let's take a look at
the Emoji del again.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.760
If we look inside the text
field did begin editing method

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.050
down here at the end of the file, we can
see in this line of code that as soon as

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.590
the user clicks into the text field,
the text is cleared.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.760
So what about the rest of the Emoji
delegate's functionality?

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.340
Let's scroll up to the top of the file.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.500
Up here we can see a dictionary
that maps animal words

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.870
to Emoji symbols to
replace those words with.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.310
By the way, don't worry if you've
never seen a dictionary before.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.349
We're going to discuss Swift
dictionaries in the next lesson.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.360
Most of the action is happening in this
shouldChangeCharactersInRange method.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.710
Whenever the text changes,

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.090
the delegate is told,
then it proceeds through these steps.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.030
It constructs a new string.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.040
It looks for each Emoji string, and

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.160
then replaces Emoji strings
with Emoji characters.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.370
If we replace a string with
an Emoji we return false here, and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.650
if not, we return true and
let the text field modify the text.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.300
Now, let's see how the Colorizer works.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.600
Remember, the Colorizer closed to
the keyboard on pressing Return,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.240
which is probably the user experience or
after.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.330
So, let's take a look
at how this was done.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.610
You'll want to scroll down to where
the text field should return method is.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.920
And here in the text field
should return method,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.197
you can see this call to text
field resign first responder.

00:01:51.197 --> 00:01:55.795
Any time a keyboard starts editing, we
say that it becomes the first responder.

00:01:55.795 --> 00:01:59.225
That's why touches to the keyboard
only show up in the current text view

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:00.805
instead of all of them.

00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:04.235
Resigning this first responder
status dismisses the keyboard.

00:02:04.235 --> 00:02:06.735
So, what else is going
on in this delegate?

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:11.195
If we scroll up to the top, we can see
that just like the Emoji delegate,

00:02:11.195 --> 00:02:14.460
this Colorizer delegate
also has a dictionary.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.720
This dictionary maps color
strings to UI color objects.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.510
Whenever the text changes,

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.930
this loop finds all of the color
words in the new string.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.310
It creates an array of color objects
corresponding to the color strings, and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.950
then passes that array into a helper
message which blends the colors.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.290
You can see this blend color array
helper method down here, and here you

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.160
can see the text color of the text field
is being set to the blended color.
