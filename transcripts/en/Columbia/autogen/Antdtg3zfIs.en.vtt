want to talk about instead is how we

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900

processes and how would we actually

see is that there are lots of replicas

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:51.169

nation of processes that are perceived
 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.439
nation of processes that are perceived
to be successes and in some cases I will

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.449
to be successes and in some cases I will
 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.839
to be successes and in some cases I will
argue are successful but they're not but

00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:58.849
argue are successful but they're not but
 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:00.760

not always with the same end results and

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:03.220
to that
 

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.579
to that
and in a sense have they been were they

00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:05.589
and in a sense have they been were they
 

00:09:05.589 --> 00:09:11.759
and in a sense have they been were they
successful in their goals or not and so

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:11.769
successful in their goals or not and so
 

00:09:11.769 --> 00:09:13.290
successful in their goals or not and so
doing I think one of the points that I

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:13.300
doing I think one of the points that I
 

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.210
doing I think one of the points that I
really want to emphasize is that this

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:15.220
really want to emphasize is that this
 

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.249
really want to emphasize is that this
type of scientific assessment this type

00:09:17.249 --> 00:09:17.259
type of scientific assessment this type
 

00:09:17.259 --> 00:09:20.009
type of scientific assessment this type
of community process is a communications

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:20.019

exercise the criticism which you will
 

00:09:22.899 --> 00:09:25.920
exercise the criticism which you will
hear in which you'll read that science

hear in which you'll read that science
 

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.230

is not advanced by processes like the
 

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.439
is not advanced by processes like the

IPCC that they don't push the frontiers
 

00:09:31.449 --> 00:09:34.230
IPCC that they don't push the frontiers

should be entirely about communicating
 

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.790
should be entirely about communicating
what we think we know as a community and

audiences who care about that because

00:10:13.249 --> 00:10:13.259
audiences who care about that because
 

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:16.379
audiences who care about that because
this scientific knowledge is a part of

process and so in my view the scientific

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:21.730
process and so in my view the scientific
 

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.249
process and so in my view the scientific
assessments should be judged as

00:10:23.249 --> 00:10:23.259
assessments should be judged as
 

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:26.579
assessments should be judged as

one of these things you really do want

one of these things you really do want
to do the best job you can at

interesting question is should they if

00:10:50.759 --> 00:10:50.769
interesting question is should they if

that they should not that the that the

we could contrast this for example with

we could contrast this for example with

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:59.460
to understand what the menu of choices
is if you're going to try to inform that

you can go to the Millennium assessment

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120
you can go to the Millennium assessment
 

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.740
you can go to the Millennium assessment
website and download at least three or

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:22.750
website and download at least three or

the conclusions of the assessment
 

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.870
the conclusions of the assessment
they've you know in a sense

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880
they've you know in a sense
 

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.410
they've you know in a sense
there is a long lasting information base

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:34.420
there is a long lasting information base
 

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.510
there is a long lasting information base
and conclusion based on which to build

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:36.520
and conclusion based on which to build
 

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.810
and conclusion based on which to build
and lastly I think there needs to be

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:39.820
and lastly I think there needs to be
 

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.850
and lastly I think there needs to be
recognition of the policy communities

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:41.860
recognition of the policy communities
 

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.950
recognition of the policy communities
that the assessments have value for them

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:43.960
that the assessments have value for them
 

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.260
that the assessments have value for them
there's some some sense of co-ownership

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:46.270
there's some some sense of co-ownership
 

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:51.930
there's some some sense of co-ownership
of the process so i want to i'm going to

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:51.940
of the process so i want to i'm going to
 

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.940
of the process so i want to i'm going to
switch directions a little bit now and

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:53.950
switch directions a little bit now and
 

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.160
switch directions a little bit now and
focus on some domestic examples of some

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:56.170
focus on some domestic examples of some
 

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.260
focus on some domestic examples of some
us examples and because these are

00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:58.270
us examples and because these are
 

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:00.210
us examples and because these are
largely through my own sort of personal

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:00.220
largely through my own sort of personal
 

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.370
largely through my own sort of personal
lens and experience this is going to

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:02.380
lens and experience this is going to
 

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.680
lens and experience this is going to
focus a lot on climate change I'll talk

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:04.690
focus a lot on climate change I'll talk
 

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:07.140
focus a lot on climate change I'll talk
about the first and second National

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:07.150
about the first and second National
 

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:08.400
about the first and second National
Climate Assessment so I'm going to talk

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:08.410
Climate Assessment so I'm going to talk
 

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.380
Climate Assessment so I'm going to talk
a little bit about this interim

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:10.390
a little bit about this interim
 

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.000
a little bit about this interim
assessment of potential impacts and

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.010
assessment of potential impacts and
 

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.820
assessment of potential impacts and
natural resources and I'll just point

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:14.830
natural resources and I'll just point
 

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.130
natural resources and I'll just point
out that we're in the middle of now of

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:17.140
out that we're in the middle of now of
 

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.650
out that we're in the middle of now of
the third national climate assessment

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:18.660
the third national climate assessment
 

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:23.180
the third national climate assessment
and that's that's worth keeping in mind

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:23.190
and that's that's worth keeping in mind
 

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:26.010
and that's that's worth keeping in mind
so let me talk about the first National

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:26.020
so let me talk about the first National
 

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.900
so let me talk about the first National
Climate Assessment this was the the

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:27.910
Climate Assessment this was the the
 

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.120
Climate Assessment this was the the
cover that was on the top of that little

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:30.130
cover that was on the top of that little
 

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:33.210
cover that was on the top of that little
triangle of covers the need for a

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:33.220
triangle of covers the need for a
 

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.830
triangle of covers the need for a
national climate assessment is actually

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:34.840
national climate assessment is actually
 

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.300
national climate assessment is actually
written into the authorizing legislation

that we can actually structure the

I'm going to go give this talk at

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:19.650
I'm going to go give this talk at
 

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:23.120
I'm going to go give this talk at
Columbia so here's the general thesis

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:23.130
Columbia so here's the general thesis
 

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:25.820
Columbia so here's the general thesis
about it and so she emailed back and

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:25.830
about it and so she emailed back and
 

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:27.500
about it and so she emailed back and
said well are we are we going to be a

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:27.510
said well are we are we going to be a
 

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.990
said well are we are we going to be a
success or a failure this time so it

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000
success or a failure this time so it
 

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.270
success or a failure this time so it
beats me I guess we'll find out so the

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280
beats me I guess we'll find out so the
 

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.820
beats me I guess we'll find out so the
last thing I want to do is is is take

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:37.830
last thing I want to do is is is take
 

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:39.770
last thing I want to do is is is take
some of these observations about

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:39.780
some of these observations about
 

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.930
some of these observations about
assessment processes and think about

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940
assessment processes and think about
 

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:44.540
assessment processes and think about
some lessons for the future because I

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:44.550
some lessons for the future because I
 

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:45.890
some lessons for the future because I
think this kind of this kind of

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:45.900
think this kind of this kind of
 

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.540
think this kind of this kind of

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:51.020
communications approaches with us to
stay and it's important I think to to

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:51.030
stay and it's important I think to to
 

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:52.370
stay and it's important I think to to
now to start to think through how we

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:52.380
now to start to think through how we
 

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.260
now to start to think through how we
might want to construct these processes

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:54.270
might want to construct these processes
 

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:56.960
might want to construct these processes
in a way that the assessments have a

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:56.970
in a way that the assessments have a
 

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:59.540
in a way that the assessments have a
well-understood role to play that they

00:42:59.540 --> 00:42:59.550
well-understood role to play that they
 

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:01.700
well-understood role to play that they
and then we recognize what they've done

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:01.710
and then we recognize what they've done
 

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:03.230
and then we recognize what they've done
well and what they haven't done well and

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240
well and what they haven't done well and
 

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.910
well and what they haven't done well and
in some extent they've done really well

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920
in some extent they've done really well
 

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.250
in some extent they've done really well
in characterizing what's known to some

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.260
in characterizing what's known to some
 

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:13.820
in characterizing what's known to some
extent there there there there a little

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:13.830
extent there there there there a little
 

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:15.440
extent there there there there a little
more challenge with characterizing

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:15.450
more challenge with characterizing
 

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:16.390
more challenge with characterizing
what's uncertain

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400
what's uncertain
 

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.500
what's uncertain
and and and so just as an example one of

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:20.510
and and and so just as an example one of
 

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:22.450
and and and so just as an example one of
the key findings from the last national

the key findings from the last national
 

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.890
the key findings from the last national
climate assessment is this notion that

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:23.900
climate assessment is this notion that

thresholds are going to be crossed
 

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.180
thresholds are going to be crossed
leading to large changes in climate and

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:28.190
leading to large changes in climate and
 

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:29.590
leading to large changes in climate and
ecosystems and we can actually be quite

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:29.600
ecosystems and we can actually be quite
 

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.570
ecosystems and we can actually be quite
confident about that because we're

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:31.580
confident about that because we're
 

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.370
confident about that because we're
starting to see empirical evidence of

uncertainty and decision making but the
 

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.580
uncertainty and decision making but the
fact is that we deal with uncertainty

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:06.590
fact is that we deal with uncertainty
 

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:09.370

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:19.170
wondering what were the reasons for why
 

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:23.420
wondering what were the reasons for why
it was there was such a push towards

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:23.430
it was there was such a push towards
 

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:28.700
it was there was such a push towards
limiting its it's doubled ins I'm sorry

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:28.710
limiting its it's doubled ins I'm sorry
 

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:31.370
limiting its it's doubled ins I'm sorry
for limiting its if we're why the

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:31.380
for limiting its if we're why the
 

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.050
for limiting its if we're why the
administration at the time was was so

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:33.060
administration at the time was was so
 

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:34.910
administration at the time was was so
Bay him and not getting it out was it

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920
Bay him and not getting it out was it
 

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.770
Bay him and not getting it out was it
for political reasons well I mean I

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:36.780
for political reasons well I mean I
 

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.030
for political reasons well I mean I
won't make a political judgment there

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040
won't make a political judgment there
 

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.620
won't make a political judgment there
was a dramatic change in

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:39.630
was a dramatic change in
 

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:43.190
was a dramatic change in
administration's you know and in their

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200
administration's you know and in their
 

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:44.780
administration's you know and in their
approach towards environmental issues

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:44.790
approach towards environmental issues
 

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:50.030
approach towards environmental issues
the arm it was also and so I think the

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040
the arm it was also and so I think the
 

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.730
the arm it was also and so I think the
the the the dimensions of those

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:52.740
the the the dimensions of those
 

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:54.920
the the the dimensions of those
arguments had already become polar

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:54.930
arguments had already become polar
 

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:58.490
arguments had already become polar
really quite polarized in ways that that

00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.500
really quite polarized in ways that that
 

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:02.300
really quite polarized in ways that that
other environmental issues had largely

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:02.310
other environmental issues had largely
 

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.970
other environmental issues had largely
not been right it was this was really

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:04.980
not been right it was this was really
 

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:07.250
not been right it was this was really
sort of a political battlefield and I

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.260
sort of a political battlefield and I
 

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:10.220
sort of a political battlefield and I
think for those of us in a scientific

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:10.230
think for those of us in a scientific
 

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:11.690
think for those of us in a scientific
community who participated in that

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:11.700
community who participated in that
 

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:17.690
community who participated in that
assessment we found ourselves just you

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:17.700
assessment we found ourselves just you
 

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:19.730
assessment we found ourselves just you
know talk about deer in the headlights I

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:19.740
know talk about deer in the headlights I
 

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.110
know talk about deer in the headlights I
mean I think we found ourselves just

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:21.120
mean I think we found ourselves just
 

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.150
mean I think we found ourselves just
sort of in some sense sort of baffled

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160
sort of in some sense sort of baffled
 

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.250
sort of in some sense sort of baffled
when you know why were these yr were

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:25.260
when you know why were these yr were
 

00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:26.750
when you know why were these yr were
these people saying such horrible things

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760
these people saying such horrible things
 

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.940
these people saying such horrible things
about us and why was I getting emails

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:28.950
about us and why was I getting emails
 

00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:32.050
about us and why was I getting emails
that I couldn't show my mother and um

00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:32.060
that I couldn't show my mother and um
 

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:36.110
that I couldn't show my mother and um
and and partly I think that's the stakes

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:36.120
and and partly I think that's the stakes
 

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.270
and and partly I think that's the stakes
are the states were really high the

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280
are the states were really high the
 

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:41.360
are the states were really high the
stakes are high partly because there was

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:41.370
stakes are high partly because there was
 

00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:46.820
stakes are high partly because there was
also this ongoing a sort of virulent

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:46.830
also this ongoing a sort of virulent
 

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:48.650
also this ongoing a sort of virulent
policy debate about what to do about the

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:48.660
policy debate about what to do about the
 

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:51.050
policy debate about what to do about the
Kyoto Protocol this was also exactly the

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:51.060
Kyoto Protocol this was also exactly the
 

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:54.020
Kyoto Protocol this was also exactly the
same time as the US was was in the

00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:54.030
same time as the US was was in the
 

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:58.460
same time as the US was was in the
middle of negotiating in Kyoto and you

00:53:58.460 --> 00:53:58.470
middle of negotiating in Kyoto and you
 

00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:00.730
middle of negotiating in Kyoto and you
know so there was a sort of one theory

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:00.740
know so there was a sort of one theory
 

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:05.270
know so there was a sort of one theory
that the whole assessment process was in

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280
that the whole assessment process was in
 

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.540
that the whole assessment process was in
a sense sort of cooked up to provide the

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:08.550
a sense sort of cooked up to provide the
 

00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:11.720
a sense sort of cooked up to provide the
fear factor to get the u.s. to agree to

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:11.730
fear factor to get the u.s. to agree to
 

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:14.560
fear factor to get the u.s. to agree to
Kyoto

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:14.570
 

00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:17.350
if that was the case nobody ever told us

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:17.360
if that was the case nobody ever told us
 

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:21.490
if that was the case nobody ever told us
um but but you know there were people

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:21.500
um but but you know there were people
 

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:26.040
um but but you know there were people
who really strongly believe that ah and

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:26.050
who really strongly believe that ah and
 

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:29.440

you know and i think it was i think when

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:29.450
you know and i think it was i think when
 

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:31.060

your face for that kind of polarization

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:31.070
your face for that kind of polarization
 

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:34.330
your face for that kind of polarization
it's really hard to convince people that

00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:34.340
it's really hard to convince people that

decades

00:58:26.089 --> 00:58:26.099
 

00:58:26.099 --> 00:58:28.849
hello so you talked a little bit about

hello so you talked a little bit about
 

00:58:28.859 --> 00:58:31.880
hello so you talked a little bit about
adaptation and the possible ways that

00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:31.890
adaptation and the possible ways that
 

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:33.200

cities around the world are doing this

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:33.210
cities around the world are doing this
 

00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:37.130
cities around the world are doing this
already but how would cities like New

00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:37.140
already but how would cities like New
 

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:40.789
already but how would cities like New
York or along the east coast adapt to

00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799
York or along the east coast adapt to
 

00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:44.680

00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:52.779
change or loss of biodiversity and areas
such as Amazon and where people's are

extremely dependent on their ecosystem
 

00:58:56.359 --> 00:59:02.059
extremely dependent on their ecosystem
so actually New York has one of the best

00:59:02.059 --> 00:59:02.069
so actually New York has one of the best
 

00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:04.400
so actually New York has one of the best

especially here I mean in the u.s. is
 

01:00:03.989 --> 01:00:07.579
especially here I mean in the u.s. is
that especially in the East is we have

01:00:07.579 --> 01:00:07.589
that especially in the East is we have

so when you've got the opportunity what

01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319
so when you've got the opportunity what
 

01:00:16.319 --> 01:00:18.109
so when you've got the opportunity what
do you do what's the right thing to do

01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119
do you do what's the right thing to do
 

01:00:18.119 --> 01:00:21.469
do you do what's the right thing to do
and I think that does provide some

01:00:21.469 --> 01:00:21.479
and I think that does provide some
 

01:00:21.479 --> 01:00:23.569
and I think that does provide some
opportunities for the cities to do some

01:00:23.569 --> 01:00:23.579

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:50.610
just did not make the splash that they
 

01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:52.760
just did not make the splash that they
were hoping for well I think that I

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:52.770
were hoping for well I think that I
 

01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:54.080
were hoping for well I think that I
think the answer the first one is that

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:54.090
think the answer the first one is that
 

01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:55.340
think the answer the first one is that
we're in the middle of the biggest

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:55.350
we're in the middle of the biggest
 

01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:57.880
we're in the middle of the biggest

know it's not a meat-eor this time it's

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:02.490
know it's not a meat-eor this time it's
 

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:05.890
know it's not a meat-eor this time it's
not it's not lava traps you know it's us

01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:05.900
not it's not lava traps you know it's us
 

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:08.450
not it's not lava traps you know it's us
we're doing it all right background

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:08.460
we're doing it all right background
 

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.580
we're doing it all right background

great mystery why and and so and I said

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:25.260
great mystery why and and so and I said
 

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:28.280
great mystery why and and so and I said
there's been a long-standing concern in

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:28.290
there's been a long-standing concern in
 

01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:30.380
there's been a long-standing concern in
the scientific communities even outside

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:30.390
the scientific communities even outside
 

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:33.320
the scientific communities even outside
of the conservation communities that

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:33.330
of the conservation communities that
 

01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:38.090
of the conservation communities that
this is not a sustainable pattern and

01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:38.100
this is not a sustainable pattern and
 

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:43.610
this is not a sustainable pattern and
that that there should be you know that

01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:43.620
that that there should be you know that
 

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:46.730
that that there should be you know that
people need to understand sort of a need

01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:46.740
people need to understand sort of a need
 

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.440
people need to understand sort of a need
for understanding this and also a need

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:48.450
for understanding this and also a need
 

01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:50.660
for understanding this and also a need
for really understanding what's

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:50.670
for really understanding what's
 

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:54.740

impossible responses to it are so that

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:54.750
impossible responses to it are so that
 

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:57.110
impossible responses to it are so that
you know in a sense that's that's sort

01:01:57.110 --> 01:01:57.120
you know in a sense that's that's sort
 

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.430
you know in a sense that's that's sort
of this is sort of the simplest possible

01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440
of this is sort of the simplest possible
 

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.520
of this is sort of the simplest possible
motivation that that there was not a

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:01.530
motivation that that there was not a
 

01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:04.340
motivation that that there was not a
broad appreciation of the magnitude of

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:04.350
broad appreciation of the magnitude of
 

01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:07.220
broad appreciation of the magnitude of
the changes involved and not a broad

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:07.230
the changes involved and not a broad
 

01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:09.020
the changes involved and not a broad
appreciation of the sorts of things that

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:09.030
appreciation of the sorts of things that
 

01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:12.200
appreciation of the sorts of things that
might might be done answer what was the

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:12.210
might might be done answer what was the
 

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:15.530
might might be done answer what was the
scientific basis and so on I think that

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:15.540
scientific basis and so on I think that
 

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:16.730
scientific basis and so on I think that
a lot of lessons were actually we're

01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:16.740
a lot of lessons were actually we're
 

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.280
a lot of lessons were actually we're
learned by the participants and the

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:19.290
learned by the participants and the
 

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:22.100
learned by the participants and the
leadership of that of that assessment

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:22.110
leadership of that of that assessment
 

01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:24.620
leadership of that of that assessment
and in particular about the importance

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:24.630
and in particular about the importance
 

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:28.550
and in particular about the importance
of engaging sort of more coherent policy

01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:28.560
of engaging sort of more coherent policy
 

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:31.240
of engaging sort of more coherent policy
audiences as the assessments are

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:31.250
audiences as the assessments are
 

01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:34.580
audiences as the assessments are
undertaken I think the big challenge in

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:34.590
undertaken I think the big challenge in
 

01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:36.230
undertaken I think the big challenge in
the global biodiversity assessment was

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240
the global biodiversity assessment was
 

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:36.560
the global biodiversity assessment was
the

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:36.570
the
 

01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:38.840
the
you know in a very real sense nobody

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:38.850
you know in a very real sense nobody
 

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:42.550
you know in a very real sense nobody
asked for it except us and so when we

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:42.560
asked for it except us and so when we
 

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:46.280
asked for it except us and so when we
when we finished you know we had that we

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:46.290
when we finished you know we had that we
 

01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:49.400
when we finished you know we had that we
had the staff and the secretariat of the

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:49.410
had the staff and the secretariat of the
 

01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:54.110
had the staff and the secretariat of the
major convention who were really excited

01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:54.120
major convention who were really excited
 

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.260
major convention who were really excited
about it but not not necessarily the

01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:57.270
about it but not not necessarily the
 

01:02:57.270 --> 01:03:00.530
about it but not not necessarily the
participating countries and so i think

01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:00.540
participating countries and so i think
 

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:03.770
participating countries and so i think
there's a lesson there there's a lesson

01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780
there's a lesson there there's a lesson
 

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:04.990
there's a lesson there there's a lesson
there about global governance

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:05.000
there about global governance
 

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.130
there about global governance
environmental governance is a lesson

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.140
environmental governance is a lesson
 

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:10.760
environmental governance is a lesson
there about the both the opportunities

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:10.770
there about the both the opportunities
 

01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:15.560
there about the both the opportunities
and the limits of engaging the actual

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:15.570
and the limits of engaging the actual
 

01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:16.910
and the limits of engaging the actual
decision making communities or

01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:16.920

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:21.230
decision making communities or
institutions beforehand we'll see if

institutions beforehand we'll see if
 

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:24.170
institutions beforehand we'll see if
we've learned our lesson actually have

01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:24.180
we've learned our lesson actually have
 

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.240
we've learned our lesson actually have
another question about a both of those

another question about a both of those

to be a sort of real hodgepodge I think

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:08.490
to be a sort of real hodgepodge I think
 

01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:09.680
to be a sort of real hodgepodge I think
there's some of that I don't think

there's some of that I don't think

there's some of that I don't think
that's I don't think that's a sufficient

that's I don't think that's a sufficient
 

01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:13.970
that's I don't think that's a sufficient
explanation though you know because the

01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:13.980
explanation though you know because the
 

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:18.320
explanation though you know because the
certainly the trends for reductions are

certainly the trends for reductions are

in fact global trends I mean they're

01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:26.580
in fact global trends I mean they're
 

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.660
in fact global trends I mean they're
they're globally important phenomena

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:28.670
they're globally important phenomena
 

01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:31.960
they're globally important phenomena
there's a handful of major causes I

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:31.970
there's a handful of major causes I
 

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:35.120
there's a handful of major causes I
think that I do think that the

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:35.130
think that I do think that the
 

01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:37.760
think that I do think that the
scientific communities the structure of

scientific communities the structure of
 

01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:39.950
scientific communities the structure of
the scientific communities who are sort

01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960
the scientific communities who are sort

it very very different and so those of

01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:45.180
it very very different and so those of
 

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.240
it very very different and so those of
us who are trained as ecologists

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:47.250
us who are trained as ecologists
 

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.830
us who are trained as ecologists
weren't necessarily originally trained

to think of these as has sort of global
you know what sorts of global trends are

01:04:53.810 --> 01:04:53.820
you know what sorts of global trends are
 

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.580
you know what sorts of global trends are
out there and how would you analyze them

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:55.590
out there and how would you analyze them
 

01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:57.050
out there and how would you analyze them
and what do you think about you know

01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:57.060
and what do you think about you know
 

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.220

what do you think about them it's just

01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:58.230
what do you think about them it's just
 

01:04:58.230 --> 01:05:01.220
what do you think about them it's just
sort of not outside of the of the

sort of not outside of the of the
 

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:04.330

I've got a question about how you
 

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:20.990
I've got a question about how you
characterize the policy community so is

01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000
characterize the policy community so is
 

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.400
characterize the policy community so is
there ever talk about trying to really

hard to overestimate and there we really

the really fascinating features about
 

01:08:30.570 --> 01:08:32.590
the really fascinating features about
the energy sector of course is that it

01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:32.600
the energy sector of course is that it

01:09:20.650 --> 01:09:22.649
we're sort of impacts on energy is
starting out to be really important and

01:09:22.649 --> 01:09:22.659
starting out to be really important and
 

01:09:22.659 --> 01:09:31.360
starting out to be really important and
quite interesting feature of the report

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:31.370
 

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:33.160
you began your discussion with the issue

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:33.170
you began your discussion with the issue
 

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:35.800
you began your discussion with the issue
of uncertainty and when I've listened to

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:35.810
of uncertainty and when I've listened to
 

01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:37.930
of uncertainty and when I've listened to
scholars who are from different

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:37.940
scholars who are from different
 

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:40.110
scholars who are from different
disciplines talking about climate change

01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:40.120
disciplines talking about climate change
 

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.100
disciplines talking about climate change
uncertainty is something they accept

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:42.110
uncertainty is something they accept
 

01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:43.540
uncertainty is something they accept
that sort of part of the scholarly

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:43.550
that sort of part of the scholarly
 

01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:44.860
that sort of part of the scholarly
discourse but unfortunately when you

01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:44.870
discourse but unfortunately when you
 

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:47.230
discourse but unfortunately when you
communicate that to the public and to

01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:47.240
communicate that to the public and to
 

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.720
communicate that to the public and to
elect officials they jump on it that's

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:49.730
elect officials they jump on it that's
 

01:09:49.730 --> 01:09:52.480
elect officials they jump on it that's
like the barn door open let's yeah drive

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:52.490
like the barn door open let's yeah drive
 

01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:56.050
like the barn door open let's yeah drive
through um so how do you bridge that gap

01:09:56.050 --> 01:09:56.060
through um so how do you bridge that gap
 

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:57.910
through um so how do you bridge that gap
because it's perfectly reasonable to

01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920
because it's perfectly reasonable to
 

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.710
because it's perfectly reasonable to
talk about uncertainty but then on the

01:09:59.710 --> 01:09:59.720
talk about uncertainty but then on the
 

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.330
talk about uncertainty but then on the
other hand if you're dealing with people

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:01.340
other hand if you're dealing with people
 

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:03.460
other hand if you're dealing with people
who have limited resources and doing

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:03.470
who have limited resources and doing
 

01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:07.270
who have limited resources and doing
analyses of policy choices ABCD where to

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280
analyses of policy choices ABCD where to
 

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.070
analyses of policy choices ABCD where to
put money well they can sit there and

01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.080
put money well they can sit there and
 

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.560
put money well they can sit there and
hammer the uncertainty issue and and and

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:11.570
hammer the uncertainty issue and and and
 

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:12.970
hammer the uncertainty issue and and and
I'm just curious because as a

01:10:12.970 --> 01:10:12.980
I'm just curious because as a
 

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:15.400
I'm just curious because as a
communication question general it

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:15.410
communication question general it
 

01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:18.070
communication question general it
doesn't resonate with people if they can

01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080
doesn't resonate with people if they can
 

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.050
doesn't resonate with people if they can
then take uncertainty and then discredit

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:20.060
then take uncertainty and then discredit
 

01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:22.840
then take uncertainty and then discredit
the analysis that's very deep and now

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:22.850
the analysis that's very deep and now
 

01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:24.160
the analysis that's very deep and now
this case makes it sound like we don't

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:24.170
this case makes it sound like we don't
 

01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:26.500
this case makes it sound like we don't
know anything and so why should we make

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:26.510
know anything and so why should we make
 

01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:27.820
know anything and so why should we make
big decisions if you don't know anything

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:27.830
big decisions if you don't know anything
 

01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:30.370
big decisions if you don't know anything
and I wouldn't make big decisions if I

01:10:30.370 --> 01:10:30.380
and I wouldn't make big decisions if I
 

01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:33.940
and I wouldn't make big decisions if I
didn't know anything either so I it's

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:33.950
didn't know anything either so I it's
 

01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:36.490
didn't know anything either so I it's
it's it's I wish they were really easy

01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:36.500
it's it's I wish they were really easy
 

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:40.830
it's it's I wish they were really easy
answered that question the what a lot of

01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:40.840
answered that question the what a lot of
 

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.090
answered that question the what a lot of
what a lot of us who've been involved in

01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:43.100
what a lot of us who've been involved in
 

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.820
what a lot of us who've been involved in
these processes try to do is to be

01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:45.830
these processes try to do is to be
 

01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:47.590
these processes try to do is to be
honest about where the uncertainty is

01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600
honest about where the uncertainty is
 

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.140
honest about where the uncertainty is
and what kind of uncertainty it is so

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:50.150
and what kind of uncertainty it is so
 

01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:53.950
and what kind of uncertainty it is so
for example I do a lot of sort of public

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:53.960
for example I do a lot of sort of public
 

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.480
for example I do a lot of sort of public
talks on climate change issues and I

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:55.490
talks on climate change issues and I
 

01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:56.910
talks on climate change issues and I
talk about change in the atmosphere

01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:56.920
talk about change in the atmosphere
 

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.540
talk about change in the atmosphere
changing the atmospheric composition

01:10:58.540 --> 01:10:58.550
changing the atmospheric composition
 

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:01.990
changing the atmospheric composition
where does this extra co2 come from you

01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000
where does this extra co2 come from you
 

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.460
where does this extra co2 come from you
know because there's essentially no

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:03.470
know because there's essentially no
 

01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:06.640
know because there's essentially no
uncertainty about that we've known since

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:06.650
uncertainty about that we've known since
 

01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:09.310
uncertainty about that we've known since
about nineteen fifty-five where the

01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:09.320
about nineteen fifty-five where the
 

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.669
about nineteen fifty-five where the
extra co2 comes from you know

01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:12.679
extra co2 comes from you know
 

01:11:12.679 --> 01:11:16.390
extra co2 comes from you know
it's extremely well documented the fact

01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400
it's extremely well documented the fact
 

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.120
it's extremely well documented the fact
of the greenhouse effect is is you know

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:19.130
of the greenhouse effect is is you know
 

01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:22.709
of the greenhouse effect is is you know
sort of this is beyond serious question

01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719
sort of this is beyond serious question
 

01:11:22.719 --> 01:11:26.219
sort of this is beyond serious question
so there are elements of the climate

01:11:26.219 --> 01:11:26.229
so there are elements of the climate
 

01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:30.429
so there are elements of the climate
change issue of for which there is

01:11:30.429 --> 01:11:30.439
change issue of for which there is
 

01:11:30.439 --> 01:11:34.060
change issue of for which there is
really very little uncertainty there are

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:34.070
really very little uncertainty there are
 

01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:35.350
really very little uncertainty there are
other elements in which there is a

01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360
other elements in which there is a
 

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.709
other elements in which there is a
tremendous I'll use a very quality

01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719
tremendous I'll use a very quality
 

01:11:38.719 --> 01:11:41.339
tremendous I'll use a very quality
determine Mendes out of uncertainty and

01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:41.349
determine Mendes out of uncertainty and
 

01:11:41.349 --> 01:11:44.259
determine Mendes out of uncertainty and
the challenge i think is teasing out the

01:11:44.259 --> 01:11:44.269
the challenge i think is teasing out the
 

01:11:44.269 --> 01:11:45.520
the challenge i think is teasing out the
parts that matter in the parts that

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:45.530
parts that matter in the parts that
 

01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:50.229
parts that matter in the parts that
don't you know does it matter for for

01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239
don't you know does it matter for for
 

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.910
don't you know does it matter for for
the policy making or decision making

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920
the policy making or decision making
 

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:55.330
the policy making or decision making
that that no one is going to be able to

01:11:55.330 --> 01:11:55.340
that that no one is going to be able to
 

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:58.799
that that no one is going to be able to
give you a weather forecast for 20 30 50

01:11:58.799 --> 01:11:58.809
give you a weather forecast for 20 30 50
 

01:11:58.809 --> 01:12:03.370
give you a weather forecast for 20 30 50
for eastern Long Island they're just not

01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:03.380
for eastern Long Island they're just not
 

01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:04.989
for eastern Long Island they're just not
you will get people who will tell you

01:12:04.989 --> 01:12:04.999
you will get people who will tell you
 

01:12:04.999 --> 01:12:06.819
you will get people who will tell you
they can do that but they can't and they

01:12:06.819 --> 01:12:06.829
they can do that but they can't and they
 

01:12:06.829 --> 01:12:10.149
they can do that but they can't and they
won't there's just sort of mathematical

01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159
won't there's just sort of mathematical
 

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:13.989
won't there's just sort of mathematical
limits to predictability and and on the

01:12:13.989 --> 01:12:13.999
limits to predictability and and on the
 

01:12:13.999 --> 01:12:15.429
limits to predictability and and on the
other hand do you really need that to

01:12:15.429 --> 01:12:15.439
other hand do you really need that to
 

01:12:15.439 --> 01:12:17.140
other hand do you really need that to
make those decisions if you had that

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:17.150
make those decisions if you had that
 

01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:18.850
make those decisions if you had that
information would you actually be able

01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:18.860
information would you actually be able
 

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:21.310
information would you actually be able
to use it and in many cases the answer

01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:21.320
to use it and in many cases the answer
 

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:24.640
to use it and in many cases the answer
that is no and so I think part of the

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:24.650
that is no and so I think part of the
 

01:12:24.650 --> 01:12:26.859
that is no and so I think part of the
challenges being sensible about which

01:12:26.859 --> 01:12:26.869
challenges being sensible about which
 

01:12:26.869 --> 01:12:29.169
challenges being sensible about which
parts of this uncertainty the spectrum

01:12:29.169 --> 01:12:29.179
parts of this uncertainty the spectrum
 

01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:32.589
parts of this uncertainty the spectrum
of uncertainties actually is relevant to

01:12:32.589 --> 01:12:32.599
of uncertainties actually is relevant to
 

01:12:32.599 --> 01:12:37.779
of uncertainties actually is relevant to
the decision making at hand because

01:12:37.779 --> 01:12:37.789
the decision making at hand because
 

01:12:37.789 --> 01:12:39.429
the decision making at hand because
otherwise I mean you're right it can be

01:12:39.429 --> 01:12:39.439
otherwise I mean you're right it can be
 

01:12:39.439 --> 01:12:42.370
otherwise I mean you're right it can be
used as a crutch well these guys are

01:12:42.370 --> 01:12:42.380
used as a crutch well these guys are
 

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:43.929
used as a crutch well these guys are
they aren't sure so we're not going to

01:12:43.929 --> 01:12:43.939
they aren't sure so we're not going to
 

01:12:43.939 --> 01:12:49.649
they aren't sure so we're not going to
decide Tony I have a question and you

01:12:49.649 --> 01:12:49.659
decide Tony I have a question and you
 

01:12:49.659 --> 01:12:53.919
decide Tony I have a question and you
clearly showed us how climate time

01:12:53.919 --> 01:12:53.929
clearly showed us how climate time
 

01:12:53.929 --> 01:12:57.520
clearly showed us how climate time
scales and especially ecosystem time

01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:57.530
scales and especially ecosystem time
 

01:12:57.530 --> 01:13:00.189
scales and especially ecosystem time
scales are really quite different than

01:13:00.189 --> 01:13:00.199
scales are really quite different than
 

01:13:00.199 --> 01:13:03.939
scales are really quite different than
weather event timescales political time

01:13:03.939 --> 01:13:03.949
weather event timescales political time
 

01:13:03.949 --> 01:13:07.839
weather event timescales political time
scales and this issue attention cycle

01:13:07.839 --> 01:13:07.849
scales and this issue attention cycle
 

01:13:07.849 --> 01:13:12.250
scales and this issue attention cycle
which can be extremely short so that's

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:12.260
which can be extremely short so that's
 

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:15.160
which can be extremely short so that's
one issue is the incommensurability

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:15.170
one issue is the incommensurability
 

01:13:15.170 --> 01:13:17.859
one issue is the incommensurability
somehow and how to bring that into

01:13:17.859 --> 01:13:17.869
somehow and how to bring that into
 

01:13:17.869 --> 01:13:21.069
somehow and how to bring that into
conversation the other one is the we're

our evening speakers will be talking

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:24.530
our evening speakers will be talking
 

01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:25.000
our evening speakers will be talking
about

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:25.010
about
 

01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:27.609
about
the polarization of climate discourse

01:13:27.609 --> 01:13:27.619
the polarization of climate discourse
 

01:13:27.619 --> 01:13:32.169
the polarization of climate discourse
and and and some might even talk about a

01:13:32.169 --> 01:13:32.179
and and and some might even talk about a
 

01:13:32.179 --> 01:13:34.899
and and and some might even talk about a
bipartisan way forward but we have 190

01:13:34.899 --> 01:13:34.909
bipartisan way forward but we have 190
 

01:13:34.909 --> 01:13:36.939
bipartisan way forward but we have 190
nations or more and we have a really an

01:13:36.939 --> 01:13:36.949
nations or more and we have a really an
 

01:13:36.949 --> 01:13:39.910
nations or more and we have a really an
international issue here we'll also hear

01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920
international issue here we'll also hear
 

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.160
international issue here we'll also hear
about methodological best science

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.170
about methodological best science
 

01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:45.160
about methodological best science
multidisciplinary but we also know that

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:45.170
multidisciplinary but we also know that
 

01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:47.709
multidisciplinary but we also know that
we need all of our disciplines to

01:13:47.709 --> 01:13:47.719
we need all of our disciplines to
 

01:13:47.719 --> 01:13:51.160
we need all of our disciplines to
address these issues and ultimately it

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:51.170
address these issues and ultimately it
 

01:13:51.170 --> 01:13:53.020
address these issues and ultimately it
be even becomes beyond disciplines into

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:53.030
be even becomes beyond disciplines into
 

01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:56.490
be even becomes beyond disciplines into
a human behavior and existence problem

01:13:56.490 --> 01:13:56.500
a human behavior and existence problem
 

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:59.529
a human behavior and existence problem
so all this is kind of a long it's kind

01:13:59.529 --> 01:13:59.539
so all this is kind of a long it's kind
 

01:13:59.539 --> 01:14:01.029
so all this is kind of a long it's kind
of a long-winded way of setting you up

01:14:01.029 --> 01:14:01.039
of a long-winded way of setting you up
 

01:14:01.039 --> 01:14:03.189
of a long-winded way of setting you up
to discuss your vision of the party

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199
to discuss your vision of the party
 

01:14:03.199 --> 01:14:07.299
to discuss your vision of the party
center not only the longer future but

01:14:07.299 --> 01:14:07.309
center not only the longer future but
 

01:14:07.309 --> 01:14:09.370
center not only the longer future but
the timescales of the longer feature and

01:14:09.370 --> 01:14:09.380
the timescales of the longer feature and
 

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:12.160
the timescales of the longer feature and
the way forward which was some of your

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:12.170
the way forward which was some of your
 

01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:14.740
the way forward which was some of your
ending slides about the way forward how

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:14.750
ending slides about the way forward how
 

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.810
ending slides about the way forward how
do you you know and what is the vision

01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:16.820
do you you know and what is the vision
 

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:19.600
do you you know and what is the vision
of going from these assessments which

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:19.610
of going from these assessments which
 

01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:23.589
of going from these assessments which
are often domestic whether they're often

01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:23.599
are often domestic whether they're often
 

01:14:23.599 --> 01:14:27.060
are often domestic whether they're often
best science multidisciplinary and so

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:27.070
best science multidisciplinary and so
 

01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:29.890
best science multidisciplinary and so
you know it's a softball question but

01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:29.900
you know it's a softball question but
 

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:32.109
you know it's a softball question but
I'd like to hear the vision of what is

01:14:32.109 --> 01:14:32.119
I'd like to hear the vision of what is
 

01:14:32.119 --> 01:14:39.220
I'd like to hear the vision of what is
the big way forward well I mean let me

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:39.230
the big way forward well I mean let me
 

01:14:39.230 --> 01:14:40.810
the big way forward well I mean let me
narrow that a little bit at least talk

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:40.820
narrow that a little bit at least talk
 

01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:44.020
narrow that a little bit at least talk
about the party center so so the party

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:44.030
about the party center so so the party
 

01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:46.299
about the party center so so the party
center has this has this you know sort

01:14:46.299 --> 01:14:46.309
center has this has this you know sort
 

01:14:46.309 --> 01:14:49.540
center has this has this you know sort
of interesting interesting title of the

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:49.550
of interesting interesting title of the
 

01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:51.100
of interesting interesting title of the
study of the longer-range feature but

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:51.110
study of the longer-range feature but
 

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:52.959
study of the longer-range feature but
but i think you know sort of underneath

01:14:52.959 --> 01:14:52.969
but i think you know sort of underneath
 

01:14:52.969 --> 01:14:58.240
but i think you know sort of underneath
that is the concern with changes that we

01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:58.250
that is the concern with changes that we
 

01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:01.720
that is the concern with changes that we
see in societies both in physical

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:01.730
see in societies both in physical
 

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:03.700
see in societies both in physical
environment and the cultural environment

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:03.710
environment and the cultural environment
 

01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:05.680
environment and the cultural environment
and the social and economic environments

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:05.690
and the social and economic environments
 

01:15:05.690 --> 01:15:07.839
and the social and economic environments
that occur over these certain time

01:15:07.839 --> 01:15:07.849
that occur over these certain time
 

01:15:07.849 --> 01:15:10.810
that occur over these certain time
scales of several decades you know sort

01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:10.820
scales of several decades you know sort
 

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:14.680
scales of several decades you know sort
of out to a century and and part of the

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:14.690
of out to a century and and part of the
 

01:15:14.690 --> 01:15:16.930
of out to a century and and part of the
reason that that time scale is is so

01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:16.940
reason that that time scale is is so
 

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:19.720
reason that that time scale is is so
interesting and so difficult is that a

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:19.730
interesting and so difficult is that a
 

01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:21.850
interesting and so difficult is that a
lot of the institutions that we have are

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:21.860
lot of the institutions that we have are
 

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.339
lot of the institutions that we have are
really well constructed to deal with

01:15:24.339 --> 01:15:24.349
really well constructed to deal with
 

01:15:24.349 --> 01:15:27.640
really well constructed to deal with
problems over those scales so if you

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:27.650
problems over those scales so if you
 

01:15:27.650 --> 01:15:30.069
problems over those scales so if you
think about about issues that are

01:15:30.069 --> 01:15:30.079
think about about issues that are
 

01:15:30.079 --> 01:15:32.339
think about about issues that are
totally outside of the realm of science

01:15:32.339 --> 01:15:32.349
totally outside of the realm of science
 

01:15:32.349 --> 01:15:34.100

I don't you know completely outside i
 

01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:37.490
I don't you know completely outside i
like the future of the Social Security

01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:37.500
like the future of the Social Security
 

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:42.140
like the future of the Social Security

problem that's you know in a sense it's
 

01:15:57.870 --> 01:15:59.540
problem that's you know in a sense it's
arithmetic and look how long we've been

01:15:59.540 --> 01:15:59.550
arithmetic and look how long we've been
 

01:15:59.550 --> 01:16:02.210

of a dent on it and so I just I'll just

01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:08.820
of a dent on it and so I just I'll just
 

01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:10.640
of a dent on it and so I just I'll just
use that as sort of emblematic of the

use that as sort of emblematic of the
 

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:15.590
use that as sort of emblematic of the
kinds of changes in the world that are

01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600

them starting to unfold but

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:20.570
them starting to unfold but
 

01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:23.240
them starting to unfold but
understanding their understanding their

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:23.250
understanding their understanding their
 

01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:25.190
understanding their understanding their
consequences and understanding the range

01:16:25.190 --> 01:16:25.200
consequences and understanding the range
 

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.720
consequences and understanding the range
of potential solutions turns out to be

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:26.730
of potential solutions turns out to be
 

01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:31.010
of potential solutions turns out to be
quite difficult the other kinds of

01:16:31.010 --> 01:16:31.020
quite difficult the other kinds of
 

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:34.250
quite difficult the other kinds of

issues that at least I see is being
particularly important for for a center

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:37.590
particularly important for for a center
 

01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:40.760
particularly important for for a center
like the party center are the challenges

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:40.770
like the party center are the challenges
 

01:16:40.770 --> 01:16:44.620
like the party center are the challenges
that in the interrelationships between

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:44.630
that in the interrelationships between
 

01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:48.290
that in the interrelationships between
developing the developing world and the

01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:48.300
developing the developing world and the
 

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.660
developing the developing world and the
industrialized world now we are headed

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:50.670
industrialized world now we are headed
 

01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:52.750
industrialized world now we are headed
for a world with nine billion people

01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:52.760
for a world with nine billion people
 

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:56.390
for a world with nine billion people
maybe 10 we don't know how to feed that

01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400
maybe 10 we don't know how to feed that
 

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:59.420
maybe 10 we don't know how to feed that
world most of those people are not going

01:16:59.420 --> 01:16:59.430
world most of those people are not going
 

01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:03.380
world most of those people are not going
to live here they're going to be in very

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:03.390
to live here they're going to be in very
 

01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:08.360
to live here they're going to be in very
large cities in urban areas mostly in

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:08.370
large cities in urban areas mostly in
 

01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:11.570
large cities in urban areas mostly in
the developing world how do we think

01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:11.580
the developing world how do we think
 

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:14.030
the developing world how do we think
about a world like that you know this is

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040
about a world like that you know this is
 

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:16.770
about a world like that you know this is
a this a very different world then

01:17:16.770 --> 01:17:16.780
a this a very different world then
 

01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:19.950
a this a very different world then
then we have today but in a sense it's

01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:19.960
then we have today but in a sense it's
 

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.350
then we have today but in a sense it's
it's the it's the further elaboration of

01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:22.360
it's the it's the further elaboration of
 

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.910
it's the it's the further elaboration of
trends that we can already start to see

01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920
trends that we can already start to see
 

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:25.859
trends that we can already start to see
unfolding and yet you know we have

01:17:25.859 --> 01:17:25.869
unfolding and yet you know we have
 

01:17:25.869 --> 01:17:27.479
unfolding and yet you know we have
choices ahead of us and so I think one

01:17:27.479 --> 01:17:27.489
choices ahead of us and so I think one
 

01:17:27.489 --> 01:17:30.779
choices ahead of us and so I think one
of the one of the really important

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:30.789
of the one of the really important
 

01:17:30.789 --> 01:17:33.330
of the one of the really important
things that a place like party can do is

01:17:33.330 --> 01:17:33.340
things that a place like party can do is
 

01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:37.740
things that a place like party can do is
to start to understand the both the

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:37.750
to start to understand the both the
 

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:39.569
to start to understand the both the
single disciplines and in a multi

01:17:39.569 --> 01:17:39.579
single disciplines and in a multi
 

01:17:39.579 --> 01:17:43.799
single disciplines and in a multi
multidisciplinary way what do those

01:17:43.799 --> 01:17:43.809
multidisciplinary way what do those
 

01:17:43.809 --> 01:17:45.450
multidisciplinary way what do those
choices look like how well do we

01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:45.460
choices look like how well do we
 

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.459
choices look like how well do we
understand them what are the forces at

01:17:47.459 --> 01:17:47.469
understand them what are the forces at
 

01:17:47.469 --> 01:17:50.609
understand them what are the forces at
work do we understand what interventions

01:17:50.609 --> 01:17:50.619
work do we understand what interventions
 

01:17:50.619 --> 01:17:55.319
