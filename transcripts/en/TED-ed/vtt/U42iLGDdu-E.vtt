00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:49.208
Let's talk about the facts of life.

00:00:49.208 --> 00:00:52.166
You remember that conversation you had when you were a kid

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.380
about sex

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.742
or drugs

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:58.336
with your parents or some trusted adult?

00:00:58.336 --> 00:01:00.044
Probably not

00:01:00.044 --> 00:01:01.402
because it's a myth.

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:03.228
You don't talk to kids about that stuff.

00:01:03.228 --> 00:01:05.477
It's just so embarrassing.

00:01:09.356 --> 00:01:11.312
And, hey, maybe that's OK.

00:01:11.312 --> 00:01:13.289
We've been outsourcing the facts of life for decades.

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.316
We spend billions of dollars on it.

00:01:15.316 --> 00:01:18.391
So, why talk to kids when you can just turn on the TV?

00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:22.206
I learned about drugs from an egg and a frying pan:

00:01:22.206 --> 00:01:23.551
"This is drugs,

00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:25.033
and this is your brain on drugs.

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:26.179
Pssssssss.

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:27.617
Any questions?"

00:01:27.617 --> 00:01:29.700
Yeah, actually, I did.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.750
But it's not about questions.

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.797
It's about data.

00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:40.644
In the 1980's when I was growing up,

00:01:40.644 --> 00:01:43.095
those data were terrifying parents:

00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:46.724
1% of high school seniors had try heroin,

00:01:46.724 --> 00:01:47.892
12% hallucinogens,

00:01:47.892 --> 00:01:49.113
12% tranquilizers,

00:01:49.113 --> 00:01:50.831
17% cocaine,

00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:52.547
26% stimulants,

00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:55.755
and over 50% of us had tried marijuana.

00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:57.524
It was an epidemic!

00:01:57.524 --> 00:01:59.203
At least, that's what they told us.

00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:02.594
And marijuana was the gateway drug, leading to all the harder stuff.

00:02:02.594 --> 00:02:06.697
Of course, 92% of us were drinking alcohol,

00:02:06.697 --> 00:02:10.087
and that was killing more of us than all drugs combined.

00:02:10.087 --> 00:02:12.898
But, nevermind, it's legal.

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:15.157
So we declared war on drugs!

00:02:15.157 --> 00:02:17.437
Nancy Reagan was our general.

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:20.719
All drugs will kill you, so just say, "No!"

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.327
Just say, "No!" to pot.

00:02:22.327 --> 00:02:24.015
Just say, "No!" to cocaine.

00:02:24.015 --> 00:02:26.938
Just say, "No!" to everything.

00:02:28.092 --> 00:02:29.227
So simple!

00:02:29.227 --> 00:02:30.811
If you want to save kids,

00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:32.671
you have to scare the hell out of them!

00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:35.901
And we spent ridiculous amounts of money doing that.

00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:39.996
Soon that war on drugs spread to become a war on sex.

00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:43.682
We were pushing abstinence on kids to fight AIDS.

00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:46.688
And when all the data finally came home,

00:02:46.688 --> 00:02:47.991
guess what:

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:51.291
completely ineffective.

00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:55.791
We love big solutions to big problems, don't we?

00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:58.045
What if the facts of life don't work that way?

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:03.862
What if the experience of having that conversation can't be mass-produced?

00:03:03.862 --> 00:03:05.634
What if it can't be scaled up?

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.362
Well, that would be very frustrating for everyone in this industry, wouldn't it?

00:03:09.362 --> 00:03:11.767
And, many of them are really trying to help.

00:03:11.767 --> 00:03:13.083
Who, then?

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:14.564
Us.

00:03:15.103 --> 00:03:16.755
We have to talk to kids.

00:03:16.755 --> 00:03:18.887
Openly and honestly.

00:03:18.887 --> 00:03:20.892
But are we ready to be honest?

00:03:21.693 --> 00:03:23.309
I don't think so.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.712
We mythologize childhood.

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:29.879
Mine was in Stone Mountain, Georgia,

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.501
a completely typical 1980's American suburb.

00:03:33.501 --> 00:03:37.963
For the parents, a wholesome paradise of bridge parties and tennis games.

00:03:37.963 --> 00:03:42.783
For us kids, we were all working on a secret research project,

00:03:42.783 --> 00:03:45.669
and our laboratory was in the woods after school,

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.138
under the covers during sleep-overs,

00:03:48.138 --> 00:03:49.827
really, any opportunity we could take

00:03:49.827 --> 00:03:53.100
to peel off our clothes and investigate.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.715
What were these things,

00:03:54.715 --> 00:03:55.446
bodies?

00:03:55.446 --> 00:03:56.530
What do they do?

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.208
We had to figure them out

00:03:58.208 --> 00:03:59.740
and that's childhood.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.544
It's not just fun and games,

00:04:01.544 --> 00:04:04.568
it's actually a Manhattan project of nakedness.

00:04:04.923 --> 00:04:07.867
And then you walk into your first class in middle school,

00:04:07.867 --> 00:04:09.564
and the bomb goes off.

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.276
You are not just a body any more.

00:04:14.535 --> 00:04:16.981
Oh no, now you are grotesque.

00:04:17.936 --> 00:04:21.046
That's when the suffering really starts.

00:04:21.677 --> 00:04:24.030
So, yeah, talk to kids.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.812
But if you are not honest about your own experiences first,

00:04:26.812 --> 00:04:30.425
everything you say smells like bullshit.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.830
Don't worry, you can practice

00:04:34.584 --> 00:04:37.447
and you should start by talking to the one kid you definitely know:

00:04:37.447 --> 00:04:38.927
you.

00:04:39.806 --> 00:04:41.922
What kind of kid were you?

00:04:41.922 --> 00:04:43.977
What troubled you?

00:04:45.008 --> 00:04:47.792
For me, it was age 13.

00:04:47.793 --> 00:04:50.230
That was the worst year.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.223
I was obsessively curious about sex

00:04:53.223 --> 00:04:55.763
and also deeply ashamed by it.

00:04:55.763 --> 00:04:58.821
It wasn't my only problem, of course, not by a long shot,

00:04:58.821 --> 00:05:02.152
but it was the beginning of a downward spiral.

00:05:02.152 --> 00:05:03.646
And my bad luck was to hit bottom

00:05:03.646 --> 00:05:07.518
while watching "The Wall" by Pink Floyd,

00:05:07.518 --> 00:05:11.425
which is a bad idea for a miserable 13-year old high on weed.

00:05:11.425 --> 00:05:14.001
So, that night, for whatever reason,

00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:18.260
it seemed like good idea to shave off my eyebrows,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.443
and then try to kill myself by swallowing all the pills in the bathroom,

00:05:22.443 --> 00:05:24.556
which was not at all fatal,

00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:27.479
but everyone noticed the eyebrows.

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.301
And that made middle school extra fun.

00:05:30.301 --> 00:05:32.724
So, what was your low point?

00:05:32.724 --> 00:05:36.828
And if you could build a time machine to travel back and talk to that kid,

00:05:36.828 --> 00:05:39.459
what would you say to yourself?

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:40.763
For me, it was easy.

00:05:40.763 --> 00:05:43.222
All I really needed was someone to reassure me

00:05:43.222 --> 00:05:46.479
that somehow I was a normal part of the universe.

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.942
But I didn't feel like I could talk to anyone.

00:05:48.942 --> 00:05:51.596
And yet weirdly, I fully expected a time traveler

00:05:51.596 --> 00:05:52.793
to materialize at any time

00:05:52.793 --> 00:05:54.739
because I was a geek.

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:57.147
I didn't know if it would be my unborn son

00:05:57.147 --> 00:05:59.270
or a T-101 cyborg.

00:05:59.747 --> 00:06:02.292
But either one would be awesome!

00:06:17.816 --> 00:06:22.599
Hey, it's me, yourself from the future, in the year 2012.

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:26.589
I have crucial information for you, but not about the future, about the past,

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:29.911
a billion years in the past, when this planet was covered with nothing but cells

00:06:29.911 --> 00:06:32.281
and all they did was fight, eat, and divide;

00:06:32.281 --> 00:06:34.402
fight, eat, and divide.

00:06:34.402 --> 00:06:35.805
Except for one.

00:06:37.037 --> 00:06:39.104
And that's your ancestor.

00:06:39.104 --> 00:06:40.825
This cell enslaved other ones,

00:06:40.825 --> 00:06:43.589
but master and slave became one.

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:46.427
And then those cells invented sex,

00:06:46.427 --> 00:06:47.888
and then they invented the first bodies

00:06:47.888 --> 00:06:49.722
with each cell doing a different job,

00:06:49.722 --> 00:06:50.249
some smelling,

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:51.520
some moving,

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.629
some eating.

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:57.620
And the job of sex went to a special cell called the gamete.

00:06:58.744 --> 00:07:02.477
And those bodies became giant.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.927
The distance to the next body was vast so they had to swim.

00:07:10.927 --> 00:07:14.721
Most would be lost and die so they were mass-produced.

00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:19.426
Soon the oceans were a non-stop riot of sex and death

00:07:19.426 --> 00:07:24.397
until 500 million years ago, when the first beast crawled onto land.

00:07:33.443 --> 00:07:35.441
Land is hard

00:07:35.441 --> 00:07:37.587
because bodies are heavy.

00:07:37.587 --> 00:07:39.583
And the sun kills gametes.

00:07:39.583 --> 00:07:41.327
To keep them safe,

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.722
so deep inside of a body,

00:07:48.722 --> 00:07:51.388
the mother builds a tiny ocean.

00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:57.942
Outside are events of unimaginable violence.

00:07:57.942 --> 00:08:00.205
Whole new forms of life are being created

00:08:00.205 --> 00:08:02.421
only to be wiped away.

00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:05.570
Millions of years are flashing by.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.698
But in here, it's always the same.

00:08:11.175 --> 00:08:12.225
Peace.

00:08:13.549 --> 00:08:14.856
Just peace.

00:08:18.257 --> 00:08:20.746
Maybe we will never know why,

00:08:20.746 --> 00:08:24.501
but of all the possible bodies that have appeared on this planet,

00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:26.399
it was this one,

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:28.099
bilaterally symmetric,

00:08:28.099 --> 00:08:29.723
warm-blooded,

00:08:29.723 --> 00:08:30.915
bigger than a mouse,

00:08:30.915 --> 00:08:32.597
smaller than a horse,

00:08:32.597 --> 00:08:35.397
2 legs, 10 toes,

00:08:35.397 --> 00:08:37.066
no tail,

00:08:37.066 --> 00:08:39.006
big brain,

00:08:39.006 --> 00:08:40.334
language,

00:08:40.334 --> 00:08:42.021
technology,

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:42.835
and civilization

00:08:42.835 --> 00:08:45.501
rising and falling for thousands of years.

00:08:49.298 --> 00:08:51.530
And here you are,

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.381
a 13-year old human

00:08:53.381 --> 00:08:56.271
perplexed and embarrassed about sex.

00:08:56.271 --> 00:08:58.683
That's what I came here to tell you:

00:08:58.683 --> 00:09:03.650
we don't know why sex evolved nor why it persists.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.853
Why don't we just clone ourselves like all life did a billion years ago?

00:09:06.853 --> 00:09:08.328
It's so much more efficient.

00:09:08.328 --> 00:09:12.345
We would all have babies, no mates.

00:09:12.345 --> 00:09:17.481
It could be that children who are genetically different from each other are protected from disease.

00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:21.015
And that is still our best guess.

00:09:21.015 --> 00:09:24.840
So be comforted to know that even in the distant future,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.286
in the year 2012,

00:09:27.286 --> 00:09:30.090
we still don't know what sex is for.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.508
It is perplexing.

00:09:32.815 --> 00:09:35.179
You shouldn't be embarrassed by it.

00:09:36.288 --> 00:09:38.645
Sex is a beautiful puzzle.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.388
And without it, you simply would not be here.

00:10:03.265 --> 00:10:05.310
By the way,

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.776
be nice to your little sister.

00:10:07.776 --> 00:10:11.635
She's your best friend. You'll see.
