00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.670
Right now the paradigm is you
have one rover for one mission.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.340
So if that rover were
to fail or break down,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.870
the whole mission is over.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.030
In order to avoid
this, we resort

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.930
to a paradigm where we use
multiple miniaturized assets,

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.870
which you can deploy in
different areas on the planet,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.420
even into high risk areas,
which are especially

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.190
important for scientists.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.809
If you lose a few in
the cause of doing so,

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:28.850
you still have a mission.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.310
Because some of them will for
sure make it into the areas

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.050
where you want to go.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.210
The main motivation
for us scientists

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.910
is to explore the unknown.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.700
That's always been the
mantra for humanity.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.690
To push the envelope, to go
where nobody has gone before.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.720
One of the main questions
which humanity has been asking

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.340
is, are we alone?

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.620
So the quest for the search
for life outside the Earth.
