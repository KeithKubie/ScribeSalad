00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.230
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.070
&gt;&gt; I think we'll get started

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.960
with a few introductions before
we begin the formal webinar.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.990
Again my name is Naomi [inaudible].

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.800 position:61%
I'm an education specialist here in
the library at the exhibition's office.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.970
We really appreciate you joining
today for this session as part

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.380
of the World War I webinar series.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.470 position:64%
As you know, this program's part of a
number of events, of webinars and events,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.760 position:75%
especially connected to the library's exhibition
"Echoes of the Great War: American Experiences

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.480
of World War I" which is on
view here through January 2019.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.860 position:61%
Today's session will focus on immigrant
veterans of the first world war,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.040 position:64%
and the work of the library's Veterans
History Project better known here as VHP.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.050 position:63%
Our presenter today will be Owen Rogers,
a liaison specialist in that office.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.420
The presentation will last
approximately 30 minutes with time

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.800 position:63%
after that for Owen to answer questions.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.510
You may note that you can
talk with the panelists

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.440 position:66%
and your fellow participants via the chat.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.860
There's a little chat icon at
the top of your WebEx window.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.790 position:64%
And use that to drop down to all
attendees if you want to talk to everyone

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.430 position:63%
or if you have just a question for one
of the presenters you can send that way,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.780 position:75%
but we'd love to see everyone's questions there.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.340 position:64%
Please also, if you haven't already, tell
us who you are and where you're watching

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.600 position:56%
from so we have a sense of the
breadth of our participants and also

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.820 position:59%
to -- just to practice using the chat.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.450
It really helps.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.550 position:64%
You can participate there in part because
we have another colleague on the chat.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.600 position:69%
Her name is Megan Harris [assumed spelling].

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.680 position:72%
She's a reference specialist from the Veterans
History Project who will answer questions

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.860 position:75%
and respond to inquiries as the session goes on,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.910
and Owen will take additional
questions at the end.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.920 position:69%
Kathy [inaudible] also one of our panelists.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.250 position:63%
She'd from our ed outreach division, and
she's our technical host for the day.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.860 position:66%
So if you have any concerns, technical
concerns, you can drop her a note as well.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.520
We are recording today's session.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.780 position:70%
The recording will be posted on the library's
website once we've been able to caption it.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.910
You should find it there shortly
several weeks after the program.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:08.760
And, with that, I will turn
the presentation over to Owen.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Naomi.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.840
Can everybody hear me?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.930
All right.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.680
Get us started here.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.550
Well, welcome everybody.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.660
My name's Owen Rogers.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.090 position:61%
I'm a public historian and I have about
five years at the Library of Congress.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.800 position:64%
All of that is at the Veterans History
Project, and even before then I worked --

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.390
I worked for about eight years
collecting, recording, archiving,

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.840 position:59%
and interpreting veterans stories
both at a university level all the way

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.620
up from a volunteer interviewer
which is the lifeblood of VHP.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.400 position:59%
We'll talk about that in a little bit.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.490
On to a graduate intern and
then a graduate assistant.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:18.090 position:73%
So my focus as public historian is on archival
[inaudible] and at the Library of Congress some

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.980 position:69%
of these vulnerable voices include immigrant
veterans who you'll learn a little bit more

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.120 position:70%
about today through the portal of World War
I and the library's commemoration of the war.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.020 position:61%
So you'll see that this is our website,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.700
and it really is the portal to
the Veterans History Project.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.870
It is both a participatory
and also an archival resource.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.120 position:58%
And all of our archived veterans
recordings can be accessed through --

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.570 position:59%
by searching the veterans collections.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.420
And that includes oral histories,
media materials, creative works,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.390 position:66%
and also looking up around the project how
to participate, looking at our blog posts,

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.550 position:69%
and we also [inaudible] out the last archive
on planet Earth to get a Facebook page.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.360 position:70%
You can read more about our collections of
materials and see more of the kinds of things

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.560 position:61%
that we're doing in terms of outreach
and collections and interpretation here

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.490 position:66%
at the library and also through tremendous
coverage in every congressional district

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.380 position:75%
in every state and most of the U.S. territories.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:37.340 position:66%
So really oral histories are the bread and
butter of the Veterans History Project,

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.880 position:58%
and you can see the broad range of
oral histories that we still receive.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.640 position:69%
To be honest, I can usually mark time on my
calendar by the bags of audio cassette tapes

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.650 position:61%
that [inaudible] sends me all the time.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.080
And that really speaks to the
breadth of media that we collect.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.350
You can see one of those audio
cassette tapes over here.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.160
All the way up through [inaudible].

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.810 position:64%
We have some legacy recordings on Betamax
and VHS which we no longer accept.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.570 position:59%
And most of the materials we'll see
coming in today will be optical media.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.310
DVDs, CDRs, with [inaudible]
digital oral history recordings.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.090 position:75%
And those can be done on anything from a digital
video camera all the way through those devices

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:32.540 position:75%
that we carry around in our pockets, our phones,
our smart phones, and a variety of manufacturers

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.850 position:67%
and formats are compliant with [inaudible].

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.590 position:58%
I encourage you to check that out
later or stick around for the Q and A

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.040 position:69%
and we'll talk a little bit about that more.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:47.330 position:67%
So in addition to contemporary oral history
recordings, what we do is we collect plenty

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.520 position:56%
of period veterans materials as
well, and that includes manuscripts.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:06:01.280 position:70%
So correspondence, any kind of either a
recent or an older memoir, diary, recordings,

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:08.970 position:67%
all of these help put us in the perspective
of a veteran while they were experiencing

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.870 position:63%
or in the immediate aftermath of events.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:18.590 position:69%
It offers a nice contextual comparison with
then and more of the now in an oral history.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:26.560 position:75%
So in terms of documentation photographs are one

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.500
of my favorite facets of the
Veterans History Project.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.690
And many of these images you'll
never see in another archive

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.740
because they're entirely personal.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.710
And they communicate a veteran's
firsthand experience.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.310 position:56%
These right here from the collection
Joseph Beimfohr [assumed spelling].

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:51.050 position:73%
He is an Iraq war veteran, and you can see that
this is very much behind the green curtain.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:57.100
This is what a collection will look
like with the polyester housing,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.750 position:70%
the preservation treatment, and the care and
concern that we provide to items to make sure

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:09.860 position:70%
that collections like Joseph Beimfohr will be
around as long as we can possibly share them

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.290 position:66%
and preserve them and make them
accessible to researchers, family members.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:23.100 position:56%
And then we come on to veterans'
creative works which really allow us

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:29.340 position:73%
to perceive veterans' experiences through their
minds' eyes, through their interpretations.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.670
The watercolors.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:37.350 position:64%
We have charcoal drawings, illustrations,
many, many, many illustrated envelopes.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:42.700 position:66%
And if you're familiar with Bill Mauldin's
"Willie and Joe," veterans oral history --

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.740 position:64%
The Veterans Oral History Project has
interpretive works that are very similar,

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.670 position:61%
ranging from World War II in my memory
all the way up through the Vietnam war.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.990
And most likely beyond.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.950
Takes us a little bit of time
to dig through the bottom

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.970 position:66%
of 100,000 collections, but you know what?

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.630
I'm going to take a note now and
I'm going to challenge myself

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:02.910
to find something newer than that.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:10.640
So all of these collections arrive
here at the Library of Congress

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.610
through a grassroots methodology.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:21.710 position:70%
And you can see here folks in Indiana sitting
down and recoding a veteran's oral history.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:26.080 position:63%
Like here they're also recording --
Making it in to an audio file available.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.930
We accept both audio and video
recordings on a smart device.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:38.810 position:61%
And we're really looking in to a portal
of kind of a gap in veterans' history.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:42.430
We don't have a tremendous amount
of Persian Gulf War collections,

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:47.750
and it's judging from [inaudible]
and that nice sort

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:53.370 position:66%
of very much grassroots do it yourself
using [inaudible] methodology instructions

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.100
and media recommendations we've
made sure to get his story here.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.040
So in terms of accessibility,
here's the awesome thing.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:09.730 position:67%
I can talk about all this content all day
long and cite stories, but if it's not easy

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:16.020
to get to, in terms of utilization,
if we can't use it, what do we do?

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:21.630
So we've made sure that,
first of all, every veteran,

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.270 position:72%
their collection is identified as their story.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.370
You know, the story of [inaudible]
the story of Jane Smith.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:34.570 position:67%
And all of those collections get a
collection record that the veteran provides

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.660 position:64%
through a biographical data form, and
that will list their [inaudible] service,

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.370 position:75%
the war they participated in, service location,
the unit or the ship that they were assigned to,

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.340
their highest rank, and also some
information about the archives

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.180 position:59%
or the organization that it came from.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:55.040
You know, whether it's a
[inaudible] patrol squadron

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.230 position:67%
or a girl scout troop or a boy scout troop.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:03.910 position:59%
And all of our more than 100,000
collections can be found through here,

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:08.060 position:63%
and about 44,000 of those are digitized.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:13.840 position:58%
So for the ones that aren't digitized
we make collections accessible

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.840 position:69%
through the American Folklife Center reading
room in terms of breaking down, you know,

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.090
the organization of the project,
we are a special collection

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.450 position:56%
within the American Folklife Center.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:30.300 position:61%
And researchers, you know, as a
national library, I encourage everybody

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.490 position:59%
to get their Library of Congress
reader card, reader registration card.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:45.590 position:73%
And once you [inaudible] through those
materials [inaudible] in about 10 working days.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.560
&gt;&gt; Sounds like we may have lost --

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.940
&gt;&gt; Now we come on to --

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.010
&gt;&gt; Give it a second here
to see if we can reconnect.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:59.410 position:70%
&gt;&gt; In terms of this is how we're more or less
-- And you can definitely tell by this sliver

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:05.380 position:64%
in the corner right here of the World War
I collections that this says everything

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.730 position:73%
about the date that [inaudible] was legislated.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:12.700
So [inaudible] has been around
since the year 2000.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.680
I'm seeing a sound problem note.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.700
Can everybody hear me okay?

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It sounds like you're
back, but you might want

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.530 position:75%
to repeat the introduction to the slide, please.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:24.430
&gt;&gt; Oh, will do.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.140
Okay. Great.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.510
So thanks for the note.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:33.070
So you can tell that the Veterans
History Project was legislated

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:37.500 position:61%
in the year 2000 basically based on the
[inaudible] disposition of the veterans

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.260
that are included in the project.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.040 position:67%
So if you looked at a sliver right here
for World War I, the project was legislated

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:49.040 position:58%
in the year 2000 and that was when
an era in our history when there were

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:55.340 position:66%
about 3,400 living World War I veterans,
and World War II veterans are passing away

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.390
at a rate of more than 1,000 a day.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:06.610 position:73%
So there was a congressional act, congressional
foresight, that looked at -- Nothing?

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.570
Okay. Okay.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:08.830
Back again.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:09.920
All right.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:15.540 position:58%
That looked at the state of World War
II veterans oral histories and said,

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.300
"If we don't create a project
that can capture these memories,

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.960
we're going to lose them forever."

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.970
And while we've lost all
of our World War I voices,

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:32.460 position:58%
we were able to capture nearly 100
World War I veterans' oral histories,

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.670 position:61%
and about 65,000 World War II veterans.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.970
So World War II forms the
largest part of our archives.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.340
Our next biggest collections
are Cold War Korea and Vietnam.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:53.520 position:70%
And we continue to receive World War I
collections through donations of manuscripts,

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.720
photographs, creative works,
like I mentioned before.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.020
So there is still potential for
those voices to be collected

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.540 position:75%
and interpreted here at the Library of Congress.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:09.460 position:67%
And our collection scope, I should add --
All of these relate the stories of veterans

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:15.120 position:59%
of the U.S. armed forces who served in
World War I through recent conflicts.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:21.340 position:67%
And in any capacity and at any time between
effectively the 20th and 21st centuries.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.580
And are no longer serving.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:29.630 position:63%
So now when it comes to World War I,
World War I veterans and in a discussion

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:35.430 position:73%
of immigration it's just a fascinating
opportunity to explore immigration as a concept

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.970
and as an era of the United States.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:43.300
And also really to look at
it as a somewhat substantial,

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:49.340
about 5% of the entire [inaudible]
World War I archives is --

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.390 position:61%
communicates immigrant veteran service.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:59.520 position:56%
So we have about, as I said
before, 400 World War I collections.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:07.560
And roughly of that amount
we found about 20 veterans

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:14.900
who indicated either first or
second generation ancestry.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.400
Either they were immigrants or they
were the children of immigrants.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.140
And that speaks to a larger
[inaudible] conundrum we have

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.150 position:72%
when it comes to interpreting veteran service.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:30.510
You know, just because ancestry
information is entirely optional.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.150
We have ancestry information for
about half of our participants.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:39.270
So effectively this could be the
amount that we've collected --

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:44.790
It could be double what is reported
on the self identified sheet

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.660 position:69%
that veterans [inaudible] for participation.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:53.160 position:56%
But of the amount that we have, this
is roughly the perspective of --

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.630 position:56%
This is the lay of the land in terms
of where our veterans come from.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.040
For World War I, that is.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.220
And what's so fascinating is that
looking through this you can see

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:10.290 position:59%
that VHP preserved the voices of World
War I veterans from both the allies

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:15.770 position:64%
and the central powers which leads you in
to a fascinating interpretation of first

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.490 position:56%
and second generation self identity.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:22.600 position:66%
So now we come to the story of Camp Upton,

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:30.370 position:58%
and Camp Upton was just a fascinating
melting pot for World War I service.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.760
I learned about this through
"Echoes of the Great War."

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:41.030 position:70%
This is a photograph that I wasn't familiar
with, and so F.M. Sefano recorded the arrival

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.780
of the new New Rochelle contingent
at Camp Upton.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:48.240
And by some estimates more
than 30 different languages

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.140 position:69%
and dialects were spoken in this camp alone.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:59.520 position:73%
So by war's end about half a million of
American enlisted troops were recent immigrants

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:07.030 position:69%
from about 50 different countries, and about
100,000 of them didn't speak English at all.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:11.550
So we're going to talk a
little bit more about avenues

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:17.850 position:69%
in which immigrants would find themselves in
the service of the United States military,

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:30.310 position:75%
but this just shows you really the sort of scope
and the diversity of men in Doughboy uniform.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:38.740 position:72%
So when we come to talk about the range of
World War I service, I found three collections

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:45.840 position:70%
that I think would be a fascinating portal in
which we would talk about immigrant identity

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.240 position:69%
within the U.S. armed forces of World War I.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.210
So right there on the left,
that's Harry Freeman,

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.810 position:67%
and in the middle we have Joseph Rosenblum.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:17:00.220 position:69%
And on the right we have Albert [inaudible].

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:10.790 position:70%
And they really do speak to the range of both
naturalized immigrants, recent immigrants,

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:16.980
and second generation descendents
of central powers parents.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:24.830 position:73%
So why don't we start with Harry Freeman and
it's a really ideal opportunity for us to segue

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:28.540 position:58%
to the Selective Service Act of 1917?

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:33.490 position:70%
So in addition to native born and naturalized
citizens, the Selective Service Act

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:42.250 position:73%
of 1917 also included immigrants who intended
to apply for U.S. citizenship at some point or,

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.800
you know, naturalized immigrants.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:50.050 position:72%
And as an extra incentive to military service,
Congress amended naturalization laws in May

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:53.560
of 1918 that fast tracked
the citizenship process

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.730 position:73%
for immigrants who served in the U.S. military.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:00.740
So by war's end about 120,000
Doughboys earned their citizenship

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.330 position:69%
as a direct consequence of military service.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:09.790 position:73%
And truly set a historical precedent that we've
seen to this day of accelerated naturalization

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.110
for veterans who served in
-- for immigrants who served

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.140 position:69%
in the armed forces to become U.S. veterans.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:22.670 position:63%
So yeah. That is the Harry Freeman
story where, yes, he was born in Russia,

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:27.830 position:70%
immigrated to the United States, naturalized,
and, as a consequence of his naturalization,

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:31.470
was eligible for the Selective
Service Act draft.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:36.060
And what's so fascinating is that
-- And I've yet to look this up.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.860 position:61%
This is another note for me to look up.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:44.690
In our collections database it
-- So he was sent to Camp Meade

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.510 position:56%
which is now Fort Meade in Maryland.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:50.750 position:73%
And quite a few of our World War I
collections are currently housed in Fort Meade.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.260 position:66%
So I wonder if his story came full circle.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:57.440
That's one for me to look up
and report back to you later.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:05.530 position:73%
So now when we come to the messaging and the
branding for U.S. military service I share this

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:13.270 position:69%
in -- We see different strategies, different
media strategies, through the generations

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:19.390 position:70%
that engage and elicit military recruitments.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:23.960
Sometimes they talk about a recent
conflict veteran or a collection

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:31.920 position:75%
who remembers U.S. army national guard coming
to his high school with a Humvee, armored truck,

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.770
that had a Playstation inside
that you could play while driving.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:46.060 position:66%
And for some reason that was just the most
incredible thing, and then novelty that --

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.680 position:58%
That was used to solicit recruitment.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.980 position:66%
So back then they didn't have Playstation.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.470
What they had was branding posters.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.170
And so I want you for the
U.S. army, this is interesting

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.810 position:67%
because on the right we'll start with this.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.960 position:61%
For some reason we'll go right to left.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:08.700 position:61%
We'll say how this is, you know, a full
English very image intense incentive

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.880
to join the U.S. army.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:20.070 position:69%
And that's compared to a poster on the left,
and the poster on the left has, you know,

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:24.340
a variety of different languages
in which to elicit participation

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:31.950 position:75%
from the contextual term aliens, from
immigrants, who are living in the United States.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:32.420
Either -- Yes.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:38.800
And to really sort of cement
that connection, seen --

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.080
And back through here we
go back to [inaudible] day.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:50.100
Many, many, many sort of
nationalistic incentives and,

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:54.270 position:56%
like we saw in the Camp Upton image,

00:20:54.270 --> 00:21:00.180
opportunities to turn military
service in to a melting pot.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:05.540 position:58%
So coming to Joseph Rosenblum, Joseph
Rosenblum's an interesting story

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:12.490 position:72%
because unlike Harry Freeman who'd lived in
the country long enough to become naturalized,

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:20.030 position:72%
Joseph Rosenblum had been here since 1913, and
he immigrated one year prior to the Great War.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:28.640 position:69%
So he left Romania and arrived in the United
States in 1913, and because he intended

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.890
to naturalize, he was also
eligible for the World War I draft.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:41.810
And what's so fascinating is,
yes, he returned to Europe

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.350 position:61%
and fought on the side of his homeland.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:53.510 position:63%
So, like I said, another example of,
you know, this cross Atlantic tug of war

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:57.720 position:66%
with European immigrants coming to the
United States and then returning to combat

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:03.090 position:70%
and then returning back to the United States.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:07.540
And I should speak a little
bit more about Harry Freeman.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.990 position:58%
Harry Freeman and Joseph Rosenblum --

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:14.390
Harry Freeman, his collection
was actually recently featured

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:17.010
in a World War I educator's book.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:24.700 position:70%
He's got a fascinating diary, and in
addition it's one of our favorites because --

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.840 position:61%
The reason why I use PowerPoint is
because my handwriting is so atrocious,

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.620 position:58%
and I always feel bad for anybody
who had to read my handwritten notes.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.670 position:56%
Harry Freeman is quite the opposite.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:41.100 position:58%
His diary is -- His entries are clean
and beautiful and also evocative

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:46.350 position:69%
because you can feel the pit in your stomach
as you count the pages from, you know,

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:50.780
November 10th to November 11th and
his notes on the end of the war.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:55.710 position:59%
So I absolutely recommend perhaps I
can throw some links around at the end

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.500
and share that material with you.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:01.650 position:61%
What's so fascinating is because, you
know, World War I is an age of writing,

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:06.650 position:66%
it's an age of manuscripts, and so looking
at that image in front of you right now,

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:14.910 position:64%
the Joseph Rosenblum image, so as opposed
to the, you know, counting out time,

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:20.500
dates on the calendar, Joseph
Rosenblum is quite the opposite.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:25.620 position:59%
And in addition, I encourage you to
[inaudible] link around to this later.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.240 position:69%
Because he -- First of all, he writes music.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.160 position:61%
And second of all, he compares his life

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.130
and he compares his experience
to, you know [inaudible] writers.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.450 position:63%
You know, cynical writers like Voltaire.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:43.110
And which, you know, he's
plunged in to the first world war

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.660 position:75%
and it's the only thing that makes sense to him.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:52.990 position:75%
So throughout his diary he draws these fantastic
parallels between his firsthand experience

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:58.350 position:64%
as a soldier and then also his connection
and his interpretation of his life

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:00.250 position:58%
through works of literature or music.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.770 position:59%
So it's just an incredible collection.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:14.360 position:72%
So coming on to the third in our series, which
is somewhat of an outlier compared to Freeman

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:19.480
and Rosenblum, Freeman and
Rosenblum both served in -- Oh.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.570
Both immigrated from nations who
served with the allied forces

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:26.560 position:59%
or who were part of the allied forces.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:37.340 position:67%
And Albert [inaudible] differs because he's
both second generation, his mom was Irish

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:42.950
and his dad was German, and
he was born in Chicago.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:47.540
So he has that immigrant
experience by way of his parents,

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:53.430
but also is a volunteer as
opposed to a conscript.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.290
So doesn't do Selective Service.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:59.140
Volunteers for service at age 28.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:10.770 position:61%
Looking through my notes, he had been a
28 year old surveyor when he enlisted.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:18.740
And during his service he
-- We had this fascinating

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.650 position:58%
out letter collection back and forth.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.820
And, like I said before in
terms of handwriting --

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:29.030 position:72%
And I'm going to be the first one that I throw
under the bus, but there's nothing better

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:34.720
than having a letter collection
and also a transcript next to it.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.610 position:64%
So I've shared some of the typed letters.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:46.080
And you can really see this amazing
complementary back and forth.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.420
So it's interesting.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:58.680 position:56%
Now he stayed on in Europe after
the occupation, after Armistice Day.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:06.420 position:73%
And it's very interesting to sort of talk about
that second generation American perspective

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:17.520 position:70%
and his special note that he sharply observed
the French whom he found incredibly grateful

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:24.530 position:58%
to the allied effort, and coming from
a German father he was not allowed

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.440
to speak or interact with Germans.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:33.180
So -- And he's compelled and he
makes a special note of that.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:38.570 position:59%
And his [inaudible] to that is just
much like all of our other collections

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:45.970 position:70%
and just a biographical and a -- In a memory,
you know, throughout generations of veterans

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:51.520 position:61%
and VHP -- It talks about the haunting,
haunting effects of the battles

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.400
and skirmishes that he witnessed.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:00.860
So in addition to these three
stories, like I said before,

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:06.180
we have more than 400 World
War I collections as a whole.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:10.260
And what we do quarterly,
this is something special

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.230
since the library's commemorating
the first world war right now --

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:19.180
But quarterly the Veterans
History Project will find a theme,

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:23.980
whether that's disabled American
veterans or whether that --

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:28.240
Or Japanese American veterans
or women in military service

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.050
or African American soldiers
through the generations.

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:39.020 position:59%
What we do is we look through our
collections and we identify content --

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:45.410 position:66%
rich content collections with compelling
oral histories and a series of photographs

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.630
and manuscripts and correspondence,
and they're well described.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:52.780
And what we do is we turn that
into what we call a web feature,

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:57.350 position:63%
and the web feature is narrative driven.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:01.970 position:70%
This one's about the first world war, and
this one's in sub components arguing over war

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:04.860
and over here [inaudible] the
"Echoes of the Great War" exhibit.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.050
Over there on a world overturned,

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:12.030
again paralleling the "Echoes
of the Great War" exhibit.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:16.470 position:69%
And what you'll have here, and we'll
absolutely circulate these links at the end,

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:24.090
are opportunities for you to click
through and learn again from dozens

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:28.150
of fully described digitized
World War I collections.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:32.440
You know, that place them in a
historical context that talks

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:40.000 position:61%
about their individual experiences and
connect them to a larger work by theme.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.670 position:75%
And in addition to World War I, we have a good
many, I think nearly 100 now, experiencing wars,

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:50.590
each chapter with different themes.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:54.950
And also all of those searches, all
of those well described stories,

00:28:54.950 --> 00:29:01.510 position:73%
can be found by searching through the veteran's
name as well which really gives you a nice A

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:09.110 position:75%
to Z. And conflict experience and nationality
diversity as you scroll through our collections.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:18.210 position:70%
And, like I said before, learn firsthand from
immigrants throughout the generations as well

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:27.590 position:59%
as natural citizens and really a broad
[inaudible] of various narratives

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:33.450 position:63%
that we have pulled together through the
efforts of oral historians, volunteers,

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:39.900 position:64%
and as I started bringing in in the
comments, folks who had taken the stories

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:45.100 position:72%
of their families and sent them to the Library
of Congress where we can share them nationally

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:49.190 position:66%
through our online collections and through
the American Folklife Center reading room.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:53.980 position:61%
And also through installations and
exhibits like "Echoes of the Great War"

00:29:53.980 --> 00:30:00.500 position:59%
where some VHP materials are featured.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:06.250 position:61%
And yes. As I said before, "Echoes of
the Great War" is currently on display.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:07.330
It will be there.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:11.720
The online exhibition will
be online until January 2019.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:18.810 position:59%
And just like you can click through
VHP materials, I encourage you to look

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:20.180
through "Echoes of the Great War."

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:27.000 position:56%
To be honest, one of the things that
-- So I'm a trained oral historian,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.840
and so I always like to hone
in on the oral histories.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.810
And one of the things that
was a challenge for me

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:39.070 position:59%
with this was we quite literally have
no World War I veterans who we can ask

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:43.100
in an oral history setting now
what age he joined the service.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.790
What motivated you to join?

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:51.290 position:67%
And by immersing yourself in "Echoes of the
Great War," those questions are answered.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:54.890
For me, just looking around, like
I said, at the photograph of --

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:58.960 position:72%
Or at the poster of "Attention to all aliens,"

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:04.870 position:58%
or the Uncle Sam [inaudible] it
really offers an immersive experience

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:08.690
for a generation that's gone.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:15.370 position:72%
But yeah. And with that, I know that that's
kind of a deep point to leave you hanging off,

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:21.530 position:61%
but I'm very interested in hearing from
the group and answering some questions.

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:25.730 position:58%
&gt;&gt; Great. Well, please do let us know
if you have questions in the chat.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:31.110 position:66%
It looks like there was one question about
submitting photographs from World War I,

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:35.170 position:64%
and Megan [assumed spelling] has replied
to look at the VHP website, loc.gov/vets,

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.760 position:69%
and also -- Or email [inaudible] at loc.gov.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:45.960 position:67%
But I don't know if you have other thoughts
about what you're looking for in terms

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:50.890
of collections, especially
when it comes to World War I.

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:54.580
What you do accept.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:55.470
&gt;&gt; So yes.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:32:03.130 position:64%
We do. So in terms of World War I
donations, like I said before, there's --

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:07.580
There is potential for oral history
in the form of a legacy recording.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:13.080 position:69%
Like if, by chance, your family or a student
recorded a story of a World War I veteran

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:18.860
in your life, we would -- And
it's in a compliant format or --

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:23.730 position:73%
Just reach out to us and describe the material.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:27.620 position:61%
In addition to those legacy recordings,
we're always looking for opportunities

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:34.940 position:59%
to collect manuscripts and we consider
a complete collection as one that has

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:40.630
at least 20 pages of military
orders or memoir or journal pages

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:46.080 position:66%
or at least 10 original photographs or
additive correspondence or creative works.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:52.040 position:61%
But just in terms of [inaudible]
institution and we live on our nuances.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:59.140 position:73%
So if you have any World War I materials that
you'd like to share with us or talk to us about

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:07.030 position:73%
or show examples of, we look forward to working
with you and seeing what we can do to make sure

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:11.990 position:72%
that your family history and the experience of
your World War I ancestor is preserved here.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:17.510
So, as I said before, it's a
30/20 [inaudible] or catchphrase.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.450
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, thank you.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.950
So then another question.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:25.270
Do you have -- Is there something
that you've found truly surprising

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.040
about someone's service during
World War I or something

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:33.760
that just was a surprise
to you in these archives?

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:41.340 position:70%
&gt;&gt; So I feel like every day I'm finding a new
story, and I know that that's sort of a maxim

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.190
that gets used up a lot, you know.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:44.520
What's your favorite story?

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.510
You know, the next one.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:48.240
But there is some truth to that.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:53.060 position:67%
In terms of World War I stories, I would
honestly say that the Freeman diary is just

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:59.010
so powerful to me because
everybody here is, you know --

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:03.870 position:75%
It's so branded, and I'm not sure if this is the
social studies curriculum, but the armistice is

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:09.410 position:56%
such an epoch, and at least it was
in my learning in American learning.

00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:17.500
And here Harry Freeman tells
a story of being ordered

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:21.440 position:73%
in to an engagement hours before the armistice.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:27.010
And having at the end of the battle
the smoke clear and realizing

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.920 position:70%
that he was completely -- He was in a pocket.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.860
He was completely encircled.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:39.560 position:67%
And that, you know, had the bell not chimed
or had the bell not tolled at 11/11/11,

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.070
he wouldn't have survived the war.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:49.030 position:70%
And it's just this mix of absurdity and
experience that just draws me right in to it.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.350
&gt;&gt; That's great.

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:52.290 position:70%
You know, we'll have to -- I'm intrigued now.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:54.170 position:64%
I haven't read through the Freeman diary.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:55.940
So I want to go do that now.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.180 position:58%
There are really such wonderful ones.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:00.510
I'm especially taken with Irving
Greenwald who's not an immigrant,

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:05.020 position:70%
but he's a child of immigrants, but there are
so many wonderful stories on your website.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:11.670
There's questions coming through
about VHP's collecting policies

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.970
which I think Megan is addressing.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.160
But a question about Camp Upton.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.650
Is there anything else on
VHP's website about Camp Upton?

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:23.710 position:61%
I think the question was
specifically, "Is there a searchable --

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.260 position:66%
Is something searchable about Camp Upton?"

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.850
Which I think is not the case, but
are there other veteran stories

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:32.490 position:69%
from Camp Upton that you know of, by chance?

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:32.830
&gt;&gt; Offhand?

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:37.350 position:67%
&gt;&gt; Oh. And Megan says it is [inaudible]
database is searchable by service location.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:38.200
So that's good.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.110
And she just sent the link.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:40.980
So that's fabulous.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.870
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Megan.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:49.380 position:63%
Yeah. So and there's a variety of
different service locations to veterans,

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.360 position:66%
and that includes training and deployment.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:56.480
So from one pathway to another, all
of those that the veteran indicated

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:01.960 position:72%
on their biographical information when we
accepted their collection or it was attributed

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:07.180 position:73%
in the service history notes, we would be able
to find that information on the backend as well

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.480
as you'd be able to find it on
the frontend through that link.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.480
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.080 position:59%
And then a few were content questions.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.830
Is World War I the war they
said would end all wars?

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:19.800
That's a -- Is that something
you feel like you can answer on?

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.790 position:64%
&gt;&gt; I feel like that's something that, you
know, we could write a monograph on that.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:29.760 position:63%
Or we could all, you know, settle around
in a circle and have a moderated panel.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:40.890 position:69%
It's -- It seems without precedent, but also
-- So without precedent, and I would say --

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:44.830 position:58%
And this is me as a public historian,
not a [inaudible] historian.

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:58.380 position:66%
To our veteran stories, we see
consistent effects on the veterans of war.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:03.780 position:58%
And the consequence of war in general
as told through their experience,

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.180 position:64%
as evidenced through their
correspondence, manuscripts, and diaries,

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:14.840 position:69%
and the war to end all wars, seeing that the
effects of the war persist through veterans

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:20.910 position:66%
of World War II, Korea, Cold War, Vietnam,
Persian Gulf, Afghan and Iraq wars,

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:26.810 position:59%
and in to war experiences, I would say
that in that capacity it's not unique.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:35.100 position:66%
And I think it's actually -- This question
is a nice segue to our -- to closing.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.630 position:64%
And then a reminder that this is part of
a series and maybe you can flip the slide

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:45.120 position:66%
to the next because I would encourage
you, Megan Parker who asked that question,

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:51.040 position:66%
to come back to the series next month when
we will have [inaudible] who's a historian

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:56.880 position:61%
in a manuscripts division and is one of
the curators of the exhibition talking

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.340 position:70%
about Woodrow Wilson's decision to go to war.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:06.450
And he will talk more about the --
Obviously the reasons that Wilson

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.340 position:70%
through the United States should be involved,
and some of the language around the war,

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:14.990 position:64%
that phrase being, "To end all wars" came
later, but this idea about the extent

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:18.920
to which the war was to make
the world safe for democracy

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:25.990 position:72%
and what Wilson's war aims were will be the
next session which is October 24, 2017 at 2PM.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:28.040
After that we'll have --
Well, we'll have one a month

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.290 position:73%
so the next will be November 28th at 2 o'clock.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:37.310 position:66%
We'll look at prints of Liberty bond drive
prints called [inaudible] liberty Paris

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:41.620 position:63%
which is a really evocative image of New
York City destroyed by the enemy made

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:44.070 position:70%
by Joseph Pennell who's a famous print maker.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:46.480 position:59%
And we'll have a specialist, Catherine
[assumed spelling] [inaudible]

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.560 position:64%
from our prints and photographs division.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:52.610 position:58%
And the last session will be December
12th, again at 2 o'clock looking

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:57.050 position:70%
at Charles Hamilton Houston and how his
wartime experience as a young officer serving

00:38:57.050 --> 00:39:01.570
in a segregated military influenced
