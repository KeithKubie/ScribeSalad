00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this problem, you're going to use the SIR model

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to look at a situation in which people's immunity doesn't last.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In other words, after someone who has been infected moves to the recovered population.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Here, she can become susceptible again.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We're going to call this waning immunity and we'll set the constant over here waning time

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to equal the amount of time that it takes for a person's immunity to fade away.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Most of the information we've given you in the supplied code you've seen before,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but there are couple of things that are particular to this unit.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You'll see another transmission coefficient,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which is a measure of how frequently each day, each infectious person might infect someone else.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You could also think of it as the likelihood that an interaction between an infected person

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and a susceptible person went up with the susceptible person becoming infected.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Just make sure that you know that its unit is 1 per person per day

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and the first thing that we want you to do is to define waning time right here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So eventually we have a system in stead state

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
where the number of recovered people is equal to 2 times the number of infected people.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Think about what this means in terms of the time that people should spend infected

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
versus the time that they should spend recovering.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Just for reference, I've include the equations for the standard SIR model right here.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Remember that this equation don't include waning immunity.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
First think about how you need to change them in order to reflect the situation at hand.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Once you figure that out, you'll need to translate your mathematical expressions into code.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We've already created list for S, I, and R for you.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And we set the initial values for susceptible, infected, and recovered populations right here.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Next comes a for loop, part of which you'll have to fill in.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We've given you S to I, right here,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
which is a number of people moving from susceptible to infected during one-time step.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We've also given you I to R,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
which is a number of people going from infected to recovered in a given time step.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
What you need to do is to define R to S.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The number of people who in one-time step become susceptible again after they've recovered.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Just to be clear, all three of these are measured in number of people,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
not in number of people per time.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Make sure that you check that your units are correct.

00:02:06.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Your last task is to modify the recursive functions right here for S, I, and R.
