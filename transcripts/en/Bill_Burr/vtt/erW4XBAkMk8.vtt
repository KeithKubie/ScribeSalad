1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.363
Okay.

2
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:02.890
<v 1>Hey, what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:05.650
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:10.510
September 11th, 2017 what's going on? How are you?

5
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.730
How's it going? How's it going? Um, more hurricanes,

6
00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:16.720
more hurricanes.

7
00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:20.080
And this is the 17th anniversary of the attacks in the World Trade Center,

8
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.170
the Pentagon, and then the one that went down in Pennsylvania, you know, I mean,

9
00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:28.030
Jesus Christ, what is going on this week?

10
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.500
It's just all gloom and frigging doom. You know,

11
00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:36.730
I was sitting there watching the news with Nia, right?

12
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.290
And this show and highlights of this, um, was it hurricane or say is,

13
00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.800
what is it? Jim are safe. Who is coming into fucking Miami, right?

14
00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:48.730
And there's some fucking, you know, white dude out there of course being like,

15
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.250
well, you know, it's know coming down real hard.

16
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.590
They show like five white people out there. And Nia literally said to me,

17
00:00:53.591 --> 00:00:55.450
she goes, what is wrong with white people?

18
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.060
Yeah, the lab. I was like, you know, we, for the most part,

19
00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.520
we grew up in cul-de-sacs. There's no excitement.

20
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:08.690
There's no drive by zig. No. Uh, you know,

21
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.090
cops beat me up for no reason. Generally speaking, you know, it's kind of, hey,

22
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:17.840
knock it off over there, straighten up. I know your father. You know,

23
00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:20.710
it's kind of like that. So I guess, you know, hurricane comes around you.

24
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.910
You need a story. Shit. You need a story.

25
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.060
I have no idea why I came up with a hacky eighties joke though about fucking the

26
00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:30.110
hurricanes. It's let's,

27
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.950
it's why don't they have all the peoples Dan with a report?

28
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.070
Because the report has never died.

29
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.160
They're always standing in the fucking middle of the shit. I don't know how,

30
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.790
I don't know how these news agencies know exactly where to fucking stand,

31
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:48.440
but somehow they stand just enough in the shit. I don't buy it. I don't buy it.

32
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.840
Um, she has one of them died yet,

33
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.493
<v 0>you know,</v>

34
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.640
<v 1>out of fuck. I mean, how the fuck do that, you know, Jesus, Belle spit it out.</v>

35
00:01:57.641 --> 00:02:00.970
Sorry. I floated a once. I, I've, I'm already done, but once I fly it, it just,

36
00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:04.930
you know, breathe in that fucking pressurized air up there.

37
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.740
Um, I mean, it's fucking inevitable.

38
00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:12.620
If you stand out inside in a fucking hurricane sums gonna fall on top of it.

39
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.280
It's bad enough. Like I love when they sit there and they tell these people,

40
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.120
you need to evacuate. You gotta get out of there. It's like and go where?

41
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.920
To my summer home.

42
00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:25.270
Don't you remember the fucking bags left it half this country upside down in

43
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:29.450
their fucking house. It's fucking unreal.

44
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:32.660
I don't understand like where these people are supposed to go. Like, where did,

45
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.501
where do they go?

46
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:36.290
Everybody just goes north and sits in a fucking waffle house for three,

47
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:39.710
four days. All the hotels get bought up. And if you don't have money,

48
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:43.280
what do you, what are you supposed to do? Um,

49
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.830
anyways, at least it was knocked down to a, to a category three, man.

50
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.620
I read some fucking, you know, at some horrible shit about, uh,

51
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.770
Houston that's still going on now is all mold and there's all in the, you know,

52
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.670
you don't need to listen to this. You see it all fucking day.

53
00:02:58.671 --> 00:03:03.220
This is just gloom and doom, all fucking misery here. So, um,

54
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.840
why don't I go to something positive? I actually, a friend of the podcast,

55
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.750
one of the great traumas of all time, Steven Adler, uh, he sent me this thing.

56
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.520
He's got a, uh, they're doing something for Ronnie James Dio. Um,

57
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.550
on October 6th at 6:30 PM bowl for Ronnie celebrity.

58
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.140
Uh, Christ, my eyes are going celebrity bowling tournament. All right, now,

59
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.960
fuck, I'm not gonna be able to read this. I can't. Okay, here we go. Oh.

60
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.440
Gotta love that. You can enlarge it. Wish I could do this to the world, man.

61
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.250
I have to get glasses. Why would I just give in to the fact that I need glasses?

62
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.040
All right. October six, 2017,

63
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:46.090
6:30 PM celebrity bowling tournament. Bowl for Ronnie.

64
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.270
Oh, for God's sake. Steven. Where's it going to be at? Oh,

65
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.620
it pins bowling center. One, two,

66
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:57.130
six five five Ventura Boulevard, studio city,

67
00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:00.310
California 906 oh four go down there.

68
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:04.390
It's for a great cause and a, you know, have yourself a white Russian,

69
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.290
you know, and tell Dani to shut the fuck up. Okay.

70
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:10.390
And I'll be down there for a great cause. Alrighty.

71
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.930
They at Gov I'll have put up a link. I'm going to post the whole uh,

72
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.850
flyer on a, the Monday morning thing of a Jig.

73
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.480
There's another guy got the TV on the am on my Twitter account.

74
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.470
There's a guy standing out there,

75
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.460
Jesus Christ standing out there in the fucking rain.

76
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.700
Like the video. Al Roker is out there.

77
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.580
How many hurricanes is that poor bastard stood down and now it's going up to

78
00:04:37.581 --> 00:04:38.414
Tampa.

79
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.960
Then it looks like it's going to go right over the Florida gators football

80
00:04:41.961 --> 00:04:46.630
stadium, somehow die around fucking making Georgia.

81
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.470
And is that what they said? Is that the trajectory? I don't know what.

82
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.870
Um, anyways, um,

83
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.260
so I was in a miss ship flew into fucking miss [inaudible] on Thursday night and

84
00:05:00.861 --> 00:05:03.560
I missed the entire New England patriots game.

85
00:05:03.561 --> 00:05:07.580
And from what I've heard as a patriots fan was probably better to just landed,

86
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.560
find out that they got the shit kicked out of them.

87
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.980
Really just kind of in the fourth quarter though. I mean,

88
00:05:12.981 --> 00:05:17.370
it was kind of a shootout with no fucking defense as far as I could tell. Um,

89
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.040
the chiefs are all excited doing fucking cartwheels cause they let up fucking 27

90
00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:24.410
points. I don't know what they're so fucking excited about,

91
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.950
but I will tell you as a patriots fan, I'm pretty fucking happy.

92
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.000
I'm going to tell you why I want to tell you why,

93
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.980
because I don't like the fucking worst thing ever is when before you even start

94
00:05:36.981 --> 00:05:41.210
the season, those fucking hacks on the sports shows go. You know,

95
00:05:41.211 --> 00:05:46.130
they talk about your team like good N***a, right? They start doing that shit.

96
00:05:46.131 --> 00:05:48.230
So before the fucking season, our restarts,

97
00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:50.180
you already got that fucking monkey on your back.

98
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.460
Every fucking fat Douche who never got picked in gym class coming in with this

99
00:05:55.461 --> 00:05:58.520
fucking loafers in his sweaters in India locker room,

100
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.980
just trying to rip the team apart and just adding just distraction.

101
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.360
So right out of the gate we fucking lose. All of that is gone.

102
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.050
And then immediately they go, Whoa, Whoa, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

103
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.970
Remember when you say and Tom Brady is after his last game was the greatest

104
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:18.530
without a doubt of all time.

105
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.800
Now we're the exact same people one fucking game later saying he's too old,

106
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.180
so I'm loving that. I'm loving all of that. What would you know?

107
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:33.050
I would actually love if we lost next week too,

108
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:34.520
but then they would have all those,

109
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:36.670
you know what's good as a time to hit the panic,

110
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.970
Blah Blah [inaudible] you'd have to deal with that. So I'm open,

111
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:43.190
you know they were in the next three, four they lose another one,

112
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:47.060
four and two and then they're five. Just nobody's paying attention. No,

113
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:50.510
they treat us like the Indianapolis Colts man when they were 13 and o and nobody

114
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:52.190
said Shit for whatever fucking reason,

115
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.430
which is really a reoccurring thing with the Indianapolis Colts.

116
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.860
No matter what they do. Hearing aids in the fucking helmets,

117
00:06:57.861 --> 00:07:01.790
fucking pumping crowd noise in tank in the final third of the season to get

118
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:04.670
Andrew luck stealing the patriots off offense.

119
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.320
Fucking being on the rules committee,

120
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:11.210
changing the rules of passing and on and on and fucking on. Right.

121
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.170
Go on 13 and oh, nobody's saying shit.

122
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.330
Oh they're just a bunch of country boys out there.

123
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:20.480
We won't pay attention to them. I love it. I love that we, uh,

124
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:21.890
I mean I hate our fucking defense,

125
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:25.730
but I haven't liked our defense since we won our first three. Um,

126
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:28.550
I think ever since then we've always been like, uh, you know,

127
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.820
well we're going to score you already gonna score 35, we're going to score 38.

128
00:07:31.821 --> 00:07:34.700
I always just, I just Kinda feel like we've been like that for too long.

129
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.790
And occasionally we've brought,

130
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.060
we brought in a shutdown corner like a Reavis um,

131
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.020
oh they ain't tailor whatever the fuck his name was who was here for like a year

132
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:47.660
or two. He was fucking great. But then all of a sudden they're like, yeah,

133
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:51.890
okay now I want to get paid. They like, yeah, Nah, Nah.

134
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.410
So, um, anyways, yeah. So I just,

135
00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:59.150
I watched a little bit of the highlights. I mean,

136
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.280
when you give up an 85 yard touchdown in your corner,

137
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.520
like fucking lets the guy go by him cause he thinks that he's got help over the

138
00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:08.320
top and the guy just isn't there. I mean,

139
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:11.590
I really don't think that's the chief's kicking our ass as much as that's

140
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.793
<v 2>um,</v>

141
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.100
<v 1>just horrible defense. You know what I mean?</v>

142
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.820
I would say though that that guy running for like 6,000 yards against us is

143
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:21.260
definitely a concern. But you know,

144
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.890
what are we supposed to win it every fucking year? You know?

145
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.170
Am I right with it? I love it. I love it. So there we go. So now what?

146
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:34.250
Now what we go 11 and five. They'll fix it, but I don't know.

147
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:36.500
You know, we do,

148
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.300
we always fucking have guys and then they make the pro bowl and then they asked

149
00:08:39.301 --> 00:08:41.930
for more money than we let them go and then we've got to build it back up again.

150
00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:46.140
So we'll see. It is definitely towards the end of Tom Brady's career. You know,

151
00:08:46.141 --> 00:08:48.570
I don't know how it could have gone any fucking better.

152
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.133
<v 2>Um,</v>

153
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.230
<v 1>you know, what are you going to tell me if it's a fist? You know, you don't,</v>

154
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:56.160
why so many people out about that, aside

155
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.040
<v 3>from the fact that they hate the patriots, it's, that's how people,</v>

156
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.890
that's how most people live their lives. You know,

157
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.070
they take one loss and they just pack it in.

158
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.410
<v 1>Oh No, we're never going to,</v>

159
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.130
<v 3>and I'm including a lot of patriots fans, you know, those ag,</v>

160
00:09:12.131 --> 00:09:13.810
but she can never listen to those sports shows.

161
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.830
Cause even like the people who call in, you know,

162
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.720
they always use words like concerned.

163
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.701
<v 1>I'll tell you right now,</v>

164
00:09:21.701 --> 00:09:25.240
I'm really concerned about our patch defense on dirt towns.

165
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.100
<v 3>Are you, what are you concerned about as if you're like, you're,</v>

166
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:32.350
you're a part of the coaching staff and if it doesn't work,

167
00:09:32.351 --> 00:09:33.340
you're going to get fired.

168
00:09:33.341 --> 00:09:35.920
You're gonna have to put your house up for sale and reload.

169
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:40.030
You relocate your kids once again. What exactly are you concerned about?

170
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.020
Um, but congratulations. The chiefs, I've actually,

171
00:09:44.021 --> 00:09:46.000
I've always liked the chiefs. Um,

172
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.640
I used to always watch the Superbowl highlights and that one with tank stream,

173
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.640
you know, 64 toss power. Trappers was always like the one of the great ones.

174
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.180
She's sitting there laughing his fucking balls off and everybody loved that back

175
00:09:55.181 --> 00:09:56.980
then. But now if they had that audio,

176
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:01.660
he'd have to issue an apology to the Minnesota Vikings and bud grant in the

177
00:10:01.661 --> 00:10:05.530
family and all that bullshit. But um, so anyways,

178
00:10:05.531 --> 00:10:08.590
I was flying back from Alabama and uh,

179
00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:12.280
so the only football games I was able to catch, I watched the uh,

180
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.260
Greenbay Seattle game, which I know Seattle fans hate, cause they,

181
00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:18.640
they definitely seem like they were getting the short end of the stick.

182
00:10:18.641 --> 00:10:23.320
Certainly on that phantom punches a injection, which I didn't see.

183
00:10:23.321 --> 00:10:28.150
I just saw the replay of it. Of course it happened on a fucking pig. Six.

184
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.900
Always fun to watch p Carroll loop blow a fucking gasket.

185
00:10:31.901 --> 00:10:35.110
But that guy is a great coach and that's, that's a great defense.

186
00:10:35.111 --> 00:10:39.850
You know what I mean? The fucking legion to do, you know, legion of boom, sorry,

187
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.740
boom. Right in your ass with the steroids.

188
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:42.783
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

189
00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.870
<v 3>Fuck all you guys. If you're going to bring up every fucking God damn time,</v>

190
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.070
Jesus Christ, we bend a card in fucking New England.

191
00:10:54.071 --> 00:10:55.660
I'm fucking trash in everybody.

192
00:10:55.661 --> 00:10:59.530
I am doing research on all your fucking teams and I'm going to do what you guys

193
00:10:59.531 --> 00:11:02.530
do every fucking time. You give me shit about my, I'm fucking fine.

194
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.240
I'm going to fucking look in the corners of your franchise. Jesus Christ.

195
00:11:07.241 --> 00:11:09.940
Like 30% of that fucking team tested pause,

196
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.020
defense tested positive for fucking steroids and they're still just talking

197
00:11:14.021 --> 00:11:17.890
about how great they are. Unbelief. Oh, that's another Colt's one.

198
00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.340
The gout caught the fucking allegedly deflated ball,

199
00:11:21.341 --> 00:11:22.990
which was never fucking proven.

200
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:25.953
<v 2>Um,</v>

201
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.160
<v 3>it's never fucking proven yet. Tom Still got fucking suspended.</v>

202
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.820
Everybody's basically paying the price for the under suspension of Ray Rice.

203
00:11:32.821 --> 00:11:35.570
I think when they go into Roger Goodell. Um,

204
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.490
how see that the Patriots lost after the, uh,

205
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.060
those barstool guys had that hilarious tee shirt of him just like a fucking

206
00:11:42.061 --> 00:11:45.660
clown. Is there anything better than just cone? Say's a fucking clown.

207
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:48.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

208
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.160
<v 3>All your accomplishments just go right out the window there. Fucking guy,</v>

209
00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:56.480
Roger Goodell makes million dollars a year, $30 million a year.

210
00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.860
As you can catch a walk into his car and you go, Hey dad,

211
00:11:58.861 --> 00:12:01.240
you're a fucking clown. I'm telling you,

212
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.430
as much as he has $30 million puppy civic, 16 after taxes, it bugs him.

213
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.220
He's going to be thinking about it when he's drinking his little donkeys,

214
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:13.240
coffee in the morning. Fuck is that guy to call me a clown talking himself.

215
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.560
You know, when he's putting his suit on, he's got the jacket, tie and shirt.

216
00:12:17.561 --> 00:12:20.050
He looks like one of those guys. He gets everything on, he puts the pants on.

217
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:23.920
Last Clooney area has his shoes on with the fucking socks in the sock.

218
00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:26.980
Garters you've got him talking to himself as he's adjusting the nut in the

219
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:30.490
fucking the knot right there and then in the mirror. Um,

220
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.590
so anyways, so I watched that game and uh, the defense is, uh,

221
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:38.950
looked obviously great in those fucking games. And uh, and now I got the,

222
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.870
I got the cowboys and giants in the background. Um,

223
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.250
I did watch the Moto GP race. I just watched the, uh, the big boys.

224
00:12:48.251 --> 00:12:51.580
I didn't get to watch a motor GP, three or two,

225
00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:55.090
but what a fucking race about mark mark has just saying, you know,

226
00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.130
David Cialis is just like, hey man, I'm going to take,

227
00:12:57.131 --> 00:13:00.940
I'm gonna take the bucket point. So mark, mark has is like, fuck that.

228
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.691
Fuck that.

229
00:13:01.691 --> 00:13:04.180
I'm going for the victory for you guys and all watch motorcycle racing.

230
00:13:04.181 --> 00:13:08.380
It was raining out and they still race. They don't quite go as fast,

231
00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:13.381
but they were going like over 150 miles an hour in the fucking rain on each

232
00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:17.920
other's asses. And this guy a, what the fuck was his name? He started the race.

233
00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:21.280
He fucking shot right up the side into first place.

234
00:13:21.281 --> 00:13:24.040
What the Fuck is being able to pee? I can't, I don't, I'm new to this sport.

235
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:26.380
I don't know all their names. So anyways,

236
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.810
now it was that guy a bill.

237
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.780
Why don't you just look the shit up so he can talk? You know what happened?

238
00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:38.950
He just can't remember the fucking names. What was the guy's name? Larry Legend.

239
00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:42.040
Is that the guy who fucking shot up and first before he fucking wiped out,

240
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.190
there's more goddamn accidents today or yesterday,

241
00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:47.770
I should say when they were racing. And uh, anyways,

242
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.400
everything that Formula One needs MotoGP has,

243
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.900
it was a race right down to the end. And fucking Mark Marquez said, fuck this.

244
00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:58.000
I'm going for the points. Cause if he got the 25,

245
00:13:58.001 --> 00:13:59.350
he was going to be tied with the visio.

246
00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:03.940
So he passed them on the fucking last lap or second to last lap and then held

247
00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:08.710
them off. Um, you know, it was some Phil Mickelson Shit. You know,

248
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.830
I'm not going to fucking, you know, just try to get back out on the fairway.

249
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:12.940
I'm going to try to put it in the hall.

250
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.420
Then I'm going to for pot and walk away with sweaty tits. I mean,

251
00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:18.610
that's what this man did, but basically on a motorcycle.

252
00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:21.490
So that was very enjoyable. But let's get down.

253
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.520
Let's talk about going down south now that the patriots season is evidently over

254
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:30.550
and Tom Brady is a over the health. Um,

255
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.740
you know the Atlanta Falcons one today in the New England patriots lost the

256
00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:40.450
exact opposite thing that happened the last time. Um, so there you go.

257
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:44.170
I don't know what that means. I'm sure Atlanta Falcon fans,

258
00:14:44.171 --> 00:14:46.900
if they could switch, you know, the results with the Patriots,

259
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:50.320
I think they would, you know, but evidently the fucking football sky is falling.

260
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.990
Um, you don't even fucking hate about fantasy football.

261
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:56.420
That is literally taken over like um,

262
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.780
they used to have like in the sports pages they used to just have,

263
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:01.400
they would have like the leaders. It was something,

264
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.960
it was really easy to find the leaders.

265
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:04.940
You could collect football cards and shit.

266
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.190
I used to know so much more about the game.

267
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.930
I don't know anybody's fucking name anymore.

268
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:13.630
Anytime you go to any sort of website where they have like fantasy fate,

269
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.790
when you want to look at stats, it's all this fantasy football shit.

270
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.000
Get this guy on your team.

271
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:23.630
Peyton Manning's fucking advertising that stuff.

272
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:29.120
I don't know. Should I just give in? Should I just give, I don't want it.

273
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.140
I don't want to do that shit.

274
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.110
I don't want to have somebody on a team that I actually,

275
00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:35.600
I don't really hate any other team in the NFL. Do I hate any team?

276
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.230
I Hate Jim [inaudible]. That's it. That's the only person I don't like.

277
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:40.580
You know,

278
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.160
there's certain people that act like fucking idiots in the league that I don't

279
00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:46.550
particularly care for, but that I don't hate the team. You know,

280
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.110
here's another classic.

281
00:15:48.111 --> 00:15:51.230
The cowboys are probably gonna beat the giants cause this is what the cowboys

282
00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:53.360
and giants do. The cowboys when in the beginning,

283
00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:56.630
part of the year and then the giants always fucking losing in the end.

284
00:15:56.631 --> 00:15:59.390
They come back around and they do the same thing down in New York.

285
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.640
So time to move on from Eli.

286
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.950
He only steps up in every fucking big moment in January his entire career.

287
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:11.690
I think it's time to get rid of him cause he fucked up in September.

288
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.830
Um, you know, I didn't even allow me to look this shit up.

289
00:16:15.831 --> 00:16:20.000
Did that as Zko Elliot guy play seems to me a,

290
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.110
what's weird is they threw out his case in the real world,

291
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:30.080
but it's like in the NFL you need less burden of proof.

292
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.280
Elliott cowboys. Is that his fucking name?

293
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.473
Uh,

294
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.333
<v 0>okay.</v>

295
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.510
<v 3>Elliott cowboys to play.</v>

296
00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.710
Is he playing judge grants champion or a restraining order request for Dallas

297
00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:47.690
cowboys running back? Probably from that psycho.

298
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.970
What would the person who seeming like a psycho. Okay.

299
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:55.310
Is he cause he go Elliott ruly makes, yeah, I've been out of the loop.

300
00:16:55.311 --> 00:16:57.770
All right, so you played, that's good. That's good.

301
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.820
Cause the clown was going to over suspend them. The elegant get this.

302
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:05.540
The NFL is back. And so what the 15 reasons, it's a complete disaster.

303
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:09.340
Hey,

304
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.550
y'all bought those Los Angeles Rams coming back wearing the Lamar Lundy fucking

305
00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:18.050
blue and white. The fearsome foursome. Marlin Olson.

306
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.290
Rosie Griff. Was it Lamar? London? You always forget him and then a,

307
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.900
what's his face there? Uh, I can never name all four of them.

308
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.230
I always end up forgetting one. I always remember Merlin Olsen Rosey Greer.

309
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.270
Oh Jesus Christ. The coolest.

310
00:17:32.271 --> 00:17:36.650
One of them are Deacon Jones and it was at Lamar Lundy, Lamar,

311
00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.990
Lamar Lundy. Is this even a podcast? Is this,

312
00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:44.900
you guys listen to me fucking yeah, there you go. Right. Lamar Lundy,

313
00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:48.800
was he a Steeler or was he a Ram? He was a he ram Lamar and warranted rams.

314
00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:49.980
Fierce foursome. I right. I got

315
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.920
<v 1>it. All right. So anyway, let's get, let's, let's, I'm not watching TV anymore.</v>

316
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:57.840
Now I'm focused. Now I'm focused. Oh, is Eli driving him in?

317
00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.293
<v 2>Okay.</v>

318
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.470
<v 1>Once he got his second and eight, eight oh nine to go in the third quarter,</v>

319
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.380
Eli calling a fucking audible over the middle, far out fairs,

320
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.030
down, moving the ball.

321
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:18.060
Cowboys fans are all going to be fuck saying you need to fucking bench fucking

322
00:18:18.061 --> 00:18:21.450
quarterback and bring back Roger Star back. Um, so we did the, uh,

323
00:18:21.451 --> 00:18:25.820
the Horseshoe Casino in Mississippi. I had so much fucking fun doing that.

324
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:27.783
<v 2>Um,</v>

325
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.570
<v 1>although it was just a part of the south man that was just deep, deep, deep,</v>

326
00:18:31.571 --> 00:18:35.170
deep south, deep south. Hang a fucking right.

327
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.940
Don't stop in Alabama. Keep going. Stop. Right before you get to fucking

328
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:47.240
Louisiana. And, um, it was just was,

329
00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.070
I don't know, the pace of the people down there was driving me fucking nuts.

330
00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:53.680
You know, I ordered room service twice.

331
00:18:53.681 --> 00:18:56.410
I kept ordering water and they just wouldn't bring it up to me.

332
00:18:56.411 --> 00:18:59.540
So the second time I said, did you, where's the glass?

333
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.450
Is there a glass of water? And she's like, well now try.

334
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.170
And I'm like, and, and that's what's on the try.

335
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.640
She just fucking walks out. There's no, Oh,

336
00:19:13.641 --> 00:19:17.660
I'm sorry. I'll go get you some. It's like it wasn't on the tray.

337
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.780
So then I go to use like nothing fucking worked.

338
00:19:20.781 --> 00:19:24.770
I go to use the fucking ironing board. The ironing board was fucked up.

339
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.280
I was trying to make it stand up. It wouldn't stand up.

340
00:19:28.281 --> 00:19:29.990
I had to bend a piece back. It wouldn't,

341
00:19:29.991 --> 00:19:33.650
and then I finally just had a fucking meltdown and I'm admitting this to the

342
00:19:33.651 --> 00:19:38.300
casino. I jumped up and down on it and then I pulled this shark nose back.

343
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.230
I felt bad afterwards and I tried to bend it back, but it's all fucked up.

344
00:19:42.231 --> 00:19:46.580
If you wonder why it's fucked up. I finished it off. It was already fucked up.

345
00:19:46.581 --> 00:19:50.330
So if you want to send me a bill, I apologize. Um,

346
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:55.770
and then the next day, me, Dean and Nick drove over into, uh,

347
00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.020
Tuscaloosa to go on.

348
00:19:57.021 --> 00:20:02.000
We went to go see Alabama versus Fresno state. Uh,

349
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.600
we had a great fucking time. Um, we met some people there,

350
00:20:05.601 --> 00:20:07.910
some friends of mine and a, they hooked us up. We were in,

351
00:20:07.911 --> 00:20:12.890
I think that's fucking skybox. No Sunburn. You know, it was a cupcake game.

352
00:20:12.891 --> 00:20:17.420
Who's kidding? Who Against Fresno state. It was a day game. It's like I went,

353
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:18.980
but I have to go back there again.

354
00:20:18.981 --> 00:20:21.620
I want to go there and night game when they play like Texas a and M,

355
00:20:21.621 --> 00:20:24.470
Mississippi or fucking, you know,

356
00:20:24.471 --> 00:20:28.160
anybody like LSU or some shit like that.

357
00:20:28.161 --> 00:20:30.890
I want to go back for that and I want to sit in the fucking crowd the next time.

358
00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.940
Um, this was like, it was too nice. It was awesome. I had a great time,

359
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.630
but it was like a, I didn't, I didn't get to feel the crowd a little bit,

360
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.570
which was perfect because I had a show that night, so I didn't drink.

361
00:20:41.571 --> 00:20:44.360
I'm still not drinking and I didn't get a sunburn, so it worked out for me,

362
00:20:44.361 --> 00:20:48.130
but I feel like I kind of went to a preseason game. Um,

363
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:54.240
<v 3>so we're walking out of there and fucking Joe Barton x somehow found the one</v>

364
00:20:55.001 --> 00:21:00.001
Russian guy in Alabama and shit escalated quickly.

365
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.320
You know, bardic walks up to the guy, that guy, uh,

366
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.980
I don't know how they got into a conversation. The Guy said he was,

367
00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:07.970
somehow he said he,

368
00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.530
he always heard his talk and he meant he said something to us.

369
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.760
We were waiting for the elevator and the guy said that he was rushing.

370
00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:17.470
So bar next, a huge penguins fan. And he goes,

371
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:22.190
<v 4>oh. He's like, oh, you're a Russian. He goes, hey, you know, you like, Oh mom,</v>

372
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.780
can you have getting him all going, right? Yeah. You're like, Maga.

373
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.120
The guy's like, Nah, Nah.

374
00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:30.770
<v 3>He's like, I like it. He's like, I let go of that skit. And then he goes,</v>

375
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:31.641
you're like, get back shit.

376
00:21:31.641 --> 00:21:36.110
And then he gets right in the guy's face and he goes, zero cups, zero cups.

377
00:21:36.111 --> 00:21:41.000
He's like a vege Kinney goes and starts doing the choking thing. Right.

378
00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:42.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

379
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.490
<v 3>Joe had had a couple of SAS Barillas who's kidding who, right?</v>

380
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:49.350
So they fucking start going back and forth and the e Joe keeps giving them shit.

381
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.590
The guy's going, oh, come on man. It's a team game. [inaudible]

382
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.650
<v 4>guys your cup. So how can you like zero cups?</v>

383
00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.260
Zero Cup keeps it

384
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.780
<v 3>acting like the guy's choking on a fucking Dick and the Russian guys getting</v>

385
00:22:01.781 --> 00:22:05.050
mad. Joe's fucking around. He's not seeing it.

386
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.550
And the fucking elevator cannot come fast enough cause it looks like it's going

387
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:11.890
to escalate into a fight. Which, you know,

388
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.760
Joe Barnick and this Russian guy was actually taller than Joe,

389
00:22:15.761 --> 00:22:20.350
but he was skinnier. But you know, we sell so Russian, you know what I mean?

390
00:22:20.351 --> 00:22:22.210
So you know, you know those fucking people, they, they'd be,

391
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:26.890
they beat the fucking bitch. Slapped Hitler all the way back to fucking Berlin.

392
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:31.410
You know, let people out of prisons and say, Hey,

393
00:22:31.411 --> 00:22:32.730
remember we threw you in there for,

394
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.280
why don't you come out and go do that to people who look like this?

395
00:22:35.281 --> 00:22:37.950
And that's what they did. Half of them were in bare feet. I mean,

396
00:22:37.951 --> 00:22:40.710
I know it's a legend at this point, but it's pretty much fucking true.

397
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:45.420
So now I'm concerned because they're both Joe's like whatever, six, four,

398
00:22:45.421 --> 00:22:49.770
this guy's like six, five, and G. I kept going, Joe, hey man. Hey Joe,

399
00:22:49.771 --> 00:22:50.650
take it easy. Just kept,

400
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:52.980
<v 4>go ahead guys that don't come say wait, come on.</v>

401
00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.310
They just kept doing it and he's laughing at the guy.

402
00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.190
<v 3>Yeah. And I don't know why. He just wasn't seeing the guy getting mad.</v>

403
00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.270
So the guy goes, hey, why don't we go around the corner and Joseph Guy,

404
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.560
let's go around the corner and they walk around the corner. I'm like,

405
00:23:05.561 --> 00:23:06.670
are they going to go fight?

406
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.800
And then there was this awkward little moment between him and me and dean is

407
00:23:10.801 --> 00:23:15.030
stone sober? Like what the fuck? So finally I just go to my buddy goes,

408
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.020
there's some stairs we can take as the elevator was taken forever. And he goes,

409
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.690
uh, yeah. I go, yeah, we can take the stairs.

410
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:21.880
So we go to take the stairs and we're going to walk out.

411
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.790
And the Russians guys like, I wouldn't take this day out as too,

412
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.660
now they walk in Belden stairs and it's just like I couldn't separate them.

413
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.750
I couldn't get them separated. And uh,

414
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.050
I dunno what happened by the end of it. They were,

415
00:23:38.051 --> 00:23:42.700
they were like best of friends ready to go drink some fucking vodka. Um,

416
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.650
we actually left the game, uh,

417
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.920
halfway through the fourth quarter because we had to go do our show,

418
00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:52.130
but we wanted to go around and get a picture in front of the bear Bryant Statue.

419
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.860
And, uh, we actually got one in front of the Nick Saban one.

420
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:56.300
There's one other guy that nobody,

421
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.640
everybody always forgets he's only won one championship,

422
00:23:58.641 --> 00:24:03.290
but it was pretty fucking amazing to, uh, to go there. I'm telling you, if you,

423
00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:06.120
if you get a fucking chance, man, everybody wants to go to the ballparks,

424
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:10.490
all the baseball parks and go to a fucking Lambeau field and that type of shit,

425
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:11.390
which I understand,

426
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:16.370
but you know all you guys who live in pro football cities and you know New York,

427
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:18.050
Chicago, all that pro shit,

428
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.740
Boston don't sleep on going to big time college football man.

429
00:24:21.741 --> 00:24:26.420
I'm telling you sec, big 10, you got to go to the University of Michigan.

430
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.720
You got to go to horseshoe in a house state. You got to go to one of them.

431
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.440
You just have to experience 100,000 fucking people going absolutely fucking

432
00:24:33.441 --> 00:24:37.520
nuts. Pick a good rivalry game. Go on fucking stubhub, pay through the nose,

433
00:24:37.521 --> 00:24:38.870
go out there and get fucking hammered.

434
00:24:38.871 --> 00:24:43.190
Go to the game and then please tell me what you see in the NFL because I don't

435
00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:45.800
think the NFL can near nearly touches me

436
00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:48.540
<v 1>excitement. Although having said that,</v>

437
00:24:48.541 --> 00:24:52.110
how great is it that it's fucking football season and this is what always

438
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.680
happened. Football season goes by like the summer, you know what I mean?

439
00:24:55.681 --> 00:24:58.470
Like every year in the summer, I'm okay, it's May, we're going into May.

440
00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:03.510
I'm really gonna pay attention and try to enjoy and remember like, hey,

441
00:25:03.511 --> 00:25:06.840
it's this summer. We're in the summer. Let's fucking enjoy this shit.

442
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:07.770
I still feel that way.

443
00:25:07.771 --> 00:25:12.090
Even though I live out in la where it's summer all the fucking time, right? Um,

444
00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:17.070
and every, every fucking year, all of a sudden it's just like September, right?

445
00:25:17.071 --> 00:25:20.040
And football seasons to same thing. You're like, oh my God,

446
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.740
fucking football season. It's fucking great. Then all of a sudden it's like,

447
00:25:22.741 --> 00:25:27.090
it's the playoffs and you're so focused on the playoffs. Playoffs.

448
00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.550
Then all of a sudden, like

449
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.520
it's that week between the championship game in the Super Bowl and you're like,

450
00:25:35.521 --> 00:25:36.420
what the fuck happened?

451
00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:40.680
You so busy putting money on the games and betting on the fucking games.

452
00:25:40.681 --> 00:25:43.470
You don't realize, not only is there only one, two teams left,

453
00:25:43.471 --> 00:25:47.510
there's only one game left and then then we're fucked.

454
00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.780
Then we'll fuck. And then the panic starts to set and then you think,

455
00:25:50.781 --> 00:25:53.480
well at least I got march madness, right?

456
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:56.440
At least they got march madness. And then I got the,

457
00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:01.160
the hockey in the basketball playoffs and then there's just the, it's just,

458
00:26:01.161 --> 00:26:02.600
you know what it really is. It's just July.

459
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.980
It's set one panic of July and into August.

460
00:26:06.981 --> 00:26:08.810
The dog days of baseball

461
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:12.010
<v 3>that you have to fucking deal with. That's how I ended up getting into fucking,</v>

462
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:15.130
I think Formula One and all that shit just to cover that.

463
00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.540
Then I totally got into it. I don't know.

464
00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:19.360
I feel like I've been talking in circles for like fucking 25 minutes.

465
00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.550
What is this? How many, how many awful minutes this has spent.

466
00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:25.300
26 see that comedian long enough. You can, you can,

467
00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.100
you could sense time.

468
00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.640
I had this feeling that I'd been bombing for 26 fucking minutes.

469
00:26:30.641 --> 00:26:33.460
So a congratulations to everybody's team who won this week,

470
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:38.100
including the chief's, not a cunt and a everybody last day. It's only funeral.

471
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.820
<v 1>It's just one week fucking relax. Um,</v>

472
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:48.730
25 days and no booze. 25 days to know the boobs.

473
00:26:48.731 --> 00:26:51.290
I'll tell you how well I'm doing with no boots. When I went out,

474
00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.060
I went through the duty free and I saw that

475
00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:58.310
Macallan McCallum rare cask black, which I'd never heard of. And I am like,

476
00:26:58.311 --> 00:26:59.680
I am fucking buying that

477
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.013
<v 3>when I get back,</v>

478
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:06.000
when I come back off the plane and when I got off the plane I, you know,

479
00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.520
I think I flew delta out in United on the way back so it wasn't there but I was

480
00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:16.060
going to buy it. You know, I'm sitting there talking to myself like, am I done?

481
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.060
Like I was actually thinking on the plane today,

482
00:27:19.061 --> 00:27:21.610
like I might be done for good.

483
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.660
And then I came home and I ordered these whiskey glasses and I'm like,

484
00:27:26.661 --> 00:27:27.560
well that's not a good sign.

485
00:27:27.561 --> 00:27:31.310
Like if you just say I'm done with heroin and then you go to Amazon or you go to

486
00:27:31.311 --> 00:27:34.400
like syringe.net, you know, and you just order a bunch of fucking

487
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:40.320
<v 1>drug paraphernalia, I guess as long as you don't buy the drugs. Right. Hey,</v>

488
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.580
I just gave officer I, I collect crack pipes. Okay, can I have,

489
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:47.030
can I have my license back please?

490
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.180
You're not going to find any residue in there.

491
00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:57.430
<v 3>Um, so anyway, I was actually thinking on the plane, I'm like, am I like,</v>

492
00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.580
what if I just next year I turned 50, right?

493
00:28:00.581 --> 00:28:05.581
And I'm just done with the booze and then I just become like this yoga Palati

494
00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:10.270
guy. I just go stink. Right? Gordon Sumner,

495
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:14.020
I become that fucking guy. You know,

496
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.810
<v 1>I look good for my age. If I actually fucking did that through my fifties,</v>

497
00:28:17.811 --> 00:28:20.420
I would look fucking unbelievable.

498
00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:25.810
<v 3>It's 64 60 year old, you know? And you figured by then,</v>

499
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.500
you know how good tanning beds are going to be,

500
00:28:29.501 --> 00:28:33.520
how good the hair plugs are going to be, you know?

501
00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.430
And I bet I'll be microchip by then,

502
00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:40.230
which I can also have like the added Viagara uh,

503
00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:42.310
option to it. You know what I mean?

504
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:46.720
I think I can stay in the game for another 10 years after that. I don't know.

505
00:28:46.721 --> 00:28:50.290
What do you guys think? Have you guys thought about the future?

506
00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:54.490
You that microchipped you full head of hair and abs?

507

done. I don't know if I can, I don't know.

612
00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:17.770
<v 1>I understand why alcoholics like they take it one day at a time cause she cause</v>

613
00:35:17.771 --> 00:35:20.090
just sitting there like I'm never going to do this. Not just today.

614
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:23.110
I'm just not going to do it today. Just not going to do it today.

615
00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.210
<v 3>You know, sometimes you got to do it though, right?</v>

616
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:30.040
You know

617
00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.700
<v 1>your wife's talking to you and you're sitting there looking at her smiling and</v>

618
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:33.980
<v 3>nod.</v>

<v 0>loves me. I can see it in his eye.</v>

622
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.360
And you're actually thinking about that bottle of booze that you bought.

623
00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.990
How are you going to go out in the garage? Like a fucking degenerate

624
00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.830
sit some dirty chair. You don't give a shit, right?

625
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:57.770
<v 3>Pour that glass. You set the bottle down, it touches the floor.</v>

626
00:35:57.771 --> 00:36:02.510
You hear it echoing in your garage. You know that garage that's yours, right?

627
00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:06.230
That garage that you made the decision, you weren't going to be like these.

628
00:36:06.231 --> 00:36:10.550
Most of these guys who let their wives not only take over the house but also the

629
00:36:10.551 --> 00:36:12.980
garage, right? And they just fill it up with all this shit.

630
00:36:12.981 --> 00:36:16.700
You can't even get the fucking car in their at garage is yours.

631
00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:19.250
You put up the Dartboard,

632
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:23.900
you get the kegerator that sticks you little fucking tree for it, you know,

633
00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:27.890
I mean, who was kicking talk. You're a guy yet you're still a child.

634
00:36:27.891 --> 00:36:30.460
Just cause you can grow a beer doesn't mean you're mature. All right.

635
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.310
<v 4>Would you look at all these stars doing these fucking commercials? Now?</v>

636
00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:39.120
Jesus fucking Christ. Can you leave something on the bone for the struggle?

637
00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.173
<v 3>Glenn actor,</v>

638
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:44.440
can't you just do a fucking ad over in Guam like you used to?

639
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.040
Um, anyways,

640
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.880
<v 4>well, well we'll dre waver.</v>

641
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.620
<v 3>I want to Redo my fucking garage again. Okay.</v>

642
00:36:55.621 --> 00:36:58.350
I gotta I gotta add something else in there. I got to add a fucking, you know,

643
00:36:58.351 --> 00:37:01.920
now that I never have my truck in there, you know, I put it in storage,

644
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:05.640
so I kind of flip flop and everything like that with the new car and then the

645
00:37:05.641 --> 00:37:09.530
old car. I haven't driven my truck in like two weeks, man. I miss it. Uh,

646
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.890
I gotta do that Sunday. I gotta have the garage with the fucking room above it.

647
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.310
You just have to have it at. That's what it is, you know?

648
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.540
And then once you do,

649
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:22.500
you have a fucking prenuptial agreement that if we get divorced,

650
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:26.190
I get the garage and the room above it and you cannot fucking evict me.

651
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:28.560
That will be mine and you will get the fucking house.

652
00:37:28.561 --> 00:37:30.270
But you know something fucking,

653
00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:34.240
<v 4>they'll just be people. I just don't feel safe with him being out there,</v>

654
00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:39.050
<v 3>cry their way into getting that to, you know,</v>

655
00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.360
I swear to God, um, I wonder if anybody,

656
00:37:44.361 --> 00:37:47.150
like when a hurricanes come in and if they were in an unhappy marriage,

657
00:37:47.151 --> 00:37:51.050
like what's going through their mind? You just sit in there with your wife,

658
00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.820
you know, she doesn't know that you bought a boat.

659
00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.640
You're tied to the back of the house, a little fucking row boat. You know,

660
00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.710
she can't see it. You convince her to try it. Right.

661
00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:03.680
<v 4>Ride out the storm with a little water comes in you like see ya later. Oh,</v>

662
00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.533
Jesus, Bill.

663
00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:08.740
<v 3>Um, all right, let's get to the fucking questions this week. I apologize.</v>

664
00:38:08.741 --> 00:38:10.360
What do I, you know, and I don't apologize.

665
00:38:10.361 --> 00:38:13.900
I don't apologize for fucking making up shit.

666
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:19.210
I'm making up Shit, man. What the fuck you want from me? All right, boo

667
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:24.500
lineups. Booz lineups that I talk about.

668
00:38:24.501 --> 00:38:27.980
Everything I wanted to talk about first before I get into this shit.

669
00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:33.200
Let's see here. Steven Adler, Ronnie James, Alabama verse Fresno State,

670
00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:36.070
Mississippi Horseshoe ironing

671
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.500
<v 1>board. Oh yeah. When I was waiting for the fucking car to come around,</v>

672
00:38:38.501 --> 00:38:39.910
I was standing out in front of the hotel going,

673
00:38:39.911 --> 00:38:42.370
I'm never coming to this fucking state again. I was so fucking,

674
00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:45.490
everything was going so god damn slow. But you know,

675
00:38:45.491 --> 00:38:48.190
once I got over my five second temper Tantrum,

676
00:38:48.191 --> 00:38:49.870
I realized that I actually had a great time there.

677
00:38:49.871 --> 00:38:52.510
So I'm going to come back next time I'm coming back.

678
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.180
It's either when Ole Miss Mississippi state has a game.

679
00:38:55.181 --> 00:38:57.630
I'm going to a fucking game that unhelped the plane out, Bam.

680
00:38:57.631 --> 00:39:02.230
Or some shit like that. Um, Joe finds a Russian, I talked about that. No boots.

681
00:39:02.231 --> 00:39:03.520
25 days.

682
00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.240
Oh Billy fucking red velvet cakes was going to take a month off.

683
00:39:07.241 --> 00:39:10.180
Now all of a sudden he thinks he's the next, he's the second commonest stink,

684
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:13.900
you know, staying held onto the hair.

685
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.660
He was losing the roof and then all of a sudden he started doing yoga.

686
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.200
He started standing on his fucking head and all that blood went to the top of

687
00:39:20.201 --> 00:39:22.840
his head, started feeding the roots. And that's what happened.

688
00:39:22.841 --> 00:39:23.980
Maybe mine will come back.

689
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.610
Fantasy football has taken over trading cards and all that shit.

690
00:39:27.611 --> 00:39:32.260
I talked about that. Well, I guess it's time to get on the fucking with the, uh,

691
00:39:32.261 --> 00:39:37.090
the Booz lineups here. All right. It's guys Booz lineup. Hey, Billy Balah chops.

692
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:42.190
Uh, I'm a listener from a listener from the UK. I,

693
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:45.340
uh, by the way, it's 16 to three. Well, you guys already know this shit.

694
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:49.840
Dallas plains, some good defense. I'm a listener from the UK.

695
00:39:49.841 --> 00:39:53.950
I managed to get to your show in Manchester and it was brilliant. Ah, thank you.

696
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.620
I was nervous about that show. You know,

697
00:39:56.621 --> 00:40:00.460
all I knew was this fucking soccer hoodlums from the 80s. You know,

698
00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:03.400
the fucking neo Nazis falling around man United. That's all I knew.

699
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:07.040
I read among the thugs and to me that was Manchester. Um,

700
00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:10.810
he said I wanted to send you my team of drinks, but I don't watch baseball. Oh,

701
00:40:10.811 --> 00:40:15.460
you're batting lineup. Okay. I tried when I was in New York to watch baseball,

702
00:40:15.461 --> 00:40:19.470
but I found it boring. Same with football. Fucking boring a,

703
00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.540
he means soccer here I guess. Cause he says la watched for that,

704
00:40:22.541 --> 00:40:25.840
for the World Cup. I mainly watch rugby league.

705
00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.440
You watch that seven nation league where if you come in last,

706
00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:33.310
you get the wooden spoon. Um, NFL for the Seahawks cricket.

707
00:40:33.311 --> 00:40:36.850
And I'm a big fan of F1. Dude, if you can sit through fucking cricket,

708
00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:39.130
you can get through a baseball game. I mean,

709
00:40:39.131 --> 00:40:44.050
that's the same thing except cricket last for fucking five days. Um,

710
00:40:44.051 --> 00:40:47.770
I decided to send you my list of drinks as the Formula One teams.

711
00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:50.440
I don't really drink that many neat spirits or whiskey,

712
00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.820
so I included everything else I drink when I want to get pissed. All right.

713
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.990
Leading off, he's gotten,

714
00:40:55.991 --> 00:41:00.580
Mercedes is Mercedes-Benz team for those of you don't want you F1 they're like

715
00:41:00.581 --> 00:41:02.900
the fucking cream of the crop. Uh,

716
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.850
we really should have batting cleanup,

717
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.370
but I get this, you're gonna do this more like,

718
00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:13.780
you know how they ranked football teams the best to the worst. All right. Uh,

719
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.570
IPA beers. Yeah, I'm one of those guys,

720
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.500
but I know piss people off talking about it. My pole position,

721
00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:24.940
drink quite happy to drink these beers all night. Drink iph all night.

722
00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:31.120
Jesus Christ. It's like drinking a Thanksgiving dinner. Each pint is so fucking,

723
00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.270
I fucking hate. I, there's so fucking I, you know,

724
00:41:35.271 --> 00:41:37.940
every once in a while if I just want to have one beer,

725
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:41.690
but I know I'm going to drink 30, I'll have an IPA.

726
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:45.020
Cause by the time I'm done with it, I'm just like, Jesus Christ had enough,

727
00:41:45.021 --> 00:41:49.130
enough with the fucking hops. Good Lord.

728
00:41:49.131 --> 00:41:53.900
It's like overactive. Quit bugging your eyes out of your fucking head. I get it.

729
00:41:53.901 --> 00:41:55.640
Beer supposed to have hops. Well,

730
00:41:55.641 --> 00:41:58.790
as long as you don't drink any of those stupid beers that have those,

731
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:02.490
those aggressive for no reason. Names, you know,

732
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.740
angry fuck face kick your mother and the current beer, whatever they, lamps,

733
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.460
Ale, angry Ale. All right.

734
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:14.450
His second better would be the Ferrari team, Jack Daniels Black Label,

735
00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:17.390
old number seven, whatever you want to call it.

736
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.300
A been around for these all these years and it's,

737
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:25.130
and it is as popular as it's always been. Usually drink it with a coke.

738
00:42:25.131 --> 00:42:28.520
Rarely neat. Oh Jesus. This guy's not even in AAA here.

739
00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:35.140
Batting third red bull mount gate with Mount Gay Eclipse Rum.

740
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:40.640
All right. If you're in your twenties I forgive you for this lineup.

741
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:45.641
I've been drinking it with ginger beer since these guys were Jaguar or the red

742
00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:50.240
ball of side, the red bull team. I'm a fucking idiot. Some sorry.

743
00:42:50.241 --> 00:42:54.110
I thought you drinking red bulls in mount gay eclipse rum. I was like,

744
00:42:54.111 --> 00:42:58.520
what in the fuck. Oh, I'm sorry. I apologize. All right. For Cindy,

745
00:42:58.521 --> 00:43:02.420
a team is, is a brown of vodcast. Never heard of that.

746
00:43:02.421 --> 00:43:05.720
Usually with apple juice. Don't get me,

747
00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:10.100
I'll see you drink like a woman you see with apple juice and a little umbrella

748
00:43:10.101 --> 00:43:13.670
in there and I thought it's been around a couple of times and I looked fatness.

749
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.550
I'm new to good vodka like a few Brits.

750
00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:20.030
I was drinking a paint stripper. VOD Paint,

751
00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:25.040
striper vodka and red bull from 17. Um, all right.

752
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.950
The Williams Stella are toys logger. Okay.

753
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:35.120
William's team is to stellar our toast. I don't know how to say half the shit.

754
00:43:35.121 --> 00:43:38.870
The old dependable, I never heard of it, but doesn't win many races anymore.

755
00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:43.400
Still nothing beats turning up at a mate's house with the crate of Stella for a

756
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:47.200
day of drinking. Toro Rosso team would be sailor Jerry rum.

757
00:43:47.201 --> 00:43:48.290
This guy's a rum drinker.

758
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:52.490
When I started drinking rum and move to the red bull team not long after.

759
00:43:52.491 --> 00:43:55.730
All right, Molly, she didn't mix that with anything. The Haas,

760
00:43:55.731 --> 00:43:59.630
the American Formula One. Jack Daniel's single barrel one for the Americans.

761
00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:02.120
There you go. The only whiskey I really drink. Neat. Good man.

762
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:07.100
There's hope for you. Renaud [inaudible] team a bitter, uh,

763
00:44:07.101 --> 00:44:10.790
the classic British British drink, which has not served warm.

764
00:44:10.791 --> 00:44:15.260
It's served at cellular seller temperature. I don't even know what bitter is.

765
00:44:15.261 --> 00:44:19.310
McLaren Yeager Meister, not as good as it used to be,

766
00:44:19.311 --> 00:44:21.500
but I have some great nights drinking this stuff.

767
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.420
How the fuck anybody drinks more than one of those as beyond me. Uh,

768
00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.410
the soccer team, I don't know who that is. Bringing up the rear. It's cider.

769
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:35.820
Not even close to a goto drink, but I'm glad it's there. I fucking hate cider.

770
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:39.690
I love the podcast is for family and all the specials. Come back to the UK soon.

771
00:44:39.691 --> 00:44:42.270
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. I'll definitely be back there.

772
00:44:42.271 --> 00:44:45.210
Thank you for your Booz lineup. Um,

773
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.980
there was actually a couple interesting things in there.

774
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:48.790
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

775
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:53.070
<v 1>that's a brow vodka. I never heard of that. But you know,</v>

776
00:44:53.071 --> 00:44:55.200
I'm going to do yoga and pilates for the rest of my life.

777
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:59.760
I'm going to age like sting. Granted he started doing that Shit in his thirties.

778
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:03.510
Alright, number two. All right. Uh, um,

779
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:04.880
<v 0>okay.</v>

780
00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:07.280
<v 1>Question number two or whatever the fuck I'm doing this week.</v>

781
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.370
A Ron stone ball bag.

782
00:45:10.371 --> 00:45:13.940
Billy loved the podcast and love when you rip into the more on simply for being

783
00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:16.460
more on this, keep it up. That's why I trash myself so much.

784
00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:21.440
I wanted to throw down a Booz lineup, but for hockey. All right, here we go.

785
00:45:21.441 --> 00:45:24.170
We're going for more booze line and I feel like this is getting old people.

786
00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.020
I'm going to read this last one that's going to be it for the booze lineups and

787
00:45:27.021 --> 00:45:30.810
every once in a while we'll do it. Uh, we need some more overrated, underrated,

788
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.320
uh, center. The Cindy Krabi position.

789
00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:41.060
Miller genuine draft. I hate that beer. God bless you. Somebody's got a drink.

790
00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:43.400
It, you pay a little too much for anybody's,

791
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:46.010
your franchise players so you have no choice.

792
00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.530
Left wing is Weiser's black label,

793
00:45:49.531 --> 00:45:52.400
smooth dangles and sets everyone else up.

794
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:57.710
Right wing is Santiago 16 year Cuban run rum.

795
00:45:57.771 --> 00:45:58.730
Foreign player.

796
00:45:58.731 --> 00:46:02.090
Other teams are afraid to sign that plays his ass off every night,

797
00:46:02.091 --> 00:46:06.830
but take some stupid penalties. Demon number one, Jack Daniels, safe, gritty,

798
00:46:06.831 --> 00:46:11.420
defensive minded and d and You didn't break the cap. Hit Forum d man,

799
00:46:11.421 --> 00:46:15.320
two cores light never misses a game. Jumps up in the zone,

800
00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:19.430
but on the wrong end of the odd man rush is too often goalie.

801
00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:24.610
His crown royal hometown boy that gives you 65 starts as season and always gives

802
00:46:24.681 --> 00:46:26.720
you a chance. Partner would love that lineup.

803
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.100
I don't know about Miller genuine draft,

804
00:46:28.101 --> 00:46:30.640
but he'd love that you've finished with crown royal. Uh,

805
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:32.420
thanks and go fuck yourself. All right.

806
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:33.700
<v 0>Okay,</v>

807
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:38.500
<v 1>now we're on, now we're onto some fucking questions here. Uh,</v>

808
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:43.010
all right, the fucker. We, uh, Bill.

809
00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:49.780
What is this? This is more fucking football. I can't do this. This is,

810
00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:51.970
there's too many Booz lists here. What's this going to get?

811
00:46:51.971 --> 00:46:55.570
Boring because it requires me to really read out loud, which I'm not good at.

812
00:46:55.571 --> 00:46:57.550
All right. Fingerprinting students.

813
00:46:58.090 --> 00:46:58.923
<v 0>Okay.</v>

814
00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.900
<v 1>What in the fuck is happening to this world? Hey Billy Bo.</v>

815
00:47:01.901 --> 00:47:03.970
Baggins I'll try to keep this short.

816
00:47:03.971 --> 00:47:06.670
I just started college and in the dining halls,

817
00:47:06.671 --> 00:47:10.150
they now only use fingerprint scanners to let you in.

818
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.880
Cooking is not allowed in the dorms. So if you want to eat,

819
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:18.930
you have to give them your fingerprints. I'm not one of those.

820
00:47:18.931 --> 00:47:22.860
I got shipped slash free tee shirt people. But what else can I do?

821
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:27.180
Your thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Well,

822
00:47:27.181 --> 00:47:30.640
millennials, I think it's time. You guys fucking rebel.

823
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.440
You got to rebel against something here.

824
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:36.780
I'll go to subway.

825
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:42.020
Why do they need your fucking fingerprints and what are they going to do with

826
00:47:42.021 --> 00:47:44.210
them? Even if they're not going to do anything with them,

827
00:47:44.211 --> 00:47:45.920
they're going to hack into the your system.

828
00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:51.050
Somebody's going to hack into the system that's so fucking nuts.

829
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:58.420
That is legit. I honestly have to look up like how, how are,

830
00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:02.980
how do people justify taking your fucking fingerprints to give you a fucking

831
00:48:02.981 --> 00:48:03.880
slice of pizza?

832
00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:10.880
How do colleges justify taking students fingerprints?

833
00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:20.520
I love how the mainstream fucking pussy ass fucking corporate media never talks

834
00:48:20.521 --> 00:48:23.010
about this shit. They just sell people out.

835
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:28.080
They're just such follies fucking idiots screaming about Trump and Hillary and

836
00:48:28.081 --> 00:48:30.780
this is what they're doing to citizens of this fucking country.

837
00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:32.610
It's fucking unbelievable.

838
00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.960
Can I refuse to have my child fingerprinted at school?

839
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:43.010
Background of fingerprinting. I got, ah, Jesus. I almost lied to you guys.

840
00:48:43.011 --> 00:48:44.990
I got to read up on this like I'm actually gonna do this.

841
00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.960
Should schools fingerprint your kids?

842
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:55.980
Isn't that a big, what is this for? Let me guess. It's for our own protection.

843
00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.830
All they do is make gift bags for people that know how to go on the Internet and

844
00:49:01.831 --> 00:49:04.380
steal shit. Here it is.

845
00:49:04.381 --> 00:49:07.410
Here's the fucking social security number with the fingerprints,

846
00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:11.220
the home address, all the relatives. All in a nice, neat, nice,

847
00:49:11.221 --> 00:49:12.900
neat little fucking bag.

848
00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:13.993
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

849
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:19.450
<v 1>I can't fucking believe that this, these fucking jerk offs,</v>

850
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:23.860
these fucking jerk offs. Anybody Watches Fox and CNN as a fucking jerk off.

851
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:29.010
When was the last time they held the feet of of the the fucking constantly doing

852
00:49:29.381 --> 00:49:32.320
all of this shit at the end of the fire. When the fuck are they ever done that?

853
00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.513
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

854
00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.440
<v 1>Have they ever really gone off the pharmaceutical companies for starting a</v>

855
00:49:36.441 --> 00:49:37.430
heroin epidemic?

856
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:40.910
Had they ever really gone after Monsanto for fucking with the food supply?

857
00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.150
Have they ever really gone after bankers for what the fuck they were allowed to

858
00:49:44.151 --> 00:49:48.860
get away with 10 fucking years ago? Jesus fucking Christ.

859
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:52.460
You do one off colored fucking joke.

860
00:49:52.461 --> 00:49:55.690
They cover that more than these fucking insurance companies are probably gonna

861
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:59.300
fuck everybody over. Ah, now I'm upset.

862
00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:00.683
<v 0>Okay.</v>

863
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:03.130
<v 1>You know what I would do, sir?</v>

864
00:50:03.131 --> 00:50:07.810
I would fucking somehow go out of my own pocket and I would fucking eat down the

865
00:50:07.811 --> 00:50:12.220
street for fucking cheap the best I could.

866
00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:16.270
That's why you can still bring snacks. You can't cook.

867
00:50:16.271 --> 00:50:19.570
You could still have a fridge, right? I need a bowl of fucking cereal.

868
00:50:19.571 --> 00:50:21.900
I would eat a fucking bowl of cereal three days a week,

869
00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:25.060
three times a fucking day before I'd get those fucking cons.

870
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.460
You goddamn fingerprints. First of all, you,

871
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.980
all you're going to do is come out of college.

872
00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:33.620
You're going to be all these student loans and what sort of job as even to be

873
00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:37.490
there. You've got to give me a fingerprints to fuck these people. Fuck up.

874
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:40.223
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

875
00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:45.760
<v 1>You know, I dunno. You're not even allowed to fucking protest anymore.</v>

876
00:50:45.761 --> 00:50:47.140
You'd have to go to a certain section.

877
00:50:47.141 --> 00:50:50.440
You'd have to get a fucking permit to protest.

878
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.590
Do I guaran fucking tee you?

879
00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:58.150
I guarantee you the reason why they're taking your fingerprints is an added

880
00:50:58.151 --> 00:51:00.400
revenue stream and they're going to, you know, they're,

881
00:51:00.401 --> 00:51:02.620
they're going to fucking sell them to somebody else.

882
00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.040
All of those fucking people that take your fucking information.

883
00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:09.220
How are we getting weed seed safe? It's secure. It isn't safe and secure.

884
00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:13.600
What they've done now is they've made it a lot easier for these people that go

885
00:51:13.601 --> 00:51:18.601
in and steal shit rather than having to having to break into you personally.

886
00:51:18.761 --> 00:51:21.280
They just break into a company and they get like a flu or whatever,

887
00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:25.770
a couple thousand people a whack.

888
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:30.540
And then what kills me is after these cons, take your information,

889
00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:33.510
their system gets hacked into and you can, you sue them

890
00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:38.680
for putting your shit up there. It's fucking unreal.

891
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:43.150
Anyways, I just recently had, you know,

892
00:51:43.151 --> 00:51:46.450
a TV network that I worked for sent me a fucking letter.

893
00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:48.880
She go in there and go read it and say, uh, you know,

894
00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.590
unfortunately someone broke into our system and um, the,

895
00:51:53.591 --> 00:51:56.680
a lot of personal information was, might've been exposed.

896
00:51:57.550 --> 00:51:59.380
So all they're required to do after, it's like,

897
00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:01.270
why did you keep all that information?

898
00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:06.410
We need to go back to paper and file cabinets. People, I'm telling you,

899
00:52:06.411 --> 00:52:08.800
make these fucking pieces of shit. Look,

900
00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:12.620
cat burglar outfits have the flashlight in their mouth is they tried to pick the

901
00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:17.300
lock to go in. I'm sorry. I really just lost my shit there,

902
00:52:17.301 --> 00:52:18.210
but I feel like my,

903
00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.630
I know even though I didn't have all the information I needed to,

904
00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:23.120
to make a logical argument, I, I feel like I am right.

905
00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:27.020
I'm sniffing around something there. All right. Alcoholics anonymous.

906
00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:32.750
Hey Bill. I was in AA for roughly two years. If you thinking about attending,

907
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:36.530
I would suggest you visit a library and get the AA big book.

908
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:41.330
Sometimes they have a copy available. I would read it. Okay.

909
00:52:41.331 --> 00:52:44.480
Now you just asked me to do two things that are really difficult for me. One,

910
00:52:44.481 --> 00:52:47.850
going to a library and to finding a book and then three,

911
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:52.130
actually three reading it. Um, what else you want me to do? Dunk a basketball.

912
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:58.340
You're really getting outside the realm of what I do here. Uh,

913
00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:01.490
then I would also read the orange papers and online website,

914
00:53:01.491 --> 00:53:04.100
which attempts to debunk the AAA philosophy,

915
00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.730
attend a few meetings and get a feel for it. But honestly,

916
00:53:07.731 --> 00:53:10.430
I don't think you're an alcoholic from listening to your podcast.

917
00:53:10.431 --> 00:53:15.020
I just think you're a piss head a. You can put a cork in the bottle.

918
00:53:15.021 --> 00:53:18.710
I hear you sometimes beating yourself up when you've had three large pours. Oh,

919
00:53:18.711 --> 00:53:22.880
Jesus. Relaxed. That's not alcoholism. I love this guy.

920
00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:25.860
Sure. You're probably not a drinker,

921
00:53:25.861 --> 00:53:30.270
but it's all on a spectrum and you seem to be doing fine when you start

922
00:53:30.271 --> 00:53:34.320
drinking, cleaning gel mixed with fruit juice because it has alcohol in it.

923
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:37.710
Then we can talk. I've heard it all in AA and,

924
00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:42.480
and you don't qualify for the club in my humble opinion. Take it easy.

925
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:47.190
You're bald. Fuck. All right. Well thank you for the kind words sir. Um,

926
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.190
no, but it's also, it's not good for you.

927
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:53.010
I can tell you it's not to the level that I was drinking was not good for you.

928
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:58.560
Um, but I, and I also don't think AA is bad. If it works for you,

929
00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:00.600
then I think it's good. If it doesn't work for you,

930
00:54:00.601 --> 00:54:02.790
I don't think you then have to go out and debunk it.

931
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:07.470
What kind of a cut does that like alcohol and non alcoholic anonymous has helped

932
00:54:07.471 --> 00:54:11.010
so many fucking people. Let me look at the orange papers.

933
00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:15.540
The fuck's the asshole who just say everybody just always has to rain on

934
00:54:15.541 --> 00:54:19.240
somebody's parade. Orange papers here.

935
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:23.500
I just realized somebody might be fucking riding out this hurricane down in

936
00:54:23.501 --> 00:54:25.900
Florida listening to this podcast. If you still have power,

937
00:54:25.901 --> 00:54:29.650
if you get a generator and I just said rain. Rain on your fucking parade.

938
00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:35.710
Sorry. Um, what are the orange papers? Orange papers.

939
00:54:35.711 --> 00:54:38.200
I spelled orange wrong. I put two ends in there.

940
00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:42.480
I don't know why I said O r n a n g orange papers. AA.

941
00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:43.450
Here we go.

942
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:50.650
Orange papers recovering from recovery anti a sites such as orange papers.

943
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:56.680
All right,

944
00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:59.390
now this is just going to be another website that just hijacked the whole

945
00:54:59.391 --> 00:55:03.680
fucking thing so I can't get to it. Where are the original orange papers?

946
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:08.090
Original. Original, please, please. Can I get the original?

947
00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:13.563
I can't find it.

948
00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.270
I cannot fucking find it. What the fuck? Come on man. All right.

949
00:55:20.271 --> 00:55:24.350
I just clicked on this page and I see a pig picture of a monkey leaving.

950
00:55:24.351 --> 00:55:26.240
AA staying sober. All right. Here we go.

951
00:55:26.241 --> 00:55:29.900
For some of the suffering alcoholic in those unhappy in AA.

952
00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:31.203
<v 0>Okay.</v>

953
00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:33.400
<v 1>All right. Let's see what they bitch about here.</v>

954
00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:39.350
For the suffering alcoholic and those unhappy in AA,

955
00:55:39.351 --> 00:55:43.370
alcoholics anonymous has over 2 million participants globally. That's it.

956
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:48.020
It is a friendly and welcoming organization with many caring, helpful members.

957
00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.380
AA offers companionship, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

958
00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:53.540
If you think you have a drinking problem and haven't tried AA,

959
00:55:53.541 --> 00:55:57.260
stop reading this essay and go to a meeting. However,

960
00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:59.930
growing number of options is solely because I didn't want to fucking read all of

961
00:55:59.931 --> 00:56:03.080
this shit. All right. I'll take your word for it evidently.

962
00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:04.693
<v 0>Okay.</v>

963
00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:07.030
<v 1>Look at Eli stepping up in the pocket.</v>

964
00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.760
What's the score? Yeah.

965
00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:12.413
<v 0>Okay.</v>

966
00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:19.830
<v 1>16 to three, seven minutes to go. Did he just throw a pick?</v>

967
00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:23.860
Who knows? All right.

968
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:29.170
<v 0>Wife working out with Ex. Oh, Jesus. Fucking Christ.</v>

969
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:34.780
If I saw that at the beginning of a fucking porno, I'd be like, oh my God,

970
00:56:34.781 --> 00:56:38.290
can we come up with a fucking less cliched scenario?

971
00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:43.510
Okay.

972
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:47.680
<v 1>Um, okay. Hey, the ability read sack, love your podcast. Love F is for family.</v>

973
00:56:47.681 --> 00:56:51.100
Can't wait for season three. I wanted your advice on something.

974
00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:52.180
Here's the story.

975
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:57.070
I got married about a year ago and me and my lovely wife moved to La right after

976
00:56:57.071 --> 00:56:59.530
the wedding because she had a great job opportunity.

977
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:04.030
She had lived in La a few years ago prior to meeting me and when she was living

978
00:57:04.031 --> 00:57:07.900
here, she had a fling with some douche chief private fitness trainer.

979
00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:12.850
Both of them viewed marriage as a stupid concept and they made a pact that when

980
00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:17.230
they'll get married, other people they'd meet up and fuck,

981
00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.670
I don't believe a fucking word of this.

982
00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:26.580
I don't believe a fucking word of this. This is too stupid.

983
00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:29.600
They made it back.

984
00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:33.830
When when they'll get married to other people,

985
00:57:33.831 --> 00:57:35.120
they'd meet up and fuck.

986
00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:39.080
I mean that definitely sounds like an la conversation in a gym.

987
00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.230
I'll continue reading. Uh,

988
00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:46.070
so as soon as she changed her relationship status status to married on Facebook,

989
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:51.430
that guy sent her a bunch of messages which were sexual and pretty much offend.

990
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:56.480
Oh, offered to take her up on the agreement and fuck.

991
00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:59.720
She didn't respond, but she did tell me about it,

992
00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:05.110
but I didn't lose my shit in remain calm in the last few weeks.

993
00:58:05.271 --> 00:58:09.250
She told me she's looking for a way to get in shape and she said that the do.

994
00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:13.340
She had offered her private workout sessions in exchange for help in his

995
00:58:13.341 --> 00:58:15.350
business. She's an accountant.

996
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:21.430
She said that because private workout sessions are expensive and he's very good

997
00:58:21.651 --> 00:58:25.130
at what he does. This is a great opportunity that would save us some money.

998
00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:33.210
She said she made it clear to him that she's happily married and nothing is

999
00:58:33.431 --> 00:58:36.400
going to happen and he understood completely.

1000
00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:40.810
She asked me if it bothers me and I not wanting to look like the insecure,

1001
00:58:40.811 --> 00:58:44.200
jealous type, all my God, you fucking dude.

1002
00:58:44.201 --> 00:58:47.020
I'm telling you these fucking women are in guys heads.

1003
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:51.110
All of this bullshit that you've seen on fucking TV,

1004
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:54.620
all of these fucking women fucking playing the victim all the time.

1005
00:58:54.621 --> 00:58:59.621
All of this fucking coverage of just what guys do to women has now every fucking

1006
00:59:00.351 --> 00:59:03.200
guy has his balls in his fucking back pocket.

1007
00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:05.900
And it's just like, well,

1008
00:59:05.901 --> 00:59:08.550
I don't want to be the guy that fucking makes you uncomfortable. Okay.

1009
00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:11.090
What would she fucking tolerate this from you?

1010
00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:16.080
You don't want to look into, that's not being in secure, sir.

1011
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:21.200
That's common fucking sense. So he said,

1012
00:59:21.201 --> 00:59:22.190
honestly, honey,

1013
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:24.890
<v 0>I trust you. I want what's best for you.</v>

1014
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:28.750
And tried actually to do that. Okay.

1015
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.140
<v 1>My question is, do you think she's trustworthy? Possible, but that guy isn't.</v>

1016
00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:34.573
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

1017
00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:37.370
<v 1>And that guy's just drawn her in because he wants to fuck her.</v>

1018
00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:39.353
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1019
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:42.590
<v 1>Um, she does have a history of cheating on her exes,</v>

1020
00:59:44.310 --> 00:59:47.970
but so do I. We both been happily married in our sex life is great,

1021
00:59:47.971 --> 00:59:51.450
but still the doubt and insecurity about that issue. This issue exists.

1022
00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:55.260
Love to hear your take on this. Can't wait for the new hour's special. Thanks.

1023
00:59:55.261 --> 00:59:59.580
And Go fuck yourself, buddy, buddy. Yet no, no,

1024
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:04.770
no fucking way. No fucking way. Work some extra hours.

1025
01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:06.753
<v 0>You know,</v>

1026
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:12.770
<v 1>I would actually be willing to believe that she's going over there thinking</v>

1027
01:00:12.771 --> 01:00:15.200
she's not going to do anything, but that guy's going to seducer.

1028
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:20.210
That's what's going to happen. They already banged. They're already, you know,

1029
01:00:20.211 --> 01:00:21.920
physically like, you know,

1030
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:23.150
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1031
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:25.340
<v 1>You know, the boundaries are not going to be there.</v>

1032
01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:31.080
And I'm telling you that that's not a good situation and you're not in,

1033
01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:33.060
you're not in secure it all,

1034
01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:35.873
<v 0>you know.</v>

1035
01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:40.050
<v 1>And so what if you are, that's a legitimate,</v>

1036
01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:43.180
that's a legitimate feeling, that full fucking thing.

1037
01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:46.120
Let's do stupid fucking tee shirts. I saw this,

1038
01:00:46.121 --> 01:00:48.010
there's some woman was wearing this fucking tee shirt.

1039
01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:49.930
I told you what that one is back in the summertime.

1040
01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:50.980
It said something like [inaudible]

1041
01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.070
a real man is excited by a strong woman. A boy is like whatever,

1042
01:00:57.071 --> 01:01:01.120
intimidated or something like that. So there's some musical, oh, I want to be,

1043
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:04.390
I want to be considered a strong man. I want a cookie.

1044
01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.600
I was reading that rolling stone where they had the, the,

1045
01:01:09.601 --> 01:01:12.360
the actress that was playing, uh, played wonder woman.

1046
01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.200
And I was all excited to read the article. And the first quote that they had,

1047
01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:19.530
the, they said, are you a feminist? She goes, yes, I'm a feminist.

1048
01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:22.680
Everyone should be a feminist because if you're not a feminist,

1049
01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.000
then you're a sexist. Right.

1050
01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:25.780
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1051
01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:28.030
<v 1>And I like bursting out laughing thinking like, well,</v>

1052
01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.760
it all depends on what your definition is.

1053
01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:32.900
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1054
01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:35.870
<v 1>yeah. That's what's funny about these Hollywood people out here. I swear to God,</v>

1055
01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:39.980
they sound just like the Fox News, right? People did the exact, that you know,

1056
01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:44.690
old Zara is zero tolerance. You think the way I go. If you do not,

1057
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.390
then you are this. Um,

1058
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:52.870
like there's no clear cut definition of feminism any more than there is of like

1059
01:01:53.871 --> 01:01:56.090
what makes like, you know,

1060
01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:00.190
that's real rock music and then somebody's always like Dutch, not rock dishes,

1061
01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.530
Rock Dad's bullshit. It's the same thing with like family.

1062
01:02:03.531 --> 01:02:08.210
Like everyone was a feminist the way my wife is, which, you know,

1063
01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:12.050
in all fairness, this actress that played one woman could be,

1064
01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:16.080
I don't fucking know. But just to say like that, it's just such a, I mean,

1065
01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:17.610
granted, it's a fucking interview.

1066
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:22.200
They're trying get people fucking worked up to read the fucking thing.

1067
01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:26.160
Maybe it was taken out of context. Maybe she said other shit,

1068
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:29.310
but just the way that's presented, you know,

1069
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:31.650
rolling stone is just fucking insufferable though.

1070
01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:32.930
It's just fucking insufferable.

1071
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:36.750
The way they handled Obama with like kid gloves and if you're a fucking

1072
01:02:36.751 --> 01:02:38.970
Republican, they stick your head in the fire.

1073
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:41.850
Now I'm not saying they shouldn't stick these Republicans head in the fire.

1074
01:02:41.851 --> 01:02:45.580
I mean they're the fucking, you know, the, the,

1075
01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.780
they bought and paid for it that level. Right. Am I nuts?

1076
01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:51.910
And I also thought by Obama was too,

1077
01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:56.680
judging by the $69 million worth of tour dates he has coming up,

1078
01:02:57.310 --> 01:02:59.110
giving speeches to all these fucking rich people.

1079
01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:04.380
Guy Just bought a $10 million fucking house. It's fucking unreal.

1080
01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:07.110
And they don't say shit. All they do is show him playing,

1081
01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.970
highlight and fucking go and kayaking and parasailing. Like, isn't it

1082
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:13.490
<v 4>cool? I carefully don't call. He is.</v>

1083
01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.633
<v 2>Um,</v>

1084
01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:20.820
<v 1>anyways, by the way, rolling stone. Is Trump the worst president ever?</v>

1085
01:03:20.821 --> 01:03:23.430
I haven't noticed. He, it's not like you haven't fucking written it.

1086
01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:26.220
It's just like, I don't even read the fucking article.

1087
01:03:26.221 --> 01:03:29.820
It's like I understood your point of view. The first 90 articles,

1088
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:33.560
there's so much other shit you could be writing about. You know what I mean?

1089
01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:35.120
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1090
01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.610
<v 1>good fucking Lord. Like my,</v>

1091
01:03:37.611 --> 01:03:40.670
why can't you make fun of like extreme liberals every once in a while?

1092
01:03:40.671 --> 01:03:45.110
Throw me a fucking curve ball, something. Ah, Jesus Christ.

1093
01:03:45.111 --> 01:03:49.760
I'd fucking need to go buy some fucking tampons here. I'm sorry.

1094
01:03:49.761 --> 01:03:50.720
You know what it, when it happened,

1095
01:03:50.721 --> 01:03:53.720
you know what the funny stopped was the fingerprint of these fucking poor kids,

1096
01:03:53.721 --> 01:03:56.510
these four kids are going to college, they're getting it all in fucking debt.

1097
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:58.390
Alright.

1098
01:03:58.390 --> 01:04:03.290
And these colleges are acting like they've adapted to how quickly the real world

1099
01:04:03.291 --> 01:04:05.090
is changing. And I don't think they are.

1100
01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.440
And that's why these kids are coming out.

1101
01:04:06.441 --> 01:04:08.660
It's like they're coming out with degrees in like fucking,

1102
01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:13.670
I don't know what the fucking, uh, churning butter essentially,

1103
01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.390
and then they can't find a fucking job. You know?

1104
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:19.521
I don't know.

1105
01:04:19.521 --> 01:04:22.300
I remember like always reading up about all these fucking amazing musicians.

1106
01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.360
They would go to Berkeley and they would, they would never come.

1107
01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:28.120
Like the guys that went out and seen the guys that went out and did shit,

1108
01:04:28.121 --> 01:04:32.970
they never finished. Like they will like this, this whole be in here.

1109
01:04:32.971 --> 01:04:37.830
I got what I needed. Now I got to get the fuck Outta here. And um,

1110
01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.690
I'm not saying drop out of college,

1111
01:04:39.691 --> 01:04:43.930
but I really feel like a [inaudible] if that voice is screaming in your head and

1112
01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:47.920
you, you fucking have some good ideas. Why take on the last year a debt,

1113
01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:50.650
the last, you know why? Because your parents want you to,

1114
01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:53.723
<v 2>um,</v>

1115
01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:57.610
<v 1>I dunno what, because Bill Gates dropped out a few drop out. I'm just saying,</v>

1116
01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:01.810
you know what the fuck I ended up doing.

1117
01:05:01.811 --> 01:05:04.510
I didn't need to go to college at all this fucking village student loan,

1118
01:05:04.511 --> 01:05:05.344
all that debt.

1119
01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:09.940
And I left and I immediately went down to a comedy club and started doing shit

1120
01:05:09.941 --> 01:05:10.774
jokes.

1121
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:13.503
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1122
01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:18.070
<v 1>Um, anyways,</v>

1123
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:21.670
<v 3>we got to end on something positive here. Uh, please go to that Steve.</v>

1124
01:05:21.671 --> 01:05:25.160
And I'll add the Ronnie James thing. Uh,

1125
01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:29.200
I'm going to post that the bowl for Ronnie. Ronnie James,

1126
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.110
what a fucking voice and what a great guy too, man. I never met the guy,

1127
01:05:32.111 --> 01:05:35.580
but like Paul, his interviews, he could have been more down to Earth a,

1128
01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:39.820
once again, it's gonna be at pins, P I n z bowling center, one, two, six,

1129
01:05:39.821 --> 01:05:43.000
five five Ventura Boulevard A. It's gonna be a bunch of rock stars.

1130
01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:47.560
They're a bunch of comedians. All bowling raising money for, uh,

1131
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:51.040
I don't even know what the, what is the cause here? Vinyl.

1132
01:05:51.041 --> 01:05:55.300
Ronnie died of cancer. So imagine it's that, right? Oh, Ronnie,

1133
01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:00.370
Ronnie James Dio. Stand up and shout a cancer. Fun.

1134
01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:04.870
There you go. Stand up and shout right. Um,

1135
01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:09.300
so there's something positive for you and I believe it's October 6th. All right.

1136
01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:12.850
I will be tweeting that out and I am trying to get back onto Instagram.

1137
01:06:12.851 --> 01:06:14.740
I haven't posted on Instagram and forever.

1138
01:06:14.741 --> 01:06:18.970
I think I have to create an entirely new account because I keep saying I forgot

1139
01:06:18.971 --> 01:06:20.710
my password. Please email it to me.

1140
01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:23.560
And they haven't been able or I haven't been able,

1141
01:06:23.561 --> 01:06:26.650
I can't find the fucking thing. I'm so that's it.

1142
01:06:26.651 --> 01:06:30.160
That's the podcast for this week. Congratulations to everybody. One week, one,

1143
01:06:30.161 --> 01:06:34.930
congratulations to all football fans. That is football season.

1144
01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:38.740
Um, my favorite fucking thing happened this weekend, by the way,

1145
01:06:38.741 --> 01:06:40.060
when I was in the Alabama theater,

1146
01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:43.700
there was this fucking guy in the front row and he had his middle aged too.

1147
01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:46.780
We had his cell phone on, it's a middle aged guy and I'm like, dude,

1148
01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:50.320
he you the show you recording the show. And he kind of was like, no. He goes,

1149
01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:50.981
he goes,

1150
01:06:50.981 --> 01:06:53.830
I'm looking at the scores because it was Saturday night and he wanted to see how

1151
01:06:53.831 --> 01:06:57.780
the other SCC teams were doing. And I go, well, what's what,

1152
01:06:57.781 --> 01:07:01.020
what are you watching? He was watching the Georgia game. I go with your Alabama.

1153
01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:05.170
The fuck do you give a shit about Georgia four? He goes there in the SCC. I go,

1154
01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.600
they're not gonna Catch Ya. They got that decent quarterback though.

1155
01:07:07.601 --> 01:07:12.070
I don't know. Then the crowd kind of dies down and this guy in the back goes,

1156
01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:16.880
he says to the guy with the phone, he just goes, excuse me sir, sir? He goes, a,

1157
01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:21.710
what'd he say? Oh fuck. I'm going to put you the joke. Auburn,

1158
01:07:21.711 --> 01:07:25.650
Clemson, whoever the fuck Auburn was playing, it was like,

1159
01:07:25.651 --> 01:07:28.170
I wasn't even there anymore. He just asked for a score.

1160
01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:29.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1161
01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.390
<v 3>Oh God. What a fucking great setup.</v>

1162
01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:33.930
It would have been such a killer story if I could have fucking remembered

1163
01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:40.730
Auburn score. What do we got here? That's right.

1164
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:45.380
They played Clemson. Yeah. He goes, excuse me sir. Auburn. Clemson.

1165
01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:46.880
That's all he had to say.

1166
01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:51.650
The guy sits right on his phone looking to give him the fucking score. Um,

1167
01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.000
I dunno. It's a great fucking place. Don't sleep on the south. Alright.

1168
01:07:56.210 --> 01:08:00.440
If you really think about it, you're states just as racist. Okay. That's it.

1169
01:08:00.441 --> 01:08:04.760
Go fuck yourselves. Um, I don't know what else to tell Ya.

1170
01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:09.170
Check in on you on Thursday. I hope. Um, you know,

1171
01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:12.740
my hope is a little damage in Florida as humanly possible and that's all you can

1172
01:08:12.741 --> 01:08:15.620
fucking hope for. And um, you know,

1173
01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:18.440
while you guys make fun of people driving electric cars, I don't know.

1174
01:08:18.441 --> 01:08:21.770
Now you know what the fuck I drive gas combustion cars.

1175
01:08:21.771 --> 01:08:24.200
So I'm not fucking looking down on you, but you know,

1176
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:26.870
I don't know what the battery does in the end.

1177
01:08:26.871 --> 01:08:30.380
When you drive the Tesla into the fucking ocean, can you recycle the battery?

1178
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:31.490
I have no idea.

1179
01:08:31.491 --> 01:08:34.190
But I'll tell you what that guys doing over there at that Tesla company.

1180
01:08:34.191 --> 01:08:38.660
I like it. I like it. I just wished the car could look a little more meaner.

1181
01:08:39.190 --> 01:08:41.930
It looks great from the back. Looks great from the side. The front.

1182
01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:43.640
I don't know what it is.

1183
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1184
01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:48.910
<v 3>Just can't quite get into it. But uh, I know it's a fucking amazing car,</v>

1185
01:08:48.911 --> 01:08:50.710
but then they SUV is fucking cool, Huh?

1186
01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:53.920
The Lamborghini doors opening up a plus.

1187
01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:57.220
It's also a great way to win the war in the Middle East, you know?

1188
01:08:58.350 --> 01:08:59.110
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1189
01:08:59.110 --> 01:09:00.960
<v 3>Drive an electric car. You ride a bicycle,</v>

1190
01:09:00.961 --> 01:09:04.110
anything you do to use less fucking fossil fuels,

1191
01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:08.400
fucks those people over over there and they don't have money to funnel through

1192
01:09:08.401 --> 01:09:13.170
the moss to give to the terrorist. And there you go. And all of a sudden, oh,

1193
01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:16.020
Jimmy, crack corns out of fireworks, right? Oh,

1194
01:09:16.021 --> 01:09:19.600
I just saw the Middle East or problem or the Middle East problem.

1195
01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:21.780
Not Middle Eastern. I don't have problems with Middle Eastern people

1196
01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:27.180
and this is why I don't hold off this. All right. Go fuck yourselves people.

1197
01:09:27.181 --> 01:09:28.200
I'll talk to you on Thursday.
