this pronghorn migration the first thing

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279
this pronghorn migration the first thing
 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.609

I had to do is walk with the migration

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619
I had to do is walk with the migration
 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.320
I had to do is walk with the migration
to figure out where they were going

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330
to figure out where they were going
 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.720
to figure out where they were going
then I started to set up camera tracks

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
then I started to set up camera tracks
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.089
then I started to set up camera tracks
which are cameras that I would set up in

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
which are cameras that I would set up in
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.130
which are cameras that I would set up in
front of the migration and then the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
front of the migration and then the
 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.660
front of the migration and then the
animals would walk through and take

animals would walk through and take
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.270
animals would walk through and take
their own picture the most exciting part

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
their own picture the most exciting part
