00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.220
with Carnegie Mellon are consistent with
our values if their values are not

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:58.230
our values if their values are not
 

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.230
our values if their values are not
consistent with our values I think we

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240
consistent with our values I think we
 

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.480
consistent with our values I think we
need to think through a process and

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:02.490
need to think through a process and
 

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.760
need to think through a process and
again this is not instantaneous this is

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:04.770
again this is not instantaneous this is
 

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.350
again this is not instantaneous this is
not immediate there are serious

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360
not immediate there are serious
 

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.900
not immediate there are serious

and had them come over to the residence

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:03.270
and had them come over to the residence
 

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.330

food for them and we asked some of them

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:12.390
food for them and we asked some of them
 

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.690

to stay as long as they wanted

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:14.700
to stay as long as they wanted
 

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.160
to stay as long as they wanted
because there was a lot of food left and

because there was a lot of food left and
 

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.680
because there was a lot of food left and
they said no we have to go because we

about infrastructure will anything go

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:20.580
about infrastructure will anything go
 

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.370
about infrastructure will anything go
toward engineering buildings and

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:22.380
toward engineering buildings and
 

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.770
toward engineering buildings and
equipment but I imagine there others who

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:24.780
equipment but I imagine there others who
 

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.720

want to know more broadly how this works

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:26.730
want to know more broadly how this works
 

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:30.560
want to know more broadly how this works
so I can address that in two three

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:30.570
so I can address that in two three
 

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:35.330
so I can address that in two three
different ways of course the invention

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:35.340

that led to the litigation settlement

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:39.590
that led to the litigation settlement
 

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.490
that led to the litigation settlement
came out of the College of Engineering

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:42.500
came out of the College of Engineering
 

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.040
came out of the College of Engineering
so this is one of the reasons why it was

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:46.050
so this is one of the reasons why it was
 

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.900
so this is one of the reasons why it was
important that the ad hoc committee that

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:47.910
important that the ad hoc committee that
 

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.390
important that the ad hoc committee that
was shared by the Provost also included

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:50.400
was shared by the Provost also included
 

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.670
was shared by the Provost also included
the Dean of engineering so that he can

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:52.680
the Dean of engineering so that he can
 

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.970
the Dean of engineering so that he can
represent his faculty and staff and

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:55.980
represent his faculty and staff and
 

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.450
represent his faculty and staff and
students in the process itself and this

students in the process itself and this
 

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.670
students in the process itself and this
group went with a large group of cohorts

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:01.680
group went with a large group of cohorts
 

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.930

and in terms of scholarships fellowships

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:31.310
and in terms of scholarships fellowships
 

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:34.630
and in terms of scholarships fellowships
the other unanimous recommendation was

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640
the other unanimous recommendation was
 

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.920
the other unanimous recommendation was
also that a significant fraction of the

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:37.930
also that a significant fraction of the
 

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.630
also that a significant fraction of the
resources that we set aside not just for

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640
resources that we set aside not just for
 

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.370
resources that we set aside not just for
engineering but for the whole university

important because it's it's top of mind
 

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:53.090
