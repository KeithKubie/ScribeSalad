00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.780
We're asked to identify the
percent, amount, and base in

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.640
this problem.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.320
And they ask us, 150 is
25% of what number?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.650
They don't ask us to solve it,
but it's too tempting.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.800
So what I want to do is first
answer this question that

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.390
they're not even asking
us to solve.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.140
But first, I want to answer
this question.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.090
And then we can think about what
the percent, the amount,

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.620
and the base is, because
those are just words.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.680
Those are just definitions.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.330
The important thing is
to be able to solve a

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.620
problem like this.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:36.640
So they're saying 150 is
25% of what number?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:44.030
Or another way to view this,
150 is 25% of some number.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:52.690
So let's let x, x is equal
to the number that

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.080
150 is 25% of, right?

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.150
That's what we need
to figure out.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.470
150 is 25% of what number?

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.920
That number right here
we're seeing is x.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.270
So that tells us that if we
start with x, and if we were

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:16.790
to take 25% of x, you could
imagine, that's the same thing

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.500
as multiplying it by 25%, which
is the same thing as

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.420
multiplying it, if you
view it as a decimal,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.920
times 0.25 times x.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.230
These two statements
are identical.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.290
So if you start with that
number, you take 25% of it, or

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:41.870
you multiply it by 0.25, that
is going to be equal to 150.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.780
150 is 25% of this number.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.760
And then you can solve for x.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.280
So let's just start with
this one over here.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.110
Let me just write it separately,
so you understand

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.780
what I'm doing.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.190
0.25 times some number
is equal to 150.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.910
Now there's two ways
we can do this.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.780
We can divide both sides of this
equation by 0.25, or if

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.930
you recognize that four quarters
make a dollar, you

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.230
could say, let's multiply both
sides of this equation by 4.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.200
You could do either one.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.550
I'll do the first, because
that's how we normally do

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.370
algebra problems like this.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:28.590
So let's just multiply
both by 0.25.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.050
That will just be an x.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.040
And then the right-hand side
will be 150 divided by 0.25.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.790
And the reason why I wanted to
is really it's just good

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.420
practice dividing
by a decimal.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.620
So let's do that.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.090
So we want to figure out what
150 divided by 0.25 is.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.610
And we've done this before.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.590
When you divide by a decimal,
what you can do is you can

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.950
make the number that you're
dividing into the other

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.660
number, you can turn this into
a whole number by essentially

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.980
shifting the decimal
two to the right.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.715
But if you do that for the
number in the denominator, you

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:00.700
also have to do that
to the numerator.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.150
So right now you can view
this as 150.00.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.360
If you multiply 0.25 times
100, you're shifting the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.070
decimal two to the right.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.220
Then you'd also have to do
that with 150, so then it

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.290
becomes 15,000.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.250
Shift it two to the right.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.470
So our decimal place
becomes like this.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.510
So 150 divided by 0.25
is the same thing as

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.840
15,000 divided by 25.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.520
And let's just work it
out really fast.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.960
So 25 doesn't go into 1, doesn't
go into 15, it goes

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.650
into 150, what is that?

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.020
Six times, right?

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.890
If it goes into 100 four
times, then it goes

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.290
into 150 six times.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.290
6 times 0.25 is-- or actually,
this is now a 25.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.170
We've shifted the decimal.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.920
This decimal is sitting
right over there.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.990
So 6 times 25 is 150.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.190
You subtract.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.270
You get no remainder.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.390
Bring down this 0 right here.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.180
25 goes into 0 zero times.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.990
0 times 25 is 0.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.810
Subtract.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.640
No remainder.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.620
Bring down this last 0.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.140
25 goes into 0 zero times.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.710
0 times 25 is 0.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.440
Subtract.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.640
No remainder.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.840
So 150 divided by 0.25
is equal to 600.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.470
And you might have been able
to do that in your head,

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.220
because when we were at this
point in our equation, 0.25x

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.790
is equal to 150, you could
have just multiplied both

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.750
sides of this equation
times 4.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.170
4 times 0.25 is the same
thing as 4 times

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.190
1/4, which is a whole.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.860
And 4 times 150 is 600.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.790
So you would have gotten
it either way.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.390
And this makes total sense.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.710
If 150 is 25% of some number,
that means 150 should be 1/4

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.310
of that number.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.690
It should be a lot smaller than
that number, and it is.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.710
150 is 1/4 of 600.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.070
Now let's answer their
actual question.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.950
Identify the percent.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.800
Well, that looks like 25%,
that's the percent.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.820
The amount and the base
in this problem.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.990
And based on how they're wording
it, I assume amount

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.330
means when you take the 25% of
the base, so they're saying

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.335
that the amount-- as my best
sense of it-- is that the

00:05:14.335 --> 00:05:24.540
amount is equal to the percent
times the base.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.130
Let me do the base in green.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.410
So the base is the number you're
taking the percent of.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.650
The amount is the quantity
that that percentage

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:33.610
represents.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.670
So here we already saw
the percent is 25%.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.960
That's the percent.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:52.910
The number that we're taking
25% of, or the base, is x.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.620
The value of it is 600.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.680
We figured it out.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.180
And the amount is 150.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.980
This right here is the amount.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.350
The amount is 150.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.630
150 is 25% of the
base, of 600.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.610
The important thing is how
you solve this problem.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.950
The words themselves, you know,
those are all really

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.460
just definitions.
