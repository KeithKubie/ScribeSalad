00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.600
&gt;&gt; DR GRIME: In 2002 mathematicians
published a new method to test for primes

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:17.500
and finally they found a fast way that was
100%. This is now one of the latest things.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.420
So this is called that AKS test. And it's
pretty much a very similar idea to what we

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.940
did with the Fermat Little Theorem. It's very
similar to that. And the test is, that if

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.940
you've got a number p and we are going to
do this. We're going to take (x - 1)

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:45.109
to the power p and then we're going to 
subtract (x^p - 1). Alright.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:51.699
So it's a polynomial, I'll show you an example
in a second. If all coefficients are divisible

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:58.039
by p then p is prime. And if they're not it's
composite. it's 100% this test. I'll show

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:04.690
you an example. let's take (x - 1)³.
Yeah, let's do that. (x - 1)³.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.360
&gt;&gt; BRADY: So 3 is the number we're testing?

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.979
&gt;&gt; DR GRIME: Yeah, 3 is the number we're testing.
We know it's a prime don't we? But we're going

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.979
to test it. We're going to take (x - 1)³
and so that's, to make it explicit,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.300
(x - 1) by (x - 1) by (x - 1). OK. Multiply
this out, you get a polynomial called

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:35.200
x³ - 3x² + 3x - 1. That's what you get.
Now you're subtracting the x³,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.479
I'm told- I'm told to that and you're, what's
that, adding on the 1. So these, these dissapear.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.500
This says these numbers are divisible by 3.
If it is divisible by 3, 3 is the number we're

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.000
testing, then it is a prime. If it's not divisible
by 3, it is not a prime. And that's our 100%

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.490
test. So this was really important, this was
huge news when they published this. 2002 they

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.410
published it and it was huge news because
it was a fast test as well. Or it could be

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.180
made in to a fast test. There's a little thing
they do just to make it a bit faster because

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.190
it does get quite difficult, these polynomials
get quite nasty. Just to make it a little

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.190
bit faster what they did is (x - a)^p  minus (x^p - a), so 'a'

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.380
is a number like we had before. And they said
this was equal to p lots of something plus,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.170
there you go, a little (x^r - 1) multiplied
by something. So that's not quite the same,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.040
that's a little bit different, this was actually
faster to work with, it makes a faster calculation.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.940
And for this version you need to test a few
candidates for 'a' here. You test a few.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.790
And if it passes that test then you can determine
that p, which is what we're trying to work

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.150
out. Try and work that out, you can find it's
prime or not.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.270
Mathematics is done all day, you know, every
day. New mathematics is coming out all the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:19.000
time. And only, well I say recently, 12 years
ago they finally solved the problem.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.900
It is still faster to do a Fermat test. it's still
faster to do this, but this is not outrageously

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.230
slow anymore. This doesn't take us to the
end of the universe anymore. So we can actually

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.230
run this test. It's slower than the Fermat
test, but 100% true.
