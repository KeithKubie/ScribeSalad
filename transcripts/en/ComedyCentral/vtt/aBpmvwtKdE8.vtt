(electronic music)

00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:08.014
- [Narrator] Previously, on Bro-Dependent.

00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:08.847
- Heh!

00:00:08.847 --> 00:00:09.680
- Fuck!

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.652
- I spent last night in your sister

00:00:11.652 --> 00:00:13.749
and I fucking cried when I came, dude.

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:15.788
- I've watched her fuck
up, like, 100 guys.

00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:16.962
- Do I smell weed?

00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:18.070
- [Group] Fuck you!

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.473
- Can't you see we're, like, fighting?

00:00:19.473 --> 00:00:20.625
- Zac, are we fighting?

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:21.694
Owww!

00:00:21.694 --> 00:00:23.749
- Yeah, I guess we are, fuck you!

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:24.826
- Fuck you, dude.

00:00:24.826 --> 00:00:25.936
- No dude, I mean it.

00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:27.194
Like in a mean way.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:28.027
Fuck you.

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:33.090
So I was like, "We are so happy."

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.304
and Anderson was like, "I
hate that you two are happy."

00:00:36.304 --> 00:00:37.852
and then he tried to punch me

00:00:37.852 --> 00:00:39.840
but I blocked his fist with my hand.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.800
I just like, crushed it
in my hand and threw it

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.699
off and got him down on the ground.

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:45.653
- Huh.

00:00:45.653 --> 00:00:47.022
- Isn't that crazy?

00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:49.997
Like I didn't think, like, I
would have that much strength,

00:00:49.997 --> 00:00:52.841
or, like, agility for that
matter, but, like, I did.

00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:55.375
- And Zac was just like,
"Our friendship, means

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:56.208
nothing to me."

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:57.498
and I was like, "Dude don't say that."

00:00:57.498 --> 00:00:59.830
and he was like, "Bam, Butterfly Knife."

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.965
and I was like, "Oh, fuck."

00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:02.853
and he came at me and I was like, "kafwa!"

00:01:02.853 --> 00:01:06.644
and I disarmed him, cause
I didn't want to hurt him.

00:01:06.644 --> 00:01:08.001
That's pretty fucked.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.450
- Right, and what does that have to do

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.331
with you working here at Lids?

00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:15.776
- Uhhh, You're asking me
about my experience and

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:17.848
that was, like, my most recent experience.

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:21.186
- Nah, I was talking about
your retail experience.

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:22.194
- Ohhh.

00:01:22.194 --> 00:01:24.409
(laughs)

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.992

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:33.377
Yeah, no, I have no retail experience.

00:01:33.377 --> 00:01:36.449
Nor any job experience of any kind.

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:37.282
- Hey, I know you man.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.525

Okay, Mark you're up.

And, we can hear you in the next room.

00:02:04.378 --> 00:02:06.740
- Oh, really, can you?

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.407
- You mind just keeping it down?

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.050

- Yeah, that's good.

00:02:18.568 --> 00:02:20.469
- Oh, Babe, I was thinking
like, since I'm over

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.219
at your place all the time,
anyway, maybe I could,

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.698
like, bring some stuff over?

00:02:24.698 --> 00:02:28.120
- Awwwww, or you could
just put an overnight

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.690
bag in your car.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.269
- Oh yeah, yeah, that's a great idea too.

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.102
- Yeah.

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:35.358
- Well I'm sorry man.

00:02:35.358 --> 00:02:37.275
I can't give you a job.

00:02:38.416 --> 00:02:39.280
- What?

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.777
- I know, I know, it's a real bummer.

00:02:41.777 --> 00:02:44.069
I've never, not hired somebody here.

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.086
- I would very much like to work here.

00:02:47.086 --> 00:02:48.408
- Yeah, and you were halfway there.

00:02:48.408 --> 00:02:50.016
You had a hat on, you didn't have sleeves

00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:51.920
on your shirt.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.908
Those are two pluses here.

00:02:53.908 --> 00:02:55.699
- This is fucking bullshit, dude.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.960
- And what is this?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.638
- My resume.

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:01.019
- It's five words and a dick.

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.508
(laughs)

00:03:02.508 --> 00:03:04.076
- Yeah I drew that.

00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:06.090
- Okay, I just need
you to slate your name.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.376
- Hi, I'm Zac Michaels.

00:03:07.376 --> 00:03:09.336
I have to be here.

00:03:09.336 --> 00:03:12.560
- Okay, um, do you have any questions?

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.808
- Uh, yeah, so my character Conner,

00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:17.976
he's just like, some dick in a soap opera?

00:03:17.976 --> 00:03:21.758
- Umm-Hmm, you're actually
gonna to be reading with Wesley.

00:03:21.758 --> 00:03:22.959
- Remember me?

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.126
- Remember me?

00:03:26.057 --> 00:03:28.950
- Conner, I never thought
I'd see you again.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.450
- Well Valentin, I never
thought I'd see anything again.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.278
But I got my eyesight
back and I can see things

00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:35.568
clearer than ever.

00:03:35.568 --> 00:03:39.768
Your face, your beautiful
reconstructed face.

00:03:39.768 --> 00:03:43.027
It's like water to my parched soul.

00:03:43.027 --> 00:03:45.088
- I can't quench your
soul-thirst Connor go.

00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:47.701
- If I can't have you,
I'll shoot my eyes out.

00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:51.284
Using the same gun that
took Tyrone's life.

00:03:53.746 --> 00:03:55.839
The end, can I go now?

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:57.658
- That was quite good, Zac.

00:03:57.658 --> 00:03:59.809
Are you available next week?

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:01.708
- Oh fuck, did I get it?
