00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.940
You ever see those a swamp people shows with them.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.480
Boats filled with fucking alligators.
I don't even think they eating those man.

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:07.410
I think most of those,

4
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:11.520
they're just taking the skins off of them and selling it for the leather.
Yeah,

5
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:14.610
that's,
that's what's really valuable.
Yeah.
Dude,
I have,
I have no,

6
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.140
no adventure in May.

7
00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:19.680
I watch you posting videos of you hunting and killing things and then eating it.

8
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:22.680
It's like if you just go back to your,
your Instagram three days in a row,

9
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:23.830
it's like I could watch like a,

10
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.120
an animal alive to being on your plate and it's fucking,

11
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:29.600
I mean more power to you,
dude.
The whole thing.
Um,

12
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.880
I watch it in all because I could never,
I could never kill something even in a,

13
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.900
even I don't even have to lead.
Could kill something.
Listen to me.

14
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.840
You could kill something and you definitely could if you wanted to feed your
son,

15
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.730
there's no doubt in my mind.

16
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.660
If you had a gun and there was a deer and you are hungry,
starving,
yes.

17
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.800
You don't even have to be starving.

18
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.850
He just have to have not the best prospects are manifesting right now.

19
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:53.970
It's like 11:00 AM I'll fuck him.
What does this Jamie,

20
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.680
46 grams of protein and alligator is that a pound?
3.3 ounces.
Holy Shit.

21
00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:02.880
Three ounces of alligator,
46 grams of protein.
You gainers out there.

22
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.570
Well of course it's a goddamn murderous dinosaur.
It's got no fat on it.

23
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:10.500
It's just muscle and skin.
They're monsters,
man.

24
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.010
Terrifying that story about like they'll eat like,
uh,

25
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.500
that's the other thing about becoming a father that people don't tell you

26
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.680
everything makes you terrified.
Oh yeah.
So you know the,

27
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.040
I'm supposed to put my kid to Disney in July and there was a story with the

28
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.930
alligator who grabbed the little kid and dragged them into the uh,

29
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.420
on the property of Disney.
Yup.
Or the father.
Just watch this kid get eaten.
Dude,

30
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:33.360
Florida,
there's too many alligators.
They can't keep track of them.

31
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:37.230
So if you have a body of water and you're not standing there 24,
seven,

32
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:41.460
when the fucking spotlight and a rifle,
those cops can sneak into that water.

33
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.130
That's,
that's some real shit,
man.
They'll sneak into that water.

34
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:47.160
They'll cross that grass.
You don't know they're there.
They climb that water.

35
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:50.490
You don't know they're there and they'll be underwater for an hour or two hours

36
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.220
and they'll pop the little head up.
They see that little kid now,
God damn,

37
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:55.830
I'm hungry.
That kids too close to the water and let's just grab them.

38
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:59.250
They don't have any qualms about that.
They don't know what the fuck you are.

39
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:00.180
They don't care what you are.

40
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.590
They have a brain the size of a goddamn walnut and they'd been alive in that

41
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:08.190
form for who knows how many fucking millions of years and they just kill,

42
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.640
kill the take.
They can go without food for a year,
man,

43
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.150
really 95 alligators removed from Disney property in Orlando.

44
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.420
Toddler killed 95 that was just like in that last year.
This was two years ago.

45
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.470
They're too tiny.
Five up to 400 alligators through April.

46
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:27.720
Like it's a project,
like they're building a fucking bridge.
