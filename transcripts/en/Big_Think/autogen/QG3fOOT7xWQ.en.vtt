life you want to be able to choose what
you become emotional about and when you

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
you become emotional about and when you
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.010
you become emotional about and when you
become emotional that's number one and

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020
become emotional that's number one and
 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.750

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
emotional well nature didn't want you to
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.300
emotional well nature didn't want you to
do either so it didn't give you any

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310
do either so it didn't give you any
 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.380

tools so if you're going to learn how to

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
tools so if you're going to learn how to
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.010
tools so if you're going to learn how to
do this it's going to be hard work and

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020
do this it's going to be hard work and
 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.049
do this it's going to be hard work and
it isn't going to be the kind of

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
it isn't going to be the kind of
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.709
it isn't going to be the kind of
learning like learning to ride a bicycle

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719
learning like learning to ride a bicycle
 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.470
learning like learning to ride a bicycle
once you learn to ride a bicycle you can

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
once you learn to ride a bicycle you can
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.209
once you learn to ride a bicycle you can
stay off it for ten years and get right

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219
stay off it for ten years and get right
 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.810
stay off it for ten years and get right
back on and ride what I'm going to tell

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820
back on and ride what I'm going to tell
 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.619
back on and ride what I'm going to tell
you now if you don't do everyday you'll

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629
you now if you don't do everyday you'll
 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.130
you now if you don't do everyday you'll
fall off you got to practice it all the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140
fall off you got to practice it all the
 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.790
fall off you got to practice it all the
time it's like being a concert pianist

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800
time it's like being a concert pianist
 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.830
time it's like being a concert pianist
it doesn't stick unless you practice it

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840
it doesn't stick unless you practice it
 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.080
it doesn't stick unless you practice it
so let's take problem number one having

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
so let's take problem number one having
 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.730
so let's take problem number one having
more choice about what you become

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740
more choice about what you become
 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.370
more choice about what you become
emotional about and that's the only

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
emotional about and that's the only
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.780
emotional about and that's the only
reason we want that is because sometimes

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790
reason we want that is because sometimes
 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.240
reason we want that is because sometimes
we become emotional of things that we

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250
we become emotional of things that we
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.039
we become emotional of things that we
don't think merit becoming emotional or

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049
don't think merit becoming emotional or
 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.910
don't think merit becoming emotional or
we activate that we don't approve of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
we activate that we don't approve of
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.450
we activate that we don't approve of
afterwards that's the number two problem

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460
afterwards that's the number two problem
 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.890
afterwards that's the number two problem
the first step is to keep a diary of

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900
the first step is to keep a diary of
 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.819
the first step is to keep a diary of
when you become emotional now you will

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
when you become emotional now you will
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.980
when you become emotional now you will
know in advance but you'll surely know

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
know in advance but you'll surely know
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.440
know in advance but you'll surely know
what it's over you just had an emotional

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450
what it's over you just had an emotional
 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.429
what it's over you just had an emotional
episode write it down in detail do this

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439
episode write it down in detail do this
 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.609
episode write it down in detail do this
for a month then go through it and look

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
for a month then go through it and look
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.010
for a month then go through it and look
for what are the themes that are causing

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
for what are the themes that are causing
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.770
for what are the themes that are causing
your emotions if it isn't apparent to

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780
your emotions if it isn't apparent to
 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.719
your emotions if it isn't apparent to
you get a friend to look at it but it

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
you get a friend to look at it but it
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.120
you get a friend to look at it but it
should be very apparent to you when you

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
should be very apparent to you when you
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.730
should be very apparent to you when you
read through this diary and you should

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
read through this diary and you should
 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.380
read through this diary and you should
be able to identify three or four

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390
be able to identify three or four
 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.119
be able to identify three or four
redundant things that are again and

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129
redundant things that are again and
 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.860
redundant things that are again and
again

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870
again
 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.850
again
getting you to act emotionally now the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860
getting you to act emotionally now the
 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.460
getting you to act emotionally now the
ones where you think you responded

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470
ones where you think you responded
 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.550
ones where you think you responded
emotionally and there was no reason to

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560
emotionally and there was no reason to
 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.890
emotionally and there was no reason to

theme now you're equipped you know what

theme now you're equipped you know what
the triggers are now when you're about

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250
the triggers are now when you're about
 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.890
the triggers are now when you're about
to enter a situation think is this

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900
to enter a situation think is this
 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.539
to enter a situation think is this
likely to trigger the one of my themes

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549
likely to trigger the one of my themes

get much sleep last night so I'm likely

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329
get much sleep last night so I'm likely
 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.780
get much sleep last night so I'm likely
to go off maybe I better postpone this

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790
to go off maybe I better postpone this

meeting because it's going to have one

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349
meeting because it's going to have one
 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.910
meeting because it's going to have one
of my hot triggers or am I in pretty

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920
of my hot triggers or am I in pretty
 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.900
of my hot triggers or am I in pretty
good shape and I'm prepared and I know

good shape and I'm prepared and I know
 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.020
good shape and I'm prepared and I know
what might be coming right down the road

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030
what might be coming right down the road
 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.349
what might be coming right down the road
that's step one on problem one step two

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359
that's step one on problem one step two
 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.680
that's step one on problem one step two
is harder

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690
 
 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.020
 
and it is to increase the gap between

and it is to increase the gap between
 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.200
and it is to increase the gap between
impulse and action the way this works

and emotion episodes begin with an

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500
and emotion episodes begin with an
 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.080
and emotion episodes begin with an
appraisal that something is triggering

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090
appraisal that something is triggering
 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.330
appraisal that something is triggering
your emotion that's based on your

your emotion that's based on your
 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.500
your emotion that's based on your
previous life experience that's stored

but this appraisal mechanism is
continually scanning wherever you are

continually scanning wherever you are
 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.070
continually scanning wherever you are
looking for any of these triggers and

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080
looking for any of these triggers and
 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.289
looking for any of these triggers and
it's incredibly fast and not always

it's incredibly fast and not always

something and impulse arises that

something and impulse arises that

something and impulse arises that

words but there is a takes time for the

impulse to get translated into action

impulse to get translated into action
 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.050
impulse to get translated into action
you want to lengthen that time so you

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060
you want to lengthen that time so you
 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.010
you want to lengthen that time so you
can spot the impulse arising before you

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020
can spot the impulse arising before you
 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.500
can spot the impulse arising before you
act

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510
act

act
this is not easy for some people it's a

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780
this is not easy for some people it's a
 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.440
this is not easy for some people it's a
lot easier for others because they

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450
lot easier for others because they
 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.650
lot easier for others because they
normally have a very slow rise time and

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660
normally have a very slow rise time and
 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.770
normally have a very slow rise time and
others are equal the attack dogs they

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780
others are equal the attack dogs they
 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.140
others are equal the attack dogs they
have almost instant very little delay

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150
have almost instant very little delay
 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.100
have almost instant very little delay
between impulsive action but strangely

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110
between impulsive action but strangely
 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.750
