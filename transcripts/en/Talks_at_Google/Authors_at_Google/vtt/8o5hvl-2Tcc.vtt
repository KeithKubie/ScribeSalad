00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.152
BERNIE BRENNER: I think
the connection here

00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:06.485
is obviously about relationship.

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:07.629
You're building rapport.

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:09.170
And relationship is
so important when

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.620
it comes to business
development.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.930
And also I say what I
try and communicate often

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.310
is the difference between
sales and business development.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.420
And in doing it
for my whole career

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.620
as well as hiring
people, I think

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.850
it's very sort of appropriate
from your standpoint.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.250
Because I've looked
at people's resumes,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.000
and they have this
incredible resume,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.940
and they stink at what they're
doing in terms of hiring.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.330
So it's not just about that,
and I've learned over the years

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.460
that there are certain
key components,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.820
at least in these roles as
it relates to BD-- Business

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.530
Development-- which is
a combination of hunting

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.710
and there are people
that what we'd

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.340
refer to as account managers.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.715
But I've renamed them
partner development managers

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:00.848
because I really like the
word development to be

00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:02.306
in there because
they're developing

00:01:02.306 --> 00:01:04.740
relationship and developing
a partnership versus managing

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.870
an account.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.570
And that's very
much the sales side.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.190
So I understanding
these nuances will also

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.920
help in terms of the recruiting
aspect and what to look for.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.950
At least I found it
to be quite effective.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.910
So I'm happy to answer
questions about where

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.160
I've made the mistakes over
the years of hiring people

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.370
and like, oh my god,
this is a disaster,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.930
and so having to let them go.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.346
And they think
that they're great,

00:01:27.346 --> 00:01:28.645
and it's just not the case.

00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:29.940
AUDIENCE: I do traditional BD.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.410
BERNIE BRENNER: Say it again.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.290
AUDIENCE: I do traditional BD,
we've got a whole team here.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.373
BERNIE BRENNER: OK, great.

00:01:33.373 --> 00:01:35.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
with all your tips.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.651
BERNIE BRENNER: All
right, thank you.

00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:38.032
All right, so--

00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:39.960
AUDIENCE: And a couple
of us are in deploying

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.798
a product [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:44.298
BERNIE BRENNER: OK,
good, all right.

00:01:44.298 --> 00:01:45.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.426
BERNIE BRENNER: Right,
right, all right,

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:50.010
so there'll be--
certainly anything related

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.360
to relationship management
is very important.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.890
As I say-- and I have a
podcast, and I'm constantly

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.450
talking about this
on the podcast,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.250
so you should all subscribe.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.100
It's called "Extreme
Biz Dev"-- is

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.650
that when it comes
to strategic deals,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.530
revenue is prioritized last.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.291
Now, everyone in the ops
world that I work with

00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:16.790
is like, what are
you talking about?

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.740
Where's the revenue?

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.740
Where's our [INAUDIBLE]?

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.159
It's relationship first.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.200
And this is all when two
companies come together,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.033
relationship first,
strategic impact second.

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:26.195
This is how you're
prioritizing what you do

00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:27.070
and how you interact.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.600
And revenue is
third, and I view it

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.060
as revenue is last, because if
you prioritize the other two,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.550
the revenue is going to come.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.200
The opportunity between the two
will be achieved or realized.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.000
So when we talk about
"The Sumo Advantage,"

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.765
I'll explain why I
use the term sumo.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:49.090
And again, this is all
about a mindset shift.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.070
But if you were to ask companies
how you grow your revenue,

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.750
most would say,
let's increase sales.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.450
Either add more people,
increase the quotas,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.000
whatever you can
do, lower the price.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.470
But increase sales, and that's
how you increase revenue.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.890
And I'm saying that's not the
only way to think about it.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.973
Obviously that's a critical
way to think about it.

00:03:10.973 --> 00:03:14.260
It's important, but
is it sustainable?

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.300
And when I say is
it sustainable,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.810
it's really, well,
if you grow sales,

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.790
so there's always going
to be some attrition.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.689
So if your goal is
to grow gross sales,

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.230
you're going to lose some, so
you've got to make up for that,

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.813
and then you've got
to gain even more.

00:03:27.813 --> 00:03:31.770
So growing is
harder, because you

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.520
have to make up for
what you've lost also.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.940
There's always some attrition
in the sales transaction.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.690
And then what's
the X-factor to it?

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.755
So think about that.

00:03:39.755 --> 00:03:43.300
You sell, so one-to-one money.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.570
And that's all it is.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.840
And I'm saying from a business
development standpoint,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840
there's an impact on it.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.730
There's an exponential impact.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.340
And then also of course
does the sales impact

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.570
the market, meaning,
if get a deal,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.730
does it really
influence the market,

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.730
changed the landscape
of the market,

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.440
to ultimately get it where
the market converges on us

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.244
and we become a whole product?

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:07.410
And usually this is I'm
talking from the perspective

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.900
of a smaller company
partnering with a sumo.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.290
In this case, Google would
be the sumo, of course.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.150
And I use actually Google as
an example not only in the book

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.041
but in this presentation here
just normally, not just for you

00:04:19.041 --> 00:04:19.540
all.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.141
Because it's a great
example, I think,

00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:26.160
of where some entrepreneurs
sometimes go wrong.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.790
So let's get to what is sales?

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.690
And so for this discussion,
I like to really boil it down

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.460
to something very, very simple.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.230
And I'm not saying
that sales is simple.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.980
I'm saying when you're
thinking about what

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.840
is the difference
between sales and BD,

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.910
I use paper cups as an example.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.280
I'm selling paper cups.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.970
And so I'm selling cups.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.934
I'm selling more cups.

00:04:49.934 --> 00:04:50.850
I'm selling more cups.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.770
It's a numbers game.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.972
I have to get more
cups out there, right?

00:04:53.972 --> 00:04:55.680
I mean, if you're a
manufacturer of cups,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.305
you've got to get
those cups out there,

00:04:57.305 --> 00:04:58.710
the more cups, the better.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.510
That is truly sales.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.040
Your pipeline, your commission
structure, everything

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.650
is based on this metric
here, versus business

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.610
development, which is vision.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.850
You're pitching this
opportunity that

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.532
could happen if these two
companies come together.

00:05:17.532 --> 00:05:19.240
But it's very different
from saying, hey,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.230
I have some paper cups.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.360
Do you want them?

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.870
So we're going to talk about the
distinctions between these two.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.460
So what does it mean if
you're pinching vision?

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.560
Well, there are four
key distinctions

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.840
that I've identified that are
the difference between sales

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.690
and BD.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.440
And so it's important
to understand.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.350
Because once my view, once
it's identified and defined,

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.140
what is business development?

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.230
And what is sales?

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.230
Because a lot of times,
you'll see these things.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.780
What is BD?

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.923
Does it live in sales?

00:05:47.923 --> 00:05:49.006
Does it live in marketing?

00:05:49.006 --> 00:05:50.925
And sometimes it has
to because the company

00:05:50.925 --> 00:05:52.245
doesn't have the resources yet.

00:05:52.245 --> 00:05:54.920
But if you really want it
to flourish, in my view,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.810
it's defining it and
treating it differently.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.310
Because if you treat
it differently,

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.740
then you'll get
the right results.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.781
So what's the difference?

00:06:01.781 --> 00:06:04.892
Distinction number one
is BD is very strategic.

00:06:04.892 --> 00:06:08.164
There's nothing terribly
strategic about sales.

00:06:08.164 --> 00:06:09.580
There could be
some aspects to it.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.496
You got a distributor.

00:06:10.496 --> 00:06:11.800
You got something.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.700
But primarily,
sales, paper cups--

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.077
I'm selling cups-- there's
nothing strategic about that.

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:19.118
This is very strategic
because it's about vision.

00:06:19.118 --> 00:06:21.340
It's about two companies
partnering together.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.200
So that's distinction
number one.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.562
Number two, there's
no direct revenue.

00:06:25.562 --> 00:06:28.020
So when you think about business
development, two companies

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.070
cutting a deal
together as partners,

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.970
the contract is
created, and all that

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.370
is, is the framework for
how two companies are

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.320
going to work together
in the future.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.850
Versus sales, there's
direct revenue.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.920
I am selling you paper cups.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.067
We have a whatever
it is, however

00:06:45.067 --> 00:06:46.900
you want to determine
what that contract is.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.480
It's just going to be an
invoice, insertion order

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.890
on something.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.920
However you're using it to
memorialize the relationship

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.880
or formalize it, it's purely,
I will deliver paper cups

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.800
on this day.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.276
You will deliver money to
me at some day after that.

00:07:02.276 --> 00:07:04.300
Very one-one, there's
direct revenue.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.500
There's no direct
revenue in a BD deal.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.200
And even if there
is some-- sometimes

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.783
you have to sweeten the deal a
little bit, touch something up,

00:07:11.783 --> 00:07:14.940
there's some infrastructure
or a technology development

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.370
that you say, OK, I'll put
a little money into that

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.120
to the other partner--
it's insignificant relative

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.000
to the size of the opportunity.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.030
So you're not, again,
judging the deal

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:30.734
or managing the relationship
based on that transaction.

00:07:30.734 --> 00:07:33.150
So if you think about managing
a relationship in the sales

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.710
transaction, this gets
to the account manager

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.640
versus the partner
development manager side.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.560
In account management-- this is
why I believe account managers,

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.690
they could have a
phenomenal resume.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:48.520
They're not necessarily
great at partner development.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.470
And the reason why is because
they've sort of evolved

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.060
their expertise or
their experience

00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:00.539
around a transaction
governing the relationship.

00:08:00.539 --> 00:08:02.580
So let's just say a customer
says, you know what?

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.770
I want more paper cups.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.230
Great, let me give you an order.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.420
The answer is yes, absolutely.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.304
Oh, but we didn't
deliver in time.

00:08:12.304 --> 00:08:13.970
Let me figure out
what's going on there.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.530
Everything is around
pleasing the customer

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.320
because the transaction exists.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.190
I want my money.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.970
You want your paper
cups, and everything

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.010
is governed around that.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.040
Whether it's telephony service,
or advertising, or whatever,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.950
there's clearly a
deliverable on each side,

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.980
and I have to find what
a sales transaction is.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.929
So account managers are
very, very good at that.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:38.603
But that doesn't translate
into relationship management,

00:08:38.603 --> 00:08:39.269
not necessarily.

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:40.960
So they may not be
sealed with that.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.140
One of the key things
that I've found

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.800
to be very good at
partner development

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.800
is to embrace conflict.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.391
And we all understand this
from a personal relationship

00:08:51.391 --> 00:08:51.890
standpoint.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.850
If anybody's read any
books on relationships

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:00.202
and gone to any courses
or anything, which I have.

00:09:00.202 --> 00:09:02.160
My wife and I go to these
things, and it's fun.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.940
But it's all about
embracing the conflict.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.260
And if you don't
have any conflict,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.000
then you're not growing
the relationship.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.910
And when I say conflict,
I mean healthy conflict.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.201
I'm not talking about beating
the crap out of somebody,

00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:13.740
you know.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.380
So you're not doing
that with your partner.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.010
You're embracing
conflict, which means

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.860
that if the partner has a
view of something that's

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.270
very different from how you
envision the relationship

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.645
and you truly believe it's
not good for the relationship,

00:09:25.645 --> 00:09:26.785
you have to confront that.

00:09:26.785 --> 00:09:29.410
And account managers-- first of
all, generally, a lot of people

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.320
are not comfortable
with conflict,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.650
so you have to look for that.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:38.429
And then, even if they are,
account managers really very

00:09:38.429 --> 00:09:40.345
rarely have conflicted
in their relationship--

00:09:40.345 --> 00:09:41.550
[PHONE RINGING]

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.340
I'm so sorry.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.110
Very rarely have conflict
in their relationship.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.580
It's usually the customer.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.040
The conflict would
be, I'm really

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.540
pissed I didn't get
my cups in time,

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.112
and now I can't sell
coffee this week.

00:09:55.112 --> 00:09:55.945
That's the conflict.

00:09:55.945 --> 00:09:57.410
And the account
manager is, holy shit.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.440
I'll get it to you right away.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.830
We're going to do
an expedited order.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:00.450
We're going to do this.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.840
I'm going to reroute whatever.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.310
Please, please, please,
please the person.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:03.680
Please the person.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.460
Please the person because they
want that next order, very,

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.835
very different as
you're thinking

00:10:07.835 --> 00:10:10.550
about who to hire from a
partner relationship standpoint

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.660
or partner development
and account management.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.130
Distinction number
three, and we talked

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.870
about the difference
between sales and BD

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.650
from a vision standpoint.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.210
Everyone's plate is full.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.450
We're all super busy.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.450
No one has a lot of down time.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.760
So whatever you're pitching
from a vision standpoint

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:33.050
is actually not on somebody's
plate, versus sales

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.010
where someone is
assigned here to buy

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.010
paper cups for that coffee shop.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.850
You can't sell coffee
without the paper cups.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.000
And someone is, it's
their responsibility

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.210
to get the paper cups.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.640
If they don't, they're fired.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.850
That doesn't happen here
in the majority of cases.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.870
When we were going
out with TrueCar

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.930
and our first big
partner was USAA,

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.040
it's not like they were looking
for a car-buying solution

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.160
and how to innovate
and change and disrupt

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.790
the automotive space.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.310
In fact, how we got the
relationship was they put out

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.930
an RFP-- this is again the
difference between sales

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.040
and BD-- they put out
an RFP for technology,

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.040
for something called an
automotive configurator.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.828
So this is where you go and you
can say I have 2014, Toyota,

00:11:15.828 --> 00:11:17.703
and then Camry comes up
or the other options.

00:11:17.703 --> 00:11:19.257
It's a typical configuration.

00:11:19.257 --> 00:11:21.340
So they wanted that, and
they were willing to pay.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.965
They wanted to know what
the differences were

00:11:23.965 --> 00:11:27.150
between your configurator
and another configurator.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.025
And we all know RFPs
are just about sucking

00:11:29.025 --> 00:11:30.400
the information
out of the market

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.190
and figuring out what
you're going to do next.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:38.870
So I responded with,
that's not what you want.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.600
And then I paint
in the RFP, painted

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.650
the vision of what could be.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.002
And those are tactics I
use to deal with RFPs.

00:11:46.002 --> 00:11:47.460
We don't have to
get into that now.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.210
But the point I'm
trying to make is

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:52.750
it was on someone's plate to
acquire-- in the tech side,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.010
anyway-- to acquire this
configuration technology,

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.634
and they were willing
to write a check.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.860
So think about
what's going on here.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.030
There's nothing
strategic about that.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.590
Money was going to change
hands on the finishing end.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.460
And it was on somebody's plate.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.380
So I come in, and
I say, no, no, no.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.780
So first of all, that's a
commodity, and it's free.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.159
No one else is responding
with it's free.

00:12:17.159 --> 00:12:19.200
Everyone's a couple hundred
thousand or whatever.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.450
It's free, so let's just
take that issue off the table

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.784
right away, because that's
not where you want to go.

00:12:23.784 --> 00:12:25.950
You want to do something
bigger for your membership.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.460
And I don't know if any of
you are familiar with USAA,

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.910
but right after
we signed, it was

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.410
ranked the number-one customer
service brand in the country.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.160
It's an incredible
organization supporting

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.505
military and their families.

00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:39.480
And you could not get
anything better than them

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.090
in terms of being a member
or being a partner of theirs.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:49.289
Because their brand and their
mission is so true north.

00:12:49.289 --> 00:12:51.580
But what I was talking about
wasn't on anybody's plate,

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.090
and I had to go through like
six different people then.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.027
Because the person who sent
out the RFP and was evaluating

00:12:56.027 --> 00:12:57.693
that was definitely
not the right person

00:12:57.693 --> 00:12:59.040
for what I'm talking about.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.990
So we had to move around.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.410
But if I had just responded with
whatever the transaction was,

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.640
that was on somebody's plate.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.840
They were ready
for configuration.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.370
Fourth-- so those are
three of the four,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.400
and those I view as factual.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.790
Those are the facts
around the circumstances

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.590
of a sales versus BD deal.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.620
The fourth is behavioral.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.740
So now [INAUDIBLE]
understanding and then now

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.750
some behavior structure change.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:30.870
And that comes to focusing on
the no, versus sales, which

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.400
is focusing on, how
do I get to yes?

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.720
ABC-- Always Be Closing,
Let's close that puppy up.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.650
Let's do it now.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.730
That's sales, right?

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.850
This is about focusing
on not getting a no.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.600
And I say not getting a
no because that's all you

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.120
as a BD person need
to be concerned

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.090
with in the early phase.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.180
Because there's no way
you're getting a yes.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.092
Remember, there's
no direct revenue.

00:13:54.092 --> 00:13:56.300
That person's plate is full,
and what you're pitching

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.710
is not on it.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.796
So it's about focusing
on not getting a no.

00:14:01.796 --> 00:14:03.670
And I think this is a
good example of someone

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.380
who wants to jump
off a building.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.360
The negotiator comes in,
and what does he say?

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.620
He certainly doesn't start
off with, hey, idiot, get

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.824
down from the building
right now, right?

00:14:14.824 --> 00:14:17.240
Now you're going to get a no,
and the guy's going to jump,

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.085
and now he's dead.

00:14:18.085 --> 00:14:20.881
And you did a terrible job.

00:14:20.881 --> 00:14:21.380
Right?

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.970
No, it's building
rapport, relationship.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.750
It all starts with that.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:30.030
Take as long as is necessary,
because this negotiator has

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.470
to focus on not getting a
no, because no means failure.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.410
No means this individual
now lost their life.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.600
There's no way he's getting
a yes out of the gate.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.340
You can't just speed
it up like in sales.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.625
Hey, listen, I'll
shave 10% off if you

00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:45.000
close before the end of the
month so I can make my quota.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.440
That doesn't exist
in this world.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.790
So they're having conversation.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.080
They're building rapport.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.017
Oh, you have two kids?

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:52.600
You know what?

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.490
I've got two kids too.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.610
Yeah, we had a rough
time with my wife

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:57.950
and I when we went through this.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.188
Whatever is going on in
this individual's mind,

00:15:00.188 --> 00:15:01.562
this negotiator's
trying to bond,

00:15:01.562 --> 00:15:04.360
and understand, and build
a trust relationship.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.750
And at some point,
there's a change.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.340
There's an inflection point
where then you will understand

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.830
on a BD level, OK, now we
can start getting to yes.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.265
That question may
be-- the partner

00:15:15.265 --> 00:15:18.130
and I refer to it as
the sumo-- may say,

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.870
what would a
relationship look like?

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.290
How would we structure this?

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:22.410
Because now you're
starting to get to yes.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:23.534
Now there's an opportunity.

00:15:23.534 --> 00:15:25.631
It takes a while to get there.

00:15:25.631 --> 00:15:27.880
The negotiator at some point
will feel this inflection

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.330
point, the bond that
happens, and will say-- wow,

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.710
I'm already losing people?

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:35.710
AUDIENCE: She had to go.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:36.185
AUDIENCE: I'll be right back.

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:37.185
BERNIE BRENNER: It's OK.

00:15:37.185 --> 00:15:37.710
I'm kidding.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.870
Will say, you know what?

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:40.691
Come on.

00:15:40.691 --> 00:15:41.190
Come on.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.620
Let's go get a cup of coffee.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.490
Let's go talk about this.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.782
And the guy feels that he
has trust with the negotiator

00:15:47.782 --> 00:15:49.323
and says, look, I
can make that lead.

00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:50.840
Because there's a
lot of risk here,

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.410
because it's so easy to say no.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:56.045
In the case of BD, remember
someone's plate is full.

00:15:56.045 --> 00:15:58.190
We talked about how there's
no immediate revenue.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.950
It requires
additional resources.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.680
It's not on their boss's plate.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.330
It's not on their
boss's boss's plate.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.800
So how could you possibly
say yes when this person,

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.880
it's not on their radar.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.815
They're not going to get
in trouble for saying no.

00:16:10.815 --> 00:16:13.260
And it's not going to affect
their compensation this year,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:14.790
even if they took
the risk on us.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.120
So it's very easy to say no.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.050
We're all into my
plate's full, so how

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.087
do I get things off my plate?

00:16:20.087 --> 00:16:22.045
And so that's the behavioral
change that occurs

00:16:22.045 --> 00:16:24.000
and the difference
between sales and BD.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.065
You can not use sales tactics--
that let's speed it up.

00:16:27.065 --> 00:16:28.390
Let's close it faster.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.460
I've got to hit my
numbers in the quarter--

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.626
when it comes to something
like this in the same way

00:16:32.626 --> 00:16:35.113
that you can't use
traditional sales compensation

00:16:35.113 --> 00:16:37.260
modeling for these
types of people.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.075
Because you can't rush it.

00:16:39.075 --> 00:16:39.950
It's going to happen.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.190
It's an evolution that occurs,
and so you can't bonus someone

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.920
on a quarterly basis or give
them commission based on this.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.530
It's not the way to look at
it, not the long-term view.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:54.110
So it really requires
this evangelic pitch.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.040
When you're pitching
a big company

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.970
and all those dynamics exist,
it is about this [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.670
That's how we got USAA, and
American Express, and Consumer

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.880
Reports, and all
these other companies.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.910
Because we're talking
about what could be,

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.690
and this is going to happen.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:13.630
So I use the term sumo and
advantage for a couple reasons.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.480
I like sumo because sumo
is a warrior contestant.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.430
They understand how to
deal with an opponent.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.930
They understand the
rules of engagement

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.099
because they're a warrior.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:27.415
Advantage means-- everyone
wants an advantage

00:17:27.415 --> 00:17:29.390
in the marketplace.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.220
So this is the goal
that I look for

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.100
and what I recommend in
terms of entrepreneurs,

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.100
they always look for.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.808
They want to cut the
deal with a big guy.

00:17:37.808 --> 00:17:40.570
It's very hard to do, but
they want to get a benefit.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.000
They want to get a gain.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.715
So sumo, to me, is a
much better terminology.

00:17:45.715 --> 00:17:47.690
And I'll use the
800-pound gorilla

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.940
that everyone wants to go
for in sales, or big whale,

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:50.690
however you refer.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.190
So let's talk about
TrueCar for a second.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:53.870
Let's talk about how
we went to market.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.060
And we're very successful now.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.076
Without this BD
strategy, we would not

00:17:58.076 --> 00:17:59.726
be in existence today.

00:17:59.726 --> 00:18:01.180
We would have been dead.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.720
Automotive's a very
difficult place to disrupt.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.020
And so think about-- I
don't know if you all

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.197
know what we do-- but
you come to our website.

00:18:09.197 --> 00:18:10.780
You put in the car
you're looking for,

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.380
and we load up all
the transactions

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.850
that happened in the
last whatever, 30 days,

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.651
60 days depending on
how much volume there

00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:18.100
is in the market
based on the car.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:18.770
But it's local.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:19.770
You can get it regional.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.560
You can get it national level.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.470
You get to see what
everybody else paid,

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:28.459
which is transparency that, when
we started, no dealer wants.

00:18:28.459 --> 00:18:30.500
They never want to give
you information and power

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.965
the consumer, because
they're really

00:18:31.965 --> 00:18:34.298
about bringing you in, sitting
you across from the desk,

00:18:34.298 --> 00:18:37.020
and then figuring
how to work a deal.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.250
Also our dealers-- now
we have 7,000 dealers--

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:42.630
provide up-front pricing.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:47.040
So before you get in, before
you even give up your anonymity,

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.410
you're getting a price of
what this dealer is going

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.000
to charge you for that car
based on how you configure--

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.920
complete transparency up front.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.598
They can't communicate with you.

00:18:55.598 --> 00:18:56.973
This is like, 8
and 1/2 years ago

00:18:56.973 --> 00:18:59.020
when we started the
company or 9 years ago now,

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.010
this is not how the
world was working.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.440
So now imagine going
into our sales floor.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.020
So this is how BD
helps accelerate sales.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.540
So imagine our
sales force, which

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.190
is people on the street
signing up dealerships.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.440
That's where the sales happen.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.367
That's a typical sales
strategy that we use.

00:19:17.367 --> 00:19:18.950
They would knock on
the dealer's door.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.270
And there's 500
different companies

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.280
knocking on the dealer's
door every week.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.340
Hey, we're launching a new
website called truecar.com,

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.540
and we're going to show
all the transactions that

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.800
occurred to give complete
transparency out,

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.430
calculate what a good price
is, what an over price is.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.870
And we want you to
provide up-front pricing.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.070
And I know you don't do
any of these things today,

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.369
and you would actually
hate it for consumers

00:19:44.369 --> 00:19:45.410
to have this information.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:46.868
But this is what
we want you to do.

00:19:46.868 --> 00:19:49.320
Do you imagine what a
dealer's going to say?

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.940
Get out.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.400
I mean, they will throw
you out, escort you out.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.123
Get out of here.

00:19:54.123 --> 00:19:56.819
I want you to die
because you're the devil.

00:19:56.819 --> 00:19:58.110
So we wouldn't be in existence.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.901
And then we have a
chicken and egg issue.

00:19:59.901 --> 00:20:02.276
Even if they were interested
and we got past the get out.

00:20:02.276 --> 00:20:04.050
I want to kill you, the
next question will be,

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.340
how many visitors do you have?

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.120
We don't have any
visitors because we

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.790
need the dealers to
get the visitors.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:13.530
So we need you first so we
can then attract consumers.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.760
Yeah, call me back when
you have some traffic.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.119
Or the next question would
be, what's your quality?

00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:20.660
We don't know what
the quality is yet

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.885
because we don't have
any visitors because we

00:20:24.885 --> 00:20:26.180
need the dealers.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.475
And then so now we're in limbo.

00:20:28.475 --> 00:20:29.850
That's not how we
went to market.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.997
We'd be dead today if we
went to market that way.

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:33.580
There's no way we
could have disrupted

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.820
this behavioral change
leveraging just our own brand

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.520
and starting out from scratch.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.380
So what do we do?

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.450
We had a heavy BD model
where we went out,

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.490
and we private labeled.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:47.869
Capital One, Consumer
Reports, American Express,

00:20:47.869 --> 00:20:49.160
Geico, Nationwide, [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.650
We have over 100 brands
that we power for.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.660
And now the
conversation changes.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.680
So now before we had
website, before we

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.664
had any customers coming in,
we're walking into dealers,

00:21:02.664 --> 00:21:04.080
and we're saying,
hey, do you want

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.360
to be part of the USAA
Car Buying Service

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.510
and be a USAA certified dealer?

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:13.020
The answer is yes
almost 100% of the time.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.780
If you're in a military
town and you're a dealer,

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.152
you want to be that dealer.

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:18.610
You want to make
sure that you are,

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.651
and you certainly don't
want to be in a situation

00:21:20.651 --> 00:21:22.410
where you're not and
your competitor is.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.659
And remember, the competitor
is the other Toyota store

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:26.900
in the market, not
Toyota versus Nissan.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.516
They actually don't
compete amongst brands.

00:21:29.516 --> 00:21:31.960
They compete in their own brand.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.191
So now we're over that issue.

00:21:34.191 --> 00:21:36.690
Never did we have a question
how many customers did we have.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:40.060
Because the answer was,
well, USAA has at the time

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.190
8 million members.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.590
So they're like, oh, great.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:45.444
Not one of them
visited the site yet

00:21:45.444 --> 00:21:47.610
because we didn't have a
site, but it didn't matter.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.932
And now we're saying, by
the way, we need that chain.

00:21:50.932 --> 00:21:52.140
We want the up-front pricing.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:52.889
OK, you know what?

00:21:52.889 --> 00:21:55.210
For USAA members, I'll do it.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.454
So that's how we created change.

00:21:57.454 --> 00:21:58.870
Absolutely there's
no way we would

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.453
have gotten it done
without leveraging

00:22:00.453 --> 00:22:03.810
the sumo in this space.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.477
And this is an example of
what these sites look like.

00:22:06.477 --> 00:22:07.810
This is American Express's site.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:09.252
This is us on our servers.

00:22:09.252 --> 00:22:10.820
But we've adopted
American Express.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.470
It's seamless.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.440
You log in, all that
information gets

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.650
transferred so you
don't have to reenter.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:20.102
The forms pre-pop when
you're ready to submit

00:22:20.102 --> 00:22:20.810
your information.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:21.976
So it's very, very seamless.

00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:23.880
There's an integration
strategy there,

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.649
integration component to it.

00:22:27.649 --> 00:22:28.690
This is Consumer Reports.

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:29.630
Again, this is us.

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:32.880
So that's how we went to
market to leverage that brand.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.145
Then of course we
launched truecar.com

00:22:35.145 --> 00:22:38.220
much later on where we had
the base of dealers already.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:43.380
Now, sumo versus gorilla, we're
all familiar with the term,

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.490
let's get the 800-pound
gorilla in the space,

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:46.864
or that is the
800-pound gorilla.

00:22:46.864 --> 00:22:49.077
Gosh, if I can land
them for paper.

00:22:49.077 --> 00:22:50.660
Someone who's selling
paper cup, gosh,

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.868
if I can get Starbucks--
that's the 800-pound gorilla

00:22:52.868 --> 00:22:53.790
in the space.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:54.510
They want it.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.360
Here's the problem
with the gorilla,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.970
in my view, when you're
talking about strategic deals.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:01.680
They're not big
into thought here.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.550
And there's all
these books the talk

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.140
about go getting the whale.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.290
Go close that whale.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:08.240
Get the big sale.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.520
Get the 800-pound gorilla.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.190
And that's great.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.050
That will bring
you a pile of cash.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.840
There's nothing wrong
with a pile of cash.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.890
We all love cash.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.910
But what you're not
getting out of the gorilla

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.450
is the critical thinking.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.780
And that's where a
sumo line works well.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.887
So sumo gives you
exponential power

00:23:25.887 --> 00:23:27.720
because you're leveraging
the sumo's assets.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.720
If you're going to
fight in the ring,

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.280
remember you're
cutting this deal.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.320
We cut the deal
with USAA so that we

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.347
can compete in our market,
not compete in USAA's market.

00:23:36.347 --> 00:23:37.680
We were leveraging their assets.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.930
So now when you're
going to market,

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:40.971
you're taking the sumo
who's standing behind you,

00:23:40.971 --> 00:23:42.850
and you've got all the
assets of the sumo.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:43.900
And they're a warrior.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.441
They know how to
compete in the ring.

00:23:45.441 --> 00:23:47.420
They understand the
rules of engagement.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.810
And now you're
leveraging the strategy

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:52.344
that they can bring
in, how they execute.

00:23:52.344 --> 00:23:53.760
They understand
how to prioritize.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.350
They understand how to improve.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.803
Gorilla doesn't do that.

00:23:55.803 --> 00:23:57.062
Gorilla is just sheer power.

00:23:57.062 --> 00:23:58.770
So when you're talking
about a sales deal

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:01.540
and the gorilla says,
I want more cups,

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.620
you better get them
more cups, or you've

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.510
messed up the delivery.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.690
You better fix that.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:11.160
That's what a gorilla gives
you, good volume, big money,

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.080
but also there's a different
level of support there.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.370
Versus the sumo, when
you're competing,

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.970
you have this guy on your side.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:21.890
And so of course then
you get to compete,

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.960
and you're leveraging
the sumo's power.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.520
So when we're out in the market,
we're now as big as USAA.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.910
We don't have one
dollar of revenue yet.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.360
We don't have one
visitor to the site.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.970
But we are now in the
market as big as USAA.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.210
That's the unique difference
between BD and sales.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.345
Now, that doesn't mean it
isn't good to say, hey,

00:24:42.345 --> 00:24:43.940
we provide paper
cups for Starbucks.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.300
OK, there's credibility there.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:45.820
You can deliver.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:46.790
You can deliver on time.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:47.665
You can mass produce.

00:24:47.665 --> 00:24:49.790
There's all the
advantages to that.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.050
But that's not going
to necessarily get

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:53.150
the market to converge.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:54.230
We're trying to
change the market.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:55.950
We're trying to change
dealer behavior.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.950
We're trying to change
market understanding.

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.070
We're trying to get consumers to
come in and adopt this strategy

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.700
that we're also embraced the
information, so a lot that

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.380
has to go on there.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.640
So in the organization
there's a product layer.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.260
There's a sales and
marketing layer.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.890
And what I'm saying
there is the layer

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:14.380
that needs to be installed to
help with sales and marketing.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.569
And really the BD later
bolts onto products.

00:25:16.569 --> 00:25:18.860
So the product people need
to understand that if you're

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.995
going to go after the strategy,
that there may be some product

00:25:22.995 --> 00:25:24.360
augmentation.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.350
You're not going to build
a whole new product.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.560
But in the case of
our platform, we

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.950
had to accommodate the
idea that, wow, we're

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.820
going to power USAA.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.595
And people, USAA members,
are going to log in.

00:25:35.595 --> 00:25:39.117
And when they come to
our site, over to us,

00:25:39.117 --> 00:25:40.950
we're not going to ask
them to log in again.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.150
That would be a disconnected
experience, especially

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.607
under the same brand.

00:25:44.607 --> 00:25:46.440
So we need to deal with
the security issues,

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.565
and we need to deal with
the handshake capabilities

00:25:48.565 --> 00:25:51.750
of transferring the data all
understanding what USAA is.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.570
And USAA's so crazy
on the security side.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.600
Just to give you an
understanding, for us

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.560
as a small company
starting out, for us

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.430
to do the deal with
them, we thought

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:01.830
we were fairly secure already.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.150
And we had to strike
a million-dollar check

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.485
just to increase the
infrastructure on the security

00:26:06.485 --> 00:26:09.170
side to deal with USAA.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.860
So a million dollars
just on security--

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.890
it doesn't generate
revenue-- is tough

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.340
when you're talking
about a start-up.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.591
But we did it, because we
understood the opportunity

00:26:17.591 --> 00:26:18.091
there.

00:26:18.091 --> 00:26:18.940
And that's hard.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.510
The ROI on that is
zero in the first year,

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:22.719
in the first two years.

00:26:22.719 --> 00:26:24.510
It's not something you
need to think about.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:28.190
So here's what happens
when you, I believe,

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.480
when you install a BD layer
from a revenue standpoint.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.400
And so your revenue's
going to grow.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.560
Of course your revenue
is going to grow

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.810
if you're a thriving business.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:40.310
But with BD, on the out
years, is grows faster.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.745
There's a big difference
between going the normal path

00:26:42.745 --> 00:26:46.500
on your own and
increasing your revenue.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.930
And actually I just
on this week's podcast

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:50.750
that just launched,
I had Greg Brogger,

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.970
who's the president of
an NASDAQ Private Market.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.200
And I don't know if
you're familiar with them.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:54.870
They launched.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.780
It's basically for
private companies

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:58.910
to get some liquidity.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.270
And he had his company
share his post.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:02.770
And he realized,
wow, you know what?

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.030
I can go along, of course.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:04.570
That's fine.

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:08.813
And he did like $1.8 I think
it was billion, $1.2 billion

00:27:08.813 --> 00:27:12.890
in the first 18 months of
his business of transactions,

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.320
and that was because of
Facebook and LinkedIn, Twitter

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.320
before they went public.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.636
Maybe not LinkedIn, but
certainly Facebook and I

00:27:18.636 --> 00:27:19.252
think Twitter.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:23.059
But it's hard.

00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:24.350
He didn't have the credibility.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.226
So he cut a deal with NASDAQ.

00:27:26.226 --> 00:27:28.100
I mean, how can you get
any better than that?

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.266
And NASDAQ then has the
advantage of going upstream.

00:27:30.266 --> 00:27:32.545
But his revenue-- and
he spent over a year.

00:27:32.545 --> 00:27:33.920
He cut that deal
a long time ago.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.000
He spent over a year developing,
building, doing these things.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.726
So in the first year, your
revenue is not going to change.

00:27:39.726 --> 00:27:40.350
That's the key.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.516
That's the thing to look at.

00:27:41.516 --> 00:27:44.110
When you're talking about
investing in a sumo,

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:46.010
in a BD layer in
a partnership, you

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:47.730
can't look at ROI over
a one-year period.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.690
You have to look
at ROI over three,

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:51.400
four year period, the long term.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.790
And in his
perspective, he's going

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.130
to achieve much more than
he could have achieved

00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:03.075
on his own, leveraging NASDAQ
and all the assets of NASDAQ

00:28:03.075 --> 00:28:04.800
in what he's going after.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.809
And it's not like NASDAQ
wants to go after that.

00:28:06.809 --> 00:28:08.600
NASDAQ wants the
relationship for upstream.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.010
These companies
eventually will go public.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.510
They'll have a relationship
with NASDAQ, that type of thing.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:16.080
But he knows that he
would be here on his own.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.727
And he goes with a
sumo, he'll be here.

00:28:17.727 --> 00:28:20.060
And it's the same thing with
TrueCar and other examples.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:24.720
So let me give you, I think the
next is an example-- oh no, OK.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.374
So when you're thinking
about BD versus sales,

00:28:27.374 --> 00:28:28.790
it's about thinking
strategically.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.610
And the question is
always, why partner?

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:31.970
Because you think about
you want to go to market,

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:32.670
why do you partner?

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.336
Well, do you want to
borrow credibility?

00:28:34.336 --> 00:28:35.410
We talked about that.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:39.059
Solving the chicken and egg
issue, there's differentiation.

00:28:39.059 --> 00:28:41.350
When we're going to market,
we're definitely different.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.040
There's no one else
representing USAA

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.880
to the dealer community
other than us.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.097
We are completely different
than Edmunds, and Autobytel,

00:28:48.097 --> 00:28:49.680
and others that are
selling out there.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.820
No one else has access
to this membership base.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.850
American Express
Black Card, Gold Card,

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:55.530
Platinum Card like we do.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:58.750
We are different, period.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.440
Risk, you can mitigate
some risk as you

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:04.440
go to market by leveraging
the assets of that sumo.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.324
Better platform for
disruption, certainly

00:29:06.324 --> 00:29:08.740
if you're in a space where you
want to disrupt leveraging,

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.390
again, the weight
of the sumo to help

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:12.830
you complete in your
organization, in your market

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:13.970
is key.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.950
And then of course
enterprise value.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.320
And again, I talked to a
lot of smaller companies,

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.610
and they're raising capital.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.026
And you cut a deal
like this, it's

00:29:21.026 --> 00:29:22.630
usually your valuation doubling.

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:25.630
And for them at the early
stages, it's very important.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:29.990
So that's the sumo
versus the gorilla.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:31.708
And now let's use an
example of Groupon.

00:29:31.708 --> 00:29:33.500
This is where Google plays in.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.100
So Groupon, we're all familiar
with Groupon, I'm sure.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:42.600
And Groupon went public
in November of 2011 at $25

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.360
and over time cratered down
to whatever it went down,

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.060
low of $4, $5-- $4, $3.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.655
And then it's climbing back
up in the $10, $11, $12 range.

00:29:51.655 --> 00:29:53.155
I don't even know
where it is today,

00:29:53.155 --> 00:29:55.780
but clearly a lot less
than what they went public.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:00.510
Everyone who bought stock
lost money pretty much.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:04.030
So let's look at Groupon as
an example of, in my view,

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.900
having no strategic
thought whatsoever

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.530
or installing a BD
layer, I should say.

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.455
So Google comes along
and says, hey, I

00:30:11.455 --> 00:30:15.446
want to buy you for $6
billion, I think it was.

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:16.760
And you know what Groupon said?

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.440
We all know.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.480
No, forget it.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.540
I'm not hooking up with you.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:25.360
Now, if you're Groupon and
Google is knocking on your door

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.247
and saying, hey,
I want to buy you,

00:30:27.247 --> 00:30:30.639
and you say no, what
should you assume?

00:30:30.639 --> 00:30:32.430
Google is going to come
in and try and kick

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.790
your ass afterwards, right?

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:38.160
Because there's no barrier
to entry in this space.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.190
So Google goes, all right.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:44.300
We all know, and then
Google builds Google Offers.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.532
That was inevitable.

00:30:45.532 --> 00:30:47.240
And there's a hundred
different companies

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.249
that do these flash
sales now, right?

00:30:50.249 --> 00:30:51.790
So this is why
Groupon is in trouble.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:53.706
This is why Groupon is
struggling to get back.

00:30:53.706 --> 00:30:55.630
Because the market's
saturated with this.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.390
Every yoga studio
and sandwich shop

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:59.099
is getting bombarded
by all these people.

00:30:59.099 --> 00:30:59.848
And you know what?

00:30:59.848 --> 00:31:02.400
If I'm going to pick, Groupon,
OK, they deliver some value.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.650
Oh no, I want to be on Google.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:05.720
There's an advantage
that Google has,

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.800
brand, presence, being
aligned with Google,

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.960
there's so many aspects to that.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.880
And Google's just bigger,
and it's hard to compete.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.230
So Groupon did do
a strategic deal.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.869
But this is where I say I don't
think it was the right one.

00:31:19.869 --> 00:31:21.910
It's an OK deal, but they
did a deal with Expedia

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:24.130
for partnership for the travel.

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:27.350
But that's not why people
and consumers go to Groupon.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.610
They're not looking to spend
$1,000 on a trip or $500

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:30.440
on a trip.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:36.790
They're looking to spend $11
for $30 of yoga activity.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.117
So they cut a deal, and it
actually didn't help them.

00:31:39.117 --> 00:31:40.950
They said, I don't want
to deal with travel,

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:42.033
so we'll just give it out.

00:31:42.033 --> 00:31:43.840
But they weren't
leveraging the sumo

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.677
to help compete with Google.

00:31:47.677 --> 00:31:49.635
Because Google wasn't
going to focus on travel.

00:31:49.635 --> 00:31:52.090
Google's focusing on the
sandwich shops, and the yoga

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:55.369
studios, and the hair
salons, exactly where

00:31:55.369 --> 00:31:56.160
Groupon's space is.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.990
And so is everyone
else is doing it.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.070
So as an example
of another company

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:05.180
that had a strategic view
of what to do, LivingSocial,

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:06.680
are you familiar
with LivingSocial?

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.740
They came up the
same time as Groupon.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.735
LivingSocial sees Google
getting in the space

00:32:12.735 --> 00:32:16.460
and says, holy shit,
what are we going to do?

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.210
We need to think about this.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:21.580
Because no one wants to
compete with Google, right?

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.220
So what do they do?

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.090
They cut a deal with Amazon
and create Amazon Local.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.970
That's a smart deal.

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:31.360
If you're going to
compete with Google,

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.620
I'd say the next company
to think about is Amazon.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.250
That is a deal that says, OK,
I'm prepared for the market.

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:40.600
I see what's coming.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.040
I need some differentiation,
and I need some power.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.190
So when LivingSocial is knocking
on the yoga studio's door,

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.930
and Groupon is and the
other hundred companies,

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:52.280
and they said, well, which
one am I going to choose?

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.529
Well, LivingSocial is
now as big as Amazon.

00:32:55.529 --> 00:32:56.570
The integration is there.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:59.540
So if you're on Amazon
and you're logged in,

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.700
and you buy an Amazon Local
product or service whatever

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.155
that is really powered
by LivingSocial,

00:33:06.155 --> 00:33:08.157
you don't have to
re-enter your information.

00:33:08.157 --> 00:33:09.490
They use the Amazon credit card.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:10.406
All that stuff exists.

00:33:10.406 --> 00:33:11.820
It's really, really simple.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.460
Amazon's got a great
reputation, obviously.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:18.790
It's growing, group of customers
that's spending a lot of money.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:20.340
So if you're
thinking about, where

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:20.900
do I want to go, you know what?

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.332
I want the clientele
from Amazon.

00:33:22.332 --> 00:33:24.290
I don't know what clientele
Groupon is getting,

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:27.554
but I know what clientele
LivingSocial is getting.

00:33:27.554 --> 00:33:29.720
And if you're a yoga studio,
you want a certain type

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.480
of clientele.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.450
You don't want someone who's
always looking for the discount

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:33.610
because then you'll
never make money.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:35.318
The idea is bring them
in, introduce them

00:33:35.318 --> 00:33:37.960
to what I can do, and then
ultimately they can pay.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:43.040
And Amazon has a
affluent demographic.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.960
So this is a big
difference here,

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.290
and this is how I look at
how to address the market.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:53.010
And so others will
ask often, well,

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.745
how do you identify a sumo?

00:33:54.745 --> 00:33:56.120
And so the easiest
way to do it--

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.578
there's multiple
ways of doing it--

00:33:57.578 --> 00:33:59.400
but the easiest way
is to think about,

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.830
if someone else did a
deal, if my competitor did

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:06.660
a deal with another company,
how am I going to get screwed?

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.400
So LivingSocial
will tell you, wow,

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.400
if Groupon did a
deal with Google,

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.725
that's going to screw me.

00:34:13.725 --> 00:34:15.600
Now, they didn't do the
deal, but then Google

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.840
gets in the space anyway.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.090
So if I have to compete with
Google and Google's going

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:21.880
to go acquire Groupon,
what should I do?

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.929
All right, I need to go
cut a deal with Amazon.

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:24.870
So you're thinking
about how you can

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.699
get hurt if someone-- so you're
either going to do that deal

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:29.485
or counter and do
a different deal

00:34:29.485 --> 00:34:31.235
or figure out how
you're going to respond.

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:34.270
Because you have to assume that
that deal is going to get done.

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:37.400
So SpareFoot's another
example of a company local

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.951
here in Austin.

00:34:39.951 --> 00:34:42.409
Very similar to TrueCar, I mean
from a modeling standpoint,

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:43.617
not in terms of what they do.

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.124
Largest inventory of
storage facilities, and you

00:34:49.124 --> 00:34:51.560
think, storage facilities,
how exciting is that?

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.059
These guys are
killing it right now.

00:34:53.059 --> 00:34:55.820
I think they just raised $50
million, another $50 million.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:59.720
So they're just
crushing the market.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.910
And what they're doing is
they're going and saying,

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:03.965
there's the Publics, which are
the big storage facilities,

00:35:03.965 --> 00:35:05.280
and that's one right there.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.312
And then there's
all these other guys

00:35:07.312 --> 00:35:08.770
that needs to
compete with Publics.

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:09.640
It's hard for them to do it.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.310
So SpareFoot is
this marketplace.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:12.070
You come online.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:14.880
You get to see what the price
is for that cube, what's

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.060
available, and then you
can book it right there.

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.060
And so they're helping
me get the smaller

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:23.710
guy able to compete where they
couldn't do it on their own.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.055
So SpareFoot's leveraging that.

00:35:25.055 --> 00:35:26.420
But what does SpareFoot need?

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:27.580
They need traffic.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.470
They need good quality traffic.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.710
So what do they do?

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.327
Yeah, they're doing their
SEN and of course optimizing

00:35:33.327 --> 00:35:35.167
as much as they can with SEO.

00:35:35.167 --> 00:35:38.139
But they're looking
for ways to get really

00:35:38.139 --> 00:35:40.055
good quality traffic
embedded at the time when

00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:41.280
a person needs it.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.220
So what do they do?

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.080
They cut at deal with
Penske Truck Rental.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.760
So now we got all these
people calling Penske saying,

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.550
hey, I want to book a truck.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:52.925
Great, now Penske can
offer, do you need storage?

00:35:52.925 --> 00:35:54.800
And a certain percentage
of the time they do.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.550
And you know what?

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.420
If a person needs storage and
they book it through SpareFoot

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.250
through Penske,
Penske's close rate

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:04.170
goes up substantially in
terms of them booking a truck.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.390
Because right now, Penske,
someone's calling up

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:09.220
and saying, what's your
rate versus U-Haul's rate?

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:12.180
And right now, U-Haul
has storage facilities.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.432
They do trucks and storage.

00:36:13.432 --> 00:36:14.890
Penske doesn't do
the storage side.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:16.230
They don't want to get into it.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.910
So Penske is winning
by getting access

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:20.750
to more facilities
than what U-Haul has,

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.005
8,000, 7,000, whatever it
is, with up-front pricing

00:36:23.005 --> 00:36:24.880
right there on all these
different facilities

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:28.110
so they can find the
best price in the market.

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:32.940
Plus, they're able to, because
of some revenue sharing,

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:36.430
they're able to supplement
even their pricing on Penske.

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:38.930
So now if you call
and you do the bundle,

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:43.314
your actual rate for your
truck could be lower.

00:36:43.314 --> 00:36:44.980
So when you're thinking
about competing,

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.110
how am I going to
compete with-- or if I'm

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:49.740
making a choice of Penske
or U-Haul, oh, well

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.200
the Penske truck's cheaper.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.150
Because I've got to
do the storage anyway.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:54.490
So there's an advantage to both.

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:56.770
But that's how SpareFoot--
and now that SpareFoot

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:59.506
is bringing this down to their
facilities and saying, listen,

00:36:59.506 --> 00:37:00.630
we have Penske volume here.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:01.921
You can't get that on your own.

00:37:01.921 --> 00:37:03.550
You want to sign
up for SpareFoot.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:07.445
So these are hard deals to
win, but they can be won.

00:37:07.445 --> 00:37:08.820
Usually it's from
the perspective

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.990
of a small guy getting the
attention of a big guy,

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.390
us trying to get the
attention of a Google.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:17.300
It's hard to do, or Amazon, or
any of these others, you know.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.805
So strategic partnerships,
it requires a change

00:37:19.805 --> 00:37:20.580
to embrace this.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:24.792
One is a mindset shift,
different from sales.

00:37:24.792 --> 00:37:26.500
What type of people
you're going to hire,

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.310
how you're going
to compensate them.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:31.300
People, we just talked about
different types of people

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.932
embrace sales versus BD.

00:37:33.932 --> 00:37:36.790
Process, the process could
change for how you manage them,

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:39.980
how you're going to organize
the company around the resources

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.845
necessary to execute on
a deal, and then culture.

00:37:42.845 --> 00:37:44.380
There needs to be
a culture shift,

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.150
embracing the idea that
a strategic deal is going

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.056
to bring value, but it's not
going to bring value now,

00:37:50.056 --> 00:37:51.380
not in the next year.

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.460
And we're all crunching
for our numbers.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:54.340
It's hard.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.260
It's not easy to embrace this.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.340
I have more challenges
internally sometimes getting

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.950
a deal one because the
COO or CTO is like,

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:02.940
what's the ROI on this?

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.648
And my answer is,
there's no ROI on this.

00:38:04.648 --> 00:38:05.810
Stop asking the question.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:07.360
That's not the right question.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.504
What's the opportunity
is the right question.

00:38:09.504 --> 00:38:11.920
But they don't want to deal
in that because it's too soft.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:17.312
So that is the sumo advantage.

00:38:17.312 --> 00:38:18.280
Yeah.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.120
And so the term sumo advantage
is an entrepreneur's alignment

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.920
with a major market
force, capability,

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.100
or accelerator with intent
to grow market share

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.250
and crush your competition.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.460
So I always talk
about small companies

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.367
should be thinking about how
to gain a sumo advantage when

00:38:33.367 --> 00:38:34.700
they're competing in the market.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.600
The Amazon Local
with the LivingSocial

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.760
is a great example of that.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.950
So that's it.

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:40.810
Thank you.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:42.930
I am a partner in
Capital Factory.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:45.630
And if any of you ever want
to come down, hang out, take

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.630
a tour, talk to others,
it's such a great place.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.340
There's much energy there.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.860
Entrepreneurs are
all over the place

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.841
and always looking for more
information and just meeting

00:38:53.841 --> 00:38:54.340
people.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.600
So it's a great place to be.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.900
Email me if you're interested.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.570
Also, I have a podcast,
"Extreme Biz Dev."

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:03.410
It's fun.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:04.300
Love it.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.510
So if you know of any
deals that are happening,

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:08.350
email me as well.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:11.390
You can just email me
bd@berniebrenner.com

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:14.260
or maybe on Twitter
or something.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.215
And I always need more content.

00:39:16.215 --> 00:39:19.410
I always love giving exposure
to deals that happen.

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:23.910
So that's it, and I'm
happy to answer questions.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:26.150
So what's the first one?

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:27.055
Anybody have any?

00:39:27.055 --> 00:39:27.555
Yes.

00:39:27.555 --> 00:39:30.669
AUDIENCE: So, how do you
quantify the success of someone

00:39:30.669 --> 00:39:35.350
in BD as opposed to sales
if they are separate?

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:40.400
BERNIE BRENNER: So in
terms of the BD pipeline,

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.170
because that's how you're
measuring performance here,

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.980
let's identify
the hunters first.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.220
So the typical
sales pipeline, I'm

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.459
selling paper cups--
this way more?

00:39:51.459 --> 00:39:52.750
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, just it's--

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.410
BERNIE BRENNER: Oh, sorry, OK.

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:54.990
MALE SPEAKER: You get washed
out on the screen there.

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:56.510
BERNIE BRENNER: Got it.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:58.110
I'm selling paper cups.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.560
So typical sales forecasting
is, all right, I've

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.300
pitched companies that buy
100,000 paper cups a month

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.740
or a quarter, and my probability
of closing this month is 10%,

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.100
so I'm going to
sell 10,000 cups.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.410
That's how you're
measuring that.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.530
BD is different.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:16.500
So there's what I've embraced
versus that, because you don't

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.620
want them focused on
the revenue, especially

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.490
since there isn't any
when they first close.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:21.730
You want to focus on closing.

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:24.730
So there are stages
of the BD deal.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:28.217
So there's targets, and
then there's pitches,

00:40:28.217 --> 00:40:29.800
and then the next
phase is, let's move

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.580
to a non-disclosure agreement.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:35.600
Then after that, they could fall
out, so they can go inactive.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.540
Or then you move
to a term sheet,

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.200
and then to an agreement,
and then you're launching.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.020
So I may say, all right, we're
going after the insurance

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:44.074
vertical TrueCar.

00:40:44.074 --> 00:40:46.240
And let's say at the time
we have no insurance guys.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.740
We have pretty much
all of them now.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:52.310
But what we want to do, we want
to align with three insurance

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:59.770
companies this year, of
the top 10, let's just say.

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:02.180
So I want 7 of
the top 10 pitched

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.371
in H1, first half of the year.

00:41:05.371 --> 00:41:14.410
I want two of them to
go to an NDA in H1,

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.297
and I want one of
them closed in H1.

00:41:16.297 --> 00:41:17.671
Let's just say
that's reasonable.

00:41:17.671 --> 00:41:19.960
It's practically not
with those big companies,

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.350
but that's the way you do it.

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:23.004
And by the end of
the year, we need

00:41:23.004 --> 00:41:24.670
to have three launched,
or two launched,

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.360
or whatever that
metric is, whatever

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.943
you think is important
and reasonable.

00:41:27.943 --> 00:41:29.452
If we already have
five on board,

00:41:29.452 --> 00:41:31.035
then getting the
next five is actually

00:41:31.035 --> 00:41:33.710
easier than the first
[INAUDIBLE] five.

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:35.467
So you're measure
them in stages, and I

00:41:35.467 --> 00:41:37.800
want to have three in this
phase, and two in this phase,

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.350
and one in this
phase, and whatever.

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:42.270
And if they don't hit it,
then it affects their bonus.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:45.390
But it's bonus
structure, and they're

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:49.110
measured on this identification
of the number in each segment.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.646
So let's say it's
insurance and then

00:41:50.646 --> 00:41:53.250
membership and then
financial institutions.

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:56.370
So we would have different
numbers to hit for each one.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.810
And their bonus is made up
primarily of their performance,

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:06.290
and then a certain
percentage-- let's say 25%--

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.739
is based on company performance.

00:42:07.739 --> 00:42:09.280
And everyone gets
options at TrueCar.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.100
That's how I do it.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.518
So they have to hit phases,
and if they're not hitting it,

00:42:13.518 --> 00:42:16.186
then it's very clear.

00:42:16.186 --> 00:42:17.810
So you have to identify
the objectives,

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.388
but it's not close this many
this month or this quarter.

00:42:20.388 --> 00:42:21.578
AUDIENCE: It must
be tough to assess

00:42:21.578 --> 00:42:23.250
the quality of the
relationship, right?

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:25.730
BERNIE BRENNER: Well,
the relationship--

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:28.195
you mean the quality of the
opportunity or the relationship

00:42:28.195 --> 00:42:28.960
that they're building?

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.280
AUDIENCE: The relationship
they're building.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.709
BERNIE BRENNER: Yeah, but
you're meeting with them.

00:42:32.709 --> 00:42:33.750
You're doing one-on-ones.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:36.570
You're understanding how
they're communicating

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:37.410
and what's going on.

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:38.820
You're seeing enough
activity to understand

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.460
whether they're
progressing or not.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.670
Look, it took me four years
to get Consumer Reports

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.540
because that deal,
they're a nonprofit.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.070
They think there's
no way we can get

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:48.812
into helping a
consumer buy a car.

00:42:48.812 --> 00:42:50.020
We're just about information.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:51.739
It took a long time
to convince them

00:42:51.739 --> 00:42:53.780
from a visionary standpoint
that they're actually

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.680
failing their members by
just giving them information.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:02.800
So you'll get an idea.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.170
I don't find that
to be that hard.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:06.800
It's more of the
understanding, look,

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.020
if you haven't pitched
10, what is your problem?

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.580
You're not getting
in the door right.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:15.400
So that's sort of a talent
assessment right there.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.310
If they just can't
get in the door right,

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.665
they don't know how to,
either they're junior

00:43:19.665 --> 00:43:22.666
and they need to be brought up
properly and mentored properly.

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:24.790
Or if they're a senior
person and they can't do it,

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:26.254
then you've got
to move them out.

00:43:26.254 --> 00:43:29.670
Maybe a different role,
but they're not doing it.

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:31.859
Now on the relationship
side, afterwards, the PDMs,

00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:32.900
that's a different story.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:36.150
So I say to them-- Partner
Development Managers--

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:38.039
I want you to identify
a three-year agenda.

00:43:38.039 --> 00:43:39.455
What are all the
things you can do

00:43:39.455 --> 00:43:41.375
with that partner over
the next three years?

00:43:41.375 --> 00:43:43.490
Put them all down, no time line.

00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:45.520
Just put them all down,
all the opportunities.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.470
Now, what do you think you
can get done in the next six

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:49.010
months?

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:50.250
You're not going to get it all
done, but what do you think's

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.310
reasonable?

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:54.600
Or the next year, and you
give that to the partner.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.689
You're not giving the
partner three years

00:43:56.689 --> 00:43:57.730
of things to think about.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:59.000
It's just too much,
and they need to focus,

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.110
and it's unreasonable, and
there's no [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:03.526
But if you focus on what we
can do in the next six months,

00:44:03.526 --> 00:44:05.289
you'll probably
get half of that.

00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:07.205
And then you're seeing
how that's progressing.

00:44:07.205 --> 00:44:10.040
And if you didn't get
the meaningful ones,

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:12.080
and you can see as
things are being deployed

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.007
and how their
relationship is building.

00:44:14.007 --> 00:44:16.090
Because if you're not
getting the meaningful ones,

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:18.214
if you're not getting the
ones that are hard to do,

00:44:18.214 --> 00:44:21.310
then the relationship
isn't progressing properly.

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:21.980
That make sense?

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:22.220
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.600
BERNIE BRENNER: So you can
see this has big impact.

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:29.480
Let's blast out an
email to 10,000 members

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.429
of the organization.

00:44:30.429 --> 00:44:32.345
And let's say the
organization has 10 million.

00:44:32.345 --> 00:44:35.390
OK, that's called a test.

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:37.850
If they don't get to half a
million or a million that year,

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:38.850
then something's wrong.

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:44.270
The test didn't work, or
they're blowing you off.

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.845
Make sense?

00:44:44.845 --> 00:44:45.470
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:47.303
BERNIE BRENNER: OK, so
that's how I do that.

00:44:47.303 --> 00:44:48.170
Yes.

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:50.545
AUDIENCE: I'm interested
in the piece where

00:44:50.545 --> 00:44:53.730
you talked about the
evangelical pitch.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:57.944
And maybe you could speak
to it to TrueCar just

00:44:57.944 --> 00:44:59.110
from a brand-agnostic piece.

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:05.067
But what do the big
companies tend to respond to?

00:45:05.067 --> 00:45:06.983
It's kind of like it has
to touch their spirit

00:45:06.983 --> 00:45:07.980
and inspire them.

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.220
BERNIE BRENNER: Yeah.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.386
AUDIENCE: Maybe innovation
gets thrown around a lot.

00:45:10.386 --> 00:45:13.100
If you can talk about ways
to find a pitch and what

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.200
speaks to the top guys.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.450
BERNIE BRENNER: Good question.

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:19.490
This gets back to
the not getting a no.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:23.520
So you think about, firstly, I
start off with the assumption

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.400
that in most cases--
not Google's case,

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.130
because you guys
are truly unique--

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:29.260
but intraprenurial
efforts rarely

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:31.030
work in a big corporation.

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:32.780
That's why they acquire
so many companies.

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:34.280
Either they don't
want to take the risk.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:35.135
They don't have the energy.

00:45:35.135 --> 00:45:36.885
They're not assigning
the people properly.

00:45:36.885 --> 00:45:40.350
You guys are different,
but in most cases,

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.460
inside efforts don't work
from a startup standpoint.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:47.170
So you going in and say
to a big company, hey,

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:50.010
this is my vision, and
this is going to happen.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.800
And you're doing it,
this evangelic pitch,

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.640
with such conviction
that this is

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.390
going to happen whether
you're on the train or not.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:58.160
This train's moving.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.080
Are you sitting?

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.800
Are you at the train station,
or are you on the train?

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.815
And all that is is
making them think, shit,

00:46:03.815 --> 00:46:05.376
do I not want to
be on the train?

00:46:05.376 --> 00:46:07.000
I mean, really it's
that type of thing.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.230
I don't want to say
no to a train that's

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:10.180
moving when I want to
move in that direction.

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.580
So I can't say no yet.

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.237
And you're creating
this opportunity,

00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:14.820
but it's really about
this conviction.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:15.960
We are going to make this work.

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.543
We've raised whatever
amount of money,

00:46:17.543 --> 00:46:19.230
or we have this
many people, and we

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:22.091
are focused on this one
thing-- you're welcome, thanks.

00:46:22.091 --> 00:46:23.840
We're focused on this
one thing, and we're

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.940
going to get this to work right.

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:25.689
And you know what?

00:46:25.689 --> 00:46:27.180
This could be great for you too.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.730
Now, a lot of times,
they don't think

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:31.574
how great it's going to
be because they think,

00:46:31.574 --> 00:46:32.240
well, we're big.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.770
How can you really
do this for us?

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:36.410
But it's the idea of that
wow, if I don't do this,

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:39.430
do I want to be the person
that says no to this?

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:42.140
And so it's sort of
that balance of keeping

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:44.510
them intrigued enough
so that you don't

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.262
get the no but with
absolute conviction

00:46:46.262 --> 00:46:47.470
that this is going to happen.

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:48.540
That's one way.

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:51.540
The other way is to-- a
part of that conviction--

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:56.300
is to do something that I refer
to as triangular attraction.

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.060
So I'll give you an example.

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:02.030
In '97, I founded a
company called Promisemark.

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:06.130
And this was in the
internet security privacy

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:09.960
space, identity theft, before
it exploded and became real big.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:13.070
So I thought that was going
to be a big opportunity.

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:15.375
And it was taking a different
approach to the problem.

00:47:15.375 --> 00:47:19.510
It was dealing the viruses,
and firewalls, and all

00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:22.760
that other crap that
technology is working with,

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.610
but putting a service
component to it,

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:26.490
basically a warranty,
an insurance policy.

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:28.480
Hey, listen, if you
ever get a virus

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.730
and it messes up your computer,
we'll fix it for free.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:34.376
You lose your data, we'll
get it back, no problem.

00:47:34.376 --> 00:47:36.750
You're a victim of identity
theft, we'll fix the problem.

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:39.000
We have people here,
and we'll cover you

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.790
for $100,000 worth of
damage or whatever.

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:44.310
Back then, we were
the pioneers in this.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:46.720
So in order to launch this
company, I had no money.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.670
I did not raise any money
yet, or any big money.

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:51.130
I had probably a
little seed money.

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:54.700
I'm sitting in my
basement, and I'm

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:58.250
negotiating with these two
multi-billion dollar companies.

00:47:58.250 --> 00:47:59.280
And it's just me.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.570
One of them is the company
called Aon Warranty Group,

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:05.340
which was the largest specialty
underwriter in the world

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:08.740
for warranties and
administration of warranties.

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.589
And the other was
Symantec for Norton.

00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:12.630
So I'm calling each of
them, and I'm saying, hey,

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:14.550
you need to be part of this.

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:15.990
And then they're saying, yeah,
we need to be part of it.

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:18.120
And of course, none of them have
a reason to be part of this.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.495
They're like, it's
too much risk.

00:48:19.495 --> 00:48:21.270
Is this really going to be big?

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:22.785
So what I had to
do was say, listen,

00:48:22.785 --> 00:48:26.230
when I was talking to Aon--
the [INAUDIBLE] margin

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:27.612
group-- I'm saying, listen.

00:48:27.612 --> 00:48:28.820
Symantec is involved in this.

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.270
They're really interested,
which was true.

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:32.600
I am in dialogue with them.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.661
At that point, Aon,
it can't say no.

00:48:35.661 --> 00:48:36.660
They're like, holy crap.

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.390
Well, the train is moving.

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:40.871
And Symantec may be on it,
another multi-billion dollar

00:48:40.871 --> 00:48:41.370
company?

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:44.300
All right, I can't
say no to this yet.

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.980
Now, when I'm on the
phone with Symantec,

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:50.110
I'm saying, Aon Warranty
Group, the largest specialty

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:54.010
underwriter in the world who
provides all the warranties

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:56.450
for at the time CompUSA
when it was still around,

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:58.730
Staples, and this
one and that one,

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:00.987
they're interested in
supporting this product

00:49:00.987 --> 00:49:02.070
and taking the market too.

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:04.810
At that point, Symantec
couldn't say no.

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:08.110
They weren't saying yes yet,
but there's no way-- again,

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:10.330
I'm communicating this
what's going to happen.

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:16.460
And this train is moving,
and at that point,

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:18.040
I was leveraging
them to validate

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.210
what I was doing, which
is they couldn't say

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:22.910
no because if Aon's
in it, it could

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:24.200
be a problem for Symantec.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.991
They want to be involved,
and they'd rather

00:49:25.991 --> 00:49:28.140
be involved than
McAfee be involved.

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.220
And same thing with Aon.

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.337
Symantec's involved,
all right, well,

00:49:31.337 --> 00:49:33.170
Bernie can get underwriting
in other places.

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:34.570
We're the largest
specialty underwriter.

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:35.820
We should be involved in this.

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.050
And it ultimately worked.

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:41.310
And we went to market, and then
I sold the company to Experian.

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:49.220
So that's how I use the pitch,
the evangelic conviction

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.987
that these companies should
at least be talking to me.

00:49:51.987 --> 00:49:53.320
Not everyone's going to say yes.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.709
But even when they
don't say yes--

00:49:55.709 --> 00:49:57.250
Consumer Reports
never said no to me.

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.750
It took four years
to do the deal.

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:00.662
I never got a no.

00:50:00.662 --> 00:50:02.620
They got, well, I don't
know if we can do this.

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:03.480
We can't do this.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.700
It doesn't seem right.

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.360
That wasn't a flat out,
don't call me again, Bernie.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.850
I never got a no.

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:11.200
It took four years to get a
yes, but I never got a no.

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.360
And that's what you want.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.090
Other questions?

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:20.020
All right, well
thank you very much.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.520
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.561
BERNIE BRENNER: Everyone
a free copy of the book,

00:50:23.561 --> 00:50:24.570
and I brought some--
