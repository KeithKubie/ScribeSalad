00:00:05.994 --> 00:00:08.119
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: Hello,
and welcome to I/O Live.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.800
I'm Florina
Muntenescu, your host.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.950
And I'm here with Matt
Henderson from Google Play.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.640
Hello, Matt.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.431
MATT HENDERSON: Hi.

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:15.473
Super excited to be here.

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:17.014
FLORINA MUNTENESCU:
So tell me what's

00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:18.650
new in Google Play
for developers?

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.380
MATT HENDERSON: There's tons of
new stuff launching this year,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.090
broadly speaking,
in three areas.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.280
So we've got a whole
new format, a new app

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.657
model that's launching today.

00:00:27.657 --> 00:00:29.240
We've also got a
bunch of new features

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.360
that help developers to do
testing and prevent bugs

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.650
in their apps.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.170
And we also have some
features launching today,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.450
which help developers
to manage their business

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.909
and to grow their
business on Play.

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:40.866
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: OK.

00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.669
This new app model
sounds interesting.

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:43.710
Can I hear more about it?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.585
MATT HENDERSON: Yeah.

00:00:44.585 --> 00:00:47.190
So there's really
two different things

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.940
that we're launching
within the app model.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.590
So one is the
Android app bundle.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.470
That's a new format,
a publishing format,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.920
that a developer can use
that enables him to reduce

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.230
the size of their app.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.819
The Android app bundle makes
use of a Play technology--

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.680
Play dynamic delivery.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.990
And together, it
serves the optimal APK

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.540
for a user's given device.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.580
And so it optimizes for the
user-specific CPU architecture

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.690
of their device.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.440
It optimizes for their
screen densities.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.160
It optimizes for
the user's languages

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.580
that they speak as well.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.950
And so by only sending the parts
of the bundle that the user

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.790
actually needs, it means that
the APK that goes to the device

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.020
is a lot smaller.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.900
And that, in turn,
enables much better

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.520
install conversion rates,
enables lower uninstall rates.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.684
Because when the app sizes are
too big, users react badly.

00:01:49.684 --> 00:01:52.100
And so that's something we're
launching today that I think

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.980
is going to be a big
win for developers.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.680
FLORINA MUNTENESCU:
And you also mentioned

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.970
something about testing.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.629
Tell me more.

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:59.170
MATT HENDERSON: As
developers, you'll

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.990
have noticed if-- during
the release process,

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.560
it's a time of risk.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.890
Because you can have bugs
going out with a new release.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.009
And we have new
testing track features

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.360
that help to reduce that risk.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.810
And so you can now
use Play Publishing

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.815
for testing and
sending out the APK

00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:22.550
to up to 100 internal
dog food testers.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.330
So that's the internal
testing track.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.030
We also now have multiple
testing tracks for close betas.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.320
And then, also to help you
reduce the bugs in your apps

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.600
and improve that
quality, there's

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.850
some new features
in Android Vitals

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.260
and new features in
the pre-launch report.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.600
In Vitals, we have new
metrics, like app startup time.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.630
We've also launched a new
overview page in Vitals

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.610
that draws your
attention to anomalies.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.560
If some of the Vitals
metrics are particularly bad,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.195
then it'll highlight
those to you

00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:58.820
so you know which
ones to prioritize.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.620
With the pre-launch
report-- so that

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.330
is the automated crawler
that tests apps prior to them

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.830
going into production.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.440
And we've launched
some new features today

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.390
that enable you to reach further
into the corners of your app

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.250
that the crawler might not
have otherwise reached.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.590
Features like, a developer
can record scripts

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.920
in Android Studio that
help the crawler to go

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.780
into particular
parts of the app.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.260
Game developers,
if you use Open GL,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.590
you can create demo loops that
help the pre-launch report

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.960
crawler to reach different
parts of your app as well.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.870
And so all these
features will mean

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.740
that once your app
hits production,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.180
it's been much more scrutinized,
eliminating more of these bugs.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.490
We're launching a
new app dashboard

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.010
in the console, which
summarizes a range

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.630
of different statistics.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.670
It's, I think, much easier at
drawing the user into the most

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.660
important metrics.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.270
You can also
configure the page now

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.240
depending on which ones
are priorities for you.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.250
And we have some
new business stats

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.320
that we're launching as well.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.880
For subscription developers, if
you have a subscription model,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.020
there is now a more complex
view to understand it at greater

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.709
detail of different subscription
states-- subscriber states--

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.390
and how you benchmark retention
for your app versus other apps

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.040
as well.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.120
You can look at new metrics,
like average revenue per user.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.990
There's new data about the
acquisition and user retention

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.695
funnel.

00:04:36.695 --> 00:04:39.650
There you can also
compare your stats

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.750
for your app against
benchmark for peer apps

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.000
that are functionally similar.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.280
So all of these
things hopefully help

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.500
developers discover
opportunities

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.054
that can enable them to grow
and be successful in Play.

00:04:51.054 --> 00:04:52.220
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: Perfect.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.200
Lots of new things for
developers, but also

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.975
for the business side.

00:04:55.975 --> 00:04:57.350
Thank you, Matt.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.940
This is Florina for I/O Live.
