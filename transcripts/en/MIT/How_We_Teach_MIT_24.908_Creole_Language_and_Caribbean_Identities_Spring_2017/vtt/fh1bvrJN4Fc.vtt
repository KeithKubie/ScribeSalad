MICHEL DEGRAFF: So
I start the class.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.270
On the very first day,
while they are still

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.120
fresh and unsuspecting
of the class contents,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.730
of my own ideology, I
give them a survey where

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.470
I ask very simple questions.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.140
You know, their
major, their year.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.090
But I also ask them
personal questions.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.410
Where were they born?

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.850
Where did they travel?

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.380
And during what years?

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.370
They were in which parts of
the country or the world?

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.310
And I asked them about some
of the course contents.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.780
You know, what do they know
about Creole languages?

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.730
How they define identity.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.500
What does identity mean?

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.360
What kind of images
does the word Caribbean

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.240
trigger in their minds?

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.130
So, very easy
questions to answer.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.440
But through these questions,
I'm able to see and to get

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.090
a sense of both the
personal background,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.040
but also what kind
of assumptions

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.670
they bring to the course.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.280
And then I can use that to
kind of have a beginning where

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.920
I can address these fundamental
assumptions that they do bring

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.610
in the course, and also
to connect the discussion

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.710
to the personal profiles.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.050
And then as we progress,
I can, from time to time,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.140
check to see how some of the
ideas might have mutated,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.890
might have evolved
through our discussions.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.740
So it's a nice
benchmark to start with.
