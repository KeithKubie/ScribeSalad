00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.260
JEN DEVINS: Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.440
Thanks for coming.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.020
We're really excited to
have you all here today.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.540
My name is Jen Devins.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.290
I lead the user experience
team for Google accessibility.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.050
And with me, I
have Andrea Wong--

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.750
she's a researcher
on accessibility;

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.590
Catherine Idylle, who is a
designer on accessibility;

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.220
and Bethany Fong, who is
the lead designer on Google

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.660
material design.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.850
We're really happy to have
such a great crowd here

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.216
that's interested in inclusive
design and accessibility,

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:42.090
and we're looking forward
to sharing with you

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.490
how you can make your
products more inclusive.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.630
But before we dive in
and get into specifics,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.310
we wanted to start
with just some basics--

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.670
what is accessibility, inclusive
design, and why it's important.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.670
As described by the Web
Accessibility Initiative,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.930
accessibility, usability,
and inclusive design

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.730
are all very closely related.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.010
Their goals, approaches,
and guidelines

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.080
overlap significantly.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.260
And when we sit down to
design and develop our apps,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.560
it's really effective to
address them together.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.660
Let's start with accessibility.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.400
Accessibility focuses
on enabling users

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.330
with disabilities to perceive,
interact, understand,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.350
and navigate tools and
services and products,

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.220
and that they can contribute
equally without barriers.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.120
Now, some of the guidelines we
think about with accessibility,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.090
such as clear color contrast
or clear, concise writing,

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.390
are useful not only to
users with disabilities

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.942
but also those that might be--

00:01:57.942 --> 00:01:59.650
or that don't have
disabilities but might

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.070
be in different situations.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.780
For example, we know
that alternative text

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.680
can be useful to users who are
blind and can't see the screen,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.430
as it describes the
imagery and visual icons.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.060
Alternative text can
also be useful to users

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.290
who might be out in remote
locations with low bandwidth

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.510
or using old technology.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.970
Another example-- it's clear
that providing enough time

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.160
for users to interact with
and read content on the screen

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.700
is useful for users who
might have a motor impairment

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.620
or cognitive impairment.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.760
This extra time is also
very useful for users

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.340
that might be learning
a new language

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.570
or have low literacy, or
children learning to read,

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.830
or simply just
people distracted.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.540
And this is how accessibility
is a key component

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.760
of inclusive design.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.750
Inclusive design is all about
considering the wide range

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.880
of human abilities.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.060
We think of age, gender,
ethnicity, and others.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.090
And as you can
see, accessibility

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.820
overlaps significantly
with these areas as well.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.570
And that's why we feel
like accessibility is

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.100
a really clear starting point.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.120
So at this point, we could
just throw up on the screen

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.640
a checklist of
guidelines for you

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.860
to follow to ensure that
your product is accessible.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.080
And that's a great place to
start, no doubt about it.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.320
However, what we've
seen is that may often

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.690
lead to a product that's
technically accessible but not

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.640
necessarily usable, let alone a
great experience for all users.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.440
And this is where
usability comes into play.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.650
Now how many people, by
a quick show of hands,

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.250
take time to reach out and get
feedback and input from users?

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.540
Quick show of hands-- right.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.140
It's an important and really
useful thing to do, right?

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.149
Unfortunately, we know that a
lot of users with disabilities

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:22.830
are left out of this really key
critical point in the process.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.660
If we're not out there talking
and observing our users,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.720
we'll never understand, what
are their true experiences?

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.010
What are their challenges?

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.470
And most importantly,
what are their insights

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.300
that could actually
benefit everyone?

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.050
And in the end, you
could be left missing out

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.040
on a large number
of potential users

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.370
and also miss out on helping
existing users who might be

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.510
in these limiting situations.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.510
OK, so that's the basics.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.960
We've got the stage set.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.960
Now, we want to walk you
through more of a case study

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.210
to demonstrate how
to design and develop

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.530
with accessibility in mind.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.700
Today, we're going to
use our fictional app.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.032
It's a travel and
hospitality app called Crane.

00:05:19.032 --> 00:05:21.490
And we're going to use this
throughout the rest of the talk

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.190
to demonstrate specifics of
how to make products more

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.770
inclusive using the standard
user-centered design

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.860
methodologies, as well as
material design system, which

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.050
includes clear guidelines,
components, and tooling.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.740
So to get this started,
we're going to break it down

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.560
into four primary stages.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.910
We have defining the product
vision, design, development,

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.640
and after design.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.280
Now, this framework probably
seems familiar to you,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.480
and that's on purpose.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.750
We're not here to introduce
yet another process for you

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.320
to follow.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.280
Instead, we see this as a
tool kit of ideas and things

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.340
that you can do to
enhance your product

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.530
to make it more inclusive,
because in the end,

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:18.184
inclusive design is really
just simply good design.

00:06:18.184 --> 00:06:20.600
OK, so now Andrea is going to
walk through the first stage

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.259
of defining the product vision.

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:24.300
ANDREA WONG: Thanks, Jen.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.460
Stage one, defining
the product vision.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.310
No matter what you're
building, understanding

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.710
what problems you're
solving for users

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.590
is the key to product success.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.950
So who are your users?

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.900
Most teams start
with the assumption

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.930
that all their users
are fully-abled,

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.760
but that may not
always be the case.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.780
So let's say you're
building a photos app.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.600
And you think, well, why
would someone who is blind

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.820
use my photos app?

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.570
Actually, a person who
is blind may use your app

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.180
because they want to
take photos and then

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.490
share them with
friends and families

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:12.060
or post them on social media,
just like everyone else.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.200
Consider these three
people on the screen.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.470
There's a man in a wheelchair
with Lou Gehrig's disease.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.035
So he has impaired
motor functioning

00:07:20.035 --> 00:07:22.000
for upper and lower body.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.040
There's a boy with a broken arm.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.490
And there's a woman holding
a full bag of groceries.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.410
Let's have a pop quiz.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.730
Which of these three people
have limited mobility.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.690
Raise their hand if you think
it's the man in the wheelchair.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.200
OK, hands down.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.280
Raise your hand if you
think it's the boy.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.850
Thank you.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.360
And lastly, raise your hand
if you think it's the woman.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:02.090
So if you raised your hands all
three times, you're correct.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.990
All three of them have
a different relationship

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.600
with limited mobility,
whether it's permanent,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.070
like the man; temporary,
like the boy; or situational,

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.950
like the woman
with the groceries.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:19.520
Yet, they're all experiencing
the exact same need right now.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.240
It's a good reminder that
for every single one of us,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.940
we'll have accessibility
needs at some point

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.990
throughout our lifetime.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:33.240
Disability is a much broader
term than we might think.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.090
And often, when something
doesn't work well

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.510
for a user with no
disabilities, that pain point

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.929
is amplified for people
with disabilities.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.060
And that's actually
good news for you,

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.730
because it gives you much
clearer signals of what

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.350
you should be focusing on.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.900
Because when everything doesn't
work-- when something doesn't

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.330
work for everyone, it
clearly is something

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.915
that you should be
paying attention to.

00:08:56.915 --> 00:08:59.040
And that's, in fact, what
we found with our studies

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.660
at Google.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.410
All users have the same core
needs because they're all

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.380
trying to meet the
same goal, whether it's

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.590
sending a photograph,
writing a email,

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.090
buying CryptoKitties,
whatever it is.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.440
So at this point, you're
probably asking, well,

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.770
how do I do research with
people with disabilities?

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:24.060
The answer is do
what you usually do.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.340
Are you, let's say
in the early stage

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.460
right now, where you're
just chatting and sitting

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.310
down and talking to users?

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.950
If you are, that's actually
the easiest and the best time

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.400
to be including users with
disabilities into your process,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.670
because you can get their
context, their needs,

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.990
and everything right
from the very start.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:47.820
You can ask the
exact same questions

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.030
as you would to someone
without disabilities.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.730
The only difference
is you have to ask

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.270
a few additional questions about
this assistive technologies

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.940
they may be using and
their context of use.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.050
So for example,
you'll be asking, say,

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.300
how do you use your
assistive technologies

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.150
when you're navigating
a mobile device?

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.250
Or how does your
impairment impact

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:16.220
or not impact your interactions
when you're planning travel?

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.980
Or maybe even, which
workarounds, if any,

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.590
do you use to get
to what you need?

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:26.450
And always, always follow
up after each question with,

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.600
why, tell me more,
to really dig in

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.580
there to get to the
context of their needs.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.890
The bonus here is
their answers may

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.040
inspire new ways of
interactions they've never

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.690
thought of before.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.000
Or maybe you're past
that stage already.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.170
That's fine.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:49.430
Right now, you're testing a
low-fidelity paper prototype.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.430
That's fine.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.410
You can still test with
people with disabilities.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:58.420
Let's say you're testing with
a user who is blind and uses

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.960
a screen reader, which is an
assistive at the technology

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.690
that reads out loud the
contents on the screen.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.910
So you're doing that, but
you don't have a screen

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.350
reader-friendly prototype.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.170
What you can do here,
though, is write

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.940
a script of what the
screen reader might

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.180
verbalize and have
someone on your team act

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.010
as a screen reader.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.400
And that person can read each
step out loud to the user

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.620
as they walk through the user
flow during the study session.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:32.000
By integrating people with
disabilities, whenever you're

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.550
talking to people
without disabilities,

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.610
you're automatically ensuring
that their viewpoints will

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.400
be included and
part of the process

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.780
throughout the entire design
and the development phases.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.670
Along with understanding
user needs,

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.860
you need to have a
general comprehension

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.280
of assistive technologies
and the different tools

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.980
that people may use
interact with your product.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:02.310
Trying the technologies yourself
is a great place to start,

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:07.350
but the best way to learn is
to observe the real experts.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.870
Those are the people who
use these technologies day

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.740
in and day out.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.160
And if you can't find someone
to observe in real life,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.240
that's OK.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.020
You can just go online and ask--
look for any kind of video.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.479
Whether it's like
going to the ATM,

00:12:21.479 --> 00:12:22.853
going to the
grocery store, there

00:12:22.853 --> 00:12:24.310
are countless
great videos online

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.440
to explain the different
ways people use

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.630
different technologies.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.910
The goal here is
to understand what

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.900
makes a good versus a
poor experience, what

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.930
are the common pitfalls, and
the standard expectations

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.310
that people have when
using your site or app.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.340
Later, using our fictional
app, Crane, we'll

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.370
walk you through designing
a great keyboard navigation

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.780
model.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.200
Starting with a keyboard
navigation model

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.702
creates a very good
foundation for you

00:12:55.702 --> 00:12:57.910
when building for other
assistive technologies, which

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:58.900
we won't go into here.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.880
You may be feeling a bit
overwhelmed right now at how

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.320
to design to meet
all those needs,

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.440
but the great thing
about design inclusively

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.810
is that people on
teams have been working

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:14.020
for years to understand what
design inclusively actually

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.690
means.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.890
So as Jen mentioned,
material design components

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.120
includes accessibility
guidelines

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.459
baked right in that anyone
can follow, regardless

00:13:24.459 --> 00:13:25.500
of the size of your team.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.100
Doing the right
thing, though, isn't

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.450
necessarily mutually exclusive
to good business sense either.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.030
It could even increase
your market share.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.520
According to the American
Institute of Research,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.460
who came out with this
report a few months ago,

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.730
working-age people with
disabilities in the US

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:53.230
alone have a discretionary
income of $21 billion.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:58.290
That's the third largest market
segment in the entire country.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.500
Then, if you think about
their families and friends who

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.910
may also use your product to
interact with them, or they

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.930
may just simply
appreciate good design.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.930
And this is not
just the US alone.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:15.620
According to Gartner,
people with disabilities

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.710
and their friends
and family worldwide

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:25.822
have a collective disposable
income of $8 trillion dollars.

00:14:25.822 --> 00:14:26.530
Think about that.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.720
OK, that was a lot
of information,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.240
so let's go over the important
points to keep in mind.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.340
One, talk to people
with disabilities

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.568
to inform your product vision.

00:14:41.568 --> 00:14:46.320
Two, learn assistive
technologies from the experts.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.180
And three, build a better
experience for all users

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.237
and potentially capture
more market share.

00:14:53.237 --> 00:14:55.570
Now, I'm going to hand it
over to Catherine, who's going

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.882
to go over stage two, design.

00:14:57.882 --> 00:14:59.090
CATHERINE IDYLLE: Right here.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.410
ANDREA WONG: Oh,
you're right here.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.785
CATHERINE IDYLLE:
Thanks, Andrea.

00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:04.636
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:06.034 --> 00:15:07.900
Hi.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.300
Now that you've defined
your product vision,

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.700
it's time to design your app.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.290
At this stage,
you'll need to think

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:19.900
about interaction design, visual
design, UX writing, and motion

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:20.980
design.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.090
But don't worry.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.430
We'll do a design
challenge together

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:29.060
using our fictional app,
Crane, to learn how to do this.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.750
So Crane is a travel
and hospitality app

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.860
that lets users book flights
and accommodations on a computer

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.490
or phone.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.350
In terms of
interaction design, you

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.180
might be wondering,
how do I even

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:47.140
get started design accessible
and usable experience

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.400
for everyone?

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.830
Well, design as you normally do.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.050
Have your wireframes
and your sketches,

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:56.080
and we'll get started there.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.740
This is a wireframe of filter
options on mobile when you

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.170
search for a flight on Crane.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.870
Here, we can see that
the checkboxes are

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:09.400
aligned with the label, but
they're pretty far apart.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.850
When designing your layout,
ensured that related content

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.010
and controls are
grouped together.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.350
This makes it
easier to understand

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.400
and also easier to reach for
people with motor disabilities,

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.760
especially for people with ALS
or a traveler on a bumpy train.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.910
So what we did here is that
we placed the checkboxes

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.920
right next to the labels.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.820
It's just a better
experience for everyone.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.970
In terms of
interaction design, you

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.360
can also have a huge
impact on all users

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.630
by thinking about the
tab interaction model,

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.840
meaning a great
keyboard experience.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:55.120
Here, we have a wireframe on web
of the flight search results.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.570
Tabbing on the keyboard
allows you to jump from one

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.940
interactive element
on the screen,

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.500
as we can see right here.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.040
This would be the
default tab experience

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.260
if we didn't design it at all.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:12.520
It would take 94
tabs stops to go

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:18.369
from point A, the back button,
to point B, the filter options.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.310
This is a slow experience.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:25.800
So what we can do is
actually group major elements

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.880
together, like this list
of individual flights.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:36.930
Now, it only takes seven
tab stops to reach point B.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.510
And once you've grouped
your big tab stops together,

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.140
don't forget how to
quickly navigate to those

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:47.080
smaller elements, such
as the individual flights

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.440
in this big list of flights.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.400
Here, we'll go with an
up and down arrow option

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.080
to navigate between them.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.270
Overall, this is a much better
and productive experience

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.960
for power users, much like
yourselves right here,

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.300
and assistive tech users alike.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.960
Here are some things
you can do to make

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.550
your app more accessible in
terms of interaction design.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:20.750
Group your content and
your controls together.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.710
Design your tab
interaction model.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.180
And don't forget the
error navigation as well.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.736
Now, onto Bethany to
talk about visual design.

00:18:30.736 --> 00:18:33.592
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.480
BETHANY FONG: Thanks, Catherine.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.190
So now that we've
laid a good foundation

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:42.640
in terms of interaction design,
let's refine our visuals.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.590
Now, to start with
the very basics,

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.060
I'm sure you all have felt the
pain of viewing light gray text

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.900
on light gray background.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.520
Let's not put our
users through that.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.780
So the number one way that you
can be a hero for these users

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.030
is by ensuring that
color contrast is--

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.250
between your foreground and
your background colors is

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:01.720
going to be high enough.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.610
And you can use our
material color tool,

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.946
pictured here, to check the
legibility of your choices

00:19:06.946 --> 00:19:09.070
and check them against
different background colors,

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.830
like the three shades of purple
here that we were exploring

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:14.510
for the Crane app.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:15.999
So let's apply this.

00:19:15.999 --> 00:19:17.540
Going back to our
app, where the user

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.510
is filling in their information
to purchase their flight,

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.450
these faded colors that
you see are trendy,

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.730
but the contrast
is so low that it's

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.220
hard for even most
sighted users to have

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.360
a legible experience here.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.710
And remember, this is going to
be better not just for users

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.740
with low vision but
someone with dilated eyes

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.840
after a doctor's
appointment or people

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.150
like yourselves, out
in the sun all day

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.130
with glare on your screen.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.990
So let's add more
color contrast.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.570
First, we're going to zoom
in on how we can add contrast

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.600
into the text field component.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.450
We increase the font
weight and color darkness

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.480
in the text fields, which
makes it easier to scan

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.750
and ensures a better
visual hierarchy.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.430
And we also increase the
background color darkness

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.880
on the button at the bottom,
making the text more legible

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.550
and making the
call-to-action much easier

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.475
to spot, which is
really important,

00:20:12.475 --> 00:20:14.600
because you're trying to
get your users to purchase

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.830
something here.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.810
And already with the
before and after,

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:21.570
you can see that this
is a much better design.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.360
Other than just looking
more aesthetically pleasing,

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.990
the text is more legible.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.590
The relative importance
of elements is clearer.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.780
And the call-to-action
are a lot easier to spot.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.470
So now, your user is
filling in their information

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.690
into those much
better text fields

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:40.030
and is getting closer
to booking that flight.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.160
But it looks like
they made an error.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.890
Some users can tell because
of the bolded orange outline.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.670
However, some users
with color blindness

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.460
might miss this important
piece of information,

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.170
and this can be fixed
by supplementing

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:56.530
any information that's coded
in color through other means,

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.140
like icons or shapes.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.810
So we're going to check
out the material icon site

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.670
and search for error icons.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.670
It's good to use a central
resource like this,

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.410
because these are common
visual metaphors that

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.860
may be recognizable to
a wide variety of users.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.550
So it looks like we can
go ahead and use this one.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:18.460
So we're going to download
it, add it to our text field,

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.230
and now, there are
two ways to understand

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.610
that this is an error state.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.190
And this makes it clearer
for everyone, not just

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.010
users who are color blind.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.180
And for our last
visual design example,

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.840
let's look at focus state
and element size on screen.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.950
So when users choose a
seat in this travel app,

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.620
it's important that they can
select the seat that they want

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.720
and that they know that their
selection was successful.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.900
And on mobile, this means
having a touch target

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:48.530
size of 48 dp by 48 dp, or
about seven millimeters wide,

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.690
which is calibrated against
the size of an adult fingertip.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.593
Makes sense.

00:21:53.593 --> 00:21:57.660
And on web, try to ensure that
your focus is highly visible.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.700
You can see it as a bold
purple outline around seat 8A.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.997
So when you're doing
your visual design,

00:22:05.997 --> 00:22:08.580
when keeping it accessible, make
sure that you have high color

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:09.720
contrast.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.210
Make sure that you have
multiple visible indicators

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.490
for any important
component states.

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.330
And lastly, make sure
that your touch target

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.746
sizes are going
to be large enough

00:22:17.746 --> 00:22:20.600
for people to actually reach.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.871
Back over to Catherine.

00:22:22.871 --> 00:22:24.302
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:24.302 --> 00:22:26.250
CATHERINE IDYLLE:
Thanks, Bethany.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.610
I'm back.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.640
With writing, you have the
power to guide all users

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.490
with accessible onscreen
text, as well as

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:36.380
meaningful off-screen
text that'll

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.380
be verbalized by
the screen reader.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.270
A screen reader is
software that sits

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.810
between you and the application,
and it works in tandem

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:46.440
with the keyboard.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.280
The keyboard moves the
focus, and the screen reader

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.000
will verbalize whatever
has come into focus.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.160
We have this example
from Google.org com,

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.890
if you heard of it, and
it'll read this button

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.800
as Google Search button.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.470
Because a screen reader
automatically reads out loud

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:09.050
the label, Google Search,
and the control type, button.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.060
So back to our Crane app.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.590
Here we have a checkout screen.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.090
It has several
interactive elements,

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.750
but let's just focus
on these four buttons.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.360
And remember, the screen
reader automatically

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.640
reads out loud the control type.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:28.790
So it'll verbalize these buttons
as button, button, button,

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.170
button.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:31.920
That's problematic.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.860
We don't know what
the buttons will do,

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.580
and the council order and
complete order actions

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.440
are right next to
each other, which

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.650
could lead to major user error.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:47.380
Instead, what we can do is
add meaningful and concise

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.870
accessory labels in addition
to the default button

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.430
verbalization.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:57.320
So here, we've added Previous
Step, Checkout Progress, Cancel

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.020
Order, and Checkout Order.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.570
Now, we know what
each button will do,

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:07.010
and there won't be a major gaffe
of canceling order rather than

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:11.760
completing one, and vice versa.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.020
You can be a champion
for screen reader users

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.260
by writing accessory
labels in addition

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.365
to the default verbalization
provided by screen readers.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.350
In terms of motion
design, have you

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:31.100
had something important
flash before your eyes,

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.180
blink, and then be gone?

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.470
Well, this just happened to
you and is a major pain point

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.930
for users with low
vision or someone

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.740
who isn't paying attention.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.520
Try to ensure that
alerts, like snack bars,

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.640
are present on the screen long
enough so that everyone can see

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.370
them, like right now,
and have an option

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:54.240
to easily dismiss them, like
dismiss button or a tapping out

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.160
function.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.840
Likewise, consider supporting
screen magnification users.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.780
Here on web, when a
user hovers over a seat,

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.040
they get additional information
about that seat in a hover

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.030
card, but it covers the rest
of the screen when magnified.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:15.480
To help our users get back
to whatever they were doing,

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:20.550
consider an easy escape hatch,
such as an escape key shortcut

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:21.870
or a close button.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.420
To ensure that your
motion design accessible,

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:30.300
present alerts for long
enough, and have an option

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.530
to easily dismiss them.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:36.030
Likewise, easily escape
hover information

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.570
during screening magnification.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:46.190
At this stage, we have designed
the interactive, visual,

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:50.690
writing, and motion
aspects of our product.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.640
Now, it's time to talk to users.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.850
Get some feedback and check
if you're on the right track.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:59.880
Also, see if you run
into any major blockers

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.600
you didn't anticipate.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.360
Consider running a
heuristic evaluation.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.660
It consists of having a
small set of examiners

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.160
evaluate your app against known
usability principles, otherwise

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.230
called heuristics.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.960
So right here, we have three
heuristics from the material

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:23.110
design accessibility
guidelines, and they're clear,

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.980
they're robust, and specific.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.620
So let's check.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:32.330
Is your app clear, meaning
are its layouts non-crowded,

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.330
and are its calls-to-action
visually distinct?

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.250
Is your app robust?

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:41.120
Does it support a variety
of user capabilities?

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.710
Finally, is your app specific?

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.630
Does it specifically support
a variety of user technologies

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:51.080
in the ways that
the user expects?

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.910
Let's try this out with Crane.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.790
So here, we have two
button variations,

00:26:55.790 --> 00:27:01.740
and we want to see if it's clear
enough for low-vision users.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.250
Well, we may find that
these two buttons actually

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.710
have the same color contrast.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:12.690
But we may also find that people
prefer the one on the right,

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:17.130
because the shopping cart icon
makes the purpose of the button

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:23.560
more obvious for people with
and without disabilities.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.600
After you're completing
your product,

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.390
conduct a heuristics
evaluation, and feel

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.270
free to use the accessibility
guidelines provided

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.430
by material design.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:38.600
Is your app clear,
robust, and specific?

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.531
Now, back to Bethany on
how to develop your app.

00:27:42.531 --> 00:27:43.864
BETHANY FONG: Thanks, Catherine.

00:27:43.864 --> 00:27:47.217
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.810
So you've moved on to
the development stage.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.310
And you'll want to make sure
that all of those decisions you

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.490
just made in the
design stage pull

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:58.670
through to the final product.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.150
So the first thing you can
do is use standard components

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:02.590
when designing.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:05.650
If you use material components,
that will be pre-vetted,

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:08.180
work well within a
holistic design system,

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.480
and they'll be usable and
recognizable to your users.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.522
If you do something
nonstandard, note

00:28:13.522 --> 00:28:15.730
that you'll perhaps have to
design the full component

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.779
yourself, as well
as marking it up

00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:20.320
with the appropriate metadata,
particularly for screen reader

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.220
users.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.160
You'll need to provide labels,
structure, and traversal paths.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.230
And designers, one
tool that you can use

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.540
is Gallery, created
by Google to help

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:34.020
you manage design iterations
and get quick design feedback.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.790
If you use our
material theme editor

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.190
with Sketch, which is
a popular design tool,

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.350
and upload your
mocks to Gallery,

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:43.620
you'll automatically see all
measurements, or red lines,

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.400
as designers call them.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:49.212
For example, you can see here
how large this price text is

00:28:49.212 --> 00:28:50.670
and make sure that
the touch target

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.550
size is going to be large
enough to be tappable for people

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.230
with hand tremor.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.300
You can also use it to
communicate back and forth

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.640
with your team about
accessibility markup

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.430
and any verbalizations
or UX writing

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.310
that you might want to do.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.470
And don't forget to
use scalable text.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:09.900
This allows for a piece of
text to scale up or down,

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.330
according to the user's
individual settings.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:14.580
This is really important
for users with low vision

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.530
who may have large
text turned on,

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.830
but usually, the rest of the
UI remains the same size.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.350
So follow the specific
platform standards

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.352
for how scalable text
should be implemented.

00:29:25.352 --> 00:29:27.810
And here's the same screen with
the large text now rendered

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:28.650
correctly.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.946
You can actually read
it, which is great.

00:29:31.946 --> 00:29:35.320
So engineers, you can keep
users with various impairments

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.560
in mind as you code, just as
a designer would periodically

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.110
consider a user with
low vision, no vision,

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:43.000
or some mobility challenges.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.070
And one way of
focusing this work

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.900
is to schedule
periodic bug bashes

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.914
and fix-its from a specifically
accessibility point of view.

00:29:50.914 --> 00:29:52.330
And there's also
a number of tools

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:53.800
that you can use
during development

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.890
to check your accessibility
on web and on Android.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.750
These include
Accessibility Scanner

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.120
on Android, which is the
app shown here, which

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.030
is really easy to use,
because it checks your app

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:07.420
screen by screen for any
accessibility errors.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.970
And come by the Accessibility
Sandbox during I/O

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:13.350
to speak for engineers to
learn about other dev tools

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:17.140
that you can use during
your own process.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.810
So as you're
developing, don't forget

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:22.080
to use common components
when you can and just inherit

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.600
the work that we've
already done for you there.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.650
Use scalable text, and use
accessibility development tools

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:33.600
throughout your process to
check yourself as you go.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.070
All right.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:37.720
ANDREA WONG: Thanks, Bethany.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.010
So now, I'm going to talk about
the last stage, stage four,

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:43.800
after development.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.130
At this point, the bulk of your
development work is complete,

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:48.300
and you're about to launch.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:58.520
At this time, we recommend using
a tool like Pre-Launch Report

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.350
from the Google Play Store.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:03.170
Some of you may already be
using Pre-Launch Report,

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:06.260
but the good news is, it
now includes accessibility.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.710
So upload your app to
alpha or beta channel,

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.950
and it'll crawl through your
app to identify a number of ways

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:19.320
to improve it, like crashes,
latency issues, and, of course,

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.790
accessibility.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:23.910
And you won't need to instrument
your app ahead of time.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:28.170
For the web, we recommend
automated accessibility tools

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:31.410
that's built right into
our Chrome DevTools.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:33.390
So inside the
Audits panel, you'll

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.590
see a tool called Lighthouse.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:39.090
Lighthouse will run
about 40 automated tests

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.990
against your site to check for
common accessibility issues.

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:46.300
When it's finished,
it'll give you a score.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.330
It'll point out the
failing elements.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.120
And the best part is, it'll
link you to documentation

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.312
with instructions on how to
fix those failing elements.

00:31:55.312 --> 00:31:57.520
And if you've done everything
right up to this point,

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.800
if you've listened to all
of us, then everything here

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.080
should be a breeze.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.320
One more thing-- no great
onboarding experience

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.680
is complete without
good help content.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:13.400
And help content is a resource
that people with disabilities

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.590
often utilize.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:19.730
So make sure you include in
help content on accessibility,

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:23.700
and make sure that content
is actually accessible.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.270
This is a great opportunity
to help all users get off

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:30.720
to a great start with
your app or your product

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.610
and recover quickly
when they get stuck.

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:37.100
Yay, you've launched.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.810
Now that we're here,
you're probably

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:41.780
going through your
metrics, your analytics.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.520
You're checking the
effectiveness of your launch,

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.150
the user engagement,
and so forth.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:50.000
You're hopefully also
doing user studies,

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.160
and you're measuring
satisfaction

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.550
to see how well your app is
being received by everyone.

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:58.370
At this point, include
respondents with accessibility

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:02.110
needs so that you're
hearing all the feedback.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:06.220
This is also the perfect
time to stop and understand

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:09.160
what benefits your team has
reaped from design inclusively

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.060
from the very beginning.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.690
So here, do a post-mortem.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:17.500
Decide what to cut, what
to keep, what to change,

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.860
and apply that to
your next cycle.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.300
Over time design inclusive will
become second nature to you.

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:28.110
Let's go over the main points.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:30.780
One, check for common
accessibility issues

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.610
with Pre-Launch
Report and Lighthouse

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.860
and countless other
tools out there.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:38.760
Make sure you have accessibility
help content that's accessible.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.540
And get feedback from
users with disabilities.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.750
And now, Jen will
summarize all this for us.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.730
JEN DEVINS: Thank you, Andrea.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:52.120
All right, so there you have
it, our tool kit of ideas

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.960
that, hopefully, you can
apply to your process.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.690
We know it's a lot
of information.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:02.010
There's a lot of great resources
out there that you can rely on.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:05.130
We wanted to leave
you with one thing

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:11.159
you can do during each stage
of the process starting today.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:13.020
So if you're starting
out and you're

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.500
defining your product vision,
can't stress it enough--

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.139
get out there and talk to users.

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:21.120
If you're curious
of, where should I

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.530
find users with disabilities?

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:23.880
I don't know anyone.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.834
There's lots of organizations
nationally and internationally

00:34:27.834 --> 00:34:30.000
that you can reach out to,
and they'll often put you

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.130
in contact with their members.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:35.790
And in fact, today in the
Design and Accessibility Sandbox

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:38.520
across the way, there are
members from the National

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:41.010
Federation of the
Blind that are willing

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:46.540
and wanting to give you feedback
or just answer your questions.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.510
If you're in the design
stage, you probably

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:52.580
started working on your
interaction workflow model,

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.969
and you're thinking about
it, have it drafted.

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:59.380
Before you get too far, take
a step back and think, now,

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.254
how would a user that's
using just a keyboard

00:35:02.254 --> 00:35:03.670
go through this
interaction model?

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.890
How would they get
their task done?

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:07.990
This is a great place
to start, and you'll

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:13.670
be very happy you did
this earlier than later.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:18.380
If you're in the development
stage, use standard components.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.200
They've been
stress-test, and they're

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.280
familiar to users,
which is great.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.730
You don't want users
to have to relearn

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:30.130
their app for each screen.

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:33.310
And finally, if you're
nearing that finish line

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:36.950
and it's after development,
just as Andrea mentioned,

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:39.460
we really recommend
ensuring that you

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.970
have accessible onboarding
and help content

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:44.650
and, if it makes
sense for your app,

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:48.940
to have accessibility-focused
tutorials and onboarding

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.440
material.

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:56.400
Making inclusive
products is critical.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.840
We all have the power
and responsibility

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.920
to remove barriers
and empower all users

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.720
to be productive and connected.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.345
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:08.345 --> 00:36:09.793
Thank you so much for your time.

00:36:09.793 --> 00:36:10.293
[APPLAUSE]
