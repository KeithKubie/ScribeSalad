00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.070
Saving us from soaking, scraping and scrubbing,
Teflon has been a lifesaver (or at least a

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.500
hand-saver) for home cooks for the last 50
years.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.289
Comprised of a unique polymer that actually
repels nearly every other material (the only

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.340
known thing a gecko’s feet can’t stick
to), the processes used to get this substance

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.760
to adhere so well to a pan relies on sand,
heat, a vacuum and sometimes even another

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.760
chemical.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.250
For the uninitiated, as noted previously,
Teflon was created by accident in 1938 in

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.870
Dupont’s Jackson Lab.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.820
Dr. Roy J. Plunkett had been playing around
with refrigerants and compressed and froze

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.059
a sample of tetrafluoroethylene which spontaneously
polymerized.

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.090
The waxy result of that experiment was polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE).

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.239
Inert and, for a long time, “considered
the most slippery material in existence,”

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.679
PTFE became known as Teflon in 1945.

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.780
The trouble with Teflon is that PTFE is a
fluorinated polymer – a long chain of identical

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.780
molecules.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.670
The molecules are comprised of carbon and
fluorine, enmeshed in one of the most powerful

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.180
bonds known, with the carbon atoms surrounded
by a “tight helix of fluorine atoms.”

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.660
Along with this super-tight bond, fluorine
also naturally repels other elements, and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.260
together, these two properties keep things
from sticking to Teflon.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.800
Because repulsion happens in all directions,
it would be impossible to get Teflon to stick

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.840
to a pan without help, and there are a few
different ways this is done.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.050
One method, said to be used for Dupont’s
Silverstone brand, begins by sandblasting

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.880
the pan, creating an uneven surface that encourages
adherence.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.910
A primer layer of Teflon is sprayed on, then
baked at high heat that helps the Teflon get

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.510
“a secure mechanical grip.”

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.010
Note that this is a mechanical, and not chemical,
adherence that some have characterized as

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.290
similar to the way ice cubes get stuck in
a tray or Velcro binds together.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.800
Depending on whom you ask about Dupont’s
process, the initial sticking is followed

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.500
by one or two more rounds of spraying and
baking before the pan is considered finished.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.970
A second method also bakes the Teflon onto
the pan (called “sintering”), but first

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.190
involves subjecting it to a barrage of ions
in a “high vacuum under electric field.”

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.050
This forces some of the bonds holding fluorine
atoms to break, allowing the carbon underneath

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.080
to bond to other materials, like oxygen, which
allows it to stick to the pan.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.000
The third method is similar to the second,
except that the changes to one side of the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.620
Teflon are done with a reducing agent that
breaks the strong bonds between the fluorine

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.980
and the carbon allowing the fluorine to bond
together.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.750
This leaves the carbon free.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.421
The free carbon, which forms into unsaturated
hydrocarbons, is sticky enough to get the

00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:56.930
Teflon sheet to 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:10.420
stick to 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.290
a pan.
