00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:06.460
Easter eggs are a common occurrence in modern
cinema.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.070
Directors love to include inside jokes and
references to other movies and franchises

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.250
in their work, simply for the fun of doing
it.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.170
Some are extremely obvious and in plain sight,
while others are sneakily hidden, and part

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.750
of the fun of the viewing experience for audiences
is trying to find them - heck, there's still

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.250
a confirmed Easter egg from 2014's Guardians
of the Galaxy that hasn't been found yet!

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.770
Damn you James Gunn!

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.280
This video will highlight some of the mostly
cunningly hidden Easter eggs that HAVE been

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.280
found.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:38.510
Here are ten cleverly hidden Easter eggs that
are hard to spot.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.600
Deadpool
There were a near-endless number of Easter

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.329
eggs in 2016's brilliantly hilarious Deadpool
movie and a couple of them actually referred

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.129
to DC superhero Batman - one of which was
very well hidden by the commotion that was

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.469
taking place at the time.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.249
When Ryan Reynold's titular character jumps
into an SUV and fights against a group of

00:00:55.249 --> 00:01:01.670
bad guys, the radio changes station as he
gets his head slammed against it.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.060
If you listen intently enough, you’ll hear
the iconic transition music from the 1960s

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.000
live-action Adam West Batman television show!

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.860
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy
This particular fun Easter egg in 2004's Anchorman:

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.690
The Legend of Ron Burgundy is actually far
from "hidden" - in fact it's clear for all

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.740
to see in big writing on a big restaurant
sign - but it's hard to spot because it's

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.950
written in Spanish!

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.619
It's the name of the restaurant visted by
Veronica Corningstone and her female co-worker.

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.549
It's called "Escupimos en su Alimento" which,
to the non-Spanish speaker, seems cultured

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:35.549
enough.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.189
However, in Spanish, what that actually means
is "We spit in your food".

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.579
Nice.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.420
Doctor Strange
As with all Marvel Cinematic Universe movies,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.990
2016's Doctor Strange was full of Easter eggs
and references to the extended Marvel universe

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.009
- but one very important one seems to have
gone under the radar because it was only briefly

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.390
and vaguely mentioned.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.430
Karl Mordo used a staff called the Staff of
the Living Tribunal when he was training Stephen

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.430
Strange.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.610
In the comic books, the Living Tribunal is
the second most powerful character in all

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.569
of Marvel - second to only the One Above All.

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.170
If this staff harnesses his power, it could
literally be more powerful than the Infinity

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.480
Gauntlet and could be the key to defeating
Thanos in the MCU's Infinity War.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.150
Raiders of the Lost Ark
There are actually a number of Easter eggs

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.730
linking the Indiana Jones franchise to the
Star Wars franchise - and they can be found

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.180
in movies in both franchises - but the best
of them arguably appears sneakily hidden in

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.769
the first Indiana Jones movie, Raiders of
the Lost Ark.

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.739
Harrison Ford's Indie has just lifted the
lid off a sarchophagus and he turns around

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.180
to look at a pillar behind him.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.090
On that pillar, amongst the many hieroglypics
carved into it, there are hieroglyphic versions

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.280
of Star Wars characters C-3PO and R2-D2.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.849
The Incredible Hulk
This is a very well-hidden Easter egg - not

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.480
only because it's hard to spot even when it's
on the screen in front of your, but because

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.110
it actually only appears in a deleted scene
that can only be seen on the Blu-ray and DVD

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.000
of 2008's The Incredible Hulk.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.440
It's a scene in which Bruce Banner heads to
the Arctic Circle to commit suicide.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.200
If you look very close, you can see Captain
America under the snow and ice, foreshadowing

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.459
his resurrection from his frozen grave just
a couple of movies later in the Marvel Cinematic

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.959
Universe franchise.

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.849
Jurassic World
One of the unsung popular characters from

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.170
the original Jurassic Park was Mr. DNA - the
animated DNA strand who appeared in the video

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.480
John Hammond showed to park guests about how
the park's scientists had recreated dinosaurs.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.549
The character makes a brief appearance in
the new visitor’s centre in 2015's Jurassic

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.000
World, which is an Easter egg in itself, but
there's more: Director Colin Trevorrow actually

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
did the voice for him.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.080
The original voice actor, Greg Burson, has
sadly passed away, and some effects were applied

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.610
to Trevorrow’s voice to hide it and make
it sound like the original.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.569
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is another

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.290
comic book movie with lots of Easter eggs,
but one example in the 2016 movie was particularly

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.560
exciting for fans of a certain Batman villain
- and we're not talking about The Joker.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.170
When Batman is looking for a place to fight
Superman, some stone pillars can be seen covered

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.170
in graffiti.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.939
Hidden amongst the graffiti is a question
mark - a sure-fire sign that the enigmatic

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.319
Riddler (who has, of course, previously been
played by Jim Carrey on the big screen in

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.320
Batman Forever) exists in the current DC movie
universe!

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.290
Finding Nemo
Disney's movies - and, in particular, their

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.890
Pixar movies - are known for including clues
that suggest all of them take place in the

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.070
same universe.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.830
2003's Finding Nemo has a prime example of
this hidden in the middle of the credits.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.320
Just as the "Special Thanks" section of the
credits begins to roll, none other than Mike

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.580
- the round green monster with a single big
eyeball from 2001's Monsters, Inc. - can be

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.720
seen swimming across the scene wearing a mask
and snorkel.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:51.450
He looks towards the camera and goes on his
merry way.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.660
The Rocky Horror Picture Show
Here we come to the most literal example of

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.920
"hidden Easter eggs" in a movie - and it's
rumoured to be the origin of the term as well

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.580
- and it comes from the 1975 classic The Rocky
Horror Picture Show.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.890
The movie's cast decided to have an Easter
egg hunt on the set, with a number of eggs

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.860
being so well hidden that they weren't found
and removed before filming resumed.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.720
Several made it into the final movie, including
one under Dr. Frank N. Furter’s throne,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.820
one on a lamp in the main hall, and another
near the lab's elevator.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.260
Suicide Squad
2016's Suicide Squad was absolutely teaming

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.130
with Easter eggs - most of which were links
to the expanded DC movie universe - but one

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.730
well-hidden example refers to the larger themes
of the movie as a whole.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.480
It's the scene when Harley Quinn smashes a
store window to pick out a designer handbag.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.730
The background shows words written in Latin
- and they aren't just random words.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.650
The phrase “si vis pacem para bellum”
- which is repeated over and over - means

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.800
“if you want peace, prepare for war.”

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.320
That’s Amanda Waller’s belief based on
the fact that a metahuman war is coming that

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.680
the world needs to prepare for.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.690
