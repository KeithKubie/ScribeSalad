00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.080
The 18th century writer, David Hume, is one of the world's great philosophical voices

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.320
because he hit upon a key fact about human nature-

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.500
that we are more influenced by our feelings than by reason.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.920
This is, at one level, possibly a great insult to our self image,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.300
but Hume thought that if we could learn to deal well with this surprising fact,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.000
we could be both individually and collectively a great deal calmer and happier than if we denied it.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.820
Hume was born in Edinburgh in 1711, to a family that was long established but far from rich.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.780
He was the second son and it was clear early on that he would need to find a job eventually,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.780
but nothing seemed to suit him.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.400
He tried law, the vocation of his father and his older brother,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.600
but soon decided that it was: "a laborious profession, requiring the drudgery of a whole life."

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.700
He was considered for academic posts at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.280
but he didn't land either job.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.980
So, he set out to become a public intellectual, someone who would make his money selling books to the general public.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.980
It was pretty hard-going.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.000
His first book, 'A Treatise of Human Nature', for which he had the highest hopes, met with a dismal reception.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.300
"Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my Treatise", he wrote.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.880
"It fell dead-born from the press, without reaching such distinction as to even excite a murmur along the zealots."

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.640
But Hume kept at it, realising that the blame largely lay with the way that he had expressed his ideas.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.360
And doggedly training himself to write in a more accessible and popular manner,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.860
eventually, he did find an audience.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.560
his later works: popular history books and collections of elegant essays were best-sellers of the day.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.180
As he would say, not without some pride:

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.000
"The money given me by booksellers much exceeded anything formerly known in England;

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I was to become not only independent but opulent."

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.600
Humes philosophy is built around a single powerful observation:

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.800
that the key thing we need to get right in life is feeling rather than rationality.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.800
It sounds like an odd conclusion.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.300
Normally we assume that what we need to do is train our minds to be as rational as possible,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.000
to be devoted to evidence and logical reasoning and committed to preventing our feelings from getting in the way.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.800
But Hume insisted that whatever we may aim for - reason is the slave of passion.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.000
We are more motivated by our feelings than by any of the comparatively feeble results of analysis and logic.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.000
Few of our leading convictions had driven by rational investigations of the facts.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.800
We decide whether someone is admirable, what to do with our spare time,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.800
what constitutes a successful career, or who to love on the basis of feeling above anything else.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.700
Reason helps a little, but the decisive factors are bound up with our emotional lives,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.300
with our passions, as Hume calls them.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.700
Hume lived in a time known as the Age of Reason,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.500
when many claimed that the glory of human beings consists in their rationality,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.500
but for Hume a human is just another kind of animal.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Hume was deeply attentive to the curious way that we very often reason from not to our convictions.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.100
We find an idea nice or threatening and on that basis alone declare it true or false.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.400
Reason only comes in later to support the original attitude.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.700
What Hume didn't believe however was that all feelings are acceptable and equal.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.000
that's why he firmly believed in the education of the passions.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.000
People have to learn to be more benevolent, more patient, more at ease with themselves

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.500
and less afraid of others.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.000
But to be taught these things they need an education system that addresses feelings rather than reason.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.920
This is why Hume so deeply believed in the role and significance of public intellectuals.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.100
These were people who (unlike university professors that Hume grew to dislike immensely)

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.800
had to excite a passion-based attachment to ideas, wisdom and insight.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.200
Only if they succeeded would they have the money to eat.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.200
It was for this reason that they had to write well, use colorful examples

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.700
and have recoursed wit and charm.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.200
Hume's insight is that if you want to change people's beliefs

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.800
reasoning with them like a normal philosophy professor won't be the most effective strategy.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.800
He's pointing out that we have to try to

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.800
adjust sentiments by sympathy, re-assurance, good example, encouragement and what he called "art".

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.000
And only later, for a few determined souls, should we ever try to make a case on the basis of facts and logic.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.400
A key place where Hume made use of the idea of the priority of feeling over reason was in connection with

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.400
religion

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.700
Hume didn't think it was rational to believe in god.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.400
That is - he didn't think there were compelling logical arguments in favor of the existence of a deity.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.200
He himself seems to have floated between mild agnosticism (there might be a god, I'm not sure)

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.200
and mild theism (there is a god, but it doesn't make much difference to me that there is).

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.200
However the idea of a vindictive god, someone ready to punish people in an afterlife for not believing in him in this one,

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.000
this he considered a cruel superstition.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.500
Hume's central point is that religious belief isn't the product of reason.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.500
So arguing for or against it on the basis of facts doesn't touch the core issue.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.700
To try to persuade someone to believe or not believe with well-honed arguments

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.700
seemed particularly daft to Hume.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.800
This is why he was a foremost defender of the concept of religious toleration.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.800
We shouldn't treat those who disagree with us over religion as rational people who've made an error

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.100
of reasoning and so need to be put right,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.300
but rather as passionate emotion-driven creatures

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.800
who should be left in peace so long as they do likewise with us.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Trying to have a rational argument over religion was for Hume the height of folly and arrogance.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.600
Hume was what is technically known as a skeptic

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.900
someone committed to doubting a lot of the common sense ideas of the day.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.800
One of the things he doubted was the concept of what is technically called "personal identity".

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.900
The idea that we have that we can understand ourselves and have

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.500
a more or less graspable and enduring identity that runs through life.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.500
Hume pointed out that there is no such thing as a

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.660
" Core Self "

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.100
"When I enter most intimately into what I call "myself","

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.700
he famously explained,

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.900
"I always stumble on some particular perception or other,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.000
of heat or cold,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.700
light or shade,

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.000
love or hatred,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.400
pain or pleasure.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.200
I never can catch "myself" at any time without a perception

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.000
and can never observe anything but the perception.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.100
Hume concluded that we aren't really the neat definable people reason tells us that we are

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.800
and that we seem to be when we look at ourselves in the mirror

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.700
or casually use that grand and rather misleading word

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.620
" I ".

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:57.400
 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.640
Yet, despite being skeptical of temper

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.860
Hume was very happy for us to hold onto most of our common-sense beliefs

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.820
because they are what help us make our way in the world

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.500
Trying to be rational about everything is a special kind of madness.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.300
Hume was making a slight dig at Descartes.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.660
The French philosopher had died 60 years before Hume was born.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.520
But his intellectual influence was still very much alive.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.840
He had argued that we should throw out every fruit of the mind that wasn't perfectly rational.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.000
But Hume proposed that hardly anything we do is ever truly rational

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.580
And yet he ventured that most beliefs are justified simply because they work

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.880
They're useful to us. They help us to get on with what we want to do.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.040
A test of a belief isn't its provable truth but its utility

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.000
Hume was offering a corrective

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.580
which we sometimes badly need

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.780
to our fascination with prestigious but not actually very important logical conundrums

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.080
In opposition to academic niceties

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.780
he was a skeptical philosopher who stood for common sense

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.580
Championing the everyday and the wisdom of the unlearned and the ordinary.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.980
Hume took a great interest in the traditional philosophical topic of Ethics

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.420
A conundrum of how humans can be good.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.860
He argued that morality isn't about having moral ideas

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.240
It's about having been trained from an early age in the art of decency

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.900
through the emotions

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.440
Being good means getting into good habits of feeling.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.680
Hume was a great advocate of qualities like wit, good manners and sympathy

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.940
because these are the things make people nice to be around

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.180
outside of any rational plan to be good.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.940
He was hugely struck by the fact that a person

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.320
and here again, he was thinking of Descartes

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.600
could be ostensibly rational and yet, not that nice.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.400
Because being able to follow complex argument

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.240
or deduce trends from data

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.000
doesn't make you sensitive to the sufferings of others

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.840
or skilled at keeping your temper.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.220
These qualities are

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.180
the work of our feelings

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.140
So, if we want people to behave well,

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.420
what we need to do is to rethink education

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.860
We have to influence the development of feeling

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.200
We have to encourage benevolence, gentleness, pity and shame

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.080
through the seduction of the passionate sides of our nature,

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.180
without delivering dry, logical lectures.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.940
Hume's philosophy always emerged as an attempt to answer a personal question.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.240
What is a good life?

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.900
He wanted to know how his own character and that of those around him

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.680
could be influenced for the best.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.120
And oddly, for a philosopher,

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.340
he didn't feel the traditional practice of Philosophy could really help.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.900
Though he was scholarly,

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.340
he was in large part, a man of the world.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.500
For some years, he was an adviser to the British ambassador in Paris

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.180
who welcomed his shrewd wisdom.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.320
He was much liked by those around him,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.840
known by the French as 'Le Bon David',

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.580
a humane, kind and witty conversationalist,

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.640
much in demand as a dinner companion.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.440
he insisted.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.100
That's the way Hume lived.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.400
Not in the intellectual seclusion of a monastery or ivory tower,

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.160
But deeply embedded in the company of other humans,

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.000
dining.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.940
He especially liked roast chicken, chatting about love and career and playing Backgammon.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.800
Hume died in Edinburgh in August 1776,

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:08.560
at home,

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.300
in his house in St. Andrew's Square

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.660
His doctor wrote about the last hours to Adam Smith,

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.540
for many years,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.140
Hume's best friend.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.060
Hume remains a rather outstanding thing.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:42.160
A philosopher, alive to how much Philosophy can has to learn from common-sense.
