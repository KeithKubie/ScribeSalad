00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:01.511
- [Voiceover] What I
hope to do in this video,

00:00:01.511 --> 00:00:03.473
is give ourselves some practice

00:00:03.473 --> 00:00:05.400
interpreting statements

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.244
and writing them as
mathematical expressions,

00:00:08.244 --> 00:00:11.100
possibly using parentheses.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.308
So let's get started.

00:00:12.308 --> 00:00:13.914
And for any of these statements,

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:14.952
if you get so inspired,

00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:17.033
and I encourage you to get so inspired,

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:18.937
pause the video and see
if you can write them

00:00:18.937 --> 00:00:21.294
as mathematical expressions.

00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:22.339
So this first one says

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.867
700 minus 19, divided in half.

00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:28.017
So we could say,

00:00:28.017 --> 00:00:29.293
another way to think about divided in half

00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:31.476
is divided by two,

00:00:31.476 --> 00:00:32.904
so we could write this as

00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:37.362
709 minus 19,

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:38.941
and we're going to do that first,

00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:41.333
so that's why I put the
parentheses around it,

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.311
divided by two, or divided in half.

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.276
That's one way that we could write this.

00:00:48.276 --> 00:00:49.367
Now the next one,

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:51.434
and once again, pause
it if you get inspired,

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:52.769
and I encourage you to.

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.471
Three times the sum of 56 and seven.

00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:59.433
So it's gonna be three times

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:01.070
the sum of 56 and seven.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.428
So the sum of 56 and seven,

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:04.135
we want to take that first,

00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:07.188
so it's going to be 56 plus the seven,

00:01:07.188 --> 00:01:10.695
that's the sum of 56 and seven,

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.432
and then we want to do three times that.

00:01:13.432 --> 00:01:16.198
We want to do three times this sum.

00:01:16.198 --> 00:01:19.727
So we could write it like that.

00:01:19.727 --> 00:01:20.900
Another way we could write it,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.235
when you're dealing with parentheses,

00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:23.709
and you're going to see this more and more

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.856
as you get into more
and more fancy algebra,

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:27.506
I guess you could say,

00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:29.683
but what I'm about to
show you isn't so fancy,

00:01:29.683 --> 00:01:32.034
is, you don't have to write
the multiplication sign here.

00:01:32.034 --> 00:01:35.505
You could just write three,
and then open parentheses,

00:01:35.505 --> 00:01:37.542
56 plus seven,

00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:44.368
and this, too, is three times

00:01:44.368 --> 00:01:47.410
the sum of 56 and seven.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.733
And you want to be very careful,

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.904
because you might be
tempted to maybe do it

00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:51.934
without the parentheses,

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:53.993
so you might be tempted
to do something like this,

00:01:53.993 --> 00:01:55.853
three times

00:01:56.992 --> 00:02:01.335
56 plus seven,

00:02:01.335 --> 00:02:02.844
but this one isn't, obviously,

00:02:02.844 --> 00:02:05.422
three times the sum of 56 and seven.

00:02:05.422 --> 00:02:07.337
In fact, the standard
way to interpret this

00:02:07.337 --> 00:02:09.334
is that you would do the
multiplication first.

00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:11.134
You would do three times 56,

00:02:11.134 --> 00:02:12.504
and then add seven,

00:02:12.504 --> 00:02:13.804
which is going to give
you a different value,

00:02:13.804 --> 00:02:15.035
and you could try it out,

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:18.065
than if you were to add
the 56 and the seven first.

00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:21.020
So, to make sure that you do
the 56 and the seven first,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.102
you want to put this
parentheses around it.

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:25.867
So let's keep going.

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:30.789
The sum of three times 56 and seven.

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:33.517
So we're gonna take the sum of two things.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.709
The first thing that we're
gonna take the sum of

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.577
is three times 56.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:44.303
So, three times 56,

00:02:44.303 --> 00:02:46.168
and seven.

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:49.342
Let me do that in a different color.

00:02:49.342 --> 00:02:51.392
And seven.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.779
So this right over here is the sum

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.701
of three times 56, and seven.

00:02:57.701 --> 00:02:59.443
Now it's always good to
write the parentheses.

00:02:59.443 --> 00:03:01.363
It makes it a little bit cleaner,

00:03:01.363 --> 00:03:02.798
a little bit more obvious.

00:03:02.798 --> 00:03:05.373
Look, I'm gonna take the three times 56,

00:03:05.373 --> 00:03:06.571
I'm gonna do that first,

00:03:06.571 --> 00:03:08.011
and then I'm gonna add seven,

00:03:08.011 --> 00:03:09.300
but based on what I just told you,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.807
the standard way, if
someone were to just write

00:03:11.807 --> 00:03:16.734
three times 56 plus seven,

00:03:26.763 --> 00:03:28.855
this actually can still be interpreted as

00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:32.004
the sum of three times 56, and seven,

00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:33.304
because as I just said,

00:03:33.304 --> 00:03:35.644
the standard, the convention, so to speak,

00:03:35.644 --> 00:03:37.774
is to do your multiplication first.

00:03:37.774 --> 00:03:39.794
Order of operations,
which you may or may not,

00:03:39.794 --> 00:03:42.407
if you're not familiar, you
will be familiar with it soon,

00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:44.322
is to do the multiplication first,

00:03:44.322 --> 00:03:47.271
and then add the seven,
or then do the addition.

00:03:47.271 --> 00:03:48.444
But just to make it clear,

00:03:48.444 --> 00:03:51.068
it doesn't hurt to put
the parentheses there.

00:03:51.068 --> 00:03:54.469
Three times 56, plus seven.

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.701
Now we have 43

00:03:56.701 --> 00:04:00.826
minus the sum of 16 and 11.

00:04:01.103 --> 00:04:03.569
So, 43 minus,

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.100
so we're gonna have 43 minus,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.200
minus the sum of 16 and 11.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.636
So, minus the sum of 16 and 11.

00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:14.738
So, from 43, we're gonna take

00:04:14.738 --> 00:04:19.068
the sum of 16 and 11,

00:04:19.068 --> 00:04:20.996
and so, once again, the
parentheses make it clear

00:04:20.996 --> 00:04:23.422
that we're going to take
the sum of 16 and 11,

00:04:23.422 --> 00:04:25.535
and we're gonna take that from 43.

00:04:25.535 --> 00:04:28.043
The parentheses are very,
very, very important here,

00:04:28.043 --> 00:04:31.133
because if we just did 43

00:04:32.303 --> 00:04:35.165
minus 16

00:04:36.704 --> 00:04:38.376
plus 11,

00:04:38.376 --> 00:04:39.966
the standard way of
interpreting this would be

00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:43.310
43 minus 16, and then adding 11,

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.074
which would give you
a different value than

00:04:45.074 --> 00:04:48.225
43 minus the sum of 16 and 11.

00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:49.277
So once again, the parentheses

00:04:49.277 --> 00:04:51.530
are very, very, very important here

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.396
to make it clear that you're
gonna add the 16 and 11 first,

00:04:55.396 --> 00:04:59.808
and then subtract that sum from 43.

00:04:59.808 --> 00:05:02.002
This is fun, let's keep going.

00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:06.448
10 times the quotient of 104 and eight.

00:05:06.448 --> 00:05:09.003
So, we're gonna do 10 times something.

00:05:09.003 --> 00:05:11.498
10 times the quotient

00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:14.301
of 104 and eight,

00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:18.105
and so the quotient of 104 and
8 we could write like this,

00:05:18.105 --> 00:05:20.391
104

00:05:20.391 --> 00:05:24.940
divided by eight,

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.137
or, based on what we told
you a little earlier,

00:05:27.137 --> 00:05:28.101
you could write this as

00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:31.288
10 times the quotient

00:05:31.735 --> 00:05:35.589
of 104 and eight,

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:40.210
or 104 divided by eight.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.870
Now let's just do this last one.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.110
Four times as large

00:05:48.662 --> 00:05:50.629
as the expression

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.416
175 minus 58.

00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:57.602
So I'm gonna do four times
as large as something,

00:05:57.602 --> 00:06:00.364
so I'm gonna multiply
something times four.

00:06:00.934 --> 00:06:02.443
It's four times as large as the expression

00:06:02.443 --> 00:06:05.648
175 minus 58.

00:06:08.295 --> 00:06:10.756
And once again, I could write it as

00:06:10.756 --> 00:06:13.918
four times as large

00:06:13.918 --> 00:06:15.539
as the expression,

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.304
let me do that in that purple color,

00:06:17.304 --> 00:06:20.207
as the expression

00:06:20.207 --> 00:06:22.037
175

00:06:22.037 --> 00:06:26.745
minus 58.

00:06:26.745 --> 00:06:27.962
Either way,

00:06:27.962 --> 00:06:30.238
and once again, if you
were to do it like this,

00:06:30.238 --> 00:06:32.699
if you didn't write the parentheses,

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.835
then, it wouldn't be the same thing,

00:06:34.835 --> 00:06:36.333
'cause if the parentheses weren't here,

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:38.666
then you would want to do
the four times 175 first,

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:40.052
and then subtract the 58,

00:06:40.052 --> 00:06:42.695
which isn't what this
statement is telling us.

00:06:42.695 --> 00:06:44.193
And this last one, I think,

00:06:44.193 --> 00:06:46.944
brings up an interesting
thing for us to think about,

00:06:46.944 --> 00:06:50.195
because if someone were to
walk up to you on the street,

00:06:50.195 --> 00:06:51.809
and they were to show you--

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:54.073
Whoops, what's going on with my computer?

00:06:54.073 --> 00:06:55.443
And they were to show you

00:06:55.443 --> 00:06:57.484
two different expressions.

00:06:57.484 --> 00:07:01.167
Well, the first expression said two--

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:01.798
Let's write it this way,

00:07:01.798 --> 00:07:03.017
actually, I'm not gonna
even speak 'em out.

00:07:03.017 --> 00:07:05.207
I'm just gonna write it down.

00:07:05.207 --> 00:07:09.895
I'm just gonna write
some crazy number here.

00:07:10.942 --> 00:07:15.737
Some crazy numbers here.

00:07:15.737 --> 00:07:18.001
So that's one expression

00:07:18.001 --> 00:07:19.766
that someone were to write,

00:07:19.766 --> 00:07:22.574
and let's say another one is this one,

00:07:24.236 --> 00:07:25.861
and I'm intentionally--

00:07:25.861 --> 00:07:27.907
What, I put the commas in the wrong place.

00:07:27.907 --> 00:07:30.273
Let me make sure I get this right.

00:07:30.273 --> 00:07:32.502
Alright, that's 183,576.

00:07:32.502 --> 00:07:34.998
This is 37,399.

00:07:34.998 --> 00:07:36.403
So that's one expression,

00:07:36.403 --> 00:07:38.678
and then another expression is this.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.473
And I'm intentionally not reading it out.

00:07:43.473 --> 00:07:44.402
Well, I'll read it out a little bit,

00:07:44.402 --> 00:07:46.736
37,399.

00:07:46.736 --> 00:07:48.094
And someone said, "Quick!

00:07:48.094 --> 00:07:50.555
"Which expression is larger?"

00:07:50.555 --> 00:07:51.635
And you might be tempted,

00:07:51.635 --> 00:07:52.703
or you might not be tempted,

00:07:52.703 --> 00:07:53.342
but you might be tempted,

00:07:53.342 --> 00:07:54.712
"Oh, let me calculate this thing.

00:07:54.712 --> 00:07:56.268
"Gee, I'm gonna have to
write this thing down,

00:07:56.268 --> 00:07:58.092
"or use a calculator or something,

00:07:58.092 --> 00:07:59.309
"or whatever else to add

00:07:59.309 --> 00:08:03.265
"183,576

00:08:03.265 --> 00:08:05.208
"plus 37,399,

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:06.690
"and then I'm gonna have
to multiply that by two,

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.934
"and figure out what
that number is equal to,

00:08:08.934 --> 00:08:09.770
"and then I would have to take

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.555
"183,576 plus 37,399

00:08:13.555 --> 00:08:14.530
"and figure out what that is,

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:15.900
"multiply that by seven,

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.131
"and figure out what that's going to be.

00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:17.967
"That's hard!

00:08:17.967 --> 00:08:18.605
"That's gonna take--"

00:08:18.605 --> 00:08:20.207
Not hard, it's just
gonna take you some time,

00:08:20.207 --> 00:08:22.239
you might make some careless mistakes.

00:08:22.239 --> 00:08:23.470
But the big realization to say,

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.107
"Well, which one is larger?

00:08:25.107 --> 00:08:27.069
"Well I don't have to even
calculate these things!"

00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:31.202
'Cause this is two times this
craziness right over here,

00:08:31.202 --> 00:08:33.570
this thing that's gonna
be 200 something thousand,

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.277
and this is seven times that thing

00:08:35.277 --> 00:08:38.540
that is going to be 200
and something thousand.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.770
So seven times that thing

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.777
is going to be larger
than two times that thing,

00:08:42.777 --> 00:08:44.003
and so, one way to--

00:08:44.003 --> 00:08:46.504
Before you dive deep, and
start computing things,

00:08:46.504 --> 00:08:48.176
it's always good to take
a step back and say,

00:08:48.176 --> 00:08:51.102
"Hey, look, can I look at how
the expressions are formed,

00:08:51.102 --> 00:08:53.075
"the structure of these expressions?"

00:08:53.075 --> 00:08:56.442
And say, "Look, this is
two times this thing,

00:08:56.442 --> 00:08:58.543
"and this is seven times this thing."

00:08:58.543 --> 00:09:00.413
Well, the seven is going to be,

00:09:00.413 --> 00:09:03.372
this one right over here is going to be

00:09:03.741 --> 00:09:06.126
a larger expression.

00:09:06.126 --> 00:09:07.934
Anyway, hopefully you enjoyed that

00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:09.703
as much as I did.
