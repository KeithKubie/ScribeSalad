00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:01.501
It's always fun to have you.

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.703
I'm pumped.

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:05.205
Maury, I met Maury 10 years ago.
I went to his show.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:06.406
And you met him.

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:07.674
Well, yeah, I have a picture
with him,

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:08.942
I was trying to look
for it on my Instagram

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.177
but I can't find it.

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:12.145
Oh yeah.
He's a nice guy.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.914
I say Maury Povich,
what's the right way to say-

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:15.115
Povich.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.384
Povich, okay.
Sometimes I say Paw-vich.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:18.952
I think you said
Pavich in the hall.

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.854
Pavich. Which is the right way?

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.790
We'll ask him. I feel like
he's a guy you can ask,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.426
"How do you say your name
that we should all this?"

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.395
And I feel like you
could just go with, Maury,

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.498
and everybody knows who it is.
There's no other Maury.

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:33.166
"Tuesdays With-"

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.434
Right, "Tuesdays with Maury."

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.803
Yeah, I read that book
and got something from it.

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.005
Same, samesies.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:40.207
I was like, "Oh, I'm going
to start forgiving everyone."

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:42.643
Yeah. When I was in
physical therapy school,

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:44.244
we had to learn about ALS

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:47.614
and I couldn't study
and focus on it.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.383
So I just was like, "I'll read
Tuesdays with Morrie."

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:50.617
'Cause he had ALS.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:51.885
Oh yeah.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.554
And I failed. You had to know-

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:55.789
You had to know-

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.190
I mean it's a graduate program.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.593
I was like, "I'm just going
to read this novel."

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.866
Maury Povich is in the studio,
everyone,

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.067
I told you
he was gonna drop by.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.302
It was gonna happen quick.
We're ready.

00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:09.536
Nice to see you.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:10.804
What's up, brother,
how you doing?

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.806
That's Chris, this is Andrew.
I'm Nikki.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.074
Hi, how are you, Maury.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.275
Nice to meet you.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.944
Good to see you.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:18.979
So many people-

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.215
No.
Seven people.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.417
Everybody.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:26.653
Everyone's so excited about you
when I talk about you.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.123
People glow, they have a story,

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:31.825
they have a relationship
with you.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.361
I learned last night
from doing some research,

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:37.731
that you were
the "A Current Affair" guy.

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:38.966
Of course, yeah.

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.367
Of course, but I was a child

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:41.802
when that show was on
so I didn't-

00:01:41.802 --> 00:01:43.370
You actually watched it?

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.505
Yes, my mom watched it
and I loved it.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:49.376
It gave me an appreciation
for really, good journalism.

00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:50.610
Do you remember the sound?

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.845
Yes.
Ka-chung.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:54.114
Yes, ka-chung,
I remember all of it.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.183
But I forgot that that was you
and then you became

00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:57.451
Maury Povich.
It's just ...

00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:58.652
No.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:00.187
Making the connection,
I loved that show.

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:01.455
That show.

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:05.959
First of all the ka-chung,
the sound, came from ...

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:09.363
We always said
when we started the show,

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:12.332
we wanted to have something
like the "60 Minutes" clock,

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:15.035
so that if you heard it,
"Oh, it's on."

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:19.172
And you would watch.
They put the old time

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:21.808
elementary school
construction paper cutters,

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.444
the sound of
a construction paper cutter.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:26.246
Put with the swish
of a golf club.

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:28.081
Put through a synthesizer

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:31.485
and that was named
after my wife, the "ka-chung."

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.755
It's so good.

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:35.989
Yeah, it used to scare me.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.190
Those are all such satisfying

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.458
sounds layered
on top of each other.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:39.659
I know.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.395
It makes sense why it worked.

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:46.299
This is like '86, so it was
the first days of synthesizing.

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:49.069
That's what they used.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.405
Oh and it worked.
I remember it, it still ...

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:53.640
Yeah, that was always
something my mom had on.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.776
But now, Maury-

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:57.577
Your mom still has
my show on now.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.280
Exactly, oh my gosh,
everyone has your show on.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.382
I mean, in this room,

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:04.117
Noa, both my producer
and Chris Destefano,

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:05.619
have you been
to a live taping, Andrew?

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:06.853
I have not but I'm going
tomorrow.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.121
Where have you all been?
I've been, I've been.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:09.456
They have been to live tapings-

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:10.991
Yeah, I was there 10 years ago.

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.759
It was awesome.
I got a picture with you too.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.796
It's wild, it's crazy.
It's really-

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:18.265
This is the tourist thing to do
when you come to New York City.

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:22.135
I'm telling you, the live taping
of my show

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:26.506
is as good entertainment
as you would ever want.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.241
My live audience
makes the show.

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.977
I mean, it's the heartbeat
of the show.

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:32.846
'Cause they go crazy.

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:35.215
And they all think they know
who the father is.

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:38.318
In my episode, when we found out
it was the father,

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:40.487
we went out of our minds.

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.990
It was like the touchdown.
Because before, we like,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.892
"There's no way he's the father,
there's no way ..."

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.694
And then when he was,
we were like, "Wooo."

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.163
Chris you were saying in line
there was shit talking.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:53.266
In line there were people,
in the episode that I was at,

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:57.604
the family of one of the guys
on the show and they were like,

00:03:57.604 --> 00:04:00.507
"I know he's the father,
I know he's the father!"

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:02.542
And then people were like,
you know nobody knows anything,

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:03.810
I was with my friends
who were like,

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.380
"No, he's not. No he's not."
We have no frame of reference.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.983
Then when he was,
we were just like, "Whoa!"

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:12.352
And they were like,
"I told you." It was great.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.321
Vivid memories,
these people are conjuring

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:16.089
just from being at your show
10 years ago.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:20.160
It truly sounds like such
a great life experience to have.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.763
I heard a story of a NFL
quarterback,

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.532
this is many years ago,

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:29.770
said that, the players would be
in the locker room

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.505
and they would not
go out to practice

00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:34.274
until they found out
who the father was.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.575
Losing games.

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:40.180
Shaquille O'Neal watches my show
every single day and Shaq,

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:43.316
and what he does is
he calls up all his friends

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:45.018
and they bet on
who the father is.

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:46.353
Oh my god.

00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:47.587
Great, great, I love it.

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:52.192
So fun. And Noa, I wanted to
give you a second to tell Maury

00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:53.493
what he means to you.

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:54.761
What?

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:56.029
'Cause you went to a taping.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.765
Yeah. Took a T.V. production
class in high school,

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:00.600
this is 15 years ago.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.102
And I went to a live
taping of your show

00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:04.771
and that's when I knew that
I had to work in production.

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.339
I was watching
your stage manager

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:08.508
and I was just mesmerized,
like,

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:10.677
"What is that job? I want to do
something like that."

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:11.912
Really?
Yeah.

00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:13.580
And that's when you got
the itch.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.816
Yeah and from then on I knew
I had to work behind the scenes.

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:17.584
So you've been in production
ever since?

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:18.952
Yeah.
Isn't that cool?

00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:20.153
Do you produce this show?

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.555
-Yes.
-Yeah.

00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:22.822
How's it going?

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:26.326
Amazing, it's the
best time of my life.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.028
It's so fun. How do ...

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.831
I'm guessing people are having
fun working on your show.

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.098
How have you-

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:37.170
Well, the most amazing part
about that is that my producers,

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.573
my associate producers,
my cameramen,

00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:43.944
have been there
for 15, 20 years.

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:48.715
People like the atmosphere,
the way we work,

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:50.417
the work environment.

00:05:52.252 --> 00:05:54.154
The first talk show I did
was for Paramount

00:05:54.154 --> 00:05:56.156
and that was 28 years ago.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.761
And I still have five people
throughout my staff

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:03.396
who've been with me
28 years.

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:06.566
Wow. That is impressive.

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:09.536
As they say, you sent my kids
through school,

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:10.804
now they've got kids.

00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:13.607
I mean, now those kids
are ready to go to school.

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:15.875
I mean, but it starts
at the top.

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.377
I mean, people who ...

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.980
It starts with you and that
just is a credit to you.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.681
And the people
that you attract.

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:24.851
Look, this business is ...

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:28.521
I mean, I've seen so much
in the television,

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:34.094
radio business in my life that,
it's easy to pick out the fools.

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:40.700
The a-holes show themselves
very early

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.036
and so therefore, you know
exactly what to guard against.

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:44.271
Yeah.

00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:45.839
So that's how I do it.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:48.675
And as far as the suits,
the executives,

00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:53.747
there's nothing better
to keep distance

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:57.017
between you and suits
than a good rating.

00:06:57.017 --> 00:06:59.619
If you get a good rating,
they don't care about you.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.022
You'll never hear from them.

00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:05.458
You're never gonna know,
they're your best friend.

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:06.993
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:10.163
The second the ratings
dip.

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:11.631
The moment there's a dip,

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:13.667
"Well, we think
that you oughta do this."

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:15.802
Really?
Where the hell have you been?

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:18.872
Yes, oh yeah,
who am I speaking to even?

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:24.311
I wanted to ask you about
the daily grind of doing a show.

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:28.181
I mean, how many episodes
are we talking, 4,000?

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:29.382
How many have you done?

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:30.617
-Oh gosh.
-Of the show?

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.152
Between 3 and 4,000, I think.

00:07:32.152 --> 00:07:33.853
Yeah, insane.
It's amazing.

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:35.755
So how many do you tape a week?

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:39.326
We tape five a week.
I tape usually ...

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:41.127
We tape in Stamford,

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:44.531
Connecticut and we tape three on
Thursdays and two on Fridays.

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:48.368
We work about,
I don't know, 27 weeks a year.

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:51.771
Do 100 and I don't know,
30 or 40 shows.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.307
Do you ever reach a point
where you're like,

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.776
Okay, I get ...
How do you muster the,

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:58.845
'cause you never
seem bored of it.

00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:00.113
How do you muster the-

00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:01.381
Because I believe ...

00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:04.751
Even though for instance,
between the lie detector themes

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:08.722
and the DNA themes, those are
our two signature themes.

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:12.125
But since I came out of news,
for many, many years,

00:08:12.726 --> 00:08:14.694
I've always believed
in storytelling

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:18.665
and I just want to find
even with those two themes

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:23.303
all the time, unique qualities
of every single story.

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:27.140
And so I believe each person,

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.543
each personality has
a unique quality about them,

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:33.580
either good or bad,
that I can bring out.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.116
And if I continue to do that,
I won't get bored.

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:39.018
So that's my mantra.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.954
That's really cool.
And you can tell that,

00:08:40.954 --> 00:08:43.289
that's why we love the show,
you bring out characters.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:44.791
And the other thing is,

00:08:44.791 --> 00:08:46.960
and I've always said
this about talk shows,

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.131
and I learned this a long
time ago when I first started.

00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:56.669
It's like being in a campaign,
to be elected.

00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:58.371
You have to knock
on somebody's door,

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.974
they have to open the door,
they have to welcome you in.

00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:03.376
They have to feel
so comfortable with you

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.145
that they'll sit you
at the table

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:06.780
or sit you on the couch.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.215
And you have to become
a member of that family.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.351
And if you can do that,

00:09:11.985 --> 00:09:14.354
then you got a chance
at being successful.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.023
That's the way I've looked at it
all my life

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:20.293
and I've looked on it as being
an advocate for the audience.

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.430
For instance, I don't know,

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.534
I've never known
the result of any DNA test

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:31.337
or lie detector test
before I open up the envelope.

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:33.039
'Cause you're an advocate
for the audience.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:35.642
You're representing
their experience.

00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:38.077
Right and I don't want to know
anything more than they do.

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:41.414
'Cause if I did, then I'd skew
the questions in a certain way.

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:45.418
That's fascinating because
I've hosted two shows,

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:48.922
two talk shows that didn't
last past two seasons.

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:52.992
And I did feel that the audience
just didn't get to know me

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:54.594
or didn't trust me.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:57.030
There was some element of that
or wasn't given a chance to ...

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.264
whatever it was.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:01.267
But you're really tapping
into something as a host,

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:04.003
trying to approach the job
like you're their advocate.

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:05.271
No question.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:08.074
It's a really cool approach and
it makes sense why it's worked.

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:10.109
And yet you can bring out
your own vulnerabilities.

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.311
Yes.

00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:13.446
You bring out
you're own experiences.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:16.216
I mean, for instance, I mean,
I can't tell you how many times

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:20.587
I've told various fathers
for instance,

00:10:20.587 --> 00:10:22.956
who are raising a child
that is not theirs.

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.358
And whether they will continue
to raise that child,

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:26.559
I keep saying,

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:29.496
"Look, my wife and I
have a child in our family.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.798
I'm not the birth father
of that child.

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:34.701
And he is as close to me
as my birth children.

00:10:34.701 --> 00:10:36.069
There's no difference."

00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:39.405
So you have to be able
to unload yourself.

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:40.773
Yes.

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:42.375
To the guests and the viewers.

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:47.413
That is extremely compassionate
and it makes them ...

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:49.816
That's great that you share
that experience.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.518
And another thing is that ...

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:55.455
Look, there is nothing
in my life that comes close

00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:57.757
to the experiences
that my guests go through.

00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:03.162
I never lived those experiences.
But there's some connective-

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:05.098
There's a bridge.
... Human instinct.

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:09.402
That they feel safe
in my company or on my show.

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:11.004
I feel safe right now.
They don't feel judged.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.238
-Yeah, I do too.
-You do?

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:13.840
I feel completely safe
right now.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.275
You give that air of a like
a therapist.

00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:16.476
I don't feel-

00:11:16.476 --> 00:11:18.578
But I'm not a therapist.
I mean...

00:11:18.578 --> 00:11:19.846
No but you're therapeutic.

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.080
Just that voice,
I don't know what it is.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.282
Very soothing voice, yeah.

00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:24.050
I just feel so good right now.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.718
Do you know how much whiskey
and cigarettes?

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:29.689
That's what I like.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:34.093
You're drunk for sure.
But man, I just feel good,

00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:35.328
my blood pressure's
low right now.

00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:36.596
I know.

00:11:36.596 --> 00:11:38.298
Really? How can you tell?

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:40.667
I'm not sweating,
my heart's not palpate,

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:42.035
I don't feel like
I'm gonna pass out.

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.604
I just feel calm. I'm gonna
get somebody pregnant tonight.

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:46.906
I'm just gonna do it,
I'm coming on your show.

00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:49.676
Cool.
That's the only way ...

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:50.843
Yeah, all right, great.
See you in about six months.
