00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.581
I usually like to start a
lecture with something new,

00:00:04.581 --> 00:00:07.612
but this time I'm going to make
an exception,

00:00:07.612 --> 00:00:11.883
and start with the finishing up
on Friday because it involves a

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:14.707
little more practice with
complex numbers.

00:00:14.707 --> 00:00:18.634
I think that's what a large
number of you are still fairly

00:00:18.634 --> 00:00:20.976
weak in.
So, to briefly remind you,

00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:23.249
it will be sort of
self-contained,

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.866
but still, it will use complex
numbers.

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:30.000
And, I think it's a good way to
start today.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.929
So, remember,
the basic problem was to solve

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:38.041
something with,
where the input was sinusoidal

00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:41.514
in particular.
The k was on both sides,

00:00:41.514 --> 00:00:46.723
and the input looked like
cosine omega t.

00:00:46.723 --> 00:00:52.023
And, the plan of the solution
consisted of transporting the

00:00:52.023 --> 00:00:57.140
problem to the complex domain.
So, you look for a complex

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.989
solution, and you complexify the
right hand side of the equation,

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.397
as well.
So, cosine omega t

00:01:07.397 --> 00:01:11.473
becomes the real part of
this complex function.

00:01:11.473 --> 00:01:15.630
The reason for doing that,
remember, was because it's

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.466
easier to handle when you solve
linear equations.

00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:23.942
It's much easier to handle
exponentials on the right-hand

00:01:23.942 --> 00:01:28.977
side than it is to handle sines
and cosines because exponentials

00:01:28.977 --> 00:01:33.373
are so easy to integrate when
you multiply them by other

00:01:33.373 --> 00:01:35.931
exponentials.
So, the result was,

00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:39.607
after doing that,
y tilda turned out to be one,

00:01:39.607 --> 00:01:44.403
after I scale the coefficient,
one over one plus omega over k

00:01:44.403 --> 00:01:51.341
And then, the rest was e to the

00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:56.946
i times (omega t minus phi),

00:01:56.946 --> 00:02:00.287
where phi had a certain
meaning.

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:06.000
It was the arc tangent of a,
it was a phase lag.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.491
And, this was then,
I had to take the real part of

00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:13.695
this to get the final answer,
which came out to be something

00:02:13.695 --> 00:02:18.255
like one over the square root of
one plus the amplitude one omega

00:02:18.255 --> 00:02:22.459
/ k squared, and then the rest
was cosine omega t plus minus

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.378
phi.

00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:30.511
It's easier to see that that
part is the real part of this;

00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:33.646
the problem is,
of course you have to convert

00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:37.584
this.
Sorry, this should be i omega

00:02:37.584 --> 00:02:41.772
t, in which case you don't need
the parentheses,

00:02:41.772 --> 00:02:45.069
either.
So, the problem was to use the

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.059
polar representation of this
complex number to convert it

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:55.316
into something whose amplitude
was this, and whose angle was

00:02:55.316 --> 00:02:58.702
minus phi.
Now, that's what we call the

00:02:58.702 --> 00:03:02.000
polar method,
going polar.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.896
I'd like, now,
for the first few minutes of

00:03:04.896 --> 00:03:07.793
the period, to talk about the
other method,

00:03:07.793 --> 00:03:10.965
the Cartesian method.
I think for a long while,

00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:14.620
many of you will be more
comfortable with that anyway.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.896
Although, one of the objects of
the course should be to get you

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:22.965
equally comfortable with the
polar representation of complex

00:03:22.965 --> 00:03:25.448
numbers.
So, if we try to do the same

00:03:25.448 --> 00:03:28.551
thing going Cartesian,
what's going to happen?

00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:32.000
Well, I guess the same point
here.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.253
So, the starting point is still
y tilde equals one over,

00:03:37.253 --> 00:03:42.602
sorry, this should have an i
here, one plus i times omega

00:03:42.602 --> 00:03:48.334
over k, e to the i omega t.

00:03:48.334 --> 00:03:52.155
But now, what you're going to

00:03:52.155 --> 00:03:57.217
do is turn this into its
Cartesian, turn both of these

00:03:57.217 --> 00:04:02.185
into their Cartesian
representations as a plus ib.

00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:06.074
So, if you do that Cartesianly,

00:04:06.074 --> 00:04:09.889
of course, what you have to do
is the standard thing about

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.636
dividing complex numbers or
taking the reciprocals that I

00:04:13.636 --> 00:04:16.915
told you at the very beginning
of complex numbers.

00:04:16.915 --> 00:04:21.131
You multiply the top and bottom
by the complex conjugate of this

00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:23.273
in order to make the bottom
real.

00:04:23.273 --> 00:04:27.021
So, what does this become?
This becomes one minus i times

00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:30.835
omega over k divided by the
product of this in its complex

00:04:30.835 --> 00:04:34.650
conjugate, which is the real
number, one plus omega over k

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.000
squared

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.317
So, I've now converted this to
the a plus bi form.

00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:47.491
I have also to convert the
right-hand side to the a plus bi

00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:49.866
form.
So, it will look like cosine

00:04:49.866 --> 00:04:53.823
omega t plus i sine omega t.

00:04:53.823 --> 00:04:55.406
Having done that,

00:04:55.406 --> 00:04:59.076
I take the last step,
which is to take the real part

00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:01.883
of that.
Remember, the reason I want the

00:05:01.883 --> 00:05:06.416
real part is because this input
was the real part of the complex

00:05:06.416 --> 00:05:10.243
input.
So, once you've got the complex

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:14.513
solution, you have to take its
real part to go back into the

00:05:14.513 --> 00:05:17.407
domain you started with,
of real numbers,

00:05:17.407 --> 00:05:19.868
from the domain of complex
numbers.

00:05:19.868 --> 00:05:23.921
So, I want the real part is
going to be, the real part of

00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:27.684
that is, first of all,
there's a factor out in front.

00:05:27.684 --> 00:05:32.180
That's entirely real.
Let's put that out in front,

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.749
so doesn't bother us
particularly.

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:39.265
And now, I need the product of
this complex number and that

00:05:39.265 --> 00:05:42.768
complex number.
But, I only want the real part

00:05:42.768 --> 00:05:45.493
of it.
So, I'm not going to multiply

00:05:45.493 --> 00:05:49.776
it out and get four terms.
I'm just going to look at the

00:05:49.776 --> 00:05:53.591
two terms that I do want.
I don't want the others.

00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:58.184
All right, the real part is
cosine omega t,

00:05:58.184 --> 00:06:02.000
from the product of this and
that.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.812
And, the rest of the real part
will be the product of the two i

00:06:07.812 --> 00:06:11.093
terms.
But, it's i times negative i,

00:06:11.093 --> 00:06:13.906
which makes one.
And therefore,

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:18.687
it's omega over k times sine
omega t.

00:06:18.687 --> 00:06:22.250
Now, that's the answer.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.562
And that's the answer,
too; they must be equal,

00:06:26.562 --> 00:06:32.000
unless there's a contradiction
in mathematics.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.485
But, it's extremely important.
And that's the other reason why

00:06:36.485 --> 00:06:40.088
I'm giving you this,
that you learn in this course

00:06:40.088 --> 00:06:44.352
to be able to convert quickly
and automatically things that

00:06:44.352 --> 00:06:47.735
look like this into things that
look like that.

00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:50.970
And, that's done by means of a
basic formula,

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.647
which occurs at the end of the
notes for reference,

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:58.544
as I optimistically say,
although I think for a lot of

00:06:58.544 --> 00:07:02.367
you will not be referenced,
stuff in the category of,

00:07:02.367 --> 00:07:07.000
yeah, I think I've vaguely seen
that somewhere.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.076
But, well, we never used it for
anything.

00:07:10.076 --> 00:07:12.923
Okay, you're going to use it
all term.

00:07:12.923 --> 00:07:16.230
So, the formula is,
the famous trigonometric

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.923
identity, which is,
so, the problem is to convert

00:07:19.923 --> 00:07:24.000
this into the other guy.
And, the thing which is going

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.307
to do that, enable one to
combine the sine and the cosine

00:07:28.307 --> 00:07:32.307
terms, is the famous formula
that a times the cosine,

00:07:32.307 --> 00:07:36.615
I'm going to use theta to make
it as neutral as possible,

00:07:36.615 --> 00:07:40.030
--
-- so, theta you can think of

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.302
as being replaced by omega t in
this particular application of

00:07:44.302 --> 00:07:47.103
the formula.
But, I'll just use a general

00:07:47.103 --> 00:07:51.095
angle theta, which doesn't
suggest anything in particular.

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:54.456
So, the problem is,
you have something which is a

00:07:54.456 --> 00:07:58.168
combination with real
coefficients of cosine and sine,

00:07:58.168 --> 00:08:03.000
and the important thing is that
these numbers be the same.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.025
In practice,
that means that the omega t,

00:08:06.025 --> 00:08:10.260
you're not allowed to have
omega one t here,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.420
and some other frequency,
omega two t here.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.823
That would correspond to using
theta one here,

00:08:17.823 --> 00:08:21.529
and theta two here.
And, though there is a formula

00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:24.478
for combining that,
nobody remembers it,

00:08:24.478 --> 00:08:28.184
and it's, in general,
less universally useful than

00:08:28.184 --> 00:08:32.949
the first.
If you're going to memorize a

00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:38.542
formula, and learn this one,
it's best to start with the

00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:44.033
ones where the two are equal.
That's the basic formula.

00:08:44.033 --> 00:08:49.525
The others are variations of
it, but there is a sizable

00:08:49.525 --> 00:08:53.389
variations.
All right, so the answer is

00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:59.084
that this is equal to some other
constant, real constant,

00:08:59.084 --> 00:09:06.000
times the cosine of theta minus
phi.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.742
Of course, most people remember
this vaguely.

00:09:09.742 --> 00:09:14.335
What they don't remember is
what the c and the phi are,

00:09:14.335 --> 00:09:18.587
how to calculate them.
I don't suggest you memorize

00:09:18.587 --> 00:09:22.159
the formulas for them.
You can if you wish.

00:09:22.159 --> 00:09:26.497
Instead, memorize the picture,
which is much easier.

00:09:26.497 --> 00:09:31.515
Memorize that a and b are the
two sides of a right triangle.

00:09:31.515 --> 00:09:36.873
Phi is the angle opposite the b
side, and c is the length of the

00:09:36.873 --> 00:09:42.122
hypotenuse.
Okay, that's worth putting up.

00:09:42.122 --> 00:09:48.262
I think that's a pink formula.
It's even worth two of those,

00:09:48.262 --> 00:09:52.945
but I will thrift.
Now, let's apply it to this

00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:57.316
case to see that it gives the
right answer.

00:09:57.316 --> 00:10:02.000
So, to use this formula,
how I use it?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.698
Well, I should take,
I will reproduce the left-hand

00:10:07.698 --> 00:10:09.750
side.
So that part,

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.966
I just copy.
And, how about the right?

00:10:13.966 --> 00:10:19.323
Well, the amplitude,
it's combined into a single

00:10:19.323 --> 00:10:25.819
cosine term whose amplitude is,
well, the two sides of the

00:10:25.819 --> 00:10:33.000
right triangle are one,
and omega over k.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.672
The hypotenuse in that case is
going to be, well,

00:10:36.672 --> 00:10:39.961
why don't we write it here?
So, we have one,

00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:43.404
and omega over k.
And, here's phi.

00:10:43.404 --> 00:10:47.994
So, the hypotenuse is going to
be the square root of one plus

00:10:47.994 --> 00:10:51.513
omega over k squared.

00:10:51.513 --> 00:10:55.338
And, that's going to be
multiplied by the cosine of

00:10:55.338 --> 00:10:59.393
omega t minus this phase lag
angle phi.

00:10:59.393 --> 00:11:02.312
You can write,

00:11:02.312 --> 00:11:05.968
if you wish,
phi equals the arc tangent,

00:11:05.968 --> 00:11:09.531
but you are not learning a lot
by that.

00:11:09.531 --> 00:11:15.156
Phi is the arc tangent of omega
over k.

00:11:15.156 --> 00:11:16.750
That's okay,

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.843
but it's true.
But, notice there's

00:11:19.843 --> 00:11:23.875
cancellation now.
This over that is equal to

00:11:23.875 --> 00:11:28.000
what?
Well, it's equal to this.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.872
And, so when we get in this
way, by combining these two

00:11:31.872 --> 00:11:36.246
factors, one gets exactly the
same formula that we got before.

00:11:36.246 --> 00:11:38.612
So, as you can see,
in some sense,

00:11:38.612 --> 00:11:41.193
there's not,
if you can remember this

00:11:41.193 --> 00:11:45.065
trigonometric identity,
there's not a lot of difference

00:11:45.065 --> 00:11:49.153
between the two methods except
that this one requires this

00:11:49.153 --> 00:11:51.877
extra step.
The answer will come out in

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:55.534
this form, and you then,
to see what it really looks

00:11:55.534 --> 00:11:58.689
like, really have to convert it
to this form,

00:11:58.689 --> 00:12:02.633
the form in which you can see
what the phase lag and the

00:12:02.633 --> 00:12:07.221
amplitude is.
It's amazing how many people

00:12:07.221 --> 00:12:10.156
who should know,
this includes working

00:12:10.156 --> 00:12:13.487
mathematicians,
theoretical mathematicians,

00:12:13.487 --> 00:12:17.612
includes even possibly the
authors of your textbooks.

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:20.944
I'm not sure,
but I've caught them in this,

00:12:20.944 --> 00:12:24.990
too, who in this form,
everybody remembers that it's

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.687
something like that.
Unfortunately,

00:12:27.687 --> 00:12:31.336
when it occurs as the answer in
an answer book,

00:12:31.336 --> 00:12:35.858
the numbers are some colossal
mess here plus some colossal

00:12:35.858 --> 00:12:39.449
mess here.
And theta is,

00:12:39.449 --> 00:12:44.799
again, a real mess,
involving roots and some cube

00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:48.924
roots, and whatnot.
The only thing is,

00:12:48.924 --> 00:12:52.491
these two are the same real
mess.

00:12:52.491 --> 00:12:58.957
That amounts to just another
pure oscillation with the same

00:12:58.957 --> 00:13:05.200
frequency as the old guy,
and with the amplitude changed,

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:12.000
and with a phase shift,
move to the right or left.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.989
So, this is no more general
than that.

00:13:14.989 --> 00:13:18.545
Notice they both have two
parameters in them,

00:13:18.545 --> 00:13:22.909
these two coefficients.
This one has the two parameters

00:13:22.909 --> 00:13:26.141
in an altered form.
Okay, well, I wanted,

00:13:26.141 --> 00:13:29.454
because of the importance of
this formula,

00:13:29.454 --> 00:13:34.141
I wanted to take a couple of
minutes out for a proof of the

00:13:34.141 --> 00:13:36.000
formula, --

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.449
-- just to give you chance to
stare at it a little more now.

00:13:46.449 --> 00:13:50.371
There are three proofs I know.
I'm sure there are 27.

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:53.916
The Pythagorean theorem now has
several hundred.

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:56.405
But, there are three basic
proofs.

00:13:56.405 --> 00:14:00.553
There is the one I will not
give you, I'll call the high

00:14:00.553 --> 00:14:03.418
school proof,
which is the only one one

00:14:03.418 --> 00:14:07.189
normally finds in books,
physics textbooks or other

00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:11.314
textbooks.
The high school proof takes the

00:14:11.314 --> 00:14:14.525
right-hand side,
applies the formula for the

00:14:14.525 --> 00:14:19.229
cosine of the difference of two
angles, which it assumes you had

00:14:19.229 --> 00:14:22.738
in trigonometry,
and then converts it into this.

00:14:22.738 --> 00:14:27.144
It shows you that once you've
done that, that a turns out to

00:14:27.144 --> 00:14:31.549
be c cosine phi
and b, the number b is c sine

00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:35.282
phi,
and therefore it identifies the

00:14:35.282 --> 00:14:39.316
two sides.
Now, the thing that's of course

00:14:39.316 --> 00:14:42.827
correct and it's the simplest
possible argument,

00:14:42.827 --> 00:14:47.086
the thing that's no good about
it is that the direction at

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:49.626
which it goes is from here to
here.

00:14:49.626 --> 00:14:53.586
Well, everybody knew that.
If I gave you this and told

00:14:53.586 --> 00:14:56.948
you, write it out in terms of
cosine and sine,

00:14:56.948 --> 00:15:01.431
I would assume it dearly hope
that practically all of you can

00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:03.867
do that.
Unfortunately,

00:15:03.867 --> 00:15:07.275
when you want to use the
formula, it's this way you want

00:15:07.275 --> 00:15:09.444
to use it in the opposite
direction.

00:15:09.444 --> 00:15:13.038
You are starting with this,
and want to convert it to that.

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:15.826
Now, the proof,
therefore, will not be of much

00:15:15.826 --> 00:15:17.871
help.
It requires you to go in the

00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:20.722
backwards direction,
and match up coefficients.

00:15:20.722 --> 00:15:22.643
It's much better to go
forwards.

00:15:22.643 --> 00:15:25.245
Now, there are two proofs that
go forwards.

00:15:25.245 --> 00:15:28.467
There's the 18.02 proof.
Since I didn't teach most of

00:15:28.467 --> 00:15:32.000
you 18.02, I can't be sure you
had it.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.578
So, I'll spend one minute
giving it to you.

00:15:36.578 --> 00:15:42.248
What is the 18.02 proof?
It is the following picture.

00:15:42.248 --> 00:15:46.609
I think this requires deep
colored chalk.

00:15:46.609 --> 00:15:50.097
This is going to be pretty
heavy.

00:15:50.097 --> 00:15:55.984
All right, first of all,
the a and the b are the given.

00:15:55.984 --> 00:16:01.000
So, I'm going to put in that
vector.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.732
So, there is the vector whose
sides are, whose components are

00:16:05.732 --> 00:16:08.809
a and b.
I'll write it without the i and

00:16:08.809 --> 00:16:11.096
j.
I hope you had from Jerison

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:14.882
that form for the vector,
if you don't like that,

00:16:14.882 --> 00:16:17.564
write ai plus bj,
okay?

00:16:17.564 --> 00:16:20.877
Now, there's another vector
lurking around.

00:16:20.877 --> 00:16:24.821
It's the unit vector whose,
I'll write it this way,

00:16:24.821 --> 00:16:29.554
u because it's a unit vector,
and theta to indicate that it's

00:16:29.554 --> 00:16:34.269
angle is theta.
Now, the reason for doing that

00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:38.657
is because you see that the
left-hand side is a dot product

00:16:38.657 --> 00:16:41.683
of two vectors.
The left-hand side of the

00:16:41.683 --> 00:16:45.011
identity is the dot product of
the vector &lt;a,

00:16:45.011 --> 00:16:49.172
b&gt; with the vector whose
components are cosine theta and

00:16:49.172 --> 00:16:52.122
sine theta.

00:16:52.122 --> 00:16:55.148
That's what I'm calling this
unit vector.

00:16:55.148 --> 00:16:59.536
It's a unit vector because
cosine squared plus sine squared

00:16:59.536 --> 00:17:04.000
is one.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.764
Now, all this formula is,
is saying that scalar product,

00:17:08.764 --> 00:17:13.962
the dot product of those two
vectors, can be evaluated if you

00:17:13.962 --> 00:17:18.987
know their components by the
left-hand side of the formula.

00:17:18.987 --> 00:17:24.099
And, if you don't know their
components, it can be evaluated

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:27.564
in another way,
the geometric evaluation,

00:17:27.564 --> 00:17:31.636
which goes, what is it?
It's a magnitude of one,

00:17:31.636 --> 00:17:36.487
times the magnitude of the
other, times the cosine of the

00:17:36.487 --> 00:17:42.859
included angle.
Now, what's the included angle?

00:17:42.859 --> 00:17:49.957
Well, theta is this angle from
the horizontal to that unit

00:17:49.957 --> 00:17:54.315
vector.
The angle phi is this angle,

00:17:54.315 --> 00:17:58.922
from this picture here.
And therefore,

00:17:58.922 --> 00:18:05.894
the included angle between
(u)theta and my pink vector is

00:18:05.894 --> 00:18:12.455
theta minus phi.
That's the formula.

00:18:12.455 --> 00:18:16.670
It comes from two ways of
calculating the scalar product

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:21.498
of the vector whose coefficients
are, and the unit vector

00:18:21.498 --> 00:18:25.099
whose components are cosine
theta and sine theta.

00:18:25.099 --> 00:18:28.241
All right, well,

00:18:28.241 --> 00:18:35.056
you should, that was 18.02.

00:18:35.056 --> 00:18:36.359
There must be an 18.03 proof
also. Yes.

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:43.747
What's the 18.03 proof?
The 18.03 proof uses complex

00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:46.934
numbers.
It says, look,

00:18:46.934 --> 00:18:53.742
take the left side.
Instead of viewing it as the

00:18:53.742 --> 00:19:02.000
dot product of two vectors,
there's another way.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.765
You can think of it as the part
of the products of two complex

00:19:06.765 --> 00:19:09.187
numbers.
So, the 18.03 argument,

00:19:09.187 --> 00:19:12.312
really, the complex number
argument says,

00:19:12.312 --> 00:19:17.000
look, multiply together a minus
bi and the complex

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.140
number cosine theta plus i sine
theta.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.265
There are different ways of

00:19:24.265 --> 00:19:28.875
explaining why I want to put the
minus i there instead of i.

00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:33.718
But, the simplest is because I
want, when I take the real part,

00:19:33.718 --> 00:19:37.585
to get the left-hand side.
I will.

00:19:37.585 --> 00:19:42.350
If I take the real part of
this, I'm going to get a cosine

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:46.864
theta plus b sine theta

00:19:46.864 --> 00:19:51.128
because of negative i and i make
one,

00:19:51.128 --> 00:19:55.392
multiplied together.
All right, that's the left-hand

00:19:55.392 --> 00:19:58.234
side.
And now, the right-hand side,

00:19:58.234 --> 00:20:03.000
I'm going to use polar
representation instead.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.394
What's the polar representation
of this guy?

00:20:06.394 --> 00:20:09.157
Well, if &lt;a,
b&gt; has the angle theta,

00:20:09.157 --> 00:20:13.815
then a negative b,
a minus bi goes down

00:20:13.815 --> 00:20:16.421
below.
It has the angle minus phi.

00:20:16.421 --> 00:20:18.473
So, this is,
has magnitude.

00:20:18.473 --> 00:20:23.052
It is polar representation.
Its magnitude is a squared plus

00:20:23.052 --> 00:20:27.315
b squared,
and its angle is negative phi,

00:20:27.315 --> 00:20:32.131
not positive phi because this a
minus bi goes below

00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:36.000
the axis if a and b are
positive.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.246
So, it's e to the minus i phi.

00:20:39.246 --> 00:20:43.010
That's the first guy.
And, how about the second guy?

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:47.142
Well, the second guy is e to
the i theta.

00:20:47.142 --> 00:20:51.127
So, what's the product?
It is a squared plus b squared,

00:20:51.127 --> 00:20:54.447
the square root,
times e to the i times (theta

00:20:54.447 --> 00:20:58.137
minus phi).

00:20:58.137 --> 00:21:01.531
And now, what do I want?
The real part of this,

00:21:01.531 --> 00:21:05.000
and I want the real part of
this.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.321
So, let's just say take the
real parts of both sides.

00:21:08.321 --> 00:21:11.196
If I take the real part of the
left-hand side,

00:21:11.196 --> 00:21:14.773
I get a cosine theta plus b
sine theta.

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:17.457
If I take a real part of this

00:21:17.457 --> 00:21:21.226
side, I get square root of a
squared plus b squared times e,

00:21:21.226 --> 00:21:23.653
times the cosine,
that's the real part,

00:21:23.653 --> 00:21:26.783
right, of theta minus phi,
which is just what it's

00:21:26.783 --> 00:21:31.000
supposed to be.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.941
Well, with three different
arguments, I'm really pounding

00:21:35.941 --> 00:21:40.882
the table on this formula.
But, I think there's something

00:21:40.882 --> 00:21:44.323
to be learned from at least two
of them.

00:21:44.323 --> 00:21:47.500
And, you know,
I'm still, for awhile,

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.647
I will never miss an
opportunity to bang complex

00:21:51.647 --> 00:21:55.617
numbers into your head because,
in some sense,

00:21:55.617 --> 00:22:01.000
you have to reproduce the
experience of the race.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.540
As I mentioned in the notes,
it took mathematicians 300 or

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.024
400 years to get used to complex
numbers.

00:22:07.024 --> 00:22:11.000
So, if it takes you three or
four weeks, that's not too bad.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.395
Now, for the rest of the period
I'd like to go back to the

00:22:36.395 --> 00:22:40.096
linear equations,
and try to put into perspective

00:22:40.096 --> 00:22:43.566
and summarize,
and tell you a couple of things

00:22:43.566 --> 00:22:46.573
which I had to leave out,
but which are,

00:22:46.573 --> 00:22:48.963
in my view, extremely
important.

00:22:48.963 --> 00:22:52.433
And, up to now,
I don't want to leave you with

00:22:52.433 --> 00:22:56.443
any misapprehensions.
So, I'm going to summarize this

00:22:56.443 --> 00:23:01.224
way, whereas last lecture I went
from the most general equation

00:23:01.224 --> 00:23:06.391
to the most special.
I'd like to just write them

00:23:06.391 --> 00:23:09.048
down in the reverse order,
now.

00:23:09.048 --> 00:23:13.212
So, we are talking about basic
linear equations.

00:23:13.212 --> 00:23:16.932
First order,
of course, we haven't moved as

00:23:16.932 --> 00:23:20.829
a second order yet.
So, the most special one,

00:23:20.829 --> 00:23:25.967
and the one we talked about
essentially all of the previous

00:23:25.967 --> 00:23:30.927
two times, or last Friday,
anyway, was the equation where

00:23:30.927 --> 00:23:34.470
the k, the coefficient of y,
is constant,

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:39.165
and where you also get it on
the right-hand side quite

00:23:39.165 --> 00:23:44.142
providentially.
So, this is the most special

00:23:44.142 --> 00:23:48.505
form, and it's the one which
governed what I will call the

00:23:48.505 --> 00:23:53.250
temperature-concentration model,
or if you want to be grown up,

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:57.612
the conduction-diffusion model,
conduction-diffusion which

00:23:57.612 --> 00:24:01.821
describes the processes,
which the equation is modeling,

00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:05.954
whereas these simply described
the variables of things,

00:24:05.954 --> 00:24:10.316
which you usually are trying to
calculate when you use the

00:24:10.316 --> 00:24:13.757
equation.
Now, there are a class of

00:24:13.757 --> 00:24:17.625
things where the thing is
constant, but where the k does

00:24:17.625 --> 00:24:20.648
not appear naturally on the
right hand side.

00:24:20.648 --> 00:24:24.937
And, you're going to encounter
them pretty quickly in physics,

00:24:24.937 --> 00:24:27.960
for one place.
So, I better not try to sweep

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:32.738
those under the rug.
Let's just call that q of t.

00:24:32.738 --> 00:24:36.943
And finally,
there is the most general case,

00:24:36.943 --> 00:24:40.463
where you allow k to be
non-constant.

00:24:40.463 --> 00:24:45.842
That's the one we began,
when we talked about the linear

00:24:45.842 --> 00:24:49.753
equation.
And you know how to solve it in

00:24:49.753 --> 00:24:54.350
general by a definite or an
indefinite integral.

00:24:54.350 --> 00:25:01.000
Now, there's one other thing,
which I want to talk about.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.727
I will do all these in a
certain order.

00:25:03.727 --> 00:25:07.460
But, from the beginning,
you should keep in mind that

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.547
there's another between the
first two cases.

00:25:10.547 --> 00:25:14.351
Between the first two cases,
there's another extremely

00:25:14.351 --> 00:25:18.084
important distinction,
and that is as to whether k is

00:25:18.084 --> 00:25:21.314
positive or not.
Up to now, we've always had k

00:25:21.314 --> 00:25:24.759
positive.
So, I'm going to put that here.

00:25:24.759 --> 00:25:30.000
So, it's understood when I
write these, that k is positive.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.291
I want to talk about that,
too.

00:25:32.291 --> 00:25:36.415
But, first things first.
The first thing I wanted to do

00:25:36.415 --> 00:25:39.546
was to show you that this,
the first case,

00:25:39.546 --> 00:25:43.365
the most special case,
does not just apply to this.

00:25:43.365 --> 00:25:45.732
It applies to other things,
too.

00:25:45.732 --> 00:25:48.176
Let me give you a mixing
problem.

00:25:48.176 --> 00:25:51.842
The typical mixing problem
gives another example.

00:25:51.842 --> 00:25:55.890
You've already done in
recitation, and you did one for

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:59.250
the problem set,
the problem of the two rooms

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:04.114
filled with smoke.
But, let me do it just using

00:26:04.114 --> 00:26:08.494
letters, so that the ideas stand
out a little more clearly,

00:26:08.494 --> 00:26:11.817
and you are not preoccupied
with the numbers,

00:26:11.817 --> 00:26:15.593
and calculating with the
numbers, and trying to get

00:26:15.593 --> 00:26:19.067
numerical examples.
So, it's as simple as k sub

00:26:19.067 --> 00:26:21.031
mixing.
It looks like this.

00:26:21.031 --> 00:26:23.825
You have a tank,
a room, I don't know,

00:26:23.825 --> 00:26:26.468
where everything's getting
mixed in.

00:26:26.468 --> 00:26:31.000
It has a certain volume,
which I will call v.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.909
Something is flowing in,
a gas or a liquid.

00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:38.911
And, r will be the flow rate,
in some units.

00:26:38.911 --> 00:26:44.123
Now, since it can't pile up
inside this sealed container,

00:26:44.123 --> 00:26:49.056
which I'm sure is full,
the flow rate out must also be

00:26:49.056 --> 00:26:51.941
r.
And, what we're interested in

00:26:51.941 --> 00:26:56.781
is the amount of salt.
So, x, let's suppose these are

00:26:56.781 --> 00:27:02.551
fluid flows, and the dissolved
substance that I'm talking about

00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:06.926
is not carbon monoxide,
it's salt, any dissolved

00:27:06.926 --> 00:27:14.000
substance, some pollutant or
whatever the problem calls for.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.806
Let's use salt.
So, it's the amount of salt in

00:27:20.806 --> 00:27:28.067
the tank at time t.
I'm interested in knowing how

00:27:28.067 --> 00:27:34.056
that varies with time.
Now, there's nothing to be said

00:27:34.056 --> 00:27:36.578
about how it flows out.
What flows out,

00:27:36.578 --> 00:27:39.497
of course, is what happens to
be in the tank.

00:27:39.497 --> 00:27:41.819
But, I do have to say what
flows in.

00:27:41.819 --> 00:27:46.000
Now, the only convenient way to
describe the in-flow is in terms

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.317
of its concentration.
The salt will be dissolved in

00:27:49.317 --> 00:27:52.701
the in-flowing water,
and so there will be a certain

00:27:52.701 --> 00:27:55.023
concentration.
And, as you will see,

00:27:55.023 --> 00:27:58.075
for a secret reason,
I'm going to give that the

00:27:58.075 --> 00:28:02.612
subscript e.
So, e is the concentration of

00:28:02.612 --> 00:28:05.585
the incoming salt,
in other words,

00:28:05.585 --> 00:28:09.279
in the fluid,
how many grams are there per

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:13.243
liter in the incoming fluid.
That's the data.

00:28:13.243 --> 00:28:17.117
So, this is the data.
r is part of the data.

00:28:17.117 --> 00:28:20.270
r is the flow rate.
v is the volume.

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:25.855
I think I won't bother writing
that down, and the problem is to

00:28:25.855 --> 00:28:30.000
determine what happens to x of
t.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.603
Now, I strongly recommend you
not attempt to work directly

00:28:34.603 --> 00:28:39.529
with the concentrations unless
you feel you have a really good

00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:42.356
physical feeling for
concentrations.

00:28:42.356 --> 00:28:46.959
I strongly recommend you work
with a variable that you are

00:28:46.959 --> 00:28:49.947
given, namely,
the dependent variable,

00:28:49.947 --> 00:28:52.693
which is the amount of salt,
grams.

00:28:52.693 --> 00:28:57.458
Well, because it's something
you can physically think about.

00:28:57.458 --> 00:29:00.446
It's coming in,
it's getting mixed up,

00:29:00.446 --> 00:29:08.815
and some of it is going out.
So, the basic equation is going

00:29:08.815 --> 00:29:18.601
to be that the rate of change of
salt in the tank is the rate of

00:29:18.601 --> 00:29:27.922
salt inflow, let me write salt
inflow, minus the rate of salt

00:29:27.922 --> 00:29:33.203
outflow.
Okay, at what rate is salt

00:29:33.203 --> 00:29:39.170
flowing in?
Well, the flow rate is the flow

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:43.670
rate of the liquid.
I multiply the flow rate,

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:47.556
1 L per minute times the
concentration,

00:29:47.556 --> 00:29:51.647
3 g per liter.
That means 3 g per minute.

00:29:51.647 --> 00:29:56.352
It's going to be,
therefore, the product of the

00:29:56.352 --> 00:30:03.000
flow rate and the concentration,
incoming concentration.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.798
How about the rate of the salt
outflow?

00:30:05.798 --> 00:30:08.892
Well, again,
the rate of the liquid outflow

00:30:08.892 --> 00:30:11.470
is r.
And, what is the concentration

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:15.373
of salt in the outflow?
I must use, when you talk flow

00:30:15.373 --> 00:30:18.983
rates, the other factor must be
the concentration,

00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:22.223
not the amount.
So, what is the concentration

00:30:22.223 --> 00:30:25.464
in the outflow?
Well, it's the amount of salt

00:30:25.464 --> 00:30:29.000
in the tank divided by its
volume.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.828
So, the analog,
the concentration here is x

00:30:32.828 --> 00:30:36.475
divided by v.
Now, here's a typical messy

00:30:36.475 --> 00:30:40.941
equation, dx / dt,
let's write it in the standard,

00:30:40.941 --> 00:30:44.770
linear form,
plus r times x over v equals r

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:50.058
times the given concentration,
which is a function of time.

00:30:50.058 --> 00:30:54.069
Now, this is going to be some
given function,

00:30:54.069 --> 00:30:59.265
and there will be no reason
whatsoever why you can't solve

00:30:59.265 --> 00:31:04.014
it in that form.
And, that's normally what you

00:31:04.014 --> 00:31:05.404
will do.
Nonetheless,

00:31:05.404 --> 00:31:09.155
in trying to understand how it
fits into this paradigm,

00:31:09.155 --> 00:31:12.837
which kind of equation is it?
Well, clearly there's an

00:31:12.837 --> 00:31:15.755
awkwardness in that on the
right-hand side,

00:31:15.755 --> 00:31:19.090
we have concentration,
and on the left-hand side,

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:22.842
we seem to have amounts.
Now, the way to understand the

00:31:22.842 --> 00:31:26.176
equation as opposed to the way
to solve it, well,

00:31:26.176 --> 00:31:28.677
it's a step on the way to
solving it.

00:31:28.677 --> 00:31:32.012
But, I emphasize,
you can and normally will solve

00:31:32.012 --> 00:31:36.746
it in exactly that form.
But, to understand what's

00:31:36.746 --> 00:31:40.031
happening, it's better to
express it in terms of

00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:43.734
concentration entirely,
and that's why it's called the

00:31:43.734 --> 00:31:45.901
concentration,
or the diffusion,

00:31:45.901 --> 00:31:48.137
concentration-diffusion
equation.

00:31:48.137 --> 00:31:51.421
So, I'm going to convert this
to concentrations.

00:31:51.421 --> 00:31:55.474
Now, there's no problem here.
x over v is the concentration

00:31:55.474 --> 00:31:57.780
in the tank.
And now, immediately,

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.575
you see, hey,
it looks like it's going to

00:32:00.575 --> 00:32:06.003
come out just in the first form.
But, wait a minute.

00:32:06.003 --> 00:32:10.010
How about the x?
How do I convert that?

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:13.701
Well, what's the relation
between x?

00:32:13.701 --> 00:32:19.712
So, if the concentration in the
tank is equal to x over v,

00:32:19.712 --> 00:32:25.618
so the tank concentration,
then x is equal to C times the

00:32:25.618 --> 00:32:31.523
constant, V, and dx / dt,
therefore, will be c times dC /

00:32:31.523 --> 00:32:34.487
dt.
You see that?

00:32:34.487 --> 00:32:38.148
Now, that's not in standard
form.

00:32:38.148 --> 00:32:44.669
Let's put it in standard form.
To put it in standard form,

00:32:44.669 --> 00:32:51.076
I see, now, that it's not r
that's the critical quantity.

00:32:51.076 --> 00:32:55.309
It's r divided by v.
So, it's dC / dt,

00:32:55.309 --> 00:33:00.000
C prime, plus r divided by v,
--

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.281
-- I'm going to call that k,
k C, no let's not,

00:33:04.281 --> 00:33:09.772
r divided by v is equal to r
divided by v times Ce.

00:33:09.772 --> 00:33:14.240
That's the equation expressed

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.800
in a form where the
concentration is the dependent

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:23.175
variable, rather than the amount
of salt itself.

00:33:23.175 --> 00:33:27.829
And, you can see it falls
exactly in this category.

00:33:27.829 --> 00:33:31.086
That means that I can talk
about it.

00:33:31.086 --> 00:33:36.484
The natural way to talk about
this equation is in terms of,

00:33:36.484 --> 00:33:43.000
the same way we talked about
the temperature equation.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.235
I said concentration.
I mean, that concentration has

00:33:47.235 --> 00:33:50.308
nothing to do with this
concentration.

00:33:50.308 --> 00:33:54.960
This is the diffusion model,
where salt solution outside,

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.531
cell in the middle,
salt diffusing through a

00:33:58.531 --> 00:34:03.016
semi-permeable membrane into
that, uses Newton's law of

00:34:03.016 --> 00:34:08.000
diffusion, except he didn't do a
law of diffusion.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.663
But, he is sticky.
His name is attached to

00:34:10.663 --> 00:34:13.262
everything.
So, that's this concentration

00:34:13.262 --> 00:34:15.665
model.
It's the one entirely analogous

00:34:15.665 --> 00:34:18.784
to the temperature.
And the physical setup is the

00:34:18.784 --> 00:34:21.122
same.
This one is entirely different.

00:34:21.122 --> 00:34:24.955
Mixing in this form of this
problem has really nothing to do

00:34:24.955 --> 00:34:27.879
with this model whatsoever.
But, nor does that

00:34:27.879 --> 00:34:31.517
concentration had anything to do
with this concentration,

00:34:31.517 --> 00:34:36.000
which refers to the result of
the mixing in the tank.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.535
But, what happens is the
differential equation is the

00:34:40.535 --> 00:34:43.152
same.
The language of input and

00:34:43.152 --> 00:34:47.688
response that we talked about is
also available here.

00:34:47.688 --> 00:34:52.747
So, everything is the same.
And, the most interesting thing

00:34:52.747 --> 00:34:57.283
is that it shows that the analog
of the conductivity,

00:34:57.283 --> 00:35:01.732
the k, the analog of
conductivity and diffusivity is

00:35:01.732 --> 00:35:06.820
this quantity.
I should not be considering r

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:11.683
and v by themselves.
I should be considering as the

00:35:11.683 --> 00:35:15.379
basic quantity,
the ratio of those two.

00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:19.269
Now, why is that,
is the basic parameter.

00:35:19.269 --> 00:35:23.548
What is this?
Well, r is the rate of outflow,

00:35:23.548 --> 00:35:27.341
and the rate of inflow,
what's r over v?

00:35:27.341 --> 00:35:31.426
r over v is the fractional rate
of outflow.

00:35:31.426 --> 00:35:35.316
In other words,
if r over v is one tenth,

00:35:35.316 --> 00:35:40.957
it means that 1/10 of the tank
will be emptied in a minute,

00:35:40.957 --> 00:35:44.500
say.
In other words,

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:49.000
we lumped these two constants
into a single k,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.599
and at the same time have
simplified the units.

00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:58.099
What are the units?
This is volume per minute.

00:35:58.099 --> 00:36:02.199
This is volume.
So, it's simply reciprocal

00:36:02.199 --> 00:36:07.400
minutes, reciprocal time,
which was the same units of

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:11.099
that diffusivity and
conductivity had,

00:36:11.099 --> 00:36:16.031
reciprocal time.
The space variables have

00:36:16.031 --> 00:36:19.164
entirely disappeared.
So, it that way,

00:36:19.164 --> 00:36:22.973
it's simplified.
It's simplified conceptually,

00:36:22.973 --> 00:36:27.883
and now, you can answer the
same type of questions we asked

00:36:27.883 --> 00:36:32.307
before about this.
I think it would be better for

00:36:32.307 --> 00:36:33.923
us to move on,
though.

00:36:33.923 --> 00:36:37.461
Well, just an example,
one really simple thing,

00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:41.923
so, suppose since we spent so
much time worrying about what

00:36:41.923 --> 00:36:45.153
was happening with sinusoid
inputs, I mean,

00:36:45.153 --> 00:36:48.230
when could Ce be sinusoidal,
for example?

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:51.307
Well, roughly sinusoidal if,
for example,

00:36:51.307 --> 00:36:55.000
some factory were polluting.
If this were a lake,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.307
and some factory were polluting
it, but in the beginning,

00:36:59.307 --> 00:37:03.461
at the beginning of the day,
they produced a lot of the

00:37:03.461 --> 00:37:07.692
pollutant, and by the end of the
day when it wound down,

00:37:07.692 --> 00:37:12.230
it might well happen that the
concentration of pollutants in

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:16.615
the incoming stream would vary
sinusoidally with a 24 hour

00:37:16.615 --> 00:37:22.485
cycle.
And then, we would be asking,

00:37:22.485 --> 00:37:26.812
so, suppose this varies
sinusoidally.

00:37:26.812 --> 00:37:31.500
In other words,
it's like cosine omega t.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.908
I'm asking, how closely does

00:37:36.908 --> 00:37:44.000
the concentration in the tank
follow C sub e?

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.173
Now, what would that depend
upon?

00:37:48.173 --> 00:37:52.347
Think about it.
Well, the answer,

00:37:52.347 --> 00:37:58.869
suppose k is large.
Closely, let's just analyze one

00:37:58.869 --> 00:38:03.921
case, if k is big.
Now, what would make k big?

00:38:03.921 --> 00:38:06.697
We know that from the
temperature thing.

00:38:06.697 --> 00:38:10.896
If the conductivity is high,
then the inner temperature will

00:38:10.896 --> 00:38:15.167
follow the outer temperature
closely, and the same thing with

00:38:15.167 --> 00:38:17.871
the diffusion model.
But we, of course,

00:38:17.871 --> 00:38:21.928
therefore, since the equation
is the same, we must get the

00:38:21.928 --> 00:38:25.060
same result here.
Now, what would make k big?

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.049
If r is big,
if the flow rate is very fast,

00:38:28.049 --> 00:38:31.466
we will expect the
concentration of the inside of

00:38:31.466 --> 00:38:35.523
that tank to match fairly
closely the concentration of the

00:38:35.523 --> 00:38:38.654
pollutant, of the incoming salt
solution, or,

00:38:38.654 --> 00:38:43.482
if the tank is very small.
For fixed flow rates,

00:38:43.482 --> 00:38:47.152
if the tank is very small,
well, then it gets emptied

00:38:47.152 --> 00:38:49.270
quickly.
So, both of these are,

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:52.235
I think, intuitive results.
And, of course,

00:38:52.235 --> 00:38:56.258
as before, we got them from
that, by trying to analyze the

00:38:56.258 --> 00:38:59.223
final form of the solution.
In other words,

00:38:59.223 --> 00:39:03.458
we got them by looking at that
form of the solution up there,

00:39:03.458 --> 00:39:07.242
and seeing if k is big.
As k increases,

00:39:07.242 --> 00:39:12.128
what happens to the amplitude,
and what happens to the phase

00:39:12.128 --> 00:39:14.861
lag?
But, that summarizes the two.

00:39:14.861 --> 00:39:17.263
So, this means,
closely means,

00:39:17.263 --> 00:39:20.162
that the phase lag is,
big or small?

00:39:20.162 --> 00:39:23.392
The lag is small.
And, the amplitude is,

00:39:23.392 --> 00:39:27.616
well, the amplitude,
the biggest the amplitude could

00:39:27.616 --> 00:39:33.000
ever be is one because that's
the amplitude of this.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.020
So, the amplitude is near one,
one because that's the

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:41.786
amplitude of the incoming
signal, input,

00:39:41.786 --> 00:39:47.289
whatever you want to call it.
Okay, now, I'd like to spend

00:39:47.289 --> 00:39:52.696
the rest of the time talking
about the failures of number

00:39:52.696 --> 00:39:58.586
one, and when you have to use
number two, and when even number

00:39:58.586 --> 00:40:03.881
two is no good.
So, let me end first-order

00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:08.536
equations by putting my worst
foot forward.

00:40:08.536 --> 00:40:13.744
Well, I'm just trying to avoid
disappointment at

00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:19.951
misapprehensions from you.
I'll watch you leave this room

00:40:19.951 --> 00:40:22.943
and say, well,
he said that,

00:40:22.943 --> 00:40:26.822
okay.
So, the first one you're going

00:40:26.822 --> 00:40:32.585
to encounter very shortly where
one is not satisfied,

00:40:32.585 --> 00:40:38.126
but two is, so on some examples
where you need two,

00:40:38.126 --> 00:40:44.000
well, it's going to happen
right here.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.634
Somebody, sooner or later,
it's going to draw on that

00:40:47.634 --> 00:40:50.639
loathsome orange chalk,
which is unerasable,

00:40:50.639 --> 00:40:52.806
something which looks like
that.

00:40:52.806 --> 00:40:54.973
Remember, you saw it here
first.

00:40:54.973 --> 00:40:58.327
r, yeah, we had that.
Okay, see, I had it in high

00:40:58.327 --> 00:41:00.704
school too.
That's the capacitance.

00:41:00.704 --> 00:41:04.478
This is the resistance.
That's the electromotive force:

00:41:04.478 --> 00:41:07.483
battery, or a source of
alternating current,

00:41:07.483 --> 00:41:11.258
something like that.
Now, of course,

00:41:11.258 --> 00:41:15.954
what you're interested in is
how the current flows in the

00:41:15.954 --> 00:41:18.638
circuit.
Since current across the

00:41:18.638 --> 00:41:23.419
capacitance doesn't make sense,
you have to talk about the

00:41:23.419 --> 00:41:27.780
charge on the capacitance.
So, q, it's customary in a

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:32.225
circle this simple to use as the
variable not current,

00:41:32.225 --> 00:41:36.000
but the charge on the
capacitance.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.642
And then Kirchhoff's,
you are also supposed to know

00:41:40.642 --> 00:41:45.192
that the derivative,
that the time derivative of q

00:41:45.192 --> 00:41:49.185
is what's called the current in
the circuit.

00:41:49.185 --> 00:41:53.735
That sort of intuitive.
But, i in a physics class,

00:41:53.735 --> 00:41:57.914
j in an electrical engineering
class, and why,

00:41:57.914 --> 00:42:02.000
not the letter Y,
but why is that?

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.973
That's because of electrical
engineers use lots of lots of

00:42:06.973 --> 00:42:11.946
complex numbers and therefore,
you have to call current j,

00:42:11.946 --> 00:42:15.174
I guess.
I think they do j in physics,

00:42:15.174 --> 00:42:17.530
too, now.
No, no they don't.

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:21.194
I don't know.
So, i is ambiguous if you are

00:42:21.194 --> 00:42:25.818
in that particular subject.
And it's customary to use,

00:42:25.818 --> 00:42:29.789
I don't know.
Now it's completely safe.

00:42:29.789 --> 00:42:32.366
Okay, where are we?
Well, the law is,

00:42:32.366 --> 00:42:36.517
the basic differential equation
is Kirchhoff's voltage law,

00:42:36.517 --> 00:42:40.597
but the sum of the voltage
drops across these three has to

00:42:40.597 --> 00:42:42.530
be zero.
So, it's R times i,

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.964
which is dq / dt.
That's Ohm's law.

00:42:44.964 --> 00:42:47.898
That's the voltage drop across
resistance.

00:42:47.898 --> 00:42:51.907
The voltage drop across the
capacitance is Coulomb's law,

00:42:51.907 --> 00:42:55.199
one form of Coulomb's law.
It's q divided by C.

00:42:55.199 --> 00:42:57.776
And, that has to be the voltage
drop.

00:42:57.776 --> 00:43:02.000
And then, there is some sign
convention.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.454
So, this is either plus or
minus, depending on your sign

00:43:06.454 --> 00:43:11.233
conventions, but it's E of t.
Now, if I put that in standard

00:43:11.233 --> 00:43:15.769
form, in standard form I
probably should say q prime plus

00:43:15.769 --> 00:43:18.442
q over RC equals,
well, I suppose,

00:43:18.442 --> 00:43:23.221
E over R.
And, this is what would appear

00:43:23.221 --> 00:43:26.542
in the equation.
But, it's not the natural

00:43:26.542 --> 00:43:30.095
thing.
The k is one over RC.

00:43:30.095 --> 00:43:32.330
And, that's the reciprocal.

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:35.893
The RC constant is what
everybody knows is important

00:43:35.893 --> 00:43:39.316
when you talk about a little
circuit of that form.

00:43:39.316 --> 00:43:41.970
On the other hand,
the right-hand side,

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:46.022
it's quite unnatural to try to
stick in the right-hand side

00:43:46.022 --> 00:43:48.397
that same RC.
Call this EC over RC.

00:43:48.397 --> 00:43:50.841
People don't do that,
and therefore,

00:43:50.841 --> 00:43:55.242
it doesn't really fall into the
paradigm of that first equation.

00:43:55.242 --> 00:43:59.433
It's the second equation that
really falls into the category.

00:43:59.433 --> 00:44:02.647
Another simple example of this
is chained to k,

00:44:02.647 --> 00:44:08.476
radioactively changed to k.
Well, let's say the radioactive

00:44:08.476 --> 00:44:10.473
substance, A,
decays into,

00:44:10.473 --> 00:44:14.947
let's say, one atom of this
produces one atom of that for

00:44:14.947 --> 00:44:17.504
simplicity.
So, it decays into B,

00:44:17.504 --> 00:44:21.498
which then still is radioactive
and decays further.

00:44:21.498 --> 00:44:26.292
Okay, what's the differential
equation, which is going to be,

00:44:26.292 --> 00:44:29.088
it's going to govern this
situation?

00:44:29.088 --> 00:44:35.000
What I want to know is how much
B there is at any given time.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.217
So, I want a differential
equation for the quantity of the

00:44:39.217 --> 00:44:41.955
radioactive product at any given
time.

00:44:41.955 --> 00:44:44.470
Well, what's it going to look
like?

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:48.762
Well, it's the amount coming in
minus the amount going out,

00:44:48.762 --> 00:44:51.721
so to speak.
The rate of inflow minus the

00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:55.051
rate of outflow,
except it's not the same type

00:44:55.051 --> 00:44:59.195
of physical flow we had before.
How fast is it coming in?

00:44:59.195 --> 00:45:01.932
Well, A is decaying at a
certain rate,

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:05.484
and so the rate at which A
decays is by the basic

00:45:05.484 --> 00:45:09.618
radioactive law.
It's k1, it's constant,

00:45:09.618 --> 00:45:12.713
decay constant,
times the amount of A present.

00:45:12.713 --> 00:45:15.175
If I used the differential

00:45:15.175 --> 00:45:18.834
equation with A here,
I'd have to put a negative sign

00:45:18.834 --> 00:45:22.633
because it's the rate at which
that stuff is leaving A.

00:45:22.633 --> 00:45:26.854
But, I'm interested in the rate
at which it's coming in to B.

00:45:26.854 --> 00:45:30.793
So, it has a positive sign.
And then, the rate at which B

00:45:30.793 --> 00:45:34.804
is decaying, and therefore the
quantity of good B is gone,

00:45:34.804 --> 00:45:38.388
--
-- that will have some other

00:45:38.388 --> 00:45:41.970
constant, B.
So, that will be the equation,

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:46.405
and to avoid having two
dependent variables in there,

00:45:46.405 --> 00:45:49.647
we know how A is decaying.
So, it's k1,

00:45:49.647 --> 00:45:53.655
some constant times A,
sorry, A will be e to the

00:45:53.655 --> 00:45:56.470
negative, you know,
the decay law,

00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:01.332
so, times the initial amount
that was there times e to the

00:46:01.332 --> 00:46:07.515
negative k1 t.
That's how much A there is at

00:46:07.515 --> 00:46:10.552
any given time.
It's decaying by the

00:46:10.552 --> 00:46:14.283
radioactive decay law,
minus k2 B.

00:46:14.283 --> 00:46:18.881
Okay, so how does the
differential equation look like?

00:46:18.881 --> 00:46:23.479
It looks like B prime plus k2 B
equals an exponential,

00:46:23.479 --> 00:46:28.424
k1 A zero e to the negative k1
t.

00:46:28.424 --> 00:46:31.027
But, there's no reason to

00:46:31.027 --> 00:46:36.146
expect that that constant really
has anything to do with k2.

00:46:36.146 --> 00:46:41.178
It's unnatural to put it in
that form, which is the correct

00:46:41.178 --> 00:46:49.655
one.
Now, in the last two minutes,

00:46:49.655 --> 00:47:02.967
I wish to alienate half the
class by pointing out that if k

00:47:02.967 --> 00:47:13.065
is less than zero,
none of the terminology of

00:47:13.065 --> 00:47:25.000
transient, steady-state input
response applies.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.205
The technique of solving the
equation is identical.

00:47:28.205 --> 00:47:33.380
But, you cannot interpret.
So, the technique is the same,

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:37.098
and therefore it's worth
learning.

00:47:37.098 --> 00:47:41.718
The technique is the same.
In other words,

00:47:41.718 --> 00:47:48.704
the solution will be still e to
the negative kt integral q of t

00:47:48.704 --> 00:47:54.901
e to the kt dt plus

00:47:54.901 --> 00:48:00.422
a constant times e to the k,
oh, this is terrible,

00:48:00.422 --> 00:48:04.709
no.
dy / dt, let's give an example.

00:48:04.709 --> 00:48:10.041
The equation I'm going to look
at is something that looks like

00:48:10.041 --> 00:48:13.362
this: y equals q of t,
let's say, okay,

00:48:13.362 --> 00:48:17.033
a constant, but the constant a
is positive.

00:48:17.033 --> 00:48:19.917
So, the constant here is
negative.

00:48:19.917 --> 00:48:23.413
Then, when I solve,
my k, in other words,

00:48:23.413 --> 00:48:26.647
is now properly written as
negative a.

00:48:26.647 --> 00:48:30.493
And therefore,
this formula should now become

00:48:30.493 --> 00:48:36.000
not this, but the negative k is
a t.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.092
And, here it's negative a t.
And, here it is positive a t.

00:48:41.092 --> 00:48:44.756
Now, why is it,
if this is going to be the

00:48:44.756 --> 00:48:49.491
solution, why are all those
things totally irrelevant?

00:48:49.491 --> 00:48:54.762
This is not a transient any
longer because if a is positive,

00:48:54.762 --> 00:48:59.408
this goes to infinity.
Or, if I go to minus infinity,

00:48:59.408 --> 00:49:03.533
then C is negative.
So, it's not transient.

00:49:03.533 --> 00:49:07.000
It's not going to zero,
and it depends heavily on the

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.133
initial conditions.
That means that of these two

00:49:10.133 --> 00:49:12.533
functions, this is the important
guy.

00:49:12.533 --> 00:49:15.133
This is just fixed,
some fixed function.

00:49:15.133 --> 00:49:18.733
Everything, in other words,
is going to depend upon the

00:49:18.733 --> 00:49:21.933
initial conditions,
whereas in the other cases we

00:49:21.933 --> 00:49:25.199
have been studying,
the initial conditions after a

00:49:25.199 --> 00:49:30.509
while don't matter anymore.
Now, why did I say I would

00:49:30.509 --> 00:49:35.433
alienate half of you?
Well, because in what subjects

00:49:35.433 --> 00:49:39.777
will a be positive?
In what subjects will k be

00:49:39.777 --> 00:49:43.155
negative?
k is typically negative in

00:49:43.155 --> 00:49:45.569
biology, economics,
Sloan.

00:49:45.569 --> 00:49:50.009
In other words,
the simple thing is think of it

00:49:50.009 --> 00:49:53.774
in biology.
What's the simplest equation

00:49:53.774 --> 00:49:58.408
for population growth?
Well, it is dP / dt equals

00:49:58.408 --> 00:50:02.752
some, if the population is
growing, a times P,

00:50:02.752 --> 00:50:09.982
and a is a positive number.
That means P prime minus a P is

00:50:09.982 --> 00:50:13.254
zero.
So, the thing I want to leave

00:50:13.254 --> 00:50:16.814
you with is this.
If life is involved,

00:50:16.814 --> 00:50:22.107
k is likely to be negative.
k is positive when inanimate

00:50:22.107 --> 00:50:25.667
things are involved;
I won't say dead,
