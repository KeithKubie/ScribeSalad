00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.380
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: This is Roy Freed; he will
be our speaker today.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.520
Roy and I know each other first from the Bulgarian
community.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.650
My mother in law and he knew each other from
a while back.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.360
And he was the first to publish a paper on
computer law in 1960 and he will be talking

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.000
about from working on computer law from 1960
to the modern law of the mind.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.010
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: Thank you.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.410
My wife and I were very fortunate in that.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.809
Thank you so very much for coming, I sure
appreciate this and I hope that I can stimulate

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.800
you to be curious and engage with me, maybe
at lunch with some discussion.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.570
I'm eager to get critiques and comments so
I can learn.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.249
As I started to say, my wife at age 72, we're
fortunate to have Fulbright Fellowships in

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:11.890
Bulgaria of all places and by a very interesting
series of coincidences, I'm writing my autobiography

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.729
now and all these items are pouring out of
me and I hope that eventually, if it gets

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.420
published, it will attract people.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.770
But in any event, here I am.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:32.149
And I've been lured into talking about my
great fortune of discovering computer law.

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:43.289
In 1960, in the middle of my career, previous
to that time I was a late bloomer and I sadly

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:50.650
got involved with litigation in large anti-trust
cases with massive files.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:58.110
It was onerous both psychological and physically
managing these papers without the computer

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.500
help that would eventually, were created.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.860
But I must say I'm glad that they didn't develop
those systems while I was active, it might

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.330
have lured me to stay in that field, which
I didn't like, so I'm glad they delayed that

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.690
a bit.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.630
I happen to have, by good fortune, an innate
engineering aptitude; I didn't realize that

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.680
until late in life.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.890
But I happened to take advantage of that as
things went along in various fields in which

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.900
I worked.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:45.610
When I was down in Philadelphia, really desperate
working on anti-trust cases, suddenly in 1959

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.570
actually, computers were first commercialized
and my engineering aptitude enabled me immediately

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.270
to grasp what the technology was all about.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.900
It seem to bewilder other people but I was
very fortunate in that immediately I could

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.170
recognize not only what they were about but
also I started to think in my usual sort of

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.790
preventive way about the possible legal implications
of having computers used and available.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.000
And so I was inspired promptly to write an
article called "The Lawyers Guide through

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.630
the Computer Maze" and I was very fortunate
to find Paul Wolkin, the editor of The Practical

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.441
Lawyer, a publication of the Joint Committee
on Continuing Professional Education of the

00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:45.380
American Bar Association and the American
Law Institute in Philadelphia.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.040
And he immediately embraced the article and
published it.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:57.041
I was fortunate I found him because they were
no editors, law students primarily of the

00:03:57.041 --> 00:04:02.980
traditional law journals who ever would have
touched it because it was so different from

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.680
the traditional footnoted articles, ponderous
articles.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.730
And that was a great fortune, good fortune
for me.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.700
Paul not only published it but gave me free
200 copies of reprints that I could distribute.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.250
Of course I immediately got the idea that
I'd like to develop a private practice and

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:32.330
also he, on his own initiative, that I would
be general chairman of seven continuing education

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.039
programs throughout the country.

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:38.699
So it was a great boost to me.

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:46.290
I was able, as a real lawyer, rather than
a lawyer that came from a engineering background,

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:53.669
to realize the intellectual and legal implications
of computers being available.

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:59.919
And I readily discovered that they were very
similar to existing law issues because computers

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.240
were simply used either in place of or to
supplement human minds.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:12.240
So I was, I enjoyed that aspect and I wrote
countless articles and wonderful thing was

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.129
that computer law turned out to be the magic
carpet for my wife and myself.

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:24.470
It enabled us to travel throughout the world
for me to be the guru and give lectures and

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.400
it was absolutely wonderful.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.360
I enjoyed that from 1960 until 1986 when I
retired.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:42.669
And figure if I retired in 1986 I'm quite
much older than all of you combined [chuckles].

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:51.160
What I found fascinating was that while I
was satisfied with computer law and what I

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.030
really, really came to enjoy was my retirement.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:02.710
Computer law was my avenue to deeper thinking
in retirement and if you have questions about

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.889
computer law and if it triggers your mind,
I'd be delighted to answer your questions.

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.270
First, I should say I found implications in
practically all fields of law.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:20.259
I wrote articles about the tax implications
about the intellectual property implications

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:25.629
and tort implications as involving civil wrongs.

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:36.520
I found them in all fields and a natural development
from those fields.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:45.319
And intellectual property, I would say that
obviously evoked copyright and it was amazing

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:53.110
how, I'm bragging now, how I readily appreciated
the technology but other people simply couldn't

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.699
grasp it.

00:06:54.699 --> 00:07:01.860
And when computer people devised the term
'program' that really threw people.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:09.080
There was an effort to patent a program, the
first effort.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:15.509
And it got to the Supreme Court and Justice
Douglas, who was a very bright and wonderful

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:21.650
man, who spoke his opinion and said that computer
programs, they're not patentable but that

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.569
doesn't necessarily mean they never would
be.

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:32.029
He had no idea what he was talking about and
neither did the lawyers handling the case.

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:39.479
They simply couldn't understand that a program
is a process and processes are patentable

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:46.289
if they are practical and deal with the, especially
with tangible things.

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:55.770
People couldn't understand tangibility, the
physical nature of electromagnetic pulse signals

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:56.770
in computers.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:03.919
It was way beyond their imagination and it
remains so today, astonishingly.

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:11.860
Well, I wrote an article pointing out the
analogy between the technology of computers

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.120
and other types of technology.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:22.129
And I haven't had fun that way, I'd like to
stand out, I have a strong ego and it enabled

00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:28.750
me to become a real person after struggling
with that awful anti-trust litigation.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:35.630
Well, what I, my message really is how a mind
evolves.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.150
And my mind evolved from computers.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:48.850
It's fascinating and I'm so thrilled, computers
have made me, as a person, first, by getting

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:58.820
into computer law and I had to struggle there,
I became active with a committee of the American

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:05.880
Bar Association called the Electronic Data
Retrieval Committee.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:12.900
And they were focused only on searching the
vast law library and at that time, the technology

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:20.060
available was primitive with the electromagnetic
punch card system of IBM and Remington Rand

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:29.020
and then a young imaginative law professor
at the University of Pittsburgh was able to

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:37.580
wheedle 400,000 dollars from the Ford Foundation
to create a very modest computer batch processing

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.930
system to search the law cases.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:48.380
And that was really the beginning but it was
so primitive and frustrating at the time.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:54.750
And I was a pioneer in my group trying to
talk about legal issues and it didn't resonate

00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:00.080
with them and, at one point, I had talked
about legal issues and taxation and how to

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:09.950
tax the, how to treat, for taxation purposes,
the expenses for creating programs and how

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.270
to deal with the income from their marketing.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:20.900
And I did that and I suggested moving on to
other topics and one of the members of the

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:26.630
committee said "Well, you already covered
the legal issues" and it was so naive.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:32.510
But in any event, I struggled through that
and I had a really great time.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:40.150
There was an American Bar Association conference
in New York, probably in the early '80s and

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:47.360
I wrote a mock trial for that and we demonstrated
that, in New York, how to introduce computer

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.740
records into evidence.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:57.030
Amazing but in the beginning there was so,
such ignorance about the nature of the records

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:04.810
and suspicion that they couldn't be reliable
but in many cases lawyers failed to file cases,

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:12.170
very valid cases, to recover money due because
of the concern lest they not persuade the

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.560
judge to accept them.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.220
It was bizarre.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:22.910
It's amazing how naive so many minds, bright
minds, can be.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:27.110
And in that case it was interesting.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:36.550
The chair of the business law committee agreed
to sponsor that presentation, that mock trial

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:43.100
and I got a very interesting judge, a district
court judge in New York to read it, preside

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.130
at it.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:50.120
And the last minute, that chair withdrew his
sponsorship and the judge said, "we're going

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.440
on" and we did it and it was beautiful.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:58.240
We read the text because we didn't have time
to prepare but it worked fine.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.680
And eventually I sold it to a law book publisher
and got enough money to take my family on

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.580
a trip to Europe.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:10.570
[chuckles]
But in any event, I did that very satisfactorily,

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.950
in fact my last legal work was for MIT.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:23.010
I had, in a computer role, become especially
known for drafting contracts to describe the

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.800
technology in relationships.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:36.900
Like, for example, for MIT they wanted Wachovia
Computer Services to take over the management

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.110
of the student loan program.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:44.790
And Wachovia presented us with a standard
form contract, so called.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.780
And it was really bizarre, even though they
were supposed to be knowledgeable and that

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.560
was their industry.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.990
I redrafted it and presented mine and they
both readily accepted it.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:03.800
And the bursar at MIT would repeatedly call
me and say how nice it was to have that agreement

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.190
in her drawer.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:12.350
Because it was really a system design for
how to maintain that relationship and it worked

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.350
well.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.280
So I left in a blaze of glory.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:23.050
And there I was, retired and relieved of the
responsibility to make a living and that made

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.170
my mind available.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:29.660
And it's wonderful how having time to think
and trying to think is so rewarding.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:37.320
I mean, it really revealed to me, the fact
that I had a very good mind.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:42.370
And it is thrilling to know your mind that
way.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:50.931
And, but what it did was it enabled me to
stop thinking about the human by drawing a

00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:54.910
broad analogy from computers.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:14:04.410
Not long before that neuroscientists had finally
discovered that the human mind had, consists

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:14.360
of circuitry and that there are electrochemical
pulse signals that represent facts and ideas

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.570
that flow through that circuitry.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:22.840
That immediately enabled me to start drawing
a very broad analogy with computers.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:31.110
I mean, the parallels are so compelling and
I'm thinking deeply about that.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:41.130
I realize that the ideal way to learn how
the opaque mind operates is by drawing analogies

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.460
and features into transparent computers.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:54.850
It's amazing how that inferential technique,
along with introspection, is the ideal means

00:14:54.850 --> 00:15:01.450
for non-scientists to discover what their
minds are really like.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:08.160
It provides an ideal basis for comparison
and really the trick in that comparison to

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:15.500
realize that the human mind is superior to
computers by virtue of its creativity and

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.830
free will.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:25.330
And that opens up such a universe of understanding,
self-understanding of understanding how society

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.290
works by interaction of minds.

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:36.880
And it opens up this very broad concept that
the whole world is actually a so-called information

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.550
processing system.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:42.790
It's haphazard but it exists, it is.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:51.430
But, I'm especially thrilled about is the
fact that by knowing how the mind operates

00:15:51.430 --> 00:16:02.370
as such an animate autonomous machine, you
learn some of the nature and source of some

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:07.120
of the social problems that we have in society.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:13.450
For example, the human mind arrives as a partial
blank slate, some people say as a blank slate

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:14.980
but that's not true.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:21.380
It arrives with this wonderful potential array
of abilities.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:28.960
A person eventually to become an adult, a
well-functioning adult.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:36.920
But it lacks the knowledge for using those
great skills, but evolution, and it's all

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.930
so related to evolution.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:47.540
Evolution arranged naturally that when each
human mind arrives with its partial blank

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:54.690
slate it automatically, from birth, starts
to receive input signals from the environment.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.180
But who is the environment?

00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:02.470
Immediately the parents and so by starting
with the parents it immediately starts to

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:11.389
embrace automatically their cultural values,
their patterns of life, and their religion,

00:17:11.389 --> 00:17:18.780
their politics and that continues throughout
life as the environment expands from the parents.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:22.589
And the-.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:29.519
What I find well that makes each mind susceptible
to ideologies automatically and naturally.

00:17:29.519 --> 00:17:31.840
I mean it's inevitable.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:42.669
And I realized that the instinct to survive
which exists in order to protect the physical

00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:51.620
structure of our body at the same time exists
to protect our point of view or our ego or

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:57.559
persona equally and against contradictions.

00:17:57.559 --> 00:18:07.990
And the, it does so by argumentation, verbal
argumentation and also violence and that creates

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.169
social problems in society.

00:18:11.169 --> 00:18:19.080
But I think that this functional perception
of the human mind that I'm describing as a

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:28.350
machine is so parallel to computers, enables
people to understand how the social problems

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:37.440
and personal problems arise and makes it,
if they're deep thinkers, should enable them

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:46.480
to realize that in order to protect and overcome
many of those problems, they should take advantage

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:55.029
of their creativity and free will and gain
an open mind that engages in critical thinking.

00:18:55.029 --> 00:19:03.220
I have the theory that that's an ideal basis
for teaching, especially young people, how

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:09.889
to start thinking, how to start using their
minds constructively for their own benefit

00:19:09.889 --> 00:19:14.620
and for the benefit of society if they would
think broadly enough.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:22.830
This is the general context in which I've
been thinking deeply and I find it so amazingly

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:29.559
exciting I find having the opportunity to
think deeply on your own is just the most

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:32.190
precious experience that is imaginable.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:44.710
It's an absolute delight, I can't tell you
how much I find it exciting and creative and

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.070
supporting my ego [laughs].

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:50.650
It makes me an important person in my own
estimation.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:20:00.530
But what I find fascinating is that knowing
this general nature of the human mind I've

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:06.929
described, it becomes possible to find aspects
of it that are so interesting.

00:20:06.929 --> 00:20:10.770
To get away from the generality to the specific.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:16.820
For example, I came to realize, on my own,
and I do all of this independently.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:27.160
I don't do research, I find, I can't find
parallel approaches to my thinking and also,

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.590
I'm selfish enough that I want to do it myself.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.980
[chuckles] I want it to be my, my creation.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:41.950
But in any event by thinking independent suddenly
I find the amazing subconscious, is so creative,

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:49.480
it, Freud's discovery of the unconscious,
discovered, or created a I think deceptive

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.470
term; because we're not unconscious we have
to be conscious.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:59.510
But we have two levels of consciousness, the
subconscious and the awareness level.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:10.460
And I'm so aware of my subconscious and how
it produces ideas on its own and sometimes

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.809
with the help of Google.

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:17.840
I can't tell you how invaluable Google is
as I do a lot of writing and I come across

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:24.149
a phrase or a word or things like that and
I have a feeling of the significance and I

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:34.240
say real easily I rely upon Google to help
me understand the accuracy and I constantly

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.240
do that.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:44.090
I'm writing a very extensive autobiography
right now and I spend so much time diverting

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:50.260
from the composing to check and validate things
like that.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:56.460
So I got the idea at one point, I don't know
where, it popped in my subconscious, and it's

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:02.679
so invaluable to nurture it and to benefit
from it.

00:22:02.679 --> 00:22:12.090
The idea about experiencing art and knowing
how the mind operates on coded discreet batches

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:21.480
of electrochemical pulse signals that evolution
exploited.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:28.220
That we experience everything that way, in
that functional way.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:36.129
And, a, I have been involved with art, I've
made sculpture for 20 years from found objects

00:22:36.129 --> 00:22:41.440
using the engineering part of my mind.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:49.590
I was moved to write an article to describe
my perceptions of the functional aspects of

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.590
art.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:56.529
And what I found was so interesting, I network
well, believe me it's wonderful.

00:22:56.529 --> 00:23:00.559
And you live here [chuckles] and I work here,
I know this now.

00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:08.749
But in Canton, Mass, where I live they have
a wonderful Canton Community TV System and

00:23:08.749 --> 00:23:15.389
it's run by a very bright woman and in my
networking activity, I live in a retirement

00:23:15.389 --> 00:23:17.210
community down in Canton.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:26.509
I took initiative to get in touch with her
and she readily realized I apparently have

00:23:26.509 --> 00:23:32.899
a contribution to make in my ideas and discussion.

00:23:32.899 --> 00:23:40.700
And she, when I gave her my idea on art she
brought up the fact that Leo Tolstoy, a famous

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:47.710
Russian author had written an article entitled
"What is Art?"

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:55.549
I had no idea about that, I mean, the networking
is so invaluable for bringing out these resources

00:23:55.549 --> 00:24:06.500
and it became so interesting how his notice
that art is simply the exercise of feeling.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:13.389
And I would define art as all activities that
produce human feeling which is so fundamental

00:24:13.389 --> 00:24:16.080
to human existence.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:25.210
And I found it fascinating to find his, Tolstoy's,
abstract concept so parallel to my functional

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:33.529
concept and I wrote an article about the functional
aspect of art with his, with Tolstoy's ideas

00:24:33.529 --> 00:24:35.049
in the background.

00:24:35.049 --> 00:24:44.629
And it turned out to be an actually beautiful
article and recently she and I had a conversation

00:24:44.629 --> 00:24:51.919
on her TV and produced a half an hour program
and it's just exciting.

00:24:51.919 --> 00:25:00.320
And it's so, I think perfect for non-scientists,
that's the important aspect of what I'm doing

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.320
and thinking about.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:08.169
Because I am a non-scientist, I can assimilate
and grasp a neuroscientist concept and I think

00:25:08.169 --> 00:25:14.639
that through the functional understanding
of the human mind, it becomes more possible

00:25:14.639 --> 00:25:20.440
to grasp what neuroscientists are discovering
and describing.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:30.700
And so I find that it's an ideal vehicle to
reach and educate non-scientists from this

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.169
basic approach.

00:25:32.169 --> 00:25:38.620
And I've talked for about a half hour now
and I would love it if I have stimulated,

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:45.970
triggered things in your mind, if you would
respond, if you would validate what I say.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:52.230
I love validation, but also if you'd criticize,
because I'm concerned that in my self-focus

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:56.510
that I might be off the wall in some respects,
which I would not want to do.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:03.090
So I invite you people to help me, and I came
here for the help.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.090
Thank you.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:05.090
OK

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.090
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Computer scientists, great challenges
trying to emulate certain ways that the human

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.090
mind thinks.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:10.090
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: yeah.

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:14.970
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I mean there are obviously big
differences but-

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:17.669
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: Yeah, parallel processing.

00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:18.669
Yeah.

00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:25.980
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Well, neural networks for example,
trying to make the computers be able to do

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.400
the sorts of things that humans-
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: Yeah

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.400
&gt;&gt;Male #1: -can do
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: Oh sure.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.400
&gt;&gt;Male #1: -ends up being a great challenge.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:35.272
Obviously there are gaps there, but one thing
that you seem to have not touched on and I

00:26:35.272 --> 00:26:36.272
wonder whether you-
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: Thank you

00:26:36.272 --> 00:26:43.200
&gt;&gt;Male #1: -is the changing of the human mind
as a result of working with computers.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:52.210
All I hear on this topic is people's cynicism;
nobody's going to be able to find his way

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:54.529
around on the map anymore because they're
using mapping computers.

00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:56.019
They can't use a dictionary because the computer
does that work for them.

00:26:56.019 --> 00:27:00.889
But not going to the extent of actually coupling
the mind with the computer.

00:27:00.889 --> 00:27:10.330
Have you thought about how peoples thinking
is changing as a result of the extension of

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:15.269
your thought to here's the data I was looking
for in Google search for example?

00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:22.720
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: I think that computers are mostly
significant for giving us this opening to

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:30.269
the mind and as aides, supplementary aides,
they're great but I think this opening up

00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:36.480
is wonderful contribution they make.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:44.749
And what I find amazing is how little people
who use computers really know how they work

00:27:44.749 --> 00:27:52.970
and it's so simple and I think that in my
missionary effort that it could be a way to

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:57.830
encourage people to learn more about computers.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:06.499
By the way, in thinking about this, I really
recently, I love writing essays on these aspects

00:28:06.499 --> 00:28:08.159
of my general thinking.

00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:13.769
And recently somehow my subconscious triggered
me to think about artificial intelligence.

00:28:13.769 --> 00:28:20.139
Ray Kurzweil, this great futurist guru here
has the solution, there are going to be computers

00:28:20.139 --> 00:28:22.690
that are superior to the mind.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:25.260
Which I think is the silliest concept in the
world.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:31.419
I think that, that artificial intelligence,
I think, is really only programming computers

00:28:31.419 --> 00:28:36.259
to do specific activities like play chess
and things like that.

00:28:36.259 --> 00:28:43.379
But when you think about the human mind, it
is not, while it is a controlling mechanism

00:28:43.379 --> 00:28:52.960
for the related human body as an encompassing
machine or system, the two are so interrelated

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.799
they're inseparable.

00:28:54.799 --> 00:29:00.419
And to think of artificial intelligence as
a separate mind it's unreasonable.

00:29:00.419 --> 00:29:09.500
The mind needs a supporting body and I can't
quite picture an independent mind as a robot,

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:19.690
pure robot tagging along with a cart that's
the body that forages for nutrition and operates

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:25.809
as a chemical factory to support the mind
and a power generator for creating the pulse

00:29:25.809 --> 00:29:27.149
signals.

00:29:27.149 --> 00:29:35.679
I mean I think that it's so important to analyze
the realities and not be taken up by these

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:37.999
flashy ideas.

00:29:37.999 --> 00:29:44.190
I think Ray is brilliant but I think, I dunno
if you'd agree with me but I think he's off

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:50.450
the wall because it just isn't realistic in
the approach he's taking.

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:51.450
Yeah?

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:58.630
&gt;&gt;Male #2: [unintelligible] part of what he
is proposing is that people will be able to

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.049
move their minds into computers in some way.

00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:06.179
And the various ways people think about how
to get your mind out of your brain into a

00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:13.360
machine is interesting just to think about.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.272
Whether it's possible in any way.

00:30:16.272 --> 00:30:18.960
[chuckles] Does it involve, you know, projecting
a hundred or a thousand years or however,

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:25.570
will the computers ever be advanced enough
to conceive of that as a probability?

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:33.960
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: I think the computers can only
supplements that the human mind is so fundamental

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:42.399
and so amazing that I think that we're limited
to using them to supplement the mind which

00:30:42.399 --> 00:30:43.750
can be great.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:51.240
And I do that in sort of a primitive way and
I also do that by inspiring me to think more

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.030
deeply about the mind.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:57.039
I think that is the approach, I don't know
if I'm right or not but that seems to me to

00:30:57.039 --> 00:30:58.039
be what it's all about.

00:30:58.039 --> 00:30:59.039
Yeah?

00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:05.409
&gt;&gt;Male #3: using your model of studying the
computer to learn about the mind to some extent

00:31:05.409 --> 00:31:08.830
answered the question.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:15.820
We have virtual machines, that is a computer
can run within it a number of things, each

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:20.549
of which feels like it is an independent computer.

00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:22.590
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: Yeah.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:28.411
&gt;&gt;Male #3: It's relatively easy [unintelligible]
the easiest of course is the internal one

00:31:28.411 --> 00:31:29.411
thinks it's identical to the outer one-

00:31:29.411 --> 00:31:30.411
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: Yeah.

00:31:30.411 --> 00:31:32.509
&gt;&gt;Male #3: -the more difference you get, the
more you have to advance the technology of

00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:33.799
making the computers basically.

00:31:33.799 --> 00:31:40.059
With the software and the operating systems
in order to be able to simulate a different

00:31:40.059 --> 00:31:46.850
kind of processor chip or altogether a different
way of operating.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:53.929
For example, a virtual machine which thinks
like the human mind presumably can't be built

00:31:53.929 --> 00:31:59.879
until you can have the basic computer be able
to think like the human mind to some extent.

00:31:59.879 --> 00:32:04.909
So we will have to get computers presumably,
who can be.

00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:07.429
Ooo, I just used [inaudible]

00:32:07.429 --> 00:32:09.609
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: Yeah, sure.

00:32:09.609 --> 00:32:13.109
&gt;&gt;Male #3: -perspective, get the concept of
self.

00:32:13.109 --> 00:32:20.200
And then it's a lot of work above that to
basically model the entire human body and

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.279
mind as one, as you said.

00:32:22.279 --> 00:32:26.269
The mind and the muscles are very linked,
they're very linked, they're not separate

00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:27.269
devices.

00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:31.870
They're attached to each other and so you
could imagine the number of years it might

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:34.729
take to make a computer than can think like
a person.

00:32:34.729 --> 00:32:35.729
If that's possible.

00:32:35.729 --> 00:32:40.840
Double to get to a point where you could actually
put a human's mind into it.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:48.409
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: I think, and again I feel so
modest about this because I'm not a neuroscientist

00:32:48.409 --> 00:32:55.119
but I think that the operation of the human
mind devised by evolution by natural section

00:32:55.119 --> 00:33:06.299
is so unique, is so elusive in the very details
of coding facts and ideas in the electrochemical

00:33:06.299 --> 00:33:11.730
pulse signals in the mind.

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:18.769
I find it difficult to imagine that people
would ever be able to emulate that in computers.

00:33:18.769 --> 00:33:21.150
But that's my present thinking.

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:26.470
But recently I noted in the newspaper and
I find it invaluable reading a newspaper,

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:29.220
especially the New York Times.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:43.799
A computer system was devised to replicate
some medical aspect enables doing research

00:33:43.799 --> 00:33:52.779
on the computer instead of directly on, what
would be on animal models, counterparts of

00:33:52.779 --> 00:33:54.289
your mind.

00:33:54.289 --> 00:34:04.749
But I, that's a very fascinating development
but I just find it hard to really expect that

00:34:04.749 --> 00:34:12.440
neuroscientists can picture those individual
pulse signals and how they work.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:19.190
And I also think it's fascinating when you
have the computer model to realize how the

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:26.909
circuitry of the mind is segmented and how
like in computers the segments are joined,

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:29.559
are assigned significance.

00:34:29.559 --> 00:34:39.950
And I find it fascinating and I'm thinking
and how the segments in computers are connected

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:48.099
by switches and the programs activate the
switches to conduct thinking, the counterpart

00:34:48.099 --> 00:34:49.099
of thinking.

00:34:49.099 --> 00:34:52.050
The carrying out the processes.

00:34:52.050 --> 00:35:00.289
And it caused me to wonder well how this is
in the mind and then I thought about synapses.

00:35:00.289 --> 00:35:05.299
And synapses being the opposite of switches
in that they're always open and you have to

00:35:05.299 --> 00:35:08.000
find a way to jump them.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:19.310
And I was able, uniquely, to meet a professor
at MIT in the McGovern Institute for Brain

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:23.280
Research who's supposed to be an expert on
synapses.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:30.160
And he immediately helped by saying "well
synapses operate by modulation" and as an

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:35.660
engineer, as sort of an amateur engineer,
I realized what happens in programs is they

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:45.260
generate added impulse to cause as appropriate
the electrochemical pulse signals that represent

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:53.030
facts and ideas into particular segments of
the mind in order to conduct the type of thinking

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.099
that's desired.

00:35:55.099 --> 00:36:04.990
So I'm just sort of trying to give you relatively
an example or how I think having an engineering

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:12.000
aptitude and a systems approach and getting
this sort of superficial understanding that

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:22.690
I have so enables people to understand better
who they are, how they work and I would hope

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:30.510
idealistically that if they gain this knowledge
that they can realize how they're being imposed

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:41.299
upon on by the inadequacy of the mind through
ideology and the like and can be encouraged

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:46.570
to overcome that by objective critical thinking
using their creativity.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:51.530
I mean, I find this exciting [chuckles] and
I just wonder does it resonate with your people

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:57.710
who are so much more aware of technology of
computers and the potential?

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:01.540
Go ahead please.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:07.609
&gt;&gt;Male #4: I observe the longer people are
adamant on sticking with their limitations

00:37:07.609 --> 00:37:08.839
even when there's limitations [unintelligible]-

00:37:08.839 --> 00:37:10.059
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: Oh yeah, oh.

00:37:10.059 --> 00:37:12.880
&gt;&gt;Male #4: -that is the product of outside
forces.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.260
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: Yeah.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:17.160
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Their sense of self is tied up
with it and I think in this country, more

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:21.560
than most others, we need to develop a culture
that values thought more.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:35.990
For people to do the thinking that would get
them to decide they don’t have to just be

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:38.990
stuck with the thing [unintelligible]-

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:44.980
&gt;&gt;Roy: It's so idealist but so needed but
I don’t think we're really worse than anybody

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:53.369
I mean people are so infected with ideology,
religious prejudices, bigotry and it's human

00:37:53.369 --> 00:37:58.930
and it's so easy when you have ideology you
don’t have to think, you've got the answers.

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:07.549
It's such a, it's a curse and I'm a missionary
I have to admit [laughs] and I just have this

00:38:07.549 --> 00:38:15.600
feeling that thinking along the lines that
I have developed, I think, so beautifully,

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.839
I mean I'm thrilled.

00:38:17.839 --> 00:38:28.170
I think that it's an ideal contribution for
people to behave individually and society.

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:37.940
And I just wonder if some of these ideas are
ideal means for education, for teaching people

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:46.180
to empower them and not be victims of the
traditional ideologies and mindset and the

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.180
like.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:54.690
And I think it really enhances individuality
and the persona and the like.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:39:01.270
It's like painting a picture, and it's, I'm
having the most exciting experience I can

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:02.270
imagine.

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:06.380
And you know how old I am?

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.819
I'm 95.

00:39:08.819 --> 00:39:16.089
[laughs] And I think it's so fascinating and
how this happened, I have no idea for people

00:39:16.089 --> 00:39:17.690
who ask me for my secret.

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:19.299
Who the hell has the secret?

00:39:19.299 --> 00:39:26.651
But I'm just thrilled that it happened this
way and in writing my auto-biography, I look

00:39:26.651 --> 00:39:27.890
for clues.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:32.310
For example, I go through my parents who are
very ordinary.

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:39.039
My mother came from Vilna, Lithuania, at 16
before the First World War.

00:39:39.039 --> 00:39:44.520
I have no idea what education she had, I was
too interested in myself to find out.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:51.750
I'm so sorry about that; she was very open
minded, never was religious in a formal way.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.589
Which I am certainly not.

00:39:54.589 --> 00:40:02.380
My father was a first generation here, his
father came from Belarus because of the Kishinev

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:06.640
Pogrom there that caused the Jews to start
leaving.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.660
And he was a very open minded man.

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:13.329
I think my mother was more intelligent than
he was but he was affable, friendly and very

00:40:13.329 --> 00:40:21.539
decent and he gave me a very open growing
up which I treasure.

00:40:21.539 --> 00:40:27.910
So in the course of thinking and writing my
autobiography, these facets kind of turn up

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:38.340
and I think that this isn't, to me, it's an
ideal frame of reference to be a decent human

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:43.349
being and work toward a better society .

00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:44.349
You have any more questions?

00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:45.349
You're good.

00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:46.349
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male #5: This question, sir, combines your

00:40:46.349 --> 00:40:49.160
two areas of the law and the computers and
the mind.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:41:05.430
Which is, you mentioned intellectual property,
I believe that the, at some point, the computer

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:14.589
technology our ability to build intelligent
software, will advance to the point where

00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:21.150
we can write a general program which can create
things, at least the main ingredient, it's

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.849
harder to [unintelligible] but be a creative
force for coming up with stuff we recognize

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:29.010
as being new and innovative things that we
previously had assumed only humans could do.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:33.440
So the question is; when do we acknowledge
that the software is really the owner, the

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:41.470
creator of this new stuff as opposed to us
who may own the software?

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:51.640
And it's gonna be a long while after that
where the computer may assert its own supplements,

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.099
that this is the creator, we have to at least
acknowledge it

00:41:54.099 --> 00:42:03.359
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: I think we're trying, I don’t
know if I got exactly what you're driving

00:42:03.359 --> 00:42:10.950
at but I think that understanding the human
mind as its programed by itself creation and

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:22.799
by learning from the environment, is an ideal
basis for working into the computer technology

00:42:22.799 --> 00:42:29.430
to realize, it's so hard to really understand
but I think it's valuable to think in that

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:30.430
context.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:31.430
Yes?

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:36.960
&gt;&gt;Male #6: I was just going to say maybe your
question is more like at what point can we

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.920
say that a computer has creativity?

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:48.589
That this was a creative product of the computer
itself as opposed to its non-autonomous behavior

00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:52.210
because we pushed it's button and so it created
an output.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:43:00.420
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: I wonder about the ability ever
to make computers truly creative like the

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.420
human mind.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:08.859
The ability of the subconscious to combine
disparate things, it’s a most amazing phenomenon

00:43:08.859 --> 00:43:14.260
to create something new from two different
things.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:18.589
I mean, I wonder if people will ever be smart
enough but I don’t know.

00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:19.589
Yes?

00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:26.310
&gt;&gt;Male #7: when you see criterion to define
[unintelligible], is when a computer can either

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:30.829
make itself better or make others that are
better than it.

00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:38.720
And that involves or continues to be continuing
in a new direction of improvement, then it

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:45.539
has taken on something of a mind of its own
that is no longer our creation.

00:43:45.539 --> 00:43:51.230
It's hard to apply that throughout our past,
there have been airfoils created by computers

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:56.480
decades ago which nobody imagined would fly
but I think they you know, segmented surface.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.710
By segment they tired mutations and oh this
way gets more lift and they morphed in the

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:05.980
computer and many iterations to a shape that
turned out flew.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.490
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: But they had to be told how to
do that.

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:10.490
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Well, right.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:11.490
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: yeah.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:17.770
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Even if it went to ways that they
didn't explicitly didn’t need to be told,

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:22.910
it's hard to make a criteria but when it comes
to making the computer better than humans

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.510
have made a computer before.

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:31.369
That's when where, where you can, it isn't
that we didn’t go in that direction, clearly

00:44:31.369 --> 00:44:39.220
making the computer able to do computer improvement
was a direction that we were striving for

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:40.310
and the computer outdid us.

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:44.051
If we can keep that up for a year of improvement
then clearly it has crossed the line.

00:44:44.051 --> 00:44:45.051
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: But that's realistic isn't it?

00:44:45.051 --> 00:44:49.210
&gt;&gt;Male #7: it has not a human mind equivalent
but it is crossing a line-

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:50.290
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: yeah.

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:54.980
&gt;&gt;Male #7: -that clearly has made it create
things that we were unable.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:45:02.140
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: I think when we will [unintelligible],
I'm sort of conservative about my ideas, I

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:06.559
think they're great [chuckles] but I'm never
fairly certain but I think that the more we

00:45:06.559 --> 00:45:12.120
know about the mind, the more we understand
the possibilities and limitations of computers

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:16.559
and I think that's the beauty of having this
technology.

00:45:16.559 --> 00:45:25.900
&gt;&gt;Male #8: There's been some interesting work
in computational simulation of neurons-

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:26.900
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: Yeah

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:31.529
&gt;&gt;Male #8: I saw an article in Scientific
American or something, and I just wonder like,

00:45:31.529 --> 00:45:33.599
suppose we have- how many neurons do we have?

00:45:33.599 --> 00:45:37.660
10 to the 15th or something in our brains
that-

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.320
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: An awful lot.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:44.670
&gt;&gt;Male #8: An awful lot and so it takes such
and such an amount of computer power now to

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:49.319
stimulate one neuron, is it, I mean is it
just a question of scale?

00:45:49.319 --> 00:45:54.180
Like, suppose we did build a computer big
enough to stimulate 10 to the 15th neurons,

00:45:54.180 --> 00:46:02.279
would, do you think there might be a possibility
for that ensemble to do the things that this

00:46:02.279 --> 00:46:03.299
[unintelligible] does?

00:46:03.299 --> 00:46:11.040
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: I have to be humble and say that's
something for you to answer more than I but

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.240
I really have no idea.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:19.950
But it's amazing what evolution and natural
selection did, I mean it's just unbelievable

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:25.820
in how it happened as responses to handicaps
in living.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:32.300
How people overcame, over long periods of
time, those handicaps and improved the physical

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.140
structure of the mind.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:42.829
By the way, this matter of knowledge, what
I find so interesting is the fact that acquiring

00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:48.990
knowledge is an acquired characteristic which
is not passed on through reproduction.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:57.480
And that’s why for each person, they have
to create their own unique body of knowledge

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:03.520
and it's passed on only through external means
books and recordings and things like that

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.730
and recordings in minds.

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:13.180
And also in connection with my ideas about
art, what I find fascinating the analogy of

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:16.079
a human mind as a sculpture.

00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:23.640
I think it's fascinating that it's constantly,
it's plastic, and constantly shaped by the

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:31.579
acquisition and creation of knowledge and
that represents paste-ons to this physical

00:47:31.579 --> 00:47:38.819
structure within the skull that, in turn,
determine emotions and action.

00:47:38.819 --> 00:47:47.250
And I think that it's just a fascinating thing
to think that how we are sculptures and sculptors

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:56.920
at the same time and I love to draw this analogy
to realize, in various fields, I mean in terms

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.869
of art and the like.

00:47:58.869 --> 00:47:59.869
Yes?

00:47:59.869 --> 00:48:02.430
&gt;&gt;Male #9: So you're saying that you appreciate
how biology, through biology we evolved the

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:03.430
intelligence of how the mind is a product
of that evolution.

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:05.059
The question of how machines might do it I
believe it probably has to involve a similar

00:48:05.059 --> 00:48:06.440
kind of evolution, because partly we don’t
understand what it is that makes up how we

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:07.440
operate.

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:13.029
Even if we did understand it'd very actually
difficult to build and explicitly do it like

00:48:13.029 --> 00:48:14.200
we do it.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:25.589
I think so modeling of the brain is probably
not the right way to do it directly.

00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:33.680
It's more about its functionality and I think
that there might be a lot of [unintelligible]

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:43.460
evolutionary kind of principles going on in
the brain itself as thinking process is kinda

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:56.430
like natural selection of ideas is whatever
the predominant ideas are that you kinda reinforce

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:57.769
by yourself awareness's-

00:48:57.769 --> 00:48:59.099
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: Yeah.

00:48:59.099 --> 00:49:01.220
&gt;&gt;Male #9: that's how it works.

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:02.220
So as to whether you can actually build machines
that would actually be as intelligent as us

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:06.019
be possibly, if we acknowledge it, self-aware
as we are, I think it has to happen by way

00:49:06.019 --> 00:49:08.029
of evolution.

00:49:08.029 --> 00:49:13.940
&gt;&gt;Roy Freed: Yeah.

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:22.941
What I find fascinating is that the two men
who invented the ENIAC computer had, could

00:49:22.941 --> 00:49:26.160
not have had any idea of how the mind works.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:35.079
It was well before neuroscientists had realized
the existence of circuitry and the pulse signals

00:49:35.079 --> 00:49:36.079
in the mind.

00:49:36.079 --> 00:49:43.040
So they drew on knowledge of physics and systems
engineering, things like that.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:47.310
And yet the mind is triggered.

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:57.869
I also, in looking at the history of interest
in computing, it goes way back through so

00:49:57.869 --> 00:49:58.869
many mechanical efforts.

00:49:58.869 --> 00:50:07.549
It seemed to me that the creation of electronic
digital computer was inevitable, we were working

00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:16.990
toward that path over many years and so much
of the need was for the commercialization

00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:25.349
of electricity made possible by Thomas Alva
Edison, which was just such a boost to that.

00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:32.920
It's fascinating to take this whole goddamn
picture and put it together, it's just fascinating

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:40.230
and exciting just in itself.

00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:48.540
Thank you so much for this ability and opportunity
to expatiate and if I've stimulated curiosity,

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:58.319
desire to talk again I would love it, I just,
to me this is my value in living.

00:50:58.319 --> 00:50:59.569
Thank you.
