00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.770
What I want to do in this
video is go over the math

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.810
behind a mortgage loan.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.680
And this isn't really going
to be a finance video.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.270
It's actually a lot
more mathematical.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.470
But it addresses, at least in
my mind, one of the most basic

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.470
questions that's at least been
circling in my head

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.120
for a long time.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.970
You know, we take out these
loans to buy houses.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.100
Let's say you take out a
$200,000 mortgage loan.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.900
It's secured by your house.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.700
You're going to pay it over--
30 years, or you could

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.180
say that's 360-- months.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.720
Because if you normally pay the
payments every month, the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.140
interest normally compounds
on a monthly basis.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.460
And let's say you're
paying 6%-- interest.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.760
This is annual interest, and
they're usually compounding

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.150
on a monthly basis,
so 6% divided by 12.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.210
You're talking about
0.5% per month.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.870
Now normally when you get a
loan like this, your mortgage

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.780
broker or your banker will look
into some type of chart or

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.480
type in the numbers into some
type of computer program.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.710
And they'll say oh OK,
your payment is going

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.590
to be $1,200 per month.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.170
And if you pay that $1,200 per
month over 360 months, at the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.700
end of those 360 months you
will have paid off the $200,000

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.190
plus any interest that
might have accrued.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.290
But this number it's not
that easy to come along.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.550
Let's just show an example of
how the actual mortgage works.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.430
So on day zero, you
have a $200,000 loan.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.010
You don't pay any
mortgage payments.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.670
You're going to pay your
first mortgage payment

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.120
a month from today.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:05.010
So this amount is going to be
compounded by the 0.5%, and

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.440
as a decimal that's a 0.005.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.250
So in a month, with interest,
this will have grown to

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:19.200
200,000 times 1 plus 0.005.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.290
Then you're going
to pay the $1,200.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.485
Just going to be minus 1,200
or maybe I should write 1.2K.

00:02:26.485 --> 00:02:28.820
But I'm just really just
showing you the idea.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.400
And then for the next month,
whatever is left over is

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.230
going to be compounded
again by the 0.5%, 0.005.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.140
And then the next month you're
going to come back and you're

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.010
going to pay this $1,200 again.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.370
Minus $1,200.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.980
And this is going to
happen 360 times.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.250
So you're going to
keep doing this.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.780
And you can imagine if you're
actually trying to solve for

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.740
this number-- at the end of it
you're going to have this huge

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.090
expression that's going to have
you know 360 parentheses over

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.690
here-- and at the end, it's
all going to be equal to 0.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.570
Because after you've paid your
final payment, you're done

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.260
paying off the house.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.130
But in general how did they
figure out this payment?

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.850
Let's call that p.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.900
Is there any mathematical
way to figure it out?

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.580
And to do that, let's get a
little bit more abstract.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.560
Let's say that l is equal
to the loan amount.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.660
Let's say that i is equal
to the monthly interest.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.100
Let's say n is equal to
the number of months

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.150
that we're dealing with.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.400
And then we're going to set
p is equal to your monthly

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.360
payment, your monthly
mortgage payment.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.340
Some of which is interest, some
of which is principle, but it's

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.550
the same amount you're going to
pay every month to pay down

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.830
that loan plus interest.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.640
So this is your
monthly payment.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.360
So this same expression I just
wrote up there, if I wrote it

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.740
in abstract terms, you start
off with a loan amount l.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.100
After 1 month it
compounds as 1 plus i.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.620
So you multiply it times
1 plus i. i in this

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.480
situation was 0.005.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.440
Then you pay a monthly
payment of p, so minus p.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.560
So that's at the
end of one month.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.330
Now you have some amount still
left over of your loan.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.990
That will now compound
over the next month.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.030
Then you're going to
pay another payment p.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.770
And then this process is going
to repeat 300 or n times,

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:47.920
because I'm staying abstract.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.975
You're going to have
n parentheses.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.970
And after you've done this
n times, that is all

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.830
going to be equal to 0.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.020
So my question, the one that
I'm essentially setting up in

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.160
this video, is how
do we solve for p?

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.510
You know if we know the loan
amount, if we know the monthly

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.980
interest rate, if we know the
number of months, how

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.080
do you solve for p?

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.870
It doesn't look like this is
really an easy algebraic

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.930
equation to solve.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.235
Let's see if we can
make a little headway.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.360
Let's see if we can rearrange
this in a general way.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.850
So let's start with an example
of n being equal to 1.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.510
If n is equal to 1, then our
situation looks like this:

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.850
you take out your loan, you
compound it for one month, 1

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.230
plus i, and then you pay
your monthly payment.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.860
Now this was a mortgage that
gets paid off in 1 month, so

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.840
after that 1 payment you are
now done with their loan,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.660
you have nothing left over.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.490
Now if we solve for p, you
can now swap the sides.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.630
You get p is equal to
l times 1 plus i.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.920
Or if you divide both sides
by 1 plus i, you get p over

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.340
1 plus i is equal to l.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.890
And you might say hey you
already solved for p

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:14.640
why are you doing this?

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.950
And I'm doing this, because
I want to show you a

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.630
pattern that'll emerge.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.890
Let's see what happens
when n is equal to 2.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.300
Well then you start
with your loan amount.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.500
It compounds for one month.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.610
You make your payment.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.380
Then there's some
amount left over.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.400
That will compound
for one month.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.250
Then you make your
second payment.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.480
Now this mortgage only
needs two payments,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.550
so now you are done.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.110
You have no loan left over.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.490
You've paid all the
principal and interest.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.060
Now let's solve for p.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.470
So I'm going to color the p's.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.960
I'm going to make this p pink.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.510
So let's add p to both
sides and swap sides.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.380
So this green p will be
equal to all of this

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.310
business over here.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:09.460
Is equal to l times 1 plus
i minus that pink p.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.320
They're the same p, I just
want to show you what's

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.040
happening algebraically.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.610
Minus that pink p
times 1 plus i.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.680
Now if you divide both sides
by 1 plus i, you get p over

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:30.590
1 plus i is equal to l times
1 plus i minus that pink p.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.380
Now let's add that pink p to
both sides of this equation.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:43.410
You get the pink p plus this
p plus p over 1 plus i is

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.350
equal to l times 1 plus i.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.320
Now divide both
sides by 1 plus i.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:59.820
You get the pink p over 1 plus
i plus the green p, the same p,

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.210
times-- it already is being
divided by 1 plus i, you're

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.910
going to divide it again by 1
plus i, so it's going to be

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:10.280
divided by 1 plus i squared
is equal to the loan.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.630
Something interesting
is emerging.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.400
You might want to watch the
videos on present value.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.620
In this situation, you take
your payment, you discount it

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.800
by your monthly interest rate,
you get the loan amount.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.490
Here you take each of your
payments, you discount it, you

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:31.380
divide it by 1 plus your
monthly interest rate to the

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.270
power of the number of months.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.490
So you're essentially taking
the present value of your

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:39.400
payments and once again,
you get your loan amount.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.180
You might want to verify this
for yourself if you want a

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.510
little bit of algebra practice.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.670
If you do this with
n is equal to 3.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.110
I'm not going to do it just
for the sake of time.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.280
If you do n is equal to 3,
you're going to get that the

00:08:51.280 --> 00:09:00.990
loan is equal to p over 1 plus
i plus p over 1 plus i squared

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:06.600
plus p over 1 plus
i to the third.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.010
If you have some time, I
encourage you to prove this for

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.480
yourself just using the exact
same process that we did here.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.460
You're going to see it's going
to get little bit harry.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.800
There's going to be a lot of a
manipulating things, but it

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.440
won't take you too long.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.800
But in general, hopefully, I've
shown to you that we can write

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.460
the loan amount as the present
value of all of the payments.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.300
So we could say in general the
loan amount, if we now

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.790
generalize it to n instead of
and n equals a number, we could

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:38.080
say that it's equal to-- I'll
actually take the p out of the

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:44.940
equation, so it's equal to p,
times 1 plus 1 over 1 plus i

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:50.510
plus 1 over 1 plus i squared
plus, and you just keep

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:58.710
doing this n times, plus 1
over 1 plus i to the n.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.760
Now you might recognize this.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.585
This right here is a
geometric series.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.450
And there are ways to figure
out the sums of geometric

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.410
series for arbitrary ends.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.330
As I promised at the beginning
of the video this would be

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.750
an application of a
geometric series.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:31.250
It's equal to the sum of 1 over
1 plus i to the, well I'll use

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:37.040
some other letter here, to
the j from j is equal to 1.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.520
This is to the one power you
could view this is to the first

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.340
power to j is equal to n.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.350
That's exactly
what that sum is.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.200
Let's see if there's any simple
way to solve for that sum.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.890
You don't want to
do this 360 times.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.020
You could, you'll get a number,
and then you could divide

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.940
l by that number, and you
would have solved for p.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.730
But there's got to be simpler
way to do that, so let's see

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.800
if we can simplify this.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.400
Just to make the math easier,
let me make a definition.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.940
Let's say that r is equal
to 1 over 1 plus i.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.350
And let me call
this whole sum s.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.980
This sum right here
is equal to s.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.720
Then if we say r is equal to
each of these terms then s is

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.220
going to be equal to this is
going to be r to

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.910
the first power.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.420
I'll write r to first this is
going to be r squared, because

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.400
if you square the numerator
you just get a 1 again.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.490
So this is plus r squared plus
r to the third, plus all

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.410
the way this is r to the n.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:39.930
And I'll show you
a little trick.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.120
I always forget the formula,
so this is a good way to

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.580
figure out the sum of
a geometric series.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.460
Actually this could be used to
find a sum of an infinite

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.240
geometric series if you
like, but we're dealing

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.940
with a finite one.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.530
Let's multiply s times r.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.880
So r times s is going
to be equal to what?

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.720
If you multiply each of these
terms by r, you multiply r

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.390
to the first times r
you get r squared.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.750
You multiply r squared times
r you get r to the third.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:10.650
And then you keep doing that
all the way, you multiply r--

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:14.040
see there's an r to the n minus
one here-- you multiply that

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.030
times r, you get r to the n.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.060
And then you multiply r to
the n times r, you get

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.500
plus r to the n plus 1.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.120
All this is right here is all
of these terms multiplied

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.650
by r, and I just put them
under the same exponent.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.460
Now what you can do is you
could subtract this green

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.180
line from this purple line.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:42.720
So if we were to say s
minus rs, what do we get?

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.210
I'm just subtracting this
line from that line.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:52.000
Well, you get r1 minus 0,
so you get r to the first

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.590
power minus nothing there.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.320
But then you have r squared
minus r squared cancel out r

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.090
to the third minus r to
the third cancel out.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.163
They all cancel out, all the
way up to r to the n minus r to

00:13:01.163 --> 00:13:03.460
the n cancel out, but then
you're left with this

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.450
last term here.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.140
And this is why
it's a neat trick.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:11.280
So you're left with minus
r to the n plus 1.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.910
Now factor out an s.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:18.080
You get s times 1 minus r-- all
I did is I factored out the s--

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.670
is equal to r to the first
power minus r to the n plus 1.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.120
And now if you divide
both sides by 1 minus

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.580
r, you get your sum.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:42.250
Your sum is equal to r minus r
to the n plus 1 over 1 minus r.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.250
That's what our sum is
equal to, where we defined

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.380
our r in this way.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.130
So now we can rewrite this
whole crazy formula.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:55.480
We can say that our loan amount
is equal to our monthly

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.990
payment times this thing.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.620
I'll write it in green.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:05.420
Times r minus r
to the n plus 1.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.870
All of that over 1 minus r.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.760
Now if we're trying to solve
for p you multiply both sides

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:18.370
by the inverse of this, and you
get p is equal to your loan

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.520
amount times the
inverse of that.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.060
I'm doing it in pink,
because it's the inverse.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:30.860
1 minus r over r minus
r to the n plus 1.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.060
Where r is this
thing right there.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.150
And we are done.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.250
This is how you can actually
solve for your actual

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:38.000
mortgage payment.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.550
Let's actually apply it.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:45.120
So let's say that your loan
is equal to $200,000.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.400
Let's say that your interest
rate is equal to 6% annually,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:58.220
which is 0.5% monthly which
is the same thing as 0.005.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.230
This is monthly interest rate.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.710
And let's say it's a 30 year
loan, so n is going to

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.800
be equal to 360 months.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.000
Let's figure out what we get.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.830
So the first thing we want
to do is we want to figure

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.200
out what our r value is.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.350
So r is 1 over 1 plus i.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:31.040
So let's take 1 divided by
1 plus i so plus 0.005.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.050
That's what our monthly
interest is, half a percent.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.870
So 0.995 that's what
our r is equal to.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.575
Let me write that down, 0.995.

00:15:45.575 --> 00:15:48.070
Now this calculator doesn't
store variables, so I'll

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.730
just write that down here.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:16:00.020
So r is equal to 0.995.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.020
We just used that right there.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.340
I'm losing a little bit
of precision, but I

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.140
think it will be OK.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.350
The main thing is I want to
give you the idea here.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.980
So what is our payment amount?

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:24.220
Let's multiply our loan amount
that's $200,000 times 1 minus

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:48.800
r, so 1 minus 0.995 divided by
r which is 0.995 minus 0.995 to

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.390
the of the-- now n is 360
months, so it's going to be

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:58.520
360 plus 1 to the 361 power,
something I could definitely

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:04.970
not do in my head, and then I
close the parentheses, and my

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.440
final answer is roughly $1,200.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.140
Actually if you do it with the
full precision you get a little

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.050
bit lower than that, but this
is going to be roughly $1,200.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.800
So just like that, we were
able to figure out our

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.790
actual mortgage payment.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:22.560
So p is equal to $1,200.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.570
So that was some reasonably
fancy math to figure out

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:28.660
something that most people deal
with everyday, but now you know

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.900
the actual math behind it.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.170
You don't have to play with
some table or spreadsheet to

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.460
kind of experimentally
get the number.
