apps and I'll start with you Joe
 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.510
apps and I'll start with you Joe
and tell us what Chrome apps are even

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520
and tell us what Chrome apps are even
 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.570
and tell us what Chrome apps are even
yeah differ from any real apps there so

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580
yeah differ from any real apps there so
 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.980
yeah differ from any real apps there so
they're relatively new which we

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990
they're relatively new which we
 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.630
they're relatively new which we
officially launched them back in

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640
officially launched them back in
 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.950
officially launched them back in
September we've been developing them for

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960
September we've been developing them for
 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.260
September we've been developing them for
a couple of years now essentially chrome

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270
a couple of years now essentially chrome
 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.139
a couple of years now essentially chrome
apps are a way to use html5 to develop

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149
apps are a way to use html5 to develop
 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.290
apps are a way to use html5 to develop
real native feeling applications

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300
real native feeling applications
 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.940
real native feeling applications
applications that look and feel like

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950
applications that look and feel like
 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.770
applications that look and feel like
native ones they run outside the browser

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780
native ones they run outside the browser
 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.100
native ones they run outside the browser
they work offline by default they work

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110
they work offline by default they work
 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.920
they work offline by default they work
on desktop as well as mobile so it's

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930
on desktop as well as mobile so it's
 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.540
on desktop as well as mobile so it's
it's a great way for developers to build

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550
it's a great way for developers to build
 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.060
it's a great way for developers to build
real native experiences so a lot of

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070
real native experiences so a lot of
 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.459
real native experiences so a lot of
things you covered here briefly here you

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469
things you covered here briefly here you
 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:00.900
things you covered here briefly here you
want to cover the offline part what does

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910
want to cover the offline part what does
 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.520
want to cover the offline part what does
it really mean to be offline yeah sure

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530
it really mean to be offline yeah sure
 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.079
it really mean to be offline yeah sure
so you know we're all familiar with

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089
so you know we're all familiar with
 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.670
so you know we're all familiar with
building web applications right so you

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680
building web applications right so you
 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.950
building web applications right so you
use html5 you build your web application

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960
use html5 you build your web application
 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.020
use html5 you build your web application
it's online so when you build a chrome

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030
it's online so when you build a chrome
 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.059
it's online so when you build a chrome
app you build it the same way html5

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:12.069
app you build it the same way html5
 

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:14.850
app you build it the same way html5
JavaScript CSS but all the resources are

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860
JavaScript CSS but all the resources are
 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.169
JavaScript CSS but all the resources are
packaged up at locally into an

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179
packaged up at locally into an
 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:18.150
packaged up at locally into an
application it's local on your machine

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160
application it's local on your machine
 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.850
application it's local on your machine
like an installed app is and you can run

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860
like an installed app is and you can run
 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.859
like an installed app is and you can run
the app when you're not connected or

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869
the app when you're not connected or
 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.029
the app when you're not connected or
when you have a connection that's not so

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039
when you have a connection that's not so
 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.760
when you have a connection that's not so
good and it just behaves normally great

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770
good and it just behaves normally great
 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.290
good and it just behaves normally great
yeah so that's that's that's really

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300
yeah so that's that's that's really
 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.210
yeah so that's that's that's really
obviously very important another thing

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220
obviously very important another thing
 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.999
obviously very important another thing
is you can access computer the laptop or

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009
is you can access computer the laptop or
 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.580
is you can access computer the laptop or
the machines resources as in the USB

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590
the machines resources as in the USB
 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.130
the machines resources as in the USB
port or the file system and stuff like

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140
port or the file system and stuff like
 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.320
port or the file system and stuff like
that so you know that brings up the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330
that so you know that brings up the
 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.999
that so you know that brings up the
ability to build whole new range of

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009
ability to build whole new range of
 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.010
ability to build whole new range of
applications yes

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020
applications yes
 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.960
applications yes
typically a web app could not yeah sure

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970
typically a web app could not yeah sure
 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.330
typically a web app could not yeah sure
so I mean we leverage html5 wherever

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340
so I mean we leverage html5 wherever
 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.960
so I mean we leverage html5 wherever
possible

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970
possible
 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.210
possible
but when html5 does not provide a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220
but when html5 does not provide a
 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.520
but when html5 does not provide a
certain feature we have chrome app API

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530
certain feature we have chrome app API
 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.440
certain feature we have chrome app API
is that that fill in for things like

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450
is that that fill in for things like
 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.839
is that that fill in for things like
file access and USB and Bluetooth and

00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:57.849
file access and USB and Bluetooth and
 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.650
file access and USB and Bluetooth and
sockets okay so one of the reasons I

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660
sockets okay so one of the reasons I
 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.570
sockets okay so one of the reasons I
have Francois here with us also is that

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580
have Francois here with us also is that
 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.800
have Francois here with us also is that
Francois has been doing some of that

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810
Francois has been doing some of that
 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.359
Francois has been doing some of that
which is integrating with some of the

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369
which is integrating with some of the
 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.279
which is integrating with some of the
hardware available on machines do you

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289
hardware available on machines do you
 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.359
hardware available on machines do you
want to tell us more about what you're

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369
want to tell us more about what you're
 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.660
want to tell us more about what you're
doing here at devoxx

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670
doing here at devoxx

one guy actually in google named luis

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860
one guy actually in google named luis
 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.400

built an awesome library on javascript

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410
built an awesome library on javascript
 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.470
built an awesome library on javascript
to be able to communicate with those USB

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480
to be able to communicate with those USB
 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.230
to be able to communicate with those USB
NFC reader okay what we've done is we've

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240
NFC reader okay what we've done is we've
 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.900
NFC reader okay what we've done is we've
been the chrome app which helps with

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910
been the chrome app which helps with
 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.100
been the chrome app which helps with
registration and the response that

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110
registration and the response that
 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.320
registration and the response that
everybody has here and you can scan it

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330
everybody has here and you can scan it
 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.360
everybody has here and you can scan it
and write to it directly from a chrome

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370
and write to it directly from a chrome
 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.699
and write to it directly from a chrome
app only with web technologies it's used

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709
app only with web technologies it's used
 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.949
app only with web technologies it's used
here for registration for you know

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959

delivering the wristbands checking

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959
delivering the wristbands checking
 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.930
delivering the wristbands checking
what's on those wristbands which is used

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940
what's on those wristbands which is used
 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.790
what's on those wristbands which is used
throughout the conference and we use

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800
throughout the conference and we use
 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.940
throughout the conference and we use
those on Chromebooks but that could be

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950
those on Chromebooks but that could be
 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.770
those on Chromebooks but that could be
on any machine that's running foam which

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780
on any machine that's running foam which
 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.570
on any machine that's running foam which
kind of brings me to the question of how

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580
kind of brings me to the question of how
 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.910
kind of brings me to the question of how
are these packaged and delivered I mean

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920
are these packaged and delivered I mean
 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.320
are these packaged and delivered I mean
those Chrome apps yeah so basically

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330
those Chrome apps yeah so basically
 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.940
those Chrome apps yeah so basically
there it depends also on desktop

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950
there it depends also on desktop
 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.100
there it depends also on desktop
machines they're packaged up as zip

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110
machines they're packaged up as zip
 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.050
machines they're packaged up as zip
files and they're stored in the Chrome

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060
files and they're stored in the Chrome
 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.970
files and they're stored in the Chrome
Web Store and so you go to the Chrome

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980
Web Store and so you go to the Chrome
 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.759
Web Store and so you go to the Chrome
Web Store you download and install the

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769
Web Store you download and install the
 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.800
Web Store you download and install the
application and it's the same as you

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810
application and it's the same as you
 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.420
application and it's the same as you
download an app from any other app store

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430
download an app from any other app store
 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.170
download an app from any other app store
on mobile we use the Cordova library to

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180
on mobile we use the Cordova library to
 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.960
on mobile we use the Cordova library to
package up applications as native apps

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970
package up applications as native apps
 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.490
package up applications as native apps
so they're basically native apps that

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500
so they're basically native apps that
 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.220
so they're basically native apps that
host your web code and they get packaged

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230
host your web code and they get packaged
 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.289
host your web code and they get packaged
as a native app for that platform so for

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299
as a native app for that platform so for
 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.240
as a native app for that platform so for
Google they go in the Play Store for iOS

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250
Google they go in the Play Store for iOS
 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.240
Google they go in the Play Store for iOS
they go in the Apple App Store so

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250
they go in the Apple App Store so
 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.860
they go in the Apple App Store so
Dominion with its desktop or mobile

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870
Dominion with its desktop or mobile
 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.080
Dominion with its desktop or mobile
that's how they get delivered so how

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090
that's how they get delivered so how
 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.690
that's how they get delivered so how
real are chrome apps today on mobile how

we've got you know a good set of the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850
we've got you know a good set of the
 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.520
we've got you know a good set of the
core API is ported over now we think

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530
core API is ported over now we think
 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.310
core API is ported over now we think
that probably by early 2014 we should be

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320
that probably by early 2014 we should be
 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.720
that probably by early 2014 we should be
in good shape for people to start

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730
in good shape for people to start
 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.080
in good shape for people to start
building real apps great so how would

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090
building real apps great so how would
 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.030
building real apps great so how would
somebody go about building an app

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040
somebody go about building an app
 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.770
somebody go about building an app
pushing it out and making it known so

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780
pushing it out and making it known so
 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.110
pushing it out and making it known so
there's a store for that people find out

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120
there's a store for that people find out
 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.690
there's a store for that people find out
about those well I mean to build it it's

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700
about those well I mean to build it it's
 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.460
about those well I mean to build it it's
really easy you can go to our website

where all the information about the API

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720
where all the information about the API
 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.050
where all the information about the API
is is stored if you want to go to github

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060
is is stored if you want to go to github
 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.630

then there's a Chrome App samples repo

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090
then there's a Chrome App samples repo
 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.450
then there's a Chrome App samples repo
in there shows all the samples so those

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460
in there shows all the samples so those
 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.740
in there shows all the samples so those
are probably the places I would start to

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750
are probably the places I would start to
 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.800
are probably the places I would start to
to learn how to build these great

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810
to learn how to build these great
 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.820

francois how hard was it to actually

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830
francois how hard was it to actually
 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.529

build this once the library was

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539
build this once the library was
 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.050
build this once the library was
available and library is done so easy

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060
available and library is done so easy
 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.960

great and we are hoping to make this

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970
great and we are hoping to make this
 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.499
great and we are hoping to make this
library open great yeah I think there's

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509
library open great yeah I think there's
 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:40.779
