00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.200
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Thank you for
joining the Law Library of Congress

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.600
and the Greater Library this
evening for the 2017 Frederic R.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.790
and Molly S. Kellogg Biennial
Lecture on Jurisprudence.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.700
My name is Jane Sanchez and
I have the honor of serving

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.830
as the 25th Law Librarian
of Congress.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.660
Ooh, thank you [applause].

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.430
Please note that today's program is
being livestreamed on the Library

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.860
of Congress' Facebook
page and YouTube channel,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.790
so all remarks including comments

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.050
and questions will
be captured on video.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.450
Also, please take a moment
to silence your cell phones.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.540
The Kellogg Biennial Lecture

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.880
on Jurisprudence is made
possible thanks to the generosity

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.060
of Mr. Frederic R.
and Molly S. Kellogg

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.640
who have endowed this
lecture series since 2009.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.820
The Kellogg Biennial Lecture

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.700
on Jurisprudence presents
prominent contributors

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.710 position:56%
to international jurisprudence
judged through writings, reputation,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.460
broad and continuing influence on
contemporary legal scholarship.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.150 position:56%
Previous Kellogg lecturers have
included Ronald Dworkin, Joseph Raz,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.880
Amartya Sen, and Michael Sandel.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.380
And I apologize if I've
massacred Ms. Sen's name.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.010
Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Kellogg
for your continued support

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.520
of this lecture series and
for joining us this evening.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.510
We really appreciate your support.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.660
[ Applause ]

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.530
Thanks to you the Library
has had the pleasure

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.050
of welcoming these eminent
legal scholars to discuss

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.110
and debate a variety of interesting
legal philosophical topics.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.720
This year is no exception.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.500
We are delighted that
Professor Jeremy Waldron

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.650
of New York University School
of Law joins us this evening

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.430
to address how countries
regulate immigration,

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.600
specifically if nations have a
right to consider their economic

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.710
and cultural interests to
shape immigration policy,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.830
and more broadly, what historical

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.760
and legal foundations give nations
the authority to regulate newcomers

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.250
into the respective countries.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.370
At this time I invite
Mr. Kellogg to the stage,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.520
who will share more details about
Professor Waldron's background

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.170
and his selection to serve
as this year's speaker

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.680
for the 2017 Frederic R. and
Molly S. Kellogg Biennial Lecture

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.510
on Jurisprudence.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:20.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.700
&gt;&gt; Frederic R. Kellogg: Greetings.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.840
This is the Fifth Biennial Lecture.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.770
We've now reached our
eighth anniversary.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.620
Ronald Dworkin was the
first as Jane Sanchez said.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:42.360
Joseph Raz in 2011 and Amartya Sen
in 2013, Michael Sandel in 2015.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.960 position:56%
And today we are pleased and honored

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.180
to have Professor Jeremy
Waldron of New York University.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.770 position:56%
Before introducing Jeremy, who Molly
and I first met in England in 2000,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.610
I would like to thank the jury
that chose him without knowing

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.660
that fact -- Mark Medish, Don
Wallace, and the Librarian

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.530
of Congress, Jan Sanchez.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.420
We are -- Molly and I are insulated
from the selection process.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.630 position:56%
So why do we support a series of law
lectures at the Library of Congress?

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.640
A big reason is Molly's 30
years of work in the House

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.570
of Representatives, that
extraordinary conduit of democracy.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.710
She served Representative J.J.
Pickle of Austin, Texas, who,

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.710
if he were still active,
would be among the first

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.800
to get things back on
a bipartisan track.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.560
So what is the purpose
of endowed lectures?

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.260
The original purpose in
Protestant and Catholic Europe was

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.720
to free clerics to devote
more thought to their sermons

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.830
to win back lost souls
and transform behavior.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.810
Our goal is more modest.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.750
But here, also, it is to give time
and incentive to legal scholars

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.940
to think through the
major philosophical issues

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.840
of our time and of the law.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.290
Endowed lectures can
influence the law.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.970
The Storrs Lectures at Yale
and the Holmes Lectures

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.870
at Harvard battled back and
forth during the last century

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.420
like heavyweight crews.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.930
There was learned hands.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.640
Holmes lecture in 1958 challenging
use of the U.S. Constitution

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.810
to override democratically-enacted
legislation.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.880
Then Herbert Wexler's response

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.830
that judicial review can be
justified by neutral principles.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.620
Grant Gilmore's Storrs lecture,
The Ages of American Law,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:59.020
criticizing Justice Holmes
for causing the age of anxiety

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.100
or legal realism, the idea

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.390
that judges just rationalize
any decision they want.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:12.840
And then, of course, H.L.A.
Hart's profound Holmes lecture,

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.830
Positivism in the Separation
of Law and Morals.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.650
And Ronald Dworkin's reply
questioning that separation

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.780
and validating once again judicial
recourse to make moral principle.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.640
There's clearly a progression
of major questions,

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.900
and it leads to our speaker today.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.650 position:56%
Jeremy Waldron has given the endowed
lectures at both Harvard and Yale,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.190
and he has addressed substantive
issues through a command

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:51.900
of fundamental theory -- basic
human equality, dignity, torture,

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:59.570
hate speech, judicial review,
positivism, and not least,

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:06.010
legislation, which might be at the
heart of his theoretical program.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.600 position:56%
Last week I was in Cambridge for the
Bicentennial of Harvard Law School,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:18.140
attended by six Justices, including
the Chief, with a day of seminars

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:23.200
where much was said about legal
education at Harvard Law School.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:31.040
But not a word about hand, heart,
Dworkin, positivism, principles --

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.310
the great issues of
the last century.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.790
I sat with a young
professor, Jacob Gerson,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.240
who said that these
topics are virtually dead

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.860
at Harvard Law School today.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.450 position:56%
He teaches a course on
legislation, so, of course, I asked,

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.230
do you cover Jeremy Waldron?

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:56.560 position:56%
Legal positivism claims that law
must be understood from its sources,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.480
the leading one of which, of
course, is democratic legislation.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.780
But the grand legal theorists
have failed to take that dispute

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.560
over positivism to its
obvious, crucial, next point --

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.870
how can and should a view

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.340
of legislation address
the philosophical issues

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.660
of the last century?

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.900
That has been Professor
Waldron's question.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.630
Such Copernican questioning
is typical of Jeremy

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.950
who takes legal theory back to
the philosophy of John Locke.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:38.330
He is courageous, articulate,
feels deeply about our country,

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:43.680
pursues his topics in detail,
able to focus in like a microscope

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.890
without losing the big picture.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.690
He is unafraid to cross
boundaries into political theory

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.440
and moral philosophy, or to
question settled assumptions.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.430
So what was Professor
Gerson's answer to my question?

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.620
It was yes, he does cover
Waldron, so there's hope

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.000
yet for Harvard [laughter].

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.460
I give you Professor Jeremy
Waldon, and remind you

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.150
that after the lecture there's
a reception you're all invited

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.510
to in the Madison Hall
on the first floor.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:34.300
[ Applause ]

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.280
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Ladies and
gentlemen, thank you very much.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.850
I'm reminded by these remarks that
the last time I visited the Library

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:48.220 position:56%
of Congress was to obtain permission
to use an image that they earned

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.970 position:56%
of the construction of the Capitol
in the 1860s which I was able to use

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.500
and grace the copy of
<i>Law and Disagreement </i>,

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:02.100
which was a companion to the
<i>Dignity of Legislation </i>in 1999.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.360
And so I was very proud
of of using that image.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.050
And I'm very honored
to be back here today.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.170
Thank you, Frederic and Molly,
for sponsoring this lecture.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.850
Thank you to the jury
for the invitation.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.870
Thank you to Jane Sanchez
for the welcome.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.180
It's a great pleasure to be here.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:24.150
My topic, as you've heard,
is immigration, which today,

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.950
perhaps especially because of
the terrorist attack in New York

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:34.470
by somebody who was, like
me, a green card holder,

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.380 position:56%
is a pressing issue of public policy
in the United States and elsewhere.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:43.750
But this is the Kellogg Lecture in
Jurisprudence, not public policy.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.280
And I want to say just a little bit

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.790
about the relationship
between the two.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:52.550
Jurisprudence, the philosophy
of law, can be divided

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.430
into special jurisprudence
and general jurisprudence.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.120
General jurisprudence,
which is the kind of work

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.870
that Ronald Dworkin does and Joseph
Raz did in his lecture before you,

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.870
is a study of law and
legal systems as such.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.250
And the concepts of legal
reasoning that are central to law

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.340
in the most abstract sense.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.310
But jurisprudence can
also be special,

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.690
and it can be special in two ways.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:24.380 position:56%
It can be special because it studies
the first principles of the law

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.560
of a particular legal system or a
particular family of legal systems

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.980
like the jurisprudence
of the common law

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.770 position:56%
or the jurisprudence of Islamic law.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.590
Or it can be special because
it studies the first principles

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:42.290 position:56%
of a particular legal topic like
criminal law or the law of torts or,

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:46.460
tonight, the law of migration.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.590
So I'm going to be looking at
the first principles that help us

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:59.020
to make sense of laws that regulate
permit/restrict human movement

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.420
on the face of the Earth,
movement from society

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.970
to society, from nation to nation.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.650
The inquiry is going to be
analogous to other forms

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.410
of special jurisprudence.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:15.230 position:56%
If this were a special jurisprudence
of tort law, we would be diving deep

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.130
into the waters of tort law to try

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.640
to examine the foundations
of corrective justice.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.380
If it was the special
jurisprudence of contract law,

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.330
we might be going deep into
the morality of promise-keeping

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.390
and the basis of economic exchange.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.650
We go deep to foundations to
try to get a new perspective

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.770
and a more pervasive perspective
on a particular department of law.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.520
And that's what I'm going to
be doing with immigration.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.290
For criminal law we
might examine the idea

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.160
of retribution, for example.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.740
A foundation approach is different

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.230
from what my philosophical
colleague sometimes call an applied

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.240
ethics approach.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.960
In applied ethics, one sets

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.750
out a policy problem
as it currently exists.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:07.870
And one adduces considerations of
value and principle in favor of

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.670
or against particular
aspects of that policy problem

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.680
as it's presented in the
politics of a country.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.660
I'm not going to do that,
although the bearing

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.670
of what I say will be fairly
obvious at various points.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.950
Instead of doing applied
ethics of immigration,

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.340
which is an entirely
honorable enterprise,

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:32.120 position:56%
I do want to take us deeper into
the presuppositions and what we have

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.740
in mind when we talk about
the regulation of migration.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.070
Dr. Kellogg mentioned the
question of the legitimacy

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:46.250 position:56%
of our regulating -- that's the sort
of question that I want to raise.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.130
So where should we
look for the foundation

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:52.480
of principles of migration law?

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.990
Certainly we need to examine
the general topic of movement

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.580
and settlement in the human world,
what I'm going to call a dialectic

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.940
of movement and settlement.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:07.170
We are a migratory species, but
we are also a settling species --

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.830
people moving en masse or
individually for reasons

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.960
of their own from one place
to another, and the response

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.030
that settled communities might
reasonably make to such movement.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.650
What I mostly want to
argue for tonight is

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:24.480
that migration has a deep
importance of its own that may mean

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.790
that it can't just be regarded
as an ordinary department

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:32.280
of public policy like, I
don't know, tax reform.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.390
Not that there's anything
wrong with ordinary departments

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.450
of public policy like tax reform.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.340
But this one raises special
issues, and I want to try

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.620 position:56%
and get a sense of why it's special.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:48.620 position:56%
So even though policy on migration
will start from questions about cost

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:56.320
and benefit, and who is harmed,
and who profits from migration,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.700
once we start putting some
pressure on those ideas,

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:04.920
we're going to find a whole cascade
of deeper questions opening up.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.970
So, here goes.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.210
As you know, we here in the
United States are participating

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.290
in a great national
debate about immigration.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.590
We have been for a while.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.160
It's a hot issue in this country,
and under the Trump Administration.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.690
Remember my inquiry is special in
the second sense, not the first,

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.870
so I'm not confining the
discussion to the United States.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.200
But it is very important in
the United States, and we --

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.390
where we use it as a
point of reference.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:34.380
It's an area of concern for
almost every advanced democracy.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.920 position:56%
It's an even hotter issue in Europe,
I think, than in the United States.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.850
Certainly it's a more bitter
and rancorous focus of debate,

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.950
if that can be imagined in Europe.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.660 position:56%
Each country's debate, each regional
debate, has its peculiarities.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.370
Much of the debate in Europe
has been about refugees,

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.660 position:56%
but it's also about the peculiar
arrangements of the Schengen Accords

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.680
that allow free movement
through most

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.480
of the countries of
the European Union.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.990
Brexit debate in the United
Kingdom involved discussion

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:09.230
about the lawful migration
of people from one country

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.430
to another under EU auspices.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.010
In the United States in recent
years we have focused particularly

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.820
on illegal immigration.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.350
And I know the terminology
is a little bit of a problem.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.300
Forgive me if my words
are clumsy on this.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.560
But immigration that is not
explicitly permitted by the laws.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.890
Both how to prevent it by securing
the southern border and what to do

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.430
about the very large number
of undocumented aliens,

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.300
adults and children, already
in the United States --

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:42.440
11 million or more living here,
8 million or more working here.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.660
Under the present administration,
we are also debating how open

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.530
or restrictive legal or
documented immigration ought

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.060
to be going forward.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.750
Today there's been a new debate

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:56.650
about diversity-based
immigration policy as opposed

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.630
to merit-based immigration policy.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.100
And President Trump has indicated
that he wants that to be the focus

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.610
of concern in the coming months.

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:08.250
President Trump has said that for
decades the immigration policy

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:13.140 position:56%
of the United States has not been
fair to our people, to our citizens,

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.760
to the interests of our workers.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.260
It's interesting to watch how even
a brief statement like that opens

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.380
up a cascade of questions.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.780
And that's how I want
to begin this evening.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.900 position:56%
President Trump is concerned about
the impact of decades of immigration

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.760
on various interests affected
in the United States --

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.710
our people, our citizens,
our workers.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:38.260
But are they they only interests
we should be considering?

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.750
If immigration is regular
public policy,

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.140
then certainly we should consider
the interests of all those

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:47.800
in our country who are likely to be
affected, directly or indirectly,

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:53.700
those with whom potential migrants
might compete for low-echelon jobs.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.360
Those who profit from the
increased prosperity that results

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.210 position:56%
from the invigoration of the
economy through migration and so on.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.390
It's obvious that we ought
to count al those interests,

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.510
and count them carefully so they're
not discounted in the aggregate,

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.590
but we look at the, as
President Trump said,

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:14.680
the fairness of the impact of
immigration across a wide array

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.390
of people at different economic
levels and in different places

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:23.340 position:56%
and faced with different arrays of
opportunity, or lack of opportunity.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.530
So we certainly need
to look at all of that.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.150
But from a foundational
perspective, what are we to say

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:34.220
about the interests of
the migrants themselves?

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.340
Are they to be counted
in the balance?

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.000
Are they to be weighed in
the balance if they benefit

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.430
from coming here, weighed
in the balance

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.010
against whatever harms there are?

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.320
And, of course, there's
always controversy

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:49.540 position:56%
about what harms there are that
immigration inflicts on our workers,

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:54.030
our citizens, on Americans.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:57.110
So we have to consider, from
a foundational perspective,

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:01.490
whose interests exactly get
counted -- the migrants themselves,

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.540
the benefits that open
migration brings to them,

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.200
members of their families,
both those who come with them

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.180
and those who stay behind?

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.300
Are those benefits properly weighed
in the balance against any harms

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.900
that immigration causes
to American interests?

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.580
Or should we set them aside for
the purposes of this debate?

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:24.010
We've got to try to figure out
a honorable and principled way

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.730
of answering that question.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:31.090
Should we also consider the impact
of immigration to the United States

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.940
on the country from which
the immigrants come?

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.370 position:56%
Because, obviously, if a large
number of people come from country a

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:41.150
to country b, that affects
the labor market in country b,

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.800 position:56%
but it also affects the labor
market and the economy in country a.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.510
And a former colleague of
mine at Oxford, Paul Collier,

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:51.050
has written a remarkable book
on immigration called <i>Exodus,</i>

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.340
<i>How Migration is Changing
Our World </i>.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.420
And he insists that we must pay
attention to that array of benefits

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.200
and costs as well as the benefits
and costs both of the inhabitants

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.940
of the country, the target country,
and the immigrants themselves.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.780 position:56%
So, whose interests is one question.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.590 position:56%
Which interests is another question.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:19.270
For economic interests may not be
the only things to be considered,

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:23.460
there are also, people would
say, security interests,

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:28.030
and that's been made
apparent in the last 24 hours.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.000
There are cultural interests.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.930
These seem particularly
important in Europe where,

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:40.520
as one sociologist has observed,
a surge in identity concerns seems

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.250
to underlie the debate
about immigration.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:48.040
People are worrying that a surge in
identity concerns is likely to lead

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.270
to more widespread opposition
to immigration and asylum

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.400
than a decline in confidence
about the economy

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.910
when the public perceives
that their national culture is

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.210
somehow threatened.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:03.060
And many feel a strong desire or
can be led to feel a strong desire

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:07.580
to defend what they believe
to be their way of life.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:11.750
Is that a legitimate ground
for making public policy?

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.990
The same sociologist thinks
that people are concerned

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.320
about the cultural religious
and linguistic distinctiveness

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.620
of their national community.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.470
And they worry that immigration
is weakening the uniqueness

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:26.670
and specificity and cohesiveness
of the national community.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.230
And I think when you scratch
the surface you'll find concerns

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:33.260
of this kind in the
American debate as well.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:36.360
But the case of the United
States also gives rise

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.820
to some deeper questions
about cultural community

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.100
if we think it is threatened
by immigration.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.440
What is the shared culture?

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.470
Is there some thing which
is the shared culture

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:54.710
of a large multi-cultural democracy
of 300 million highly diverse

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:58.770
and opinionated people
inhabiting a continent?

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:01.380
In what sense are modern
democracies, large and diverse

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.930
as many of them are, in
what sense are they really

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.160
cultural communities?

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.900
I spent a few years recently
in England and when challenged

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.200
on this I would have to listen

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.550
to English political philosophers
mumbling things about a sense

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:19.570
of history and cups of tea
and queueing at bus stops.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:24.440 position:56%
And some of them would invoke Prime
Minister John Major's famous bon mot

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.690
about England "as the country of
long shadows on cricket grounds

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:33.580
and warm beer and invincible
green suburbs and dog lovers

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.770
and pools fillers and as George
Orwell said, 'Old maids bicycling

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:42.640
to holy communion through the
morning mist.'" And it was

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.320
on the basis of [inaudible]
like this that people

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:50.440
who drink cold lager
[laughter] don't play cricket

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.100
and wouldn't be seen dead
going to holy communion claim

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.430
that they are entitled to
resist the immigrant hoards

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.730
on cultural grounds.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.740
Is culture even the sort of thing
that laws and public policy ought

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.090
to be in the business of upholding?

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:10.280
Consider the most deeply felt
form of cultural solidarity.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.630
Namely the shared beliefs
and practices of a religion.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:17.350
Are the practitioners of
a given religion entitled

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:20.050
to pressure their political
leaders to drive away those

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.540
who hold different beliefs and hew
to different practices because,

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.670
I don't know, Britain is a
Christian country as people

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.310
who don't go to church tend to say.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:33.150
Yeah? It is long and
well-established in our tradition,

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.450
in this country, that religious
belief and practice are not

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:40.100
to be protected in any way by
law, let only by laws that exclude

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.460
from a given vicinity people
whose faith is different from that

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.960
of the existing inhabitants.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.210
Our view is existing religious
belief in a given area just has

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.150
to take his chances with
whoever happens to be

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.950
in that area at any given time.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.100
Adherence to a given
faith are not entitled

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.980
to establish the religious
homogeneity

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.570
or to preserve the religious
homogeneity of the area

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:08.070
where they live by forbidding
heretics or those who follow

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:12.640
after other gods from
settling in their vicinity.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.940
So a tough question.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.020
If we think, as we surely do, that
religion cannot possibly, religious

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.050
and [inaudible] cannot
possibly be a legitimate ground

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:24.460
for respecting immigration, can
we really think that culture is,

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.710
given that religion matters more in
the lives of the people who have it

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.850
than culture does in and of itself.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.030
President Trump's Administration
is interested

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:37.350
in all aspects of immigration
policy.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:42.310 position:56%
But has has, as I said, a particular
interest in illegal immigration.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:47.640
And this raises questions about law
and our obligation to obey the law

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.300
and the obligation of
immigrants to obey the law.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:56.210
And it raises jurisprudential
questions quite quickly about that.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.760
Immigration laws have a special
character that they operate

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.880
in a sort of extra-territorial
manner.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:09.000
Somebody from Mexico who tries
to cross the border or climb

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.900
over the wall into the
United States is, we say,

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.440
constrained by an American law
that prohibits him from doing so.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.740
But that's what we say.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.040
But it's not his law.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.640
It's not a Mexican law.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.420
Is he actually bound by it?

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:27.020
It's not a law that he has had any
role or representation in making,

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.880
which means that our usual
account of legal obligation,

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.300
which tends to be based on things
like consent or the fairness

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:37.500
of the political process,
cannot quite establish the grip

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.800
of American immigration law
on the would-be immigrant.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.270
So what obligation do would-be
immigrants have to obey the law

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.280
of their destination country?

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.780
Must have some obligation because
they are seeking to come here,

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.340
and voluntarily coming here.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.230
That certainly looks like
consent to obey the laws.

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:01.670
If they succeed in climbing
over the wall and settling here,

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:02.970
working here, and living here,

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:05.170
then they will be obligated
to obey our laws.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:09.180
But can the sense of obligation be
projected back into their decision

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.170
to cross into the country
in the first place?

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.760
It's a delicate, it's
a delicate question.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.390
There's also a question
about what nations owe

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:17.830
to each other in this regard.

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.370
I don't just mean should
Mexico have to pay

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.450
for the wall [laughter], right?

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:27.030 position:56%
But countries do have obligations to
one another in regard to migration.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:29.170 position:56%
They respect each other's passports.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.120
The respect each other's borders.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.870
They participate in securing
each other's systems.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:38.620
Should we be considering
migration law not just as local,

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:43.190
positive law of this community
but as systematic positive law

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.220
of the whole system of states?

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.970
Should it be seen as a law in
the world, something justified

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:52.830
as a systemic arrangement?

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.890
The questions we post about --

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.180
you see, I'm just giving
you a cascade of questions.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.570
The questions we pose
about immigration,

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.460
the questions about borders.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.680
But which borders?

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.780
In the United States we're
up to our eyes in borders.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.500
We have borders of all sorts --

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:15.170
city limits, town and county
jurisdictions, state lines,

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.560
as well as the national borders
of the republic as a whole

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.020
that distinguish us
from Canada and Mexico.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.830
Generally speaking, we
regulate movement only

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.540
across national borders.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.780
Other borders may mark
the application of laws

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.790
and the jurisdictions of
policing or judicial authorities,

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:33.190
but they are not the
site of restrictions

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:36.820
on movement even though they
distinguish important politically

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.220
distinct entities from one another.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.420
I originally intended the
title of this lecture to be

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.550
about the philosophical
foundations of migration law,

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:47.700
not just immigration law.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.330
And really, that's still the case.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.940
In a large country like the United
States, there is a great deal,

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:56.160
always has been, a great deal of
internal migration from one part

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.210
of this vast country to another.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:01.420
And we wouldn't these days dream
of treating freedom of movement

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.070 position:56%
within the country as a proper topic

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.800
for legal restriction,
though it used to be.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.280
And very occasionally,
even within living memory,

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.150
there have been attempts
to revive it,

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:16.760 position:56%
as when Los Angles sent police
officers in the era of the Dust Bowl

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.520
to the California border
to resist the incursions

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.370
of people from, I don't
know, Oklahoma.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:29.680
In a scene from the movie,
<i>The Hunt for Red October </i>,

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:35.420
a Russian naval officer
played by the actor Sam Neill,

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.850
a New Zealand actor -- I'm
a New Zealand [inaudible] --

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:43.250
a Russian naval officer
player by Sam Neill muses

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:48.420 position:56%
about what he will do if his attempt
to defect from the Soviet Union

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.710
to the United States
proves successful.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:55.690
His experience has been of
Russian attitudes or movement.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.210
He says he's going to be
a recreational vehicle

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:00.910
and drive from state to state.

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:04.820
"Do they let you do that," he
asks his commanding officer.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.560
"Oh, yes," says the commander,
played by Sean Connery.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.340
"No papers?"

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.960
"No papers," says Sean Connery.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.550
State-to-state."

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:19.620
In the 16- and 1700s, the Poor
Law in the United Kingdom used

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.240
to punish paupers who roamed from
parish to parish in search of work.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.800
And it was one of the
signal achievements

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.380
of Adam Smith's <i>The
Wealth of Nations </i>to argue

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.300
that there was no economic
justification

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.840
for this prohibition
on internal movement.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.550
In the U.K. you can move
from parish to parish now.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:36.500
You can move from county to county.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.900
Even from nation to nation,
as the border between England

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.830
and Scotland is regarded.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.230
Indeed, we now conceptualize
internal movement

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:47.350
as a matter of rights.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:50.970
Article 13 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights holds

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.870
that "Everyone has the right to
freedom of movement and residence

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:57.240
within the borders of each state,"
meaning each national state,

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.880
which means that free movement
is emphatically not something

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.040
to be regulated on the basis of
a calculus of economic interest.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.570
It's removed from that
calculus and held as a matter

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.300
of principle distinct from it.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.390 position:56%
If it's a human right, then
internal movement is no more subject

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:14.270
to routine economic policy
calculations than a right to marry

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:17.330
or a right to freedom of religion.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:20.020
Article 13 further holds
that everyone has the right

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.400
to leave any country,
including his own.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.190
Immigration is not subject
to economic calculus either.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.040
Countries have sought
to limit immigration,

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.600
leaving one's country in the past.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.860
Our Cold War adversaries
did this to their citizens

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.180
as a matter of security policy.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.730
But we regarded it as a matter
of pride in this country,

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:42.860
that we rejected that idea and,
again, that everyone has a right

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.750 position:56%
to leave their country if they like.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:51.410
So speaking generally, issues of
migration are not treated just

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:54.370
like any other issues of
economic or public policy.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.990
We do make an exception
for immigration,

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.500
an exception from the human
rights framework that we use

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.800
for most migration issues, for
immigration over internal movement.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.130
So we've got to ask, what
makes it right or permissible

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.110
to put immigration at the
mercy of economic policy

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:13.280
when we leave emigration
and internal free?

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:17.120
And that's why there's an
issue of legitimacy here.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.740
We've got to, as it were, see
what distinguishes the one topic

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.040
from the others.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.410
I don't mean you can't
distinguish them.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.270
I mean we have to ask.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.570
To frame the question slightly
differently, we have an issue

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:33.640
of legitimacy to confront in
regard to coercive policies

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.280
that keep people out
-- coercive policies.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.240
As Joe Carens, who's a
Canadian political theorist,

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.910
who's written a fine book called
<i>The Ethics of Immigration </i>,

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:43.300
which is really applied
ethics rather

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.180
than philosophical foundations,
but none-the-worse for that --

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:53.090
as Joe Carens puts it, "Borders
have guards, and guards have guns.

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:57.870 position:56%
Sovereign states stop people from
entering their territory, stop them.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.920
They stop them forcibly.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:03.360
They chase after them and drag
them away from the boundary.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.050
They incarcerate them
until they can be deported.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:09.640
And they forcibly remove
them from the country.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:14.180
Now coercion, even the coercion
of law, is never self-justifying.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.500
The closest it ever comes
to being self-justifying is

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.920
when you are coercing a coercer,
as a manual count, with --

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.820
sort of like a set
-- a double negative.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.480
And so it adds up to
freedom all over again.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.350
But when we coerce immigrants,
we're not coercing coercers,

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:33.720
because the immigrants themselves
normally are not acting coercively.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.450
I mean, they're trying
to get into the country,

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:38.660
but they're not acting coercively.

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.080
Resistance by the officials

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.390
of the relevant sovereign is
usually the first introduction

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:43.880
of coercion into the situation.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.720
And again, I don't mean

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.880
that coercive immigration
laws can never be justified.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.320
I believe they can.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:55.000
But I do mean we have to
ask and we have to ask why.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:01.130
For example, let's suppose,
as seems to be the case,

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:05.210
that by-and-large immigrants,
even unlawful immigrants,

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:09.840
are no more prone to crime than
anyone else in the country.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.190
They don't come here
to steal our stuff

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:15.250
or harm our persons or families.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:18.770
Nonetheless, the inhabitants here
would just rather the newcomers

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:20.430
didn't come.

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:21.960
Those had that preference.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.830
Is that a preference that it's
appropriate to uphold with steel,

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:30.240
just because we would rather
not have these people around?

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.170 position:56%
We characterize coercion in relation
to the kind of freedom it restricts.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:38.290
Does it impact some particularly
valuable freedom like freedom

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:41.540
of religion, some basic liberty,
something that matters in the way

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:46.000
that -- in qualitatively in
the way that freedom does.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.140
Or is it just undifferentiated
negative freedom

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:55.060
like stopping the movement of
an insect or a mouse or a cat

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:59.740
from moving from point a to point
b. Is the migrants' freedom just

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.440 position:56%
about the freedom to move physically
from a point south of the border

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.330
to a point north of the border?

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:06.630
Not really.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:08.100
I mean it's not necessarily
like religious freedom either,

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.010
but it is something richer.

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:12.340
It answers to the human
aspiration not just

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.240
to physically move but to settle.

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:19.190
Not to just physically move
but to make a life for oneself

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.170
and one's family in an area.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:23.030
And, again, we have
to -- if we are going

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:26.590 position:56%
to justify corrosive immigration
laws, we have to think it's coercion

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:32.250
in relation to that entirely
understandable human aspiration.

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:37.350
So, a cascade of questions
presented unsystematically.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:43.000
Forgive me, but it's just
intended to prime the pump.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.350
Let's move particularly to
the question of legitimacy.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:49.520
We know that people feel much
more strongly about immigration

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.250
than they do about many
other issues and politics.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.700
People feel much more strongly
and righteously about immigration

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.620
than they do about many of
the issues that affect them

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:02.080
in circumstances where immigration
doesn't really affect them.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.040
It arouses strong passions,

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:09.350
and those passions are
themselves politically influential.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:11.690
Moreover, it's become
accepted wisdom

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:16.060
that politicians cannot afford
to ignore those strong passions,

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:18.740
cannot afford to ignore
the strong feelings

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.430
that are associated
with immigration policy.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:25.390
So when we ask about the
legitimacy of this body of law,

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:28.660
we have to ask not only about
the legitimacy of the work

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:33.180
that legislators do on this matter,
but also about the legitimacy

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:36.170
of the political pressure
that citizens bring to bear

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:39.120
on their legislators to do
something about this matter.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:43.060
This is a democracy and we
bear ultimate responsibility

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:48.520
for the laws we pressure
our lawmakers to enact.

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:53.790
The philosopher Michael
Walzer suggest in his book,

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:59.170
<i>Spheres of Justice </i>, that states
almost by definition have a right

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.370
and a responsibility to
control their borders.

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:04.350
And this is a very common saying.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:08.310
Former Senator Alan Simpson of
Wyoming is famous for having said,

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:12.640
"The first duty of a sovereign
nation is to control its borders."

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.860
Ronald Reagan is supposed
to have said,

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:19.090
"A nation that cannot control its
borders isn't really a nation."

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.870
And there's version after
version of this saying.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:27.650
There's a webpage which lists
about 20 or 30 versions of this.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:28.950
It's a common sentiment.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:32.170
I think we need to think
twice before we repeat it.

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:35.280
One reason to think twice
is that the term used

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.060
in these proposed definitions of
the elemental responsibilities

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:45.480
of the state, control its
borders, is ambiguous.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.680
Certainly a nation has the
right and responsibility

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:51.890
to control its borders against
encroachments by other countries --

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.250
against their armies, for example.

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:55.830
That much is clear.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.540
On the other hand,
many of us believe

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.460
that nations do not have the right
to control the passage of ideas

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.540
across their borders or
to control the movement

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.780
of capital across their borders.

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.890
Maybe they have the right to keep
track of capital and to keep track

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.890
of human movements, but
do we necessarily assume

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.920
that controlling the borders
means controller everything

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:21.440
that might be flying from one
side of the border to another?

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.160
So where in this array of
possible things that might

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.910 position:56%
or might not be comprised in the
claim a sovereign nation has a right

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:31.430
to control its borders, where
should we locate a putative right

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:32.970
to control immigrants?

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:36.420
Is that more like a right to
resist other states' armies?

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.690
Or is it more like a
movement of capital and ideas?

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:46.260
What we need at this stage are
arguments, not definitions.

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:50.170
Once upon a time, there was a
philosopher called Henry Sidgwick.

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:53.590
Sort of relative Victorian times.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:55.100
He wrote a book called <i>The Elements</i>

00:37:55.100 --> 00:38:01.160
<i>of Politics </i>which
was published in 1897.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.090
And Sidgwick entertained --
he didn't hold, but he set out

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:07.900
and entertained an alternative view
to the effect that the business

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:11.230
of legal and political
officials, including lawmakers,

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:14.890
is to maintain order over
a particular territory,

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:19.010
but not in any way to determine
who is to inhabit that territory.

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:21.880
Their job is to maintain
order in the well-defined,

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.930
jurisdictionally well-defined
territory, but not necessarily

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:27.250
to determine who is to
inhabit this territory

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:30.300
or to restrict the enjoyment
of its natural advantages

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:34.870
to any particular portion
of the human race.

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:38.550
Sidgwick didn't endorse that view.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.320
He says it represents
a cosmopolitan ideal.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:48.220 position:56%
I'm going to call it the Sidgwickian
Ideal anyway just for brevity.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:52.730
And I think calling it
cosmopolitan is a bit highfaluting,

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:58.140
for the position he maintains
exactly describes the principle

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.820
of state level government
in the United States, yeah?

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:05.580
Indiana has a defined jurisdiction

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:08.860
where it maintains
order, provides services.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.940
But it's not the function of the
Indiana legislature to determine

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.480
who lives within the boundaries,
in the boundaries of Indiana.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.860
Whoever chooses to live there
must obey the laws of Indiana,

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.220 position:56%
and gets the benefit of the services
of Indiana, whether they were born

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:26.040
in South Bend or come from,
I don't know, Falls Church

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.930
or Chattanooga, or anywhere else.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:36.210
States, in the sense of Indiana or
Texas, even District of Columbia,

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:40.010
are open Sidgwickian associations.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.710
They have defined jurisdictional
boundaries,

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.230
but those boundaries
are not supposed

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:47.300
to be barriers to human movement.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:51.810
And we think it's perfectly
possible -- we see it every day --

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:55.670
for states to run themselves
on that basis.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:58.280
More abstractly, aspects

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.210
of the Sidgwickian position are
already implicated in how we think

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:04.090
about the tasks of government
at the national level.

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:08.400
A government, we know,
has to take the population

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.990
of its territory more
or less as it finds it.

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:14.790
It doesn't get to determine
the size of the population.

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:18.300
And when governments have tried to
determine the size of a population

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.020
in the way that the Chinese and
the Indian government sometimes do,

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:24.170
we have the gravest reservations
about that enterprise.

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:27.050
Although it may have
been understandable.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:28.990
The government of the
national territory doesn't get

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:32.000
to determine the size of the
population, at least not directly.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.910 position:56%
If there is an uptick in fertility,
then the government just has to cope

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:40.790
with the increase of numbers and
adjust its planning accordingly.

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:45.210
If there is a decline in the ratio
of young people to old people,

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:48.850
then government policy
just has to deal with that.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:53.770
Suppose the government of some
territory suddenly discovered tens

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:58.540
of thousands of people living in
a forested area of that territory

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:02.240
who hadn't previously been counted,
hadn't previously been encountered,

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.060
hadn't ever been noticed, and
now they have been noticed

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.150
if the forests are part
of that state's territory.

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:12.380
Then again, it just has to
adjust the demographic basis

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.880
of its policy calculations.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.950
And that sense of state is an open
entity that has responsibilities

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:22.950
to whoever turns out to be
here, whether it planned

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:25.820
to take care of them or not.

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:29.900
Again, this doesn't settle anything
about immigration, but it indicates

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:34.690
that there's an idea of openness
which is present in the background

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:37.670
of this debate as well as
the idea of closedness,

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:40.260
which we tend to take for granted.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:43.300
And which is it to be --
closedness or openness?

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:47.150
Considerations like these show that
immigration issues raise questions

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:49.910
about what constitutes
a political community

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.690
and what political
communities are like.

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:55.480
Are they like neighborhoods
where people move in and out

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.010 position:56%
of neighborhoods, and we regard with
some abhorrence the use of, say,

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:03.720
for example, racial covenants
or religious restrictions

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:08.510
to preserve the character
of a neighborhood.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:12.920
Are they like neighborhoods which
are open, well-ordered but open,

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:18.620
or are they to be like country
clubs with understood as predefined

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.420
and exclusive, governed by
associational principles

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.740
with the right to pick
and choose their members?

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:28.770
I think we have to think
about that background issue

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:33.950
as we consider the
legitimation of immigration laws.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.920
So the communal dimension, how
we think about the community,

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.660
people here, not just the
government but the community.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.880
How we understand the
community, that's important.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.200
Our questions so far have been

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.470
about the national
government though not really

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:52.740
about the government
protecting its own interest

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:56.950
but protecting the interests of the
community of which it is a steward.

00:42:56.950 --> 00:43:02.810 position:56%
And this suggests that it may be
worth just asking a few foundational

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:07.390
questions about immigration
considered quite apart

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:08.770
from governments.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:11.900
And even those as a jurisprudence
lecture, quite apart just

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.200
for the moment from positive law.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.380
Let me back up a little bit.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:26.580
I want to back into this by way of
some classic political philosophy.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:30.480
Frederic Kellogg was good enough to
mention my interest in John Locke,

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:35.210
about whom I have written more
than any person decently should.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:37.720
John Locke, as you know, wrote
in England in the second half

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:42.050
of the 17th century, and he held
the view that most of the powers

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:45.780
of government, most of the
legitimate powers of government,

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:49.390 position:56%
were held by government because they
had been delegated to government

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.920
in the social contract
by individuals

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.900
who held those powers first.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.380
Individuals had the power to punish
offenses against the law of nature

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:00.840
when there was no government
in a state of nature.

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.060
Individuals had the power
of enforcement over the law

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.330
of nature, and that chaotic.

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:08.980 position:56%
And so they set up a government with
a social contract and transferred

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:13.420
that power that they had
individually to be better ordered

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:20.650
and better administered by a state,
less chaotically, more principled,

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:22.800 position:56%
less vengeful in its administration.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:26.090
But the idea was that the basis
of the government's entitlement

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:31.610
to do this was its prior
entitlement to natural individuals.

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:35.610
By contrast, a state's power
to impose religious coercion,

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:37.770
which was perfectly familiar
to Locke, which is why had had

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:40.130
to write his letter
concerning toleration,

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:42.230
couldn't be justified
in that way he thought.

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:45.660
Individuals have no right to coerce
each other on matters of religion,

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:48.340
since one man's salvation
or perdition is no prejudice

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.600
to any other man's affairs.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.070
And, therefore, individuals
have no power of this kind

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:55.750
that they could transfer
to their government

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:58.940
to maintain a religious
establishment.

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.970
So which of these is
the better analog

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:04.380
to the alleged power to
restrict immigration?

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.320
Is it a right that people
once had on a state of nature,

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.120
but which they transferred
to the government

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.170
for its better administration?

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:13.100
Or is it a power like
religious coercion

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.980
which the people never
could have had anyway.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.840
The aim here is not to figure
out what the man, John Locke,

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.140
thought about immigration.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:24.190
They use a little bit of
locking in structure to see

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:28.540
if we can illuminate this topic
from the underneath, as it were.

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.880
So here's a thought experiment.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.890
Forget about governments
for the moment.

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:36.120
Forget about national
borders for a moment.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.590
Just think of people
living in a state of nature,

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.790
but without a government,
without positive law,

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:46.720
but nevertheless living
reasonably sociably in villages.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.460
They're gathered together in
a village and they are faced

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.740
with the prospect of
newcomers coming

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:54.230
in to settle in their vicinity.

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:55.530
They suddenly wake up one morning

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:58.250
and they see some campfires
on the horizon.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:01.350
A wonderful novel by Jim Crace
called <i>Harvest </i>which deals

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:05.310
with this scenario in a
medieval, in a medieval village.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:08.000
So people living in a state
of nature, gathered together

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.480
in a village, faced with the
prospect of newcomers coming

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.930
to settle in their vicinity.

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:18.500
Might the villagers be justified
in driving the newcomers away

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:22.020
by shouting threats,
throwing rocks at them,

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.160
tearing up their encampments,
telling them, "Get off with you;

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.810
go to some other vicinity"?

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:33.850
The imagery evoked here an
unorganized mob driving strangers

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:37.770
out is not pleasant,
not intended to be.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:41.740
One of the advantages of the state
of nature thought experiment is

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:45.440
that we abandon any sanitized image

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:50.510
of a stainless steel legal
system doing the work

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:52.900
for us impersonally in our name.

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.630
It forces us to consider
what the powers

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:57.360
that the government are supposed
to have would look like if we had

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.710
to actually wield those
powers ourselves.

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:02.890 position:56%
I'm conscious that some people are
quite happy to go down to the border

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:05.350
and wield those powers themselves.

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:09.000
But, in general, what would it be
life if these powers were wielded

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.290
in the name of a community,
nevermind about borders,

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:14.020
if it was just the
defense of a vicinity?

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:19.520
If it was just us driving strangers
away, would it feel as rightful

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.250
and as righteous as it
might appear when done

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.810
under the auspices of positive law?

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:26.700
If the answer is no, then we
have some hard questions to face

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:30.520 position:56%
about what law adds to the situation
apart from a comforting distance

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:35.100
between us and the driving
away with an added dollop

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:38.360
of impersonal deniability.

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.560
Let me be clear.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:44.340 position:56%
There's no doubt that people in this
thought experiment would be entitled

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:49.200
to drive away bandits or
marauders, those who come to prey

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.970
on their property or their persons.

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:56.170
And occasionally, as you
know, rhetoric appropriate

00:47:56.170 --> 00:48:00.310
to rebuffing marauders is used in
our modern, emphatically nonstate

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.540
of nature immigration debate.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:07.420
People say illegal
immigrants are rapists

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:10.660
or drug dealers or members of M13.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:13.760
People say if they're prepared
to break our immigration laws,

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.410
what other laws might they
be tempted to violate?

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:20.460
But this rhetoric is not
generally appropriate.

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:23.180
In the real world, most would
be immigrants, including most

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.580
of those whose movement into
our country is restricted.

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:28.130
They're not marauders and
they're not terrorists.

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:30.880
They don't approach our territory
with the intention of harming us,

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.500
stealing our stuff, or
driving us off our land.

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.440
If they had their way,
they would just be

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:39.540
like somebody regularly
moving into the neighborhood,

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:42.220
looking to find a place
to rent, and a job,

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.590
or a basis for starting
up a business.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:47.130
They would be seeking
to involve themselves.

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:51.960
They are attracted by the open and
fluid economic networks that live

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:55.380
in the vicinity, that
flourish in the vicinity --

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:58.130
the market for labor, the
market for property, and so on.

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:01.450
They want to make a life for
themselves in our vicinity,

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:05.650 position:56%
not on our property in much the same
way that we make lives for ourselves

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:07.860
in this vicinity or that we
might move from one place

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.020
to another to make a new life.

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:13.150
If that is known to be
the newcomer's aspiration,

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:17.590
would we still be entitled
to drive them away?

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:18.890
Now your response to this sort

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:20.640
of experiment may be
different from mine.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.610
And I'm not even going to tell you
what mine is, because my approach

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:27.340
in this lecture is to pose
questions, foundational questions,

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:29.990
not give you foundational answers.

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:34.450
And, anyway, the Locke and Ford
experiment, admiral though it is

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:38.760
in my view, is only one
valuable way of getting

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:42.210
down to the real basics
and foundations.

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:44.780
Here's another.

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:48.840
And it's more anthropological
in its character.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:55.150
We need to think, way, way in
the background of our arguments

00:49:55.150 --> 00:50:00.370
about immigration, about the basis
in which human beings have for tens

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:04.080
of thousands of years lived and
inhabited this planet of ours.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:08.470 position:56%
And we need to focus especially on
what I'm going to call the dialectic

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:12.130
of movement and settlement.

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:16.340
Humans are, and always have
been, migratory animals.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.650
Our natural relation to land

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:24.490
and territory has always included
wandering as well as settlement.

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:26.380
Since our species -- this
is all stuff you know --

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:30.530
since our species evolved in
Africa, bands of us have moved

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:33.830
out across the face of the earth
into other parts of Africa,

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:38.340
into the Middle East, and then
into Europe, into Asia, South Asia,

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:42.190
into Australia, into the
America's, first from the Northwest

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:45.310
and then later, much
later from the East.

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:50.320
Human movement is not a
perverse or unnatural activity.

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:56.220
It's been the basis of our relation
to the planet, and peoples move

00:50:56.220 --> 00:51:00.450
for subsistence, they move for a
better life, they always have done.

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:03.410
They move individually, they
move in small family groups,

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:06.680
the move in larger gatherings.

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.080
So that's one point.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.640
Humans move, humans
migrate, it just happens.

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:17.570 position:56%
But in the dialectic of movement and
settlement, we need to do justice

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:19.850
to the other side as well.

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:23.440
People move, and people settle.

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.990
And I don't want to
give the impression

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:28.890
that settlement is always
just a temporary hiatus,

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:32.770
a pause while we gather our
strength for the next migration.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:36.210
Migratory humans are
not necessarily nomads.

00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:38.370
Most of us move in order to settle.

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:40.720
I moved from New Zealand
to settle first

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.800
in Britain and then to settle here.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:47.670
Humans have both the experience
and the expectation of settlement,

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:50.620
and not just temporary settlement,
but permanent settlement,

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:53.700
conceived as a cherished place
in a framework for settling

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:55.580
with a family, for
bringing up children,

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.770
and whereby children can
bring up their children,

00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:00.620
and so on through tens,
and maybe hundreds

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:05.200
of generations, sometimes
for millennia.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:09.020
Moreover, in this dialectic
of movement and settlement,

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:13.420
people and people's participate in
different and overlapping periods.

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:14.910
That's something.

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:17.970
It's not like musical
chairs where we all move

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.910
and then we all stop, right?

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:24.240
Some are settled for so long that
they have forgotten the dynamics

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.050
that drew their ancestors
to this place.

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:30.070
They've forgotten the dynamics
whereby their ancestors came

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:36.020
to Maryland from England,
to England from Saxony,

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:40.260
to Saxony from Central Europe,
and they're there from the steps

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:44.450
of Anatolia, and so on
back through the millennia.

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:49.470
Immemorial settlement can generate
a sort of optical illusion.

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:51.380
We describe ourselves as privileged

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.930
to always have been the
inhabitants of this soil.

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.000
And we think that privilege
entitles us

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.800
to rebuff others who
are on the move.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:05.540
And that can make migration seem
unusual, perverse, and threatening.

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:09.420 position:56%
So somewhere way in the background,
not determining any policy outcomes,

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:12.550
there needs to be a way of
recovering a sense of what it was

00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:16.650
like to move in the consciousness
of those in whom longevity

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:20.970
of settlement has generated
a sense of settled right.

00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:22.270
And say that again.

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:24.490
There needs to be a way of
recovering a sense of what it was

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:28.200
like to move, recovering that
in the consciousness of those

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:33.990
in whom longevity of settlement
has induced this feeling of right

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:36.140
and righteousness for where we are.

00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:43.140
I have heard it said that
a foundational account

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:47.660
of migration needs to
be rooted in a sense

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:51.000
of our common ownership
of the Earth.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.690
And I think that's in large
part a religious idea.

00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:57.500
Although I think it can be given
nonreligious understanding.

00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:03.060
For my money, God gave the
world to mankind in common,

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:06.260
and we have to figure out territory
and settlement and boundaries

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:10.050
from that as our starting
point if we can.

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:11.350
It's important, again.

00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:14.360
I don't think using this premise,
God gave the world to mankind

00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:19.310
in common, settles anything in
the immigration debate except

00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:21.310
to indicate that our
most basic rights

00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:23.460
in this matter range more broadly

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:28.300
than whatever citizenship rights
we might happen to have or lack.

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:34.890
When somebody walks from Chihuahua
to Texas, or sails from Libya

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:39.830
across the sea to Italy, he
is, from one perspective,

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:44.050
moving from one place where he
has a right to another place

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:46.580
where he has no right to be.

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:50.000
That's the [inaudible] view, that's
the law's view of the matter.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.990 position:56%
But in some deeper and more
generous vision, he is simply moving

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:59.060
on the face of a planet that
is as much his as anybody's.

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:02.140
And so anything we say about
immigration must be said not

00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:07.080
in denial of that, but in
response, in response to that.

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.560
Original common ownership
of the Earth.

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.860
This is an abstraction,

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:13.950
and by itself it doesn't generate
anything conclusive at the level

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:18.320
of policy except, maybe,
a sense of humility.

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:22.440
But it may do some
work as well in helping

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.900
to inform a few areas
of public policy.

00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:28.570
And let me just mention
four or five of them.

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:31.950
At the very least, common ownership
of the Earth does foundational work

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:34.600
as the basis of our
normative determination that,

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:40.820
since we now have a system of
states on the face of the globe,

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:45.230
that everyone must have some
place on Earth for them, yeah?

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:47.290 position:56%
That statelessness is an abomination

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:50.590
and we should make sure we
play our part in remedying it

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:54.350
and not causing it if it happens.

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:58.120
Everyone's entitled
to a place on Earth.

00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.520
It explains the elemental
acknowledgement

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:06.620 position:56%
by many legal systems, including our
own, of the principle of jus soli,

00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:08.130
which is the right of the soil.

00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:10.350
A person has a least the
right to be and remain

00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:14.120
in the place where
he was born, yeah?

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:18.130
Immanuel Kant, who's another one
of my philosophical favorites,

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:21.950 position:56%
identified original common ownership
with the idea, and this is a quote,

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:23.720 position:56%
that, "All human beings have a right

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:27.500
to be wherever nature
has placed them," yeah?

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:31.100
At least, they have
at least that right.

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:34.720 position:56%
Common ownership, thirdly, helps us
make sense of the distinctive rights

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:38.290
of the refuge, now formalized
in international law.

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:41.610
For somebody fleeing from a place
that has become intolerable,

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:45.220
there must be at least some
other place on Earth to flee to.

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:48.710
There's nowhere else
that they can go.

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:51.440
Maybe original common ownership
helps explain what we've

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.850
already noticed.

00:56:52.850 --> 00:56:56.590
The presence of human rights
thinking in the migration area,

00:56:56.590 --> 00:57:00.060
even if it doesn't go all the
way across from internal movement

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.950
to immigration to emigration.

00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:04.630
Nevertheless, migration
as such is an area

00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:06.650
which we think is important enough

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:10.410
to have a human rights
dimension to it.

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:14.860
And fifth, common ownership
helps us make sense of very,

00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:21.160
very ancient traditions of
universal hospitality to strangers.

00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:25.380
A theme in <i>The Odyssey </i>,
if you remember your study

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:30.170
of <i>The Odyssey </i>, a theme
in ancient Jewish tradition,

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:35.390
for your were strangers in the Land
of Egypt, a tenet of natural law

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:40.400
since Aquinas and Victoria, and a
focus of philosophical attention

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.250
in the work of thinkers
like Kant again.

00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:46.090
It doesn't settle anything,
but we need to have it

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:49.210
as a background premise
to humanize [inaudible],

00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:53.360
and help define the task
that we face in legitimizing

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.500
and justifying immigration laws.

00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:57.770
All of these implications
can be construed more

00:57:57.770 --> 00:58:00.480
or less generally, generously.

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.910
But if we do want to think
in foundational terms,

00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:07.190
I think these are some of the
pathways that we need to follow.

00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:12.640
Well, I'm sorry this
has become so abstract,

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.530
although with a foundational
lecture,

00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:19.430
what would you [laughter] expect?

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:21.330
That's the point of
foundational thinking.

00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:25.390
I want to end by exploring one
possible way of coming up for air,

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:28.430
because we've been way down in the
depths exploring the foundations

00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:33.330 position:56%
of this very ancient formation of
states and borders and restrictions.

00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:35.850
We've been like archeologists
exploring the foundations

00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:38.890
of a very ancient formation.

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:42.340
It's a point I've made a
couple of times already.

00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:44.290
There may have been a
time when human families

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:46.530
or larger groupings moved
on the face of the Earth

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:50.460
to find territories for
themselves when no one else was.

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:53.730
Territories, hopefully, uninhabited
in the vast wilderness of the world

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:55.270
where they could settle

00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:59.230
and unmolested take
advantage of local resources.

00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:01.630
In a crowded world we
understand and we know

00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:04.430
that that can no longer
be the intention.

00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:06.970
People still move in order to
make a life for themselves,

00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:11.300
but they move now precisely to
be near existing settlements,

00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:15.190
to be in vicinity in particular of
the open, fluid, and dense networks

00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:19.770
of exchange, opportunity, and
well-ordered economic interaction

00:59:19.770 --> 00:59:22.550
that characterize the life
of a developed country.

00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:26.910
They move because we have
open, economic networks

00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:30.290
which offer immense benefits
and opportunities to anyone

00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:33.500
in the vicinity if
they care to take them.

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.440
They do not come as predators.

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:39.320 position:56%
They do come to be near existing
habitation and to try to make a life

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.180
with the others who are
living in that vicinity.

00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:46.210
So that's the framework
for the real world.

00:59:46.210 --> 00:59:49.350
And it's an interesting question
how we should align this sense

00:59:49.350 --> 00:59:53.950
of economic openness which makes
a destination so attractive

00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:57.070
with the idea of an open
Sidgwickian community

00:59:57.070 --> 00:59:59.660
that I mentioned about
20 minutes ago.

00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.870
Remember I talked about
Henry Sidgwick's conception

01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:05.880 position:56%
of a society whose government
conceives its function as being just

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.180
to maintain order in the territory,

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.490
but not to determine
who comes into it.

01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:12.370
The sort of Indiana model.

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:16.310
We could contrast the
second kind of open society

01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:19.550
in the Sidgwickian sense
with the country club,

01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:23.720
exclusive club conception
which seems to be its rival.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.920
The closed society maintained
exclusively for the benefit

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:30.290
of its members with a very
scrupulous process of picking

01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:33.380
and choosing who gets to
be a member of the club.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:38.130
Is that closed and exclusive
conception really how we want

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:40.590
to think of modern community --

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:45.020
exclusive only for those with
whom we choose to associate?

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:48.290
Might not that clubbyness yield
a rather unattractive conception

01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:52.790
of economy, with markets and
networks tied down to systems,

01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:55.390
I don't know, nepotism and
closed privilege rather

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:58.620
than open-ended opportunity
and prosperity.

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.470
Myself, I don't think
those two senses

01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:03.590
of openness can be
altogether separated,

01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:07.590
as though we could maintain
our prosperity and the vigor

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:11.380
and flexibility of an open economy
while also maintaining among

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:15.730
ourselves politically a sense of
our community as a exclusive club,

01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:19.970
only for those who happen
to already have rights here.

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:27.980
All of this, and particularly
this last comment,

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.640
makes me worry a little bit.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:33.820
And I want to ask,
finally, why does it feel

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:38.990
as though a foundational
account is necessarily biased

01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:41.360
in this matter, yeah?

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:45.740
Why does it feel that it's sort of
nonmutual and that it's skeptical?

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:49.250
Maybe asking the questions
sounds like a skeptical inquiry

01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:52.990
and it sounds like by asking
question after question

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:56.010
after question I'm inflicting
a death of a thousand cuts

01:01:56.010 --> 01:02:00.730
on the principle of the legitimacy
of immigration restrictions.

01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:06.750
Is there some sense that it's wrong
or disloyal to pose hard questions,

01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:09.230
to take up abstract perspectives?

01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:10.530
I don't know.

01:02:10.530 --> 01:02:11.830
Is it just me?

01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:14.100 position:56%
I should have begun by acknowledging
my own interests in the matter.

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.260
I am a serial migrant [laughter].

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:21.470
Though born and raised and educated
in New Zealand on the other side

01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:24.670
of the world, itself a
country of immigration,

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:27.410
I have been for almost 30
years a permanent resident

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.090
of the United States.

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:32.060
And in the early 1980s and
also for four recent years

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:34.330
in which I held the Chichele
Chair of Political Theory

01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:38.600
at Oxford I enjoyed similar
status in the United Kingdom.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:44.270
I had like a full house of green
cards [laughter] in my hand.

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:46.140
So it's no surprise that
I should be holding,

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:49.020
that I should hold
pro-immigrant views.

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.700
And perhaps it's worth my trying
to appreciate how the perspective

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:54.810
of someone who has for
decades enjoyed the hospitality

01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:57.430
of a country other
than his own would find

01:02:57.430 --> 01:03:00.650 position:56%
that this affects the
foundational questions that he asks.

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:02.730
So I am conscious of that.

01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:05.630
But I have tried not to make
any particular argument in favor

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:07.390
of open borders or
less restrictive laws.

01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:11.040
Those have been questions, just
a sense of what it's like to go

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.940
down to foundational issues, and
how, certainly how disconcerting

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:19.630
that might be, but not
intending to prejudge everything.

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:21.780
It's part of the business
of being a philosopher

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:24.830
and a juris prude is a
philosopher in certain spirits.

01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:27.000
Philosophers have to
ask dumb questions.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.730
You know, will the sun
come up tomorrow morning?

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:31.660
Yes, of course, shut up.

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.740
Will the principle of
cause and effect fail?

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:35.040
[Inaudible] and so on.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.420
What's the basis of morality?

01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.390
Questions that ordinary
people don't ask,

01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:43.850
questions that as David Hume said
about his own queries, seem cold

01:03:43.850 --> 01:03:48.110 position:56%
and strained and ridiculous, so that
you have to go and play backgammon

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:51.160
to try and restore a
little bit of equilibrium.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.870
And asking questions about whether
it's legitimate for a country even

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:57.230
to have an immigration policy
does feel a little bit like that.

01:03:57.230 --> 01:04:02.030
But it's a way of generating
some perspective on the issue

01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:05.620
and providing a way, I
believe, of enriching

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:08.930
and humanizing the
discourse on this matter.

01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:11.750
So that's what I've
tried to do this evening.

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:13.550
Thank you very much indeed.

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:30.040
[ Applause ]

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.440
Jane, will you call
on people or shall I?

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.150
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: I'll
just go [inaudible].

01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:34.450
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Yes.

01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:35.750
Yes, sir.

01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:37.550
&gt;&gt; May I --

01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:41.310
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:44.700
Well, I thought there
was a -- is it on?

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.000
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.300
&gt;&gt; No.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.900
&gt;&gt; Is it on?

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.200
&gt;&gt; No.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.500
&gt;&gt; No.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.340
&gt;&gt; This is on.

01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:07.640
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.140
&gt;&gt; I gave up math and
science for law.

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.440
I hope [inaudible].

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.170
But I thought it was
a marvelous talk.

01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:14.470
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Thank you.

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:17.600
&gt;&gt; And even though you're an
English-speaking migrant moving

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.730
through English-speaking countries,

01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:22.160
I don't think you had
any bias in particular.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.460
My own view.

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:25.100
I assume you don't take
the country club position.

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:31.360
But I do have maybe two questions.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:35.150
One is the enormous
growth of population.

01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:36.880
This is not a Malthusian question.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:42.700
It's just the sheer
numbers of people moving.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:47.290
And it can lead to crowding,
say, in small countries.

01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:49.230
So that's my first point.

01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:50.530
What do you think about that?

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:51.830
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Yeah.

01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:53.270
&gt;&gt; And my second point's
related to that word "country."

01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:56.120
I'm a law professor,
not a philosopher.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.900
The only thing I gave
up was philosophy.

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.660
I thought it was too indeterminant.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:04.280
But I don't think --

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:08.300
most philosophers and juris
prudes do not really focus

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:11.160
on the nation-state
system very much.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.610
And I'm not talking about borders.

01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:15.020
I'm sort of talking about loyalties

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.770
to national sport teams
and things like that.

01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:20.710
There's no question that
is a modern phenomenon.

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:23.590
I've just come back, actually, from
Europe and you're certainly right.

01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:25.750
Immigration -- I was in
Austria, for example.

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:28.160
Immigration's a much
more heated [inaudible]

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:33.420
because it's a smaller
country, probably deservedly so.

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:35.790
But I do think that this
question of population growth

01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:41.210
and the pressures it creates and
of crowding of certain countries,

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:43.160
and this point about
the nation-state system.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.460
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Yeah.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:45.760
Thank you very much.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.060
I think they're both
hugely important.

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:50.330 position:56%
And apart from some vague
reference to the nation-state system

01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:51.630
in the middle of the lecture,

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:53.280
I didn't really address
either of them.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:57.690
I do think that ultimately it's
going to be impossible to come

01:06:57.690 --> 01:07:00.600
up with a rational approach to
immigration law without thinking

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.660
about it partly in terms
of the nation-state system.

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:08.640
You know, I go from country to
country, and you hand your passport

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:13.080
to the officer at the border as
you come into Italy or South Africa

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.170
or Australia, wherever it is,

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:17.270
and he just doesn't tear
it up and throw it away.

01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:19.360
And he looks at it
respectfully, he may stamp it,

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.210
and passes it back to you.

01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:25.230
We have a system where countries
respect each other in this regard.

01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:29.160
And certainly whatever arrangements
are made regarding migration are

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.780
made at the behest of particular
countries with some sense

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.440
that there is a degree
of solidarity.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.640
And I believe for that reason it's
important for lawyers to be able

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:41.020
to raise their eyes
beyond the arrangements

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:45.580
of any particular society and think
about the overall system for travel

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:47.970
and migration in the world.

01:07:47.970 --> 01:07:54.240
The crowning point is hugely
important and we would have

01:07:54.240 --> 01:08:00.410
to ask -- nevermind the
calculus of economic interests

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:04.330
or even cultural interests, do
we have to be concerned simply

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:08.020
about the pressure of movement
of large numbers of people

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:11.010
to suddenly transform
the conditions of life?

01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:13.000
Because, certainly,
that's how some people

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.210
in Europe have seen
the refugee crisis.

01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:19.140
And people worry, not that
there's any prospect of this,

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:22.310
but if the southern border was
open there would be a deluge

01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:29.220
of people overwhelming the
services of a particular country.

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:36.730
So whether the large-scale issue of
crowding and the large-scale issue

01:08:36.730 --> 01:08:40.440
of movement of very large numbers
of people is an appropriate subject

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.860
for public policy I think
needs to be answered,

01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:47.810
and can't be answered just on
the basis of what I've said.

01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:54.190 position:56%
I think, with the possible exception
of concerns about school district,

01:08:54.190 --> 01:08:56.490
of school districts, that
schools sometimes get overwhelmed

01:08:56.490 --> 01:08:58.750
by numbers, we by-and-large
don't think

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:01.400
about immigration concerns
in those terms.

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.730
But they are there in the
background, and I think maybe --

01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:09.190
I mean, the imagery I was giving
you about movement on the face

01:09:09.190 --> 01:09:13.130
of the Earth asks us to
imagine small bands of people,

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:19.470 position:56%
1- or 2000 maybe moving out around
the periphery of South Asia and down

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:21.700
into Australia and so on.

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:25.850
But when we're dealing with tens of
thousands, hundreds of thousands,

01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:30.160
maybe millions of people moving, as
we undoubtedly will see in the wake

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.040
of climate change, then I
think there are serious issues

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.340
to be raised.

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:37.510
And I should have addressed
those had we had unlimited time.

01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:38.810
Yes, ma'am.

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:41.860
Right button beside you.

01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:43.160
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:47.030
I'm an immigration reporter.

01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:51.190
I cover immigration here in
Congress for the last 10 years

01:09:51.190 --> 01:09:52.490
for <i>Hispanic Magazine </i>.

01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:55.150
I've written two books about
it, mainly from the aspect

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:58.000
of how immigration laws evolved.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.770
But it's very clear when you look
at it from this point of view

01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:04.060
that there is a big difference
between migration and immigration.

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:09.180
And it seems to me that
you mix the two a lot.

01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:14.940
And immigration is -- it's a
concern of the nation-state.

01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:17.140
And it's a national concern.

01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:19.770
It isn't in the Foreign
Relations Committee.

01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:22.520
Most countries it's in the
Labor Committee because it has

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.360
to do with work development.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.520
And when we talk about nation
of immigrants, you have to talk

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.930 position:56%
about not only what the
immigrants' interest is coming here,

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:35.400 position:56%
but what the nation-state's interest
is in welcoming them or not.

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.890
And they certainly have
the right to do that.

01:10:37.890 --> 01:10:43.910
So an analogy I like to make is
that of a university, of a popular,

01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:47.560
wonderful university that's
people's dreams to go there.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:51.320
And they will benefit tremendously
and they're incredibly qualified.

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:54.330
And the university would
also benefit from them.

01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:56.020
But there's thousands of people.

01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.580
They cannot take all the people.

01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:00.210
In order to keep the integrity

01:11:00.210 --> 01:11:04.000
of the university they
have admissions policies.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.300
And they get to choose.

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:10.250
Everyone gets to apply, but they
-- the university gets to choose.

01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:13.040
And in the interests of the
university and their integrity

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.550
and their standards and all that.

01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:20.310
And I think it's useful rather
than getting political and racist,

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:22.460
all that, that to think
of nation-states

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:24.570
as having admissions policies.

01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:25.900
And they change over time.

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:27.200
And that's what I cover.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.500
And it's fascinating.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:31.870
But I don't think it's
a religious thing.

01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:34.710
There isn't a civil
right to immigration.

01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:36.600
Immigration's not a civil right.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:39.090
And it's not a human right either.

01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:41.280
In the United Nations
Charter in the Chart

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:45.170
of Human Rights it says you have
a human right to leave a country,

01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:48.030
but no one has a human
right just to come in.

01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:50.950
And, of course, the basis of
that, not just to come in,

01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:56.040
but I mean to stay, to settle, and
the basis of that is citizenship.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.980 position:56%
You get -- a country gets to decide.

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:01.740
And it's in the first
section of our Constitution

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:05.390
that Congress decides
naturalization.

01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:08.730
So, I mean, from the very
beginning, there is a distinction

01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:11.250
between citizens and noncitizens.

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:13.560
And I don't think you can
talk about immigration

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.630
without talking about
a nation-state.

01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:18.460
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: I
think all of that is true.

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:25.640
It is the case that no matter
how popular California might be,

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:28.520
or how popular Indiana
may be, we wouldn't dream

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.480
of regulating movement now --

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.780
&gt;&gt; No.

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.080
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: -- from there,

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.380
even though it might
lead to overcrowding.

01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:35.680
Yes, as internal migration.

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:36.980
&gt;&gt; They're still part
of the United States.

01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:38.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: They're part of
the United States, but nevertheless,

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.150
it's the State of California
that's responsible

01:12:40.150 --> 01:12:41.930
for administering its
school system and the State

01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:44.700
of California is responsible
for administering it.

01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:46.660
&gt;&gt; You're talking [inaudible]
a very [inaudible].

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:47.960
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Yes, right.

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.700
So that we have to think what
makes the nation-state and movement

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.630
across that border are different.

01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:54.930
What's involved?

01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:56.430
Because we do think that
movement into and out

01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:59.210
of California is a
matter of human rights.

01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:03.050
Secondly, on the issue
of universities,

01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:06.230
we would think it were a
problem, it would be a problem

01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:10.850
if there were just one of these
highly attractive universities,

01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:15.900
and everybody had to either
sink or be admitted and swim.

01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:21.790
What we find is, of course, we
have a thousand or more colleges

01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:25.490
and universities set out across
the country, an array of them.

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:26.790
Some better, some worse.

01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:29.920
But at every level
a echelon of them.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.690 position:56%
And I think our view about the
university analogy, which I respect.

01:13:34.690 --> 01:13:35.990
That's a good analogy.

01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:38.510
A view about that analogy
would be different

01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:42.150
if it were made more conformable
to the situation of migration.

01:13:42.150 --> 01:13:45.090
&gt;&gt; In the same window there's
many countries if you don't get

01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:46.880
into the United States,
if you don't --

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:50.150
unaccepted through an
immigration visa or a temporary.

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:51.600
There's other nation-states.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:55.390
You have a Plan B. You don't
have the right to come in.

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:58.180
You don't get a right
to storm the dorms,

01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:02.260
take the courses, and
demand a degree.

01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:03.560
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Yeah.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:04.860
No, that's exactly right.

01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:06.160
That's exactly right.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.500
We have to think that
through I mean.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.950
And part of what was
going on in here --

01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:12.800
it wasn't really a confusion
of migration and immigration

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.960
because there were -- you
mightn't have heard it,

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.810
but they were carefully
distinguished at various stages.

01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:20.930
They were put in the same
paragraph precisely in order

01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:23.640 position:56%
to disconcert us a little bit, yeah,

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.020
in order to disconcert
our sense that, of course,

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.820
we know that immigration
is different.

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:30.610
And someone says, well,
how is it different?

01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:32.270
Well, it's about citizenship.

01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:34.870
But exactly what is a
community of citizens?

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:36.840
Is it like a club or is it --

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.880
and so we have to pose the
hard questions anyway even

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:44.800
if they do disconcert the terms
and topics we normally deal in.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.100
Yeah.

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:47.400
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.700
&gt;&gt; Professor Merritt.

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:50.000 position:56%
Build on this question particularly.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.930
I'd like to push you
a little further.

01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:56.690
Thanking you for this
very, very lucid lecture.

01:14:56.690 --> 01:15:00.790
I actually think the citizenship
question's quite important.

01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:02.720
And I would take it
back to your state

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:06.070
of nature analogy,
the harvest analogy.

01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:07.370
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Yeah.

01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:10.330
&gt;&gt; One group sees the --
suddenly wakes up in the morning

01:15:10.330 --> 01:15:13.620
and finds another group
possibly encroaching.

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:17.800
The real question is not whether
the other group can be nearby.

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.900 position:56%
It seems to me the question you're
asking is whether the other group is

01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:26.410
entitled to join, to join, to
enter the group that's already

01:15:26.410 --> 01:15:27.710
located somewhere.

01:15:27.710 --> 01:15:29.010
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Sure.

01:15:29.010 --> 01:15:35.590
&gt;&gt; And that is a question of
the difference between travel

01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:39.630
as migration, residency,
and citizenship.

01:15:39.630 --> 01:15:43.600
And I just wonder whether you
see any foundationally valid

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.890 position:56%
distinctions among those categories.

01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:47.190
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Right.

01:15:47.190 --> 01:15:48.490 position:56%
Citizenship's going to be important.

01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:50.390 position:56%
It's probably unlikely that it's
going to be a foundational category,

01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:52.160
but it's going to be important,
I think, for the reasons

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.710
that you both have stated.

01:15:55.710 --> 01:15:59.410
So let's think a little bit
about the harvest analogy,

01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:01.820 position:56%
the Jim Crace or John Locke analogy.

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:03.380
So people come into the vicinity.

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:07.490
I'm assuming they come into
the vicinity to have dealings

01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:10.650
with the people there as well as
to make whatever life they can

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:14.470
in whatever land they can
legitimately start plowing

01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:16.190
and cultivating.

01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:19.410
So they may even want
to buy some stuff.

01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:23.070
They may want to engage in
some economic transactions.

01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:26.910
They may want to join in,
which is not at all the same

01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:31.260
as becoming a member, because it's
not clear what membership means

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:34.640
in the context of this idea.

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.560
So joining in the activities
just means taking advantage

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.040
of the openness that's
already established.

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.760
You know, that there
are marketplaces.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:48.290
&gt;&gt; Well, there -- many economists
will argue that the trade,

01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:51.470
which is what you're describing,
isn't a substitute for migration.

01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:53.580
If you allow people to trade,

01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:55.900
you actually remove the
incentive for migration.

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:57.200
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Yeah.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.500
That sounds absolutely right.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.230
And so it certainly
needs to be dealt with.

01:17:00.230 --> 01:17:04.750
But, certainly, we have to put
a question mark over the idea

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:06.730
of joining so long as we remain

01:17:06.730 --> 01:17:08.880
within the four corners
of the Lochean question.

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:11.160
Then we have to ask ourselves,
since we eventually want to get

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:15.000
to the notion of joining, what
it's based on and what sort

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.180
of association we are imagining.

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:22.690
And if it's an association
whose closedness is definitive

01:17:22.690 --> 01:17:26.940
in the conception of citizenship
and the definition of citizenship,

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:29.360
then the only point I was
pressing on is we'd have

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.480
to think a little bit
about the impact of that

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.500
on the overall atmosphere
of the economy as well.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.900 position:56%
But I appreciate the very -- it
occurred to me as I was writing this

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:42.890
that there really ought to be a
few pages on citizenship as such

01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:45.310
because the main, the
main right of citizenship,

01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:47.170
the most distinctive right
of citizenship is the right

01:17:47.170 --> 01:17:49.970
to remain in the country.

01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:53.500
Many countries allow
noncitizens to vote.

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:56.090
Many countries, including this
one, give citizens the benefit

01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:58.190
of almost all -- noncitizens
the benefit

01:17:58.190 --> 01:18:03.000
of almost all -- all
non-voting rights.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.550
But the main benefit
the citizens have is

01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:08.290
under no circumstances
can they be deported

01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:13.320
or have their citizenship
stripped from them.

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:14.620
Please.

01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:15.920
&gt;&gt; We give a green card.

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.220
It's called a Permanent
Legal Residence.

01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:18.790
You have permanency there.

01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:23.630
It's the immigrant, the person on
the Permanent Legal Residency gets

01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:29.850
to choose, gets to decide if
they're going to be a citizen.

01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:35.020
There's no requirement
to be a citizen.

01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:39.530
They can be here the
rest of their lives --

01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:41.260
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron:
No, that's not true.

01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:42.560
&gt;&gt; -- with a green card.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:44.060
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: There's supposed

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:46.290
to be a normative path
to citizenship.

01:18:46.290 --> 01:18:49.700
I remember once coming through --

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:51.000
&gt;&gt; Only [inaudible] lively.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.300
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Sure.

01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:53.600
&gt;&gt; That's why they say it's a path.

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.900
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Right.

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.200
&gt;&gt; But it's still up
to the individual

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.550
that they're going to do it or not.

01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:58.850
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Right.

01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:03.240
&gt;&gt; Most of them, most people
with green cards never do apply.

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:07.570
&gt;&gt; I was coming through the
barrier once at the immigration,

01:19:07.570 --> 01:19:12.550
maybe in Los Angeles, and there
was an elderly officer dealing

01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:15.210
with my -- [inaudible] before
it was done by machine.

01:19:15.210 --> 01:19:20.650
And he said, "Green
Card holder since 1987.

01:19:20.650 --> 01:19:21.950
What's the matter?

01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:23.260
Don't you want to be a citizen?"

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:26.260
And it was a sweet question.

01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:33.350 position:56%
And there is some doctrine on this
which holds that states are entitled

01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:36.850
to confine certain roles like,
say, school teacher or something

01:19:36.850 --> 01:19:42.680
like that, to citizens, and
to preclude green card holders

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:48.220 position:56%
because green card holders have made
a choice not to become citizens.

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:51.040
And it's actually a
normative trajectory.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.340
Yes, sir.

01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:53.640
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:56.760
I wonder if you could discuss the
reaction to this type of philosophy

01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:58.230
in terms of historical
experience of different states.

01:19:58.230 --> 01:19:59.880
Can you generalize what types of
states have allowed open borders?

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:01.180
When in history?

01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:02.480
And under what type of
leadership conditions?

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:05.630
And when have more closed and
restrictive rules been applied?

01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:06.930
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Thank you.

01:20:06.930 --> 01:20:11.040
So many people would say that
the present regime of closed

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:14.460
and guarded borders and
passports as a prerequisite

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:16.880
for movement only really emerged

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:19.910
around the time of
the First World War.

01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:22.410
And that until then borders
were relatively open,

01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:25.600
although they could be closed for
police reasons at various times.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.040
Certainly in the Ancient World,

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:31.570 position:56%
although there were some ferociously
self-protective societies.

01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:34.710
A city like Athens would
be open to a large number

01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:36.160
of foreigners to come and settle.

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:38.290
They wouldn't have rights to
participate in the democracy,

01:20:38.290 --> 01:20:40.890
but they -- Aristotle
was an example.

01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:44.110
A Macedonian who came to settle in.

01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:46.180
But I don't want to draw
anything normative from that

01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:47.540
because the conditions
were different

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:51.660
and the political systems were
more like what we would call cities

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:55.300
than might what we would
call nation-states.

01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:58.410
I think it's a very, very
interesting question to ask

01:20:58.410 --> 01:21:02.630
about what were the pressures
that led to the development

01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:04.840
of national immigration policy.

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:07.250
In this country, I'm
told, and somebody will --

01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:09.510
I think you'll be able to help me.

01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:12.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:14.030
&gt;&gt; There's national
immigration laws from the 1880s.

01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:15.680
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: It
was the Anti-Chinese.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.400
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah [inaudible].

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:18.700
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Yeah.

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:20.000
That's right.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.300
But until then, it was
sometimes the responsibility

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.600
of the individual states --

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:23.900
&gt;&gt; That's right.

01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:25.820
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: -- to administer
control at their ports and --

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:29.910
which didn't mean that internal
movement was restricted.

01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:33.550
But states which were near national
boundaries would administer those.

01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:36.240
So we do start getting, you
know, Chinese Exclusion Acts

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:39.260
and so on -- 1890's, 1880's.

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:44.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; But before that the states -- and
states got to give the citizenship.

01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:45.320
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Yeah.

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.570
&gt;&gt; They got to decide who was
going to be a citizen [inaudible].

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:49.330
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: So what would
be really interesting would be

01:21:49.330 --> 01:21:53.070
to tract not just the particular
panics that might lead to something

01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:56.690
like the Chinese Exclusion Act,
but whatever one could salvage

01:21:56.690 --> 01:22:02.020
from the diva philosophy that
began under changing circumstances

01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:05.620
to inform and affect the history.

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.580
I'm not an historian, but I think

01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:10.260
that would be an entirely
respectable --

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:14.420
I'm sure you've -- absolutely.

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:18.280
Yes, sir. We need a microphone.

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:19.580
&gt;&gt; I could just speak
really loud [inaudible].

01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:21.970
&gt;&gt; I'll get [inaudible].

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.340
&gt;&gt; Hello.

01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:29.640
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Yeah.

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:30.940
&gt;&gt; Professor, thanks
for making it out here.

01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.240 position:56%
I'm really interested in your notion

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.880
of citizenship, political
citizenship.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:40.230 position:56%
And I was getting the sense that as
you were talking you have this sense

01:22:40.230 --> 01:22:44.960
of we are all migrants in
the larger historical sense.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.740
So there's this fluidity
about citizenship.

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:52.060
How do you make sense of that in
a trans-historical perspective?

01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:53.360
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Yeah.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:59.440
&gt;&gt; I mean, it's -- how do you
make sense of that through time?

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.740
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Yeah.

01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:02.040
So what I wanted to insist is

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:05.610
that although we are
all migratory animals,

01:23:05.610 --> 01:23:10.060
and our ancestors have all
been movers from time to time,

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:12.020
we move in order to settle.

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:15.270
And we settle in the
aftermath of movement,

01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:18.490
often for extraordinary long
periods, periods which --

01:23:18.490 --> 01:23:22.160
before the time of writing
and Facebook and whatnot,

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:25.700
periods that begin to
become opaque to us.

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:30.930
So, for example, in my country
in New Zealand, which was --

01:23:30.930 --> 01:23:35.670
unless you [inaudible] -- the
most recently-settled landmass

01:23:35.670 --> 01:23:40.560
in the world settled probably about
a thousand years ago by the people

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:44.230
who are now described as
its indigenous inhabitants.

01:23:44.230 --> 01:23:46.270
That thousand years has sufficed

01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:51.810
to efface most collective
memory of the migrations.

01:23:51.810 --> 01:23:58.960
And such memory as there is
is [inaudible] compromised

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:04.200
with some sense, some mythology
of having been immemorially there.

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.860
So we have to understand, I think,
the psychology of settlement,

01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:12.610
the psychology of settlement
for 10/15/20 generations,

01:24:12.610 --> 01:24:16.620
and thinking about how
that affects the mentality.

01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:20.010
And I didn't want -- I mean, I
did want to do justice to that,

01:24:20.010 --> 01:24:24.610
although I think it generates a
certain optical illusion regarding

01:24:24.610 --> 01:24:25.960
the fact of movement.

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:30.890
It can make movement appear
to be a fearsome and unnatural

01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:35.250
and threatening thing because
one moves in order to settle.

01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:37.880
And one fears that if one
allows settlement to be open

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:41.010
to newcomers this will undermine
settlement, which was the point

01:24:41.010 --> 01:24:42.900
of moving in the first place.

01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:47.590
&gt;&gt; So are you saying that
citizenship is almost based,

01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:51.950
in a sense, on our ability to
recognize collective memory?

01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:54.570
In a sense it's economy to that.

01:24:54.570 --> 01:24:59.730
So if we take a cost -- idea of
census [inaudible] will be applied

01:24:59.730 --> 01:25:02.550
if not just space [inaudible]
through time.

01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:07.290
I mean, we can't demand all
people to try to simulate,

01:25:07.290 --> 01:25:09.580
come up with that thought
experiment.

01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:13.870 position:56%
But how does one go about conceiving
of citizenship in that case?

01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:15.170
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Right.

01:25:15.170 --> 01:25:17.660
It's one of the hardest things that
people have found philosophically.

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:20.810
There's a wonderful discussion
of it, as you may know,

01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:24.690
at the very beginning of Book
Three of <i>Aristotle's Politics </i>,

01:25:24.690 --> 01:25:26.800
where he says, "How do
we define citizenship?

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:28.740
How do we define a citizen?"

01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:31.590
And sometimes he's
defining it functionally.

01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:36.670
A citizen is somebody who can take
turns in ruling and being ruled.

01:25:36.670 --> 01:25:40.100
And sometimes he defines it as it
were in terms of qualifications.

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:43.130
A citizen is a person whose
parents were citizens.

01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:46.640
And sometimes he's moving
back and forth between them,

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:49.840
because this is the beginning
of thinking about citizenship.

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.520
The other thing that we need
to bear in mind, and again,

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:55.400
it makes us a little bit humble,
is that even though citizenship

01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:01.400
as a notion goes way, way
back in that spurt, for us,

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:05.610
in our relatively recent
history over the last 500 years,

01:26:05.610 --> 01:26:07.810
citizenship has been
massively associated

01:26:07.810 --> 01:26:10.720
with subjection, you know?

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:13.890
So one is a British
subject before we begin

01:26:13.890 --> 01:26:15.750
to talk about British citizens.

01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:18.700
And a British subject is a person
who owes allegiance to an overlord

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:23.400
or overlady, and citizen
is built up out of that,

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:30.330
which makes it a little bit less
attractive in the scheme of things.

01:26:30.330 --> 01:26:31.830
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:34.790
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Ma'am, please.

01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:36.450
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Professor.

01:26:36.450 --> 01:26:39.250
I found your lecture
very enlightening.

01:26:39.250 --> 01:26:41.440
I'm not an American.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:46.650
I'm what I think you would
call a documented alien.

01:26:46.650 --> 01:26:50.320
But temporarily working
in this country.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:56.330
And I'm glad you brought up
the example of school districts

01:26:56.330 --> 01:27:02.390
because I think that the example
is not as exceptional as you think.

01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:08.950
I think a lot of the resistance in
Western societies to migration has

01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:14.610
to do exactly with the
same series or arguments.

01:27:14.610 --> 01:27:22.240 position:56%
That is, the fear that the newcomers
will not contribute to the society,

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:26.230
the existing people, the
existing population live in,

01:27:26.230 --> 01:27:30.250
and that the redistribution of
the wealth which is taking place

01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:35.980
in that given area will cause
disproportionate advantages

01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:37.280
for newcomers.

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:42.220
I'm not saying I condone this,
but I'm saying it is an argument,

01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:45.720
and it is going far
beyond the nation-state.

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:48.420
If you look at Europe,
where I'm from --

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:52.200
I like to consider myself not
as a citizen of a nation-state,

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.110
but as a European citizen.

01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:57.790
We have decided in Europe to
put certain things together,

01:27:57.790 --> 01:28:02.580
to open up our borders, but to
integrate our economies, and also,

01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:05.240
to a certain extent
and ever far-reaching,

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.530
to integrate certain
social benefits,

01:28:07.530 --> 01:28:10.370
educational systems, and so forth.

01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:14.870
And that is why we have now at
our borders also the development

01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:17.730
of a common migration policy.

01:28:17.730 --> 01:28:21.210
And the second argument,
or the second thing I would

01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:23.830
like to raise is the following.

01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:28.440
There is also a fear that certain
newcomers, and this is tied

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:33.180
to culture, this is tied to
religion, to other things,

01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:38.030
we'll have a harder time to
accept the fundamental values

01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:44.080
on which our societies,
plural, are founded.

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.760
And if people start thinking like
that, there's certainly a lot

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:51.810
of more arguments,
then we can, of course,

01:28:51.810 --> 01:28:54.930
and we should, reason
in the abstract.

01:28:54.930 --> 01:29:00.470
But we should not just tell
those people they are wrong.

01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:02.130
We should take that into account.

01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:04.200
And I'm also a former politician.

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:05.540
We should deal with it.

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:06.840
Thank you.

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.140
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Thank
you very much, indeed.

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:10.300
Quite the points that
I think are important.

01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:14.000
I mentioned a book by Paul Collier
called <i>Exodus </i>, which was --

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.390
he's an economist at Oxford.

01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:17.820
And it's a very, very
sophisticated study.

01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:19.130
And on your second point, one

01:29:19.130 --> 01:29:22.480
of the things he reckons
is, nevermind about culture.

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.350
Nevermind about economy.

01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:27.120
There's just something called
the model in each society,

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.520
which is a model of how one
lives and betters oneself

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:32.600
and how one brings up a
family and works and so on.

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:35.490
And the concern is that
the basic model or way

01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:37.350
of life may be compromised.

01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:41.480
Not now the recipes and the dancers
and the costumes or the culture

01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:46.420
and that thing, or the myths,
but just the basic model of life

01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:48.780
and livelihood in the community.

01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:51.690
And that the models are not equally
distributed among the societies.

01:29:51.690 --> 01:29:56.030
And, of course, migrants leave
one society and go to another

01:29:56.030 --> 01:30:01.040 position:56%
because of the dysfunctionality
sometimes of the model of livelihood

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.040
in the society that they have left.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:06.700
And Collier, perhaps more than me,

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:11.370
is worried about the transportation
of one model to another.

01:30:11.370 --> 01:30:14.730
On the first point, there's so
much to be said about the issue

01:30:14.730 --> 01:30:19.960
of redistribution and
disproportionality.

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:24.260
And I don't think -- I'm not
as skeptical as some people are

01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:26.750
about the necessity
for a certain sense

01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:31.490
of preestablished solidarity before
you can have a redistributive

01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:32.790
social system.

01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:36.630 position:56%
People sometimes worry about that in
the context of the European Union.

01:30:36.630 --> 01:30:41.320
Others worry about it in relation
to the issue of migration.

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:45.500
It seems to me that a lot of
redistribution, certainly a lot

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.720
of social services, are provided

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:51.710
in the United States
by individual states.

01:30:51.710 --> 01:30:53.720
And those individual
states work with them.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:58.130
They run their school districts
irrespective of their inability

01:30:58.130 --> 01:31:03.210 position:56%
to control who crosses their state
lines and who crosses their borders.

01:31:03.210 --> 01:31:08.120
So sometimes we need a very special
explanation of why we get panicked

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:11.710
about crossings of national borders
in relation to school districts.

01:31:11.710 --> 01:31:15.690
Whereas we're not panicked at all
about crossings of state lines

01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:17.840
in regard to school
districts which tells me

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:20.120
that legitimate though
the concern is,

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:24.950
there is something else
going on in this issue.

01:31:28.130 --> 01:31:29.430
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:30.790
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] officer.

01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:32.090
My name's [inaudible].

01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:35.190
We're talking about
[inaudible] about the human right

01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:38.540
that I think there's a
distinction whether a person is

01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:39.970
equally protected.

01:31:39.970 --> 01:31:43.220
And that's like in the
United States Constitution.

01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:45.600
I just wonder, is there
real [inaudible]?

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:48.350
You call it profession.

01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:54.260 position:56%
Or is there some good studies that
will tell you their real [inaudible]

01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:56.390
and not equal protection at all.

01:31:56.390 --> 01:32:00.360
So, for instance, whether
Constitution

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:04.850
or right is say you are protected
for all your belongings, your home,

01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:07.900 position:56%
your property, and your [inaudible].

01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:09.960
You [inaudible] litigation.

01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.470 position:56%
So is there any such things and then

01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:17.070
when we [inaudible] consider
what is seriously, what it is,

01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:19.410
some kind of documentary or study

01:32:19.410 --> 01:32:24.450
or research say there is
really good protection.

01:32:24.450 --> 01:32:25.750
There's no bias.

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:30.680
There's no improper processing of
complaint or procedures or record

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:36.800 position:56%
or tampering or document destruction
or anything on this [inaudible].

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:40.800
If you are citizen but if
they take away your green card

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.160
or take away your citizenship
or records.

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:46.290
So basically you are nothing.

01:32:46.290 --> 01:32:47.590
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Thank you.

01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:49.360
&gt;&gt; So we are [inaudible] studies.

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.660
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: No.

01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:53.090
It's interesting, isn't it,
because we have the aspiration

01:32:53.090 --> 01:32:55.430
to equal protection, and
I'll say a little bit

01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:58.010
about what is equal protection
[inaudible] in a moment.

01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:59.760
We have an aspiration
to equal protection,

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:03.470
but every political community
falls short of its aspirations.

01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:06.630
And this one is no exception.

01:33:06.630 --> 01:33:10.000
Equal protection was originally
set up to deal with issues of race,

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.490
but it's now into certainly
much, much broader sense.

01:33:12.490 --> 01:33:16.150
But even with regard to the
racial core of equal protection,

01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:21.340
this country, like many other
countries, has seen a gap

01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:24.590
between the aspiration
and the reality.

01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:25.890
Now that's the first point.

01:33:25.890 --> 01:33:28.470
The second point is
about the aspiration.

01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:32.250
And equal protection in the United
States' Constitutional Scheme is

01:33:32.250 --> 01:33:35.920
equal protection of persons, not
equal protection of citizens.

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:39.150
No person shall be denied the
equal protection of the law.

01:33:39.150 --> 01:33:42.180
So it applies to me,
it applies to you

01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:44.150
if you're a citizen
of the United States.

01:33:44.150 --> 01:33:49.040
It even, in many respects,
applies to undocumented aliens

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:51.750
who may not be denied,
say, police protection,

01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:54.300
or the protection of the laws.

01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:59.130
So, at the level of the aspiration,
the Constitutional rights connoted

01:33:59.130 --> 01:34:03.360
by equal protection, maybe with the
exception of the vote and the right

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:07.660
to remain, are entirely
equal as opposed to --

01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:11.890
as regards different categories
or our right to be here.

01:34:11.890 --> 01:34:16.200
But the reality, as you've
indicated, falls far short of that,

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:20.260
and not just on the citizenship
dimension, but even with regard

01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:22.900
to people whose right to
citizenship here is indubitable.

01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:25.540
Oh there's been massive
failures of equal protection,

01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:30.220
but we work as hard as we can
to remedy those through law.

01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:31.900
&gt;&gt; But it's broken.

01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:33.200
The [inaudible] regardless.

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.500
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: Certainly the --

01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:37.260
&gt;&gt; The school district and
other places broken [inaudible].

01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:38.560
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: They are indeed.

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:40.300
And so there's no guarantee
that it's --

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:43.860
you know, that the inequality
is getting less and less.

01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:46.280
Once you have a failure
of the aspiration,

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:49.270
the failure can get worse or
the failure can get better.

01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:53.300
But good-hearted people are
trying to work on it as well as --

01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:55.250
as well as undermining it.

01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:56.550
&gt;&gt; Not so effectively.

01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:57.850
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron:
Not so effectively.

01:34:57.850 --> 01:34:59.810
But it would be a pity
to use that as a way

01:34:59.810 --> 01:35:02.520
of discrediting the aspiration.

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:06.660
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: At this
point, if everyone can agree,

01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:12.780 position:56%
I think we should all move down to
the Madison Hall and perhaps if some

01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:16.670
of you still would like to talk
to the Professor and he's still

01:35:16.670 --> 01:35:18.560
with us, you're welcome
to talk to him.

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:19.960
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Waldron: I'll be
here and I'll have a glass

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:21.620
of wine in my hand [applause].

01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:25.870
Thank you very much indeed.

01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:29.530
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
