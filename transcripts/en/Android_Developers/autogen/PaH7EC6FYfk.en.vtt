is also just use some some estimation to

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:09.230
is also just use some some estimation to
 

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.650
is also just use some some estimation to
reduce the frequency of your updates if

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:11.660
reduce the frequency of your updates if
 

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.910
reduce the frequency of your updates if
you know that it's going to be 15

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:12.920
you know that it's going to be 15
 

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.290
you know that it's going to be 15
minutes before you get to your

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:14.300
minutes before you get to your
 

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.150
minutes before you get to your
destination you don't need to check your

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160
destination you don't need to check your
 

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.660
destination you don't need to check your
location every five minutes yeah yeah

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:19.670
location every five minutes yeah yeah
 

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.680

the two implementations yeah so I think

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:31.430
the two implementations yeah so I think
 

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.850
the two implementations yeah so I think
the guys from Nevada

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:35.860
 

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.660
they put a vacation

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:40.670
 

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.519
library where they basically took Rito's

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:42.529
library where they basically took Rito's
 

00:11:42.529 --> 00:11:44.620

project so you can actually just listen

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:48.080
project so you can actually just listen
 

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.360

one I think as well from the guys from

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600
one I think as well from the guys from
 

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.440

quite so Stephano and quite I think use

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:56.450
quite so Stephano and quite I think use
 

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.100

so yeah I don't mean reaches post

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:04.490
so yeah I don't mean reaches post
 

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.490
so yeah I don't mean reaches post
specifically just the case of geofencing

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:06.500
specifically just the case of geofencing
 

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.560
specifically just the case of geofencing
and I wouldn't say having a service room

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:08.570
and I wouldn't say having a service room
 

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.030
and I wouldn't say having a service room
the whole time is really the best thing

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040
the whole time is really the best thing
 

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.410

you basically want your service advising

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:11.420
you basically want your service advising
 

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.660
you basically want your service advising
as possible it's not redoing any work so

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:13.670
as possible it's not redoing any work so
 

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.570
as possible it's not redoing any work so
you probably use a combination of the

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:15.580
you probably use a combination of the
 

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.740
you probably use a combination of the
combination of the passive location

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:17.750
combination of the passive location
 

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.890

you know grab locations whenever anyone

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:23.570
you know grab locations whenever anyone
 

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.000
you know grab locations whenever anyone
else fires application provider and also

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.010
else fires application provider and also
 

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.500
else fires application provider and also
notify your app with a passive provider

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:26.510
notify your app with a passive provider
 

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.200
notify your app with a passive provider
but then you know if you need to no need

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:29.210
but then you know if you need to no need
 

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.810
but then you know if you need to no need
to check the minimum interval every 15

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:31.820
to check the minimum interval every 15
 

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.750
to check the minimum interval every 15
20 minutes whatever use the in executive

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:34.760
20 minutes whatever use the in executive
 

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.060
20 minutes whatever use the in executive
repeating alarms as well you know I mean

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:37.070
repeating alarms as well you know I mean
 

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.760
repeating alarms as well you know I mean
I'm totally confused as to why they need

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:39.770
I'm totally confused as to why they need
 

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.500
I'm totally confused as to why they need
to have a service running all the time

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:41.510
to have a service running all the time
 

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.180
to have a service running all the time
as well that's kind of the whole point

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:43.190
as well that's kind of the whole point
 

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.770
as well that's kind of the whole point
for activity alerts you're kind of

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:44.780
for activity alerts you're kind of
 

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.480
for activity alerts you're kind of
waiting for something to kick off then

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:46.490
waiting for something to kick off then
 

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.070
waiting for something to kick off then
you do something rather than have it

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:48.080
you do something rather than have it
 

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.480
you do something rather than have it
invent one yeah so I think in in

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:52.490
invent one yeah so I think in in
 

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:53.800
invent one yeah so I think in in
practice right from the start there's

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:53.810
practice right from the start there's
 

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:54.880
practice right from the start there's
something that maybe we're not

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:54.890
something that maybe we're not
 

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.310
something that maybe we're not
understanding or actually need to just

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.320
understanding or actually need to just
 

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.090
understanding or actually need to just
read think about it in different way is

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:01.100
read think about it in different way is
 

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.410
read think about it in different way is
the idea of having service running on

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:02.420
the idea of having service running on
 

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.840
the idea of having service running on
time just scares me and love them

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:04.850
time just scares me and love them
 

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:10.659
time just scares me and love them
Yeah right maybe running a service all

00:13:10.659 --> 00:13:10.669
Yeah right maybe running a service all
 

00:13:10.669 --> 00:13:12.539
Yeah right maybe running a service all
the time if you're doing something like

00:13:12.539 --> 00:13:12.549
the time if you're doing something like
 

00:13:12.549 --> 00:13:15.549
the time if you're doing something like
opportunistic you know a location

00:13:15.549 --> 00:13:15.559
opportunistic you know a location
 

00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:19.150
opportunistic you know a location
matching say where am I now and what

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:19.160
matching say where am I now and what
 

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.549
matching say where am I now and what
points of interests are near me you know

00:13:21.549 --> 00:13:21.559
points of interests are near me you know
 

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:22.900
points of interests are near me you know
sort of like the field trip app or

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:22.910
sort of like the field trip app or
 

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.400
sort of like the field trip app or
something like that maybe then it makes

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:24.410
something like that maybe then it makes
 

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.439
something like that maybe then it makes
a little bit more sense yeah yeah but

00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:26.449
a little bit more sense yeah yeah but
 

00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:27.489
a little bit more sense yeah yeah but
you know then we put in location the

00:13:27.489 --> 00:13:27.499
you know then we put in location the
 

00:13:27.499 --> 00:13:28.779
you know then we put in location the
whole time right you want the service to

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:28.789
whole time right you want the service to
 

00:13:28.789 --> 00:13:30.340
whole time right you want the service to
stop itself as soon as you stop doing

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:30.350
stop itself as soon as you stop doing
 

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:31.629
stop itself as soon as you stop doing
any work and you know the schedule

00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:31.639
any work and you know the schedule
 

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:34.569
any work and you know the schedule
itself to be woken up again after after

00:13:34.569 --> 00:13:34.579
itself to be woken up again after after
 

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:37.150
itself to be woken up again after after
a period and then stop it up right yeah

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.160
a period and then stop it up right yeah
 

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.619
a period and then stop it up right yeah
I mean I guess you also get to a point

00:13:38.619 --> 00:13:38.629
I mean I guess you also get to a point
 

00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:40.299
I mean I guess you also get to a point
where you want to use like the cell

00:13:40.299 --> 00:13:40.309
where you want to use like the cell
 

00:13:40.309 --> 00:13:41.829
where you want to use like the cell
tower location is just a rough guide

00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839
tower location is just a rough guide
 

00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:44.829
tower location is just a rough guide
wait for that to change sort of try and

00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839
wait for that to change sort of try and
 

00:13:44.839 --> 00:13:46.419
wait for that to change sort of try and
listen listen off the pass of things and

00:13:46.419 --> 00:13:46.429
listen listen off the pass of things and
 

00:13:46.429 --> 00:13:49.179
listen listen off the pass of things and
if you need more fine-grained GPS then

00:13:49.179 --> 00:13:49.189
if you need more fine-grained GPS then
 

00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:51.969
if you need more fine-grained GPS then
start thinking about how you can sort of

00:13:51.969 --> 00:13:51.979
start thinking about how you can sort of
 

00:13:51.979 --> 00:13:53.379
start thinking about how you can sort of
try and avoid it and when you do use it

00:13:53.379 --> 00:13:53.389
try and avoid it and when you do use it
 

00:13:53.389 --> 00:14:01.449
try and avoid it and when you do use it
use it sparingly yeah yeah

00:14:01.449 --> 00:14:01.459
use it sparingly yeah yeah
 

00:14:01.459 --> 00:14:03.219
use it sparingly yeah yeah

with the get view no you can you can add

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820
with the get view no you can you can add
 

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.419
with the get view no you can you can add
a new method to the simple cursor

00:17:41.419 --> 00:17:41.429
a new method to the simple cursor
 

00:17:41.429 --> 00:17:44.630
a new method to the simple cursor
adapter that you extend and then from

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640
adapter that you extend and then from
 

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.630
adapter that you extend and then from
that adapter you can get the position

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640
that adapter you can get the position
 

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.899
that adapter you can get the position
and check the tag and if the tag is the

00:17:50.899 --> 00:17:50.909
and check the tag and if the tag is the
 

00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:53.990
and check the tag and if the tag is the
same time you need from the cursor then

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000
same time you need from the cursor then
 

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.389
same time you need from the cursor then
you can update the view you understand

00:17:59.389 --> 00:17:59.399
you can update the view you understand
 

00:17:59.399 --> 00:18:01.820
you can update the view you understand
what I mean yeah of course the turn is

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:01.830
what I mean yeah of course the turn is
 

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.279
what I mean yeah of course the turn is
done yeah it's interesting as proposed

00:18:04.279 --> 00:18:04.289
done yeah it's interesting as proposed
 

00:18:04.289 --> 00:18:06.680
done yeah it's interesting as proposed
yeah yeah I think this is probably what

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:06.690
yeah yeah I think this is probably what
 

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.919
yeah yeah I think this is probably what
try to do that I instinctively code to

00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:09.929
try to do that I instinctively code to
 

00:18:09.929 --> 00:18:10.700
try to do that I instinctively code to
solve that problem

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:10.710
solve that problem
 

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:15.350
solve that problem
I just I I guess the way you're saying

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360
I just I I guess the way you're saying
 

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.789
I just I I guess the way you're saying
you don't know which item in the list

00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799
you don't know which item in the list
 

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:18.860
you don't know which item in the list
you want to update you need to find that

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:18.870
you want to update you need to find that
 

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.600
you want to update you need to find that
way of matching the two of which you do

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:20.610
way of matching the two of which you do
 

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.690
way of matching the two of which you do
in the adapter one way or the other but

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:23.700
in the adapter one way or the other but
 

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.430
in the adapter one way or the other but
yeah if you extend the simple cursor

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440
yeah if you extend the simple cursor
 

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.810
yeah if you extend the simple cursor
adapter then you can start doing a lot

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820
adapter then you can start doing a lot
 

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.760
adapter then you can start doing a lot
of this stuff and it's one of those

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:28.770
of this stuff and it's one of those
 

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:29.539
of this stuff and it's one of those
things where you have to code yourself

00:18:29.539 --> 00:18:29.549
things where you have to code yourself
 

00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:31.070
things where you have to code yourself
busy trying to be something outside of

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080
busy trying to be something outside of
 

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.230
busy trying to be something outside of
what the pre-built cursor or the

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240
what the pre-built cursor or the
 

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.720
what the pre-built cursor or the
pre-built adapters design today yeah

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:38.730
pre-built adapters design today yeah
 

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.180
pre-built adapters design today yeah
make sure you use the view holder design

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:41.190
make sure you use the view holder design
 

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.370
make sure you use the view holder design
oh yeah if you hold her and also use a

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:43.380
oh yeah if you hold her and also use a
 

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.310
oh yeah if you hold her and also use a
hash map or something for the faster

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320
hash map or something for the faster
 

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.740
hash map or something for the faster
using and then when you use the view

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:48.750
using and then when you use the view
 

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.100
using and then when you use the view
holder set the hash map tag to the same

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:52.110
holder set the hash map tag to the same
 

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.940
holder set the hash map tag to the same
view so you can find it faster yeah I am

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:55.950
view so you can find it faster yeah I am
 

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.470
view so you can find it faster yeah I am
I believe that this is the right

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480
I believe that this is the right
 

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.690
I believe that this is the right
solution I was just looking something to

00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.700
solution I was just looking something to
 

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.350
solution I was just looking something to
don't change

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360
don't change
 

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.019
don't change
all the structure don't change the

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:03.029
all the structure don't change the
 

00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:04.789
all the structure don't change the
simple cursor adapter with something

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799
simple cursor adapter with something
 

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:07.340
simple cursor adapter with something
else just looking for that is why the

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:07.350
else just looking for that is why the
 

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:11.539
else just looking for that is why the
custom adapter is there - can I have one

00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:11.549
custom adapter is there - can I have one
 

00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:14.570
custom adapter is there - can I have one
more question probably yeah

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:14.580
more question probably yeah
 

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.529
more question probably yeah

think we have a blog post coming out and
 

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.430
think we have a blog post coming out and
that's right yeah probably more

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440
that's right yeah probably more
 

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.379
that's right yeah probably more
information on it soon but uh my dad

00:23:49.379 --> 00:23:49.389
information on it soon but uh my dad
 

00:23:49.389 --> 00:23:50.820
information on it soon but uh my dad
details at hand but yeah the

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:50.830
details at hand but yeah the
 

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.139
details at hand but yeah the
implementation of secure random

00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:52.149
implementation of secure random
 

00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:54.840
implementation of secure random
has changed slightly and so if you were

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:54.850
has changed slightly and so if you were
 

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.190
has changed slightly and so if you were
making bad assumptions about how it

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:56.200
making bad assumptions about how it
 

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:01.619
making bad assumptions about how it
worked then okay thank you

00:24:01.619 --> 00:24:01.629
worked then okay thank you
 

00:24:01.629 --> 00:24:02.759

accept changing you to make but we have
 

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.210
accept changing you to make but we have
a real question sir and what did you

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220
a real question sir and what did you
 

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:15.169
a real question sir and what did you
suggest doing this time did we find that

00:24:15.169 --> 00:24:15.179
suggest doing this time did we find that
 

00:24:15.179 --> 00:24:17.600
suggest doing this time did we find that
the final solution how could we can work

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:17.610
the final solution how could we can work
 

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.750
the final solution how could we can work
around the problem over encryption in

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760
around the problem over encryption in
 

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.600
around the problem over encryption in
4.2 so if you have stopped working you

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:23.610
4.2 so if you have stopped working you
 

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.490
4.2 so if you have stopped working you
get completely fails on 4.2 then I guess

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:25.500
get completely fails on 4.2 then I guess
 

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.710
get completely fails on 4.2 then I guess
the temporary measure you could set a

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720
the temporary measure you could set a
 

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.440
the temporary measure you could set a
max SDK on your apk so that 4.2 users

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:30.450
max SDK on your apk so that 4.2 users
 

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.419
max SDK on your apk so that 4.2 users
can't download it would be one way to do

00:24:32.419 --> 00:24:32.429
can't download it would be one way to do
 

00:24:32.429 --> 00:24:37.220
can't download it would be one way to do
it until you fix the bug okay we'll try

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:37.230
it until you fix the bug okay we'll try
 

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:40.340

question and so generally an Android
 

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.620
question and so generally an Android
application is I use like there's like

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:57.630
application is I use like there's like
 

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.840
application is I use like there's like
one user application at install time you

00:25:59.840 --> 00:25:59.850
one user application at install time you
 

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.610
one user application at install time you
can have that's not quite true you can

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:01.620
can have that's not quite true you can
 

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.900
can have that's not quite true you can
actually share the user ID between

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:02.910

an application and a single process
which is round at the end so when you

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:10.650
which is round at the end so when you
 

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:12.830
which is round at the end so when you
when your application starts and yeah

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840
when your application starts and yeah
 

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.020
when your application starts and yeah
the process is started it's folks from

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:15.030
the process is started it's folks from
 

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.760

so then yeah but then you have a many
 

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:30.470
so then yeah but then you have a many
many different ways which you can be

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480
many different ways which you can be
 

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.820

multitasking after that so when you ask

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:31.830
multitasking after that so when you ask
 

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.200
multitasking after that so when you ask
what happens to work of threads in the

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:33.210
what happens to work of threads in the
 

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.030
what happens to work of threads in the

pool during some network queries and
 

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.410
pool during some network queries and
that's kind of an open-ended question it

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:36.420
that's kind of an open-ended question it
 

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.760
that's kind of an open-ended question it
depends how you create those words

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:37.770
depends how you create those words
 

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:38.870
depends how you create those words
meaning if you're talking about async

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880
meaning if you're talking about async
 

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:43.010
meaning if you're talking about async
tasks which I suspect you might be then

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:43.020
tasks which I suspect you might be then
 

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.960
tasks which I suspect you might be then
those threads will continue to

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:44.970
those threads will continue to
 

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.600
those threads will continue to
completion but then they won't really

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:47.610
completion but then they won't really
 

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:52.700
completion but then they won't really
have a context anywhere but if you you

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:52.710
have a context anywhere but if you you
 

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:53.810
have a context anywhere but if you you
know go do your own things like you're

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:53.820
know go do your own things like you're
 

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.250
know go do your own things like you're
going to create a thread itself or if

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260
going to create a thread itself or if
 

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.600
going to create a thread itself or if
you're going to use an executor service

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:56.610
you're going to use an executor service
 

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.500
you're going to use an executor service
or an intent service and loaders or any

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:00.510
or an intent service and loaders or any
 

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:02.810
or an intent service and loaders or any
of these good things then then you can

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820
of these good things then then you can
 

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.380
of these good things then then you can
have these tasks that persist the

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:05.390
have these tasks that persist the
 

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.190
have these tasks that persist the
destruction of your activity and mean

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200
destruction of your activity and mean
 

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.620
destruction of your activity and mean
creation of the object and so it's kind

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:09.630
creation of the object and so it's kind
 

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.110
creation of the object and so it's kind
of an open-ended question yeah async

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120
of an open-ended question yeah async
 

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.410
of an open-ended question yeah async
tasks it's convenient but not always the

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:15.420
tasks it's convenient but not always the
 

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.910
tasks it's convenient but not always the
right answer to your to your problem

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:16.920
right answer to your to your problem
 

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.590
right answer to your to your problem
take a look at some other stuff like mmm

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600
take a look at some other stuff like mmm
 

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.260
take a look at some other stuff like mmm
intent services and handler friends and

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:21.270
intent services and handler friends and
 

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:26.390
intent services and handler friends and
other such mechanisms as well and don't

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:26.400
other such mechanisms as well and don't
 

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.260
other such mechanisms as well and don't
need your activities so I hope your

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:30.270
need your activities so I hope your
 

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:35.060
need your activities so I hope your
question right my course that's where my

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:35.070
question right my course that's where my
 

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.660
question right my course that's where my
sort of icing on that cake is is if you

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:38.670
sort of icing on that cake is is if you
 

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:42.169
sort of icing on that cake is is if you
are going to run an async task either

00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179
are going to run an async task either
 

00:27:42.179 --> 00:27:44.419
are going to run an async task either
make sure that you don't rely on

00:27:44.419 --> 00:27:44.429
make sure that you don't rely on
 

00:27:44.429 --> 00:27:47.060

quite famous open-source project we have

00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:22.120
quite famous open-source project we have
 

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:26.490
quite famous open-source project we have
more than 200,000 downloads and so we

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:26.500
more than 200,000 downloads and so we
 

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.740
more than 200,000 downloads and so we
can go and help us to develop it and to

00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:28.750
can go and help us to develop it and to
 

00:54:28.750 --> 00:55:02.900
can go and help us to develop it and to
test it for us

00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:07.010
we have three hunting members but I

00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:07.020
we have three hunting members but I
 

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:21.330
we have three hunting members but I
don't think they're all it's a good

00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:21.340
don't think they're all it's a good
 

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:32.940
don't think they're all it's a good
amount and everywhere so so himself

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:32.950
amount and everywhere so so himself
 

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:35.640
amount and everywhere so so himself
of course they apps to them and but

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:35.650
of course they apps to them and but
 

00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:38.370
of course they apps to them and but
there are a lot of one one-man show in

00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:38.380
there are a lot of one one-man show in
 

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:42.120
there are a lot of one one-man show in
which around the Netherlands over in

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:42.130
which around the Netherlands over in
 

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:45.800
which around the Netherlands over in
East and South also and we tend to

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:45.810
East and South also and we tend to
 

00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:48.960
East and South also and we tend to
observe them all but I think if you say

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:48.970
observe them all but I think if you say
 

00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:50.660
observe them all but I think if you say
we're going to have something about NFC

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:50.670
we're going to have something about NFC
 

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:53.040
we're going to have something about NFC
we have it in there ain't open it's a

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:53.050
we have it in there ain't open it's a
 

00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:58.650
we have it in there ain't open it's a
bit so it's good good thing yeah I'm

00:55:58.650 --> 00:55:58.660
bit so it's good good thing yeah I'm
 

00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:00.930

about the GCM one quick question

00:57:34.329 --> 00:57:34.339
about the GCM one quick question
 

00:57:34.339 --> 00:57:39.410
about the GCM one quick question
basically the Android model is that apps

00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.420
basically the Android model is that apps
 

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:41.839
basically the Android model is that apps
are to be put on the background you

00:57:41.839 --> 00:57:41.849
are to be put on the background you
 

00:57:41.849 --> 00:57:43.509
are to be put on the background you
press the home button and the app

00:57:43.509 --> 00:57:43.519
press the home button and the app
 

00:57:43.519 --> 00:57:45.890
press the home button and the app
continues to work until the system close

00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:45.900
continues to work until the system close
 

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:50.329
continues to work until the system close
it down and the process is successfully

00:57:50.329 --> 00:57:50.339
it down and the process is successfully
 

00:57:50.339 --> 00:57:53.180
it down and the process is successfully
terminated by the system if the user

00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:53.190
terminated by the system if the user
 

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:57.680
terminated by the system if the user
presses for stop then the GCM messaging

00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:57.690
presses for stop then the GCM messaging
 

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:01.609
presses for stop then the GCM messaging
won't work on the device that's what I

00:58:01.609 --> 00:58:01.619
won't work on the device that's what I
 

00:58:01.619 --> 00:58:09.259
won't work on the device that's what I
saw is it is that the designed framework

00:58:09.259 --> 00:58:09.269
saw is it is that the designed framework
 

00:58:09.269 --> 00:58:11.920
saw is it is that the designed framework
for the GCM to work on the not at all

00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:11.930
for the GCM to work on the not at all
 

00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:15.079
for the GCM to work on the not at all
yours actually running it so anyway from

00:58:15.079 --> 00:58:15.089
yours actually running it so anyway from
 

00:58:15.089 --> 00:58:17.720
yours actually running it so anyway from
verge of the system it should just be

00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:17.730
verge of the system it should just be
 

00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:18.829
verge of the system it should just be
going straight through to your broadcast

00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839
going straight through to your broadcast
 

00:58:18.839 --> 00:58:20.180
going straight through to your broadcast
receiver right and again picked up and

starting whichever parts your
application and needed to process the

00:58:22.519 --> 00:58:22.529
application and needed to process the
 

00:58:22.529 --> 00:58:25.130
application and needed to process the
message yeah but I'm not getting

00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:25.140
message yeah but I'm not getting
 

00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:26.079
message yeah but I'm not getting
anything

00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:26.089
anything
 

00:58:26.089 --> 00:58:28.490
anything
basically when I impress the for stop

00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:28.500
basically when I impress the for stop
 

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:33.349
basically when I impress the for stop
under settings which will unregistering

00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359
under settings which will unregistering
 

00:58:33.359 --> 00:58:34.160
under settings which will unregistering
from the service

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:34.170
from the service
 

00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:36.950
from the service
yeah I'm sure because the unregistering

00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960
yeah I'm sure because the unregistering
 

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:40.690
yeah I'm sure because the unregistering
from services only when the application

00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:40.700
from services only when the application
 

00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:44.599
from services only when the application
we have an exit button on our app that

00:58:44.599 --> 00:58:44.609
we have an exit button on our app that
 

00:58:44.609 --> 00:58:49.750
we have an exit button on our app that
keeps the device register to the GCM

00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760
keeps the device register to the GCM
 

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:53.500
keeps the device register to the GCM
well that's a bad thing anyway you have

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:53.510
well that's a bad thing anyway you have
 

00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:54.880
well that's a bad thing anyway you have
an exit button on your app that keeps

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:54.890
an exit button on your app that keeps
 

00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:56.920
an exit button on your app that keeps
that then closes the GCM connection did

00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:56.930
that then closes the GCM connection did
 

00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:59.140
that then closes the GCM connection did
you say no it doesn't close the GCM it

00:58:59.140 --> 00:58:59.150
you say no it doesn't close the GCM it
 

00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:02.560
you say no it doesn't close the GCM it
keeps the device registered and closes

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:02.570
keeps the device registered and closes
 

00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:04.930
keeps the device registered and closes
all the other stuff so the user

00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:04.940
all the other stuff so the user
 

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:07.480
all the other stuff so the user
basically doesn't see us on foreground

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:07.490
basically doesn't see us on foreground
 

00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:10.150
basically doesn't see us on foreground
or background we kill the service for

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160
or background we kill the service for
 

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.730
or background we kill the service for
the communication and everything

00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:11.740
the communication and everything
 

00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:15.430
the communication and everything
terminated and basically then you can

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440
terminated and basically then you can
 

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:20.170
terminated and basically then you can
get a GCM message but when I do the for

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:20.180
get a GCM message but when I do the for
 

00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:23.980
get a GCM message but when I do the for
stop on our app it basically stops

00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:23.990
stop on our app it basically stops
 

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:31.960
stop on our app it basically stops
sending delivering the GCM it is a

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:31.970
sending delivering the GCM it is a
 

00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:33.280
sending delivering the GCM it is a
slightly strange education people

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:33.290
slightly strange education people
 

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:34.540
slightly strange education people
shouldn't be hitting for stop on apps

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:34.550
shouldn't be hitting for stop on apps
 

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:37.300
shouldn't be hitting for stop on apps
yeah I know but basically you have users

00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:37.310
yeah I know but basically you have users
 

00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:39.070
yeah I know but basically you have users
the dual-tone they're gonna do it if

00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:39.080
the dual-tone they're gonna do it if
 

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.600
the dual-tone they're gonna do it if
they don't trust your application so it

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:40.610
they don't trust your application so it
 

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:42.220
they don't trust your application so it
seems more like an app issue that if

00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:42.230
seems more like an app issue that if
 

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:43.540
seems more like an app issue that if
you've got users hitting full stop on

00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:43.550
you've got users hitting full stop on
 

00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:45.130
you've got users hitting full stop on
your application they're doing it for

00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:45.140
your application they're doing it for
 

00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:47.020
your application they're doing it for
the exact reason that they want to stop

00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:47.030
the exact reason that they want to stop
 

00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:48.730
the exact reason that they want to stop
it popping up all these messages and

00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:48.740
it popping up all these messages and
 

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.590
it popping up all these messages and
it's their only way probably know

00:59:50.590 --> 00:59:50.600
it's their only way probably know
 

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:55.390
it's their only way probably know
basically I'm more paranoid than most

00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:55.400
basically I'm more paranoid than most
 

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:58.900
basically I'm more paranoid than most
people so basically when I use the phone

00:59:58.900 --> 00:59:58.910
people so basically when I use the phone
 

00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:01.480
people so basically when I use the phone
every time I don't have any things on

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:01.490
every time I don't have any things on
 

01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:04.420
every time I don't have any things on
the recent and I go to the settings and

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:04.430
the recent and I go to the settings and
 

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:06.630
the recent and I go to the settings and
just press or stop on all the

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640
just press or stop on all the
 

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.000
just press or stop on all the
applications kills broadcast as well

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:09.010
applications kills broadcast as well
 

01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:11.410
applications kills broadcast as well
best reception it'll be kind of a mac

01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:11.420
best reception it'll be kind of a mac
 

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.810
best reception it'll be kind of a mac
off period it's kind of full stuff and

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:13.820
off period it's kind of full stuff and
 

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:15.850
