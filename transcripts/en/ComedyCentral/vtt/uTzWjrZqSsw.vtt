&gt;&gt; YES, I DID.

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:15.041 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, I DIDN'T.

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:16.275 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:20.213 line:91%
FIRST QUESTION, IS ANYONE HIGH? 
LET'S GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.247 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:39.198 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND NOW YOU ARE A NEURO

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:42.768 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE YOU
HAVE TO BE HIGH TO MAKE UP THAT

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:43.869 align:start position:0% line:91%
TITLE. SO YOU SPECIALIZE IN
THIS.

00:01:43.902 --> 00:01:46.539 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE WE READY FOR MARIJUANA TO BE
LEGALIZED NATIONALLY.

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:48.007 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ARE WE READY FOR THAT?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.009 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE
QUESTIONS WHEN WE SAY ARE WE

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:50.710 align:start position:0% line:85%
READY?

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:51.978 line:85%
&gt;&gt; ARE WE READY TO HANDLE THAT?

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:55.181 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I KNOW IT IS A RIDICULOUS
QUESTION FOR ONE BECAUSE WHEN WE

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:59.552 line:91%
THINK ABOUT MARIJUANA, IT IS THE
SECOND MOST WIDELY USED PSYCHO

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:02.688 align:start position:0% line:91%
ACTIVE SUBSTANCE IN THE UNITED
STATES .. ALCOHOL BEING THE

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:03.622 align:start position:0% line:85%
FIRST.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.825 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND SO PEOPLE ARE ALREADY 
SMOKING MARIJUANA.

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:07.093 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT IS NOT A MATTER OF WHETHER WE
ARE READY.

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:11.330 line:91%
IT IS A MATTER OF, ARE WE READY
TO EDUCATE PEOPLE HOW TO DO THIS

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:14.100 align:start position:0% line:91%
SAFELY, AND THAT'S WHAT IS, THAT
SHOULD BE THE QUESTION.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.869 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE WORST THAT CAN
HAPPEN FROM PEOPLE USING

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:17.536 align:start position:0% line:85%
MARIJUANA?

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.472 line:85%
&gt;&gt; LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.707 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU CLEAN YOUR BATHROOM,
THAT'S IT.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.608 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; CLEAN YOUR BATHROOM REALLY
WELL.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.143 line:85%
&gt;&gt; CLEAN OUT YOUR REFRIGERATOR.

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:25.044 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:26.546 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.814 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET ME GET THE SCIENTIFIC
APPROACH FIRST.

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:31.784 line:91%
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF
ONE OF THE WORST THINGS YOU CAN

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:32.485 align:start position:0% line:85%
HAPPEN.

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:34.187 line:85%
YOU SAY WE HAVE BROWNIES THERE.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.421 size:75% position:38% line:85%
THEY MAY HAVE THC IN IT.

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:36.689 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; POSSIBLY.

00:02:36.722 --> 00:02:39.926 line:91%
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT
CAN HAPPEN IS YOU DON'T TELL US

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.160 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE CONCENTRATION THAT IS IN
HERE.

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:44.030 line:91%
IF IT IS HIGH CONCENTRATION AND
PEOPLE TAKE TOO MUCH THEN THEY

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:48.968 line:91%
CAN GET INTO SOME TROUBLE, LIKE
INCREASED ANXIETY AND THINK THEY

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.904 line:91%
ARE DYING AND THINK THEY ARE
LOSING THEIR MIND A WIDE RANGE

00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:55.141 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF THINGS BUT WE CAN EASILY DEAL
WITH THOSE --

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.677 line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT ONE BROWNIE IS GOOD, BUT
TEN BROWNIES, THEY'RE GONNA BE

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.479 align:start position:0% line:91%
OBESE AND HIGH.
&gt;&gt; CAN I GIVE A TIP TO EVERYONE

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:05.718 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHO IS PARANOID? F YOU EVER
THINK YOU ARE DYING, YOU NEVER

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:08.354 align:start position:0% line:91%
DIE.  IT IS WHEN YOU DON'T THINK
YOU ARE DYING IS WHEN YOU GET

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:10.189 align:start position:0% line:85%
RUN OVER BY THE BUS.

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:13.259 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; EVERYONE WHO JUST THINKS THEY
ARE DYING NEVER ACTUALLY

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:14.460 size:78% position:39% line:85%
FULFILLS ON THAT PROMISE.

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:17.697 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT GOING TO FEEL LIKE
WHEN THIS BECOMES COMPLETELY

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.865 align:start position:0% line:85%
SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE?

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:21.367 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I AM FINE.  THIS IS WHAT I
WOULD LIKE TO.  I WOULD LIKE

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.174 line:91%
TO STOP THE DIALOGUE ABOUT POT
AND GAY MARRIAGE AND GET ON WITH

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:28.708 align:start position:0% line:85%
OUR LIVES.

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:32.745 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ARE THOSE RELATED?

00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:35.348 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF I ATE ENOUGH OF THOSE
BROWNIES, WE COULD BE MARRIED

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.516 align:start position:0% line:85%
I AM SAYING, NO.

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.988 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT WE
ARE DEBATING -- MY MOM WAS A

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:43.522 size:75% position:38% line:85%

&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, YEAH.

00:03:48.393 --> 00:03:52.965 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT I AM SAYING IS, THIS
DEBATE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 40

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:53.466 align:start position:0% line:85%
OR 50 YEARS NOW.

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:54.000 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: RIGHT.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:55.935 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; MORE THAN THAT.

00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:56.769 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; 1930S

00:03:56.802 --> 00:03:59.505 align:start position:0% line:91%

ISIS.

00:03:59.538 --> 00:04:00.005 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: RIGHT.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.707 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT IS JUST ME.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.612 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU CAN'T MOVE ON BECAUSE
THE LEGALIZATION AND

00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:08.814 line:91%
DECRIMINALIZATION, THAT IS TWO
SEPARATE ISSUES BECAUSE WHEN WE

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:13.252 line:91%
HAVE TO ACCEPT THE REALITY YOU
HAVE PLACES WHERE MARIJUANA IS

00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:16.522 line:91%
LEGAL BUT LIKE WASHINGTON, D.C.,
WHERE THEY JUST ENACTED IT, YOU

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:20.192 align:start position:0% line:91%
CAN ONLY DO IT IN YOUR OWN HOME,
YOU SHARE IT BUT NOT SELL IT,

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:24.664 line:91%
YOU CAN'T SMOKE IT IN YOUR CAR,
YOU CAN'T SMOKE IT IN PUBLIC, IT

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:28.534 line:91%
IS ILLEGAL, EVEN THOUGH THEY
LEGALIZED IT YOU CAN STILL BE

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:30.569 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARRESTED. IN CALIFORNIA IS
DIFFERENT BECAUSE WHAT THEY DID 

00:04:30.602 --> 00:04:35.808 align:start position:0% line:91%
VTHERE IS THEY SAID, IT IS
DECRIMINALIZE AND SIMPLY GIVE A 

00:04:35.841 --> 00:04:36.408 size:75% position:38% line:85%
FINE  AND NOT PROSECUTE.

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:37.910 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE REAL ISSUE.

00:04:37.943 --> 00:04:40.346 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE ARE TALKING ABOUT YOUNG

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.081 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:44.283 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: EXACTLY.

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:48.120 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND NOW, AND I KNOW WE SPEAK
IN CODE HERE, I AM HERE TO CUT

ABOUT THIS?

&gt;&gt; DON'T DO IT OUT OF AN APPLE.

00:05:16.281 --> 00:05:19.652 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.442 align:start position:0% line:91%

ILLEGAL AND MY PARENTS TOLD ME

&gt;&gt; THERE ARE 100,000 TOTAL

00:06:57.015 --> 00:07:00.352 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS MARIJUANA CAUSES WHITE
WOMEN TO SEEK SEXUAL RELATIONS

00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:06.392 align:start position:0% line:91%
WITH NEGROES, ENTERTAINERS AND
OTHERS.

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:11.797 align:start position:0% line:91%
DOES MARIJUANA MAKE WHITE
WOMEN WANT TO

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:12.832 align:start position:0% line:85%
HAVE SEX WITH NEGROES

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:16.836 align:start position:0% line:91%

THAT.

NOTHING WRONG WITH A WHITE WOMAN

ARE HIGH.

00:07:23.108 --> 00:07:23.709 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT IS THEIR RIGHT.

&gt;&gt; ONE SECOND. YOU POINT OUT

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:30.349 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THESE ANCILLARY  STATEMENTS
WHICH WE ALL LAUGH AT, BUT

00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:33.052 line:91%
AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAD
EQUALLY RIDICULOUS STATEMENTS,

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:36.922 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO AS WE THINK ABOUT MEDICINE
AND PEOPLE FROM MEDICINE 

00:07:36.955 --> 00:07:40.993 align:start position:0% line:91%
MAKING STATEMENTS ABOUT
MARIJUANA TODAY, RECALL WHAT

00:07:41.026 --> 00:07:44.497 line:91%
THEY WERE SAYING PREVIOUSLY, IT
IS THE SAME SORT OF INANE SORT

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.298 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF STATEMENTS THAT PEOPLE ARE
MAKING.

00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:49.368 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND, LARRY IF YOU ARE LOOK AT
THE DOCUMENTARY

00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:52.137 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE HOUSE I LIVE IN.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.874 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT IS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF THE WAR
ON DRUGS AND THE FACT OF THE

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:59.445 line:91%
MATTER IS, IN THIS COUNTRY, WE
TARGETED ASIANS WHEN IT CAME TO

00:07:59.478 --> 00:08:01.514 align:start position:0% line:91%
DRUGS, BECAUSE IT WAS A QUESTION
ON TAKING JOBS

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:02.482 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HEROIN.

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:04.250 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE TARGETED
AFRICAN-AMERICANS, SO THERE WAS

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:07.720 line:91%
ALWAYS A CONNECTION IN AMERICA
BETWEEN DRUG USE AND ECONOMICS

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:11.390 line:91%
AND THAT IS WHY THAT PARTICULAR
STATEMENT IS WHAT IT SPEAKS TO,

00:08:11.423 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS
WHOLE ISSUE OF MARIJUANA, IT HAS

00:08:14.593 --> 00:08:18.564 align:start position:0% line:91%
BEEN A WAY TO, JUST
SYSTEMATICALLY TARGET A GROUP OF

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:21.433 line:91%
PEOPLE AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE A
NUMBER OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:25.938 size:88% position:44% line:91%
JAIL AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN

WHITES GOING TO JAIL, THIS
MARIJUANA ISSUE NOW FORCES US TO

00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:34.446 line:91%
HAVE REALLY A WAR ON DRUG ISSUE,
A BROADER ISSUE THAT HAS TAKEN

HAVE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS THAT

00:08:37.449 --> 00:08:39.852 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE REALIZING WE CAN'T AFFORD TO
KEEP LOCKING PEOPLE UP.

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:43.022 line:91%
THAT'S THE BROADER ISSUE, NOT
HEY CAN I GET HIGH BUT CAN WE

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:45.457 align:start position:0% line:91%
KEEP LOCKING PEOPLE UP
WRONGFULLY AND DESTROYING OUR

BEGINNING ON LEGALIZING

MAJOR REASONS THAT IS DRIVING
