00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:03.737
As we go to our next game,
Chemistry Experiments.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.706
Chemistry Experiments.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.278
You know, one of the...
one of the weirdest parts

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.247
of any award shows
is the bizarre pairings

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.382
of the celebrity presenters.
For-for example, last night

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:17.284
at the Golden Globes,
which somehow was convinced

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.119
that <i>The Martian</i> is a comedy.
It's not really a comedy,

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.121
but (bleep) it, we got
Matt Damon on the show.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.423
Uh, they forced Ricky Gervais
and Mel Gibson

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:25.359
to share the stage, I guess
'cause of their mutual interest

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.562
in public intoxication.
Needless to say, these two

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:32.533
had worse chemistries than
a Me-Mexican meth lab, so...

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:36.003
If that wasn't awkward enough,
they also had Magic Mike present

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.972
with the bear
who raped Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.444
So comedians,
as an award show announcer,

00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:46.647
I would like you
to announce weirder couplings

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.615
who should give awards
at the next Golden Globes

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.517
in 60 seconds, and begin.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:51.852
Jackie.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:55.022
Uh, please welcome
Sean Penn and El Chapo.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.557
All right, points.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.925
That's real,
that really happened!

00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.226
Pete Holmes.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.495
Please welcome,
from Tony! Toni! Toné!,

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.664
Tony and Toni.
Toné couldn't make it.

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:05.332
Points. Genius.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:07.801
Thank you for making
a Tony! Toni! Toné! reference.

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:09.236
See, they all spell
the "Tony" differently,

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.171
that's how it works.
Points. Jackie.

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:13.640
Uh, please welcome Donald Trump
and a copy of the Koran.

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:14.675
Points.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.210
Brett.

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:19.479
Please welcome Bill Cosby
and his wife Camille.

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:20.814
All right, points.

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:23.016
Pete Holmes.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.485
Please welcome Paula Deen
and DMX.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.087
Yeah. Points. Pete Holmes.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.890
Please welcome Chris Hardwick
and a BB-8 that he's (bleep).

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.893
-Yes! So, BB-8.
-(buzzer sounds)

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.228
I could get that.

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:36.763
I could totally get that.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.804
-Huh. A moment.
-♪ I'm waiting -You know,

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:46.940
sometimes you just... you just
got a chemistry with someone.

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:50.277
-You know? I'm... What?
-WOMAN: Oh, my God.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.947
Somebody's really getting off
on you (bleep) a BB-8 out there.

00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:56.216
Oh, sorry,
that's also a spoiler.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.553
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:01.488
Yeah.

00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:04.691
It's, uh...

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:08.028
uh... BB-8 out, uh, by me.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:08.128
-By me.
-Oh, nice.
