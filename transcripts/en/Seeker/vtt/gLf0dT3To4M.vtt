00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.380
Not long ago, I got in an argument on twitter
about whether the International Space Station

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.920
is in space or in the atmosphere…

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.940
I mean, it’s called the International Space
Station -- so of course it is!

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.940
Right?

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.660
Or… maybe… maybe it’s not.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.130
It seems like a simple question, space starts
at 100 kilometers.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.800
That’s the Karman Line.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.300
The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale’s
demarcation of where space begins.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.450
Then, I reached out to NASA and they confirmed
it.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.600
Yes, internationally, the Karman line equals
space!

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.609
I was right!

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.120
The ISS is in space.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.720
But, my twitter fighter was also right.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.530
See, the Karman line is actually still in
the atmosphere.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.149
In the thermosphere, actually.

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.940
See, NASA spokesperson Dan Huot told me from
a physical science’s perspective, [quote]

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.469
“there is no hard-definable point where
space begins… the atmosphere just gradually

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.210
decreases the higher you get.”

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.659
So, where does space start, really?

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.569
Let’s do this graphically:
We are at the bottom of Earth’s atmosphere

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:59.569
here.

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:00.569
In the troposphere.

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:05.210
This is where regular clouds appear, where
weather happens… mount everest, everything.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.670
The troposphere contains about 75 to 80 percent
of all the atoms that make up our blanket

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.680
of air.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.890
Above that, practically speaking, there are
three more layers of atmosphere.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.829
The stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.229
The stratosphere is where the ozone layer
is, where planes fly, and where we sent that

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.600
360 cam on a weather balloon last year (it’s
awesome).

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.310
At the top of that layer the pressure is less
than 1 percent of ground level.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.040
You’re above more than 99 percent of the
atmosphere and we’re only at layer TWO -- we’re

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.840
still hundreds of miles from the International
Space Station.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.390
The mesosphere is next this is where meteors
burn up -- they’re moving ridiculously fast,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.659
so even though there’s almost no actual
air -- they hit a lot of it in a short time.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.570
But there’s still the thermosphere, where
x-rays and UV are absorbed and where aurora

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.570
manifest.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.609
The air is hot, but there’s so little of
it you’d still feel cold.

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.289
Molecules of air so rarely meet when they
do, they naturally sort themselves by type!

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.070
Even though we’re calling these things atmosphere
-- there’s not much atmo at all.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.269
The thermosphere extends hundreds and hundreds
of miles.

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.340
And is why this argument started.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.780
The space shuttle, ISS, and some low-orbit
satellites do fly in the thermosphere!

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.610
But they’re in a near vacuum.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.660
There’s almost no air at all… less than
point-0001 percent of the atmosphere exists

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.660
there.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.730
And yet, we’re not done.There’s another
layer.The exosphere.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.730
That same NASA spokesperson told me the shuttle
missions started pre-atmospheric entry at

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.730
122km (400,000 ft).

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.900
That’s not even in the thermosphere -- but
a FIFTH LAYER: THE EXOSPHERE.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.900
THAT’S RIGHT

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.140
Even though the thermosphere is a vacuum,
it’s definitely space, the exosphere is

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.180
considered an atmospheric layer by NASA and
some scientists.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.409
Basically, because it’s where the sun’s
rays overpower Earth’s gravity and move

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.860
particles around.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:57.910
But it is huge, extending 190,000 km or halfway
to the moon. On top of that, when the Earth

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.299
is in between the moon and sun, the solar
wind pushes particles from our atmosphere

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.080
onto the lunar surface along a tail -- called
the plasma sheet.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.420
Bits of Earth’s atmosphere can be thrown
so far it is on the moon.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.430
It’s pretty insane.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.580
Okay, to wrap it up.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.330
In nature, things aren’t binary.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.560
Where does the ocean end…?

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.780
At the beach?

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.019
The beach is a gradient.

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.640
The water goes back and forth, there are tides
and weather…

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.030
So, where does our atmosphere end?

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.160
Not sure.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.920
Where does space start?

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.920
The Karman Line.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.970
100 Kilometers.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:32.970
Why?

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.120
Because it had to start somewhere.

Space is part of nature, which means it’s
complicated and doesn’t always fit into

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.269
clean little boxes.

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.269
We have to tweak it.

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.810
For example, do you know what space actually
looks like?

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.120
Chances are, you don’t, because space pics
are usually fake.
