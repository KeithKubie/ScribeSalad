00:00:02.829 --> 00:00:04.370
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: So
I thought that we

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.950
would start by talking
about this day,

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.120
and how you got involved with
global climate and things

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.180
having to do with the
International Day of Happiness.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.290
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Well,
there's so many parts of it.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:25.670
I got invited back in
'07, 7/7/07 by the way,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.480
by Al Gore and Kevin Wall,
to be a part of Live Earth.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.760
Which was this movement, and
is this movement, about climate

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.960
change, the effects
of global warming,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.290
another issue--
people's denial of it.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.050
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Big time.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.190
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: And I
found myself just really

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.520
being concerned.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.317
And once you realize the
gravity of the situation,

00:00:54.317 --> 00:00:55.900
I found myself being
really concerned.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.040
And so we put on this concert.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.660
And we had different people
and different kinds of--

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.470
LYNN HIRSCHBERG:
This was back in '07?

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.120
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Yes, in '07.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.995
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Wow.

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:09.820
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: And we
sang for climate change.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.180
And this time we're
doing it, we'd

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.420
like to have a billion
signatures or more.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.150
Because there's seven
billion people on the planet.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.430
And we have the reach now.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.050
So for me, I think
my contribution to it

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.674
is just-- I was the creative
director the first time.

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:32.840
They're making me creative
director the second time.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.630
I just want music.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.935
And I just want to
literally have harmony.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.917
I want humanity to harmonize.

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:46.333
I was going to say
it differently,

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.000
but it wasn't coming out right.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.375
LYNN HIRSCHBERG:
And that's going

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.710
to take place-- today is the
day you're announcing that.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.280
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Yes.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.238
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: I see.

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:56.550
And were you familiar with
International Happiness Day?

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.020
Was this something
you knew about

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.350
before you wrote the song?

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.940
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
I didn't know.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.440
No.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.560
I didn't know.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.144
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Because I
never heard about it until this.

00:02:06.144 --> 00:02:08.560
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: I didn't
know for a short while either.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.940
And then it was like,
yeah, there's a day.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:19.100
And actually, one of our
buddies from Virgin-- excuse me.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.567
Did I really do that?

00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:22.900
I'll tell you why I said Virgin.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.700
It's because a lot of the crew
that are at Columbia Records

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.480
now are from the original
crew of Virgin Records.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.140
And so one of the guys there
had a really good idea,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.770
when speaking to
the UN, of this idea

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.674
of merging the two intentions
together-- the intention

00:02:41.674 --> 00:02:44.090
of the song "Happy" and the
intention of the International

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.900
Day of Happiness.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.279
And somehow we ended up
here in this great place.

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:49.320
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Exactly.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.830
Well, let's talk a little
bit about the song "Happy."

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.490
One of the things that interests
me about the song "Happy"

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.820
is that not only does it say
happy, but it sounds happy.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.240
Was that your intention
when you wrote it,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.740
to make a song that
actually elicits happiness?

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.580
When you put that
song on, I don't

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.620
care if you've heard it two
million times, you feel happy.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.550
As opposed to just
the word happy.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.740
Because other songs could say
love, you don't feel love.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.850
So there's this amazing
synergy of the lyric,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.850
the music, the whole
feel of the event of it.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.860
I will confide that my dog
even responds to the song.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.720
He starts wagging his tail
every time it comes on.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.100
He just gets happy.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.668
Was that part of what you had
in mind when you created it?

00:03:39.668 --> 00:03:40.584
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: No.

00:03:40.584 --> 00:03:42.539
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:44.580
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: I thought
I was on to something,

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.705
but apparently not.

00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:48.330
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
OK, well yes and no.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.360
Yes in the sense
that I was trying

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.450
to meet the expectations
of the director.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.880
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: This was
created for the animated movie.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.755
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Yeah,
for "Despicable Me."

00:04:00.755 --> 00:04:03.020
In the script and
the actual moments,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.790
I was trying to
connect that emotion.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.280
But I did not know that it
was going to turn into this.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.320
I did not know that I would
be here today doing this.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.000
I did not know that when you
look at the views collectively,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.310
what those numbers look like.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.640
I never realized
ever, or dreamt ever,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.940
that a song could do this.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.200
And part of watching
it happen is

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.654
when you realize it's not you.

00:04:34.654 --> 00:04:35.320
It's the people.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.320
I'm sure you guys have
heard me say this before.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.900
But it's the countless numbers.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.780
It's the numbers of the people.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.080
It's their activity that turned
that song into what it is.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.732
It's actually their song now.

00:04:46.732 --> 00:04:47.940
They sang it more than I did.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.910
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: I think
it's all of your song.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.790
But that was interesting, too.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.000
Because the initial idea
for the video incorporated

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.530
all these people.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.230
Was that in your
head at the time,

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.040
that the song would have that
kind of unifying approach?

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.074
Or did that just
come about because it

00:05:04.074 --> 00:05:06.490
was cool to have all these
different people sing the song?

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.906
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
We didn't know.

00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:09.790
We didn't know that that
was going to happen.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.780
And when it did, it just
kind of like caught fire.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.365
And we were just like, whoa.

00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:19.990
Because that's when
you realize it just

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.250
has nothing to do
with you anymore.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.250
I'm telling you, that's
the most humbling thing.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.780
Something that you do,
when you're no longer even

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.710
a part of it anymore
and it just goes on

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.820
and takes on a life of its own.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:42.434
There's no greater version of
being humble to me than that.

00:05:42.434 --> 00:05:44.100
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: But
what's cool is also

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.850
what Google has done
with this Happiness

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.720
Project, the Happy
Planet Project,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.880
is basically make
it even bigger.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.620
So they're
incorporating both what

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.130
you're talking about with
global warming, and the song.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.030
It's taking on different
ramifications all the time,

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.560
which is kind of amazing.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.310
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Yeah, again,
I can't believe I'm here.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.360
But it's awesome.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.460
And Live Earth is something
that we want everyone

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.830
to participate in.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.080
It's really honestly
like a global party.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.580
LYNN HIRSCHBERG:
But tell the story,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.580
because I think it's so
interesting and actually

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.500
kind of educational, and
makes me always feel better,

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.150
about how long it took
for "Happy" to catch on.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.070
How the song was out--
anyway, you tell the story.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.930
Because the genesis of the
song is so interesting,

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.270
because the success of
it would indicate that it

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.140
was successful from the jump.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.540
And that's not what happened.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.290
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: No.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.150
The movie came out in July.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.200
And we went to radio with it.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.220
And it didn't sound
like anything else

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:42.990
that was going on.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.256
It wasn't the trap song.

00:06:45.256 --> 00:06:50.900
[LAUGHTER] And it
wasn't an EDM record.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.430
There was no
[SOUND OF HEAVY BASS BEAT]

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.090
[SOUND OF ELECTRONIC MUSIC]

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.870
You know, it wasn't that.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.060
They were like,
what is this record?

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.970
What are you doing?

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.210
I was just excited that
we were able to pull off

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.100
those kind of chord
progressions and something that

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.900
had to do with pop culture.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.410
So when it didn't go to
radio, it was like, oh yeah,

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.060
I didn't think it
was going to happen.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.564
But look, me and my wife, we're
going to go to the movies,

00:07:20.564 --> 00:07:21.730
and we're going to watch it.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.590
And this is actually
going to be in there.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.925
And that's enough for us.

00:07:24.925 --> 00:07:26.550
LYNN HIRSCHBERG:
That's so nice of you.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.610
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
That was enough.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.202
I remember us both tearing
up at the premiere.

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:32.910
And we were good.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.410
We were like, OK, cool.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.590
Done.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.004
And six months went by.

00:07:39.004 --> 00:07:40.170
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Six months.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.790
I think everyone
who does something

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:42.850
should think about that.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.225
No matter how
great something is,

00:07:44.225 --> 00:07:47.520
sometimes it doesn't
hit right away.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:54.970
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: And we were
like, we have to do a video.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.500
We have to.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.710
Karen who runs i am OTHER,
was like, we have to.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.360
We can't let this record go.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:01.940
We love it.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.830
And I was like,
yeah, I do love it.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.710
Because it felt good to us.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.050
Remember, we didn't think
it would have this effect.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.707
We just knew what
we felt internally.

00:08:09.707 --> 00:08:12.040
So we were like, let's just
take advantage of the moment

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.620
and just do it anyway.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.850
And then so Mimi
Valdes said, well

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.094
if you want this to
be considered and get

00:08:20.094 --> 00:08:22.010
that kind of light, you
should do exactly what

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.830
Gru was doing in the video.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.330
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Gru being the
character in "Despicable Me."

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:26.670
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Yes.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:27.240
I'm sorry.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.860
See, that's why we have
the professional here.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.610
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Just
for those of you who

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.314
don't go to "Despicable Me."

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:36.980
Which is no one in
this room, of course.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.880
Everyone's seen it.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.756
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: We shoot
the video I think in November,

00:08:46.756 --> 00:08:47.880
toward the end of November.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.425
I want to say like the week
of the 20th of November.

00:08:51.425 --> 00:08:53.280
We put it out.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.830
And it just exploded, the video.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.380
It just exploded.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.450
And we were like,
are you seeing this?

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.490
Is something wrong?

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.450
And then you go look
at the iTunes page

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.500
and you just see
all the countries.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.700
And I'm just like, what is that?

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.380
And from my perspective,
I'm a producer.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.090
So I'm definitely not expecting
anything like this to happen.

00:09:21.366 --> 00:09:22.740
And the look on
my face right now

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.780
is kind of like the way I felt.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.380
And I still feel that way.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.270
I really do.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:34.600
What that song did is that song
made me change my perspective.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:40.210
And now I feel like I make
music because it feels good.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.799
And that's the only
thing I want to do now.

00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:45.340
If it doesn't feel good, I don't
want anything to do with it.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.740
And it's not because I'm
trying to ever feel this again.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.640
Because "Happy"
is its own thing.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.910
But I just want to continue to
just explore different feelings

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:55.500
and thoughts.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.310
And I want them to
be vivid like that.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:05.164
And the song, after it
was done, showed me that.

00:10:05.164 --> 00:10:06.830
I didn't go into it
with that intention.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.550
Nor did I set out
to tell people that.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.670
But it told me that.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.240
So then that made me change.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.534
And it made me say to myself,
OK, now you can't go back.

00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:19.950
You know what this
feels like now.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.650
And not being the face of the
song, or singing the song.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.210
I'm saying, you know that
a song can feel this way.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.160
You can't.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.334
It has to be this way.

00:10:31.334 --> 00:10:33.500
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Did you
ever hear again from radio?

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.940
Do you remember the first
time you heard them playing it

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.920
in heavy rotation on the radio?

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.220
Because I felt
like that was so--

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.640
I love when a song feels
like it's everywhere.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.330
And that song just
was everywhere.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.121
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
Well, the beauty in that

00:10:47.121 --> 00:10:51.010
is that for a moment, radio
became like this monster

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.280
that people felt like they
had to conquer in order

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.420
to be a part of.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.014
And I have to say, it was the
DJs and the program directors,

00:10:58.014 --> 00:10:59.930
that when the song
actually did start working,

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.000
they would tell us, man, you
know what, we tried it at first

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.860
and it didn't work.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.080
But we're so happy for you.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.860
It does work.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.443
Man, you should see
when it does this.

00:11:06.443 --> 00:11:09.120
My daughter, my son,
my di da di da di.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.700
And if it weren't
for the radio DJs,

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.700
if it weren't for the
program directors,

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.270
and when they did get behind
it, they went full throttle.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.100
And I have to say,
if any of you guys

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.290
are listening in radio right
now, and program directors,

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:24.940
thank you.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.840
You have changed my life.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.130
You have changed my perspective.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:33.010
And I would argue and dare to
say that you've essentially

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.040
changed the world.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.140
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: I would agree.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.120
And here here.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.422
It's a good thing.

00:11:38.422 --> 00:11:44.410
[APPLAUSE] Today on the
radio when I came here,

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:50.297
the UN Secretary General, Ban
Ki-moon, he was praising you.

00:11:50.297 --> 00:11:51.880
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
He talked about it?

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.421
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: He
talked about you.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.010
And he talked about this day.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.550
[LAUGHTER] It was on the BBC.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.080
You can look it up.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.880
It was on BBC
Radio this morning.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.920
And I felt like, wow.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.140
I'm going, it's exciting.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:12.610
And he said that when
he is blue, to be happy,

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.190
he listens to music.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.040
And he said that the
thing he listens to most

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.800
is-- he said, of
course, "Happy."

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.770
But he also said, I'm an old man
and I listen to Stevie Wonder.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.710
So the question
is, in your life,

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.570
what music has made you happy?

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.110
At different times in your
life, have you turned to music

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.180
to change your mood?

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.510
Or was there any particular
thing that just made your day

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.649
when you heard it?

00:12:40.649 --> 00:12:42.190
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
How serendipitous.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.380
It is Stevie Wonder.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.560
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Really?

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.790
Which particular-- "Songs
in the Key of Life"?

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:47.760
Any particular song?

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.218
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
There's so many.

00:12:49.218 --> 00:12:50.490
There's so many albums.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.160
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: You've got
to pick a song, like "Happy."

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.440
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: A song?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.559
It was tough to do that
when talking to him.

00:12:57.559 --> 00:12:58.350
We did the special.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:03.080
And also on Snoop's album, there
is a song with Stevie Wonder,

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.520
myself, and Snoop called
"California Roll."

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.360
You guys have to check it out.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.020
Because he's on there singing
and playing the harmonica,

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.145
and it's just unbelievable.

00:13:20.685 --> 00:13:22.810
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: You can
do it when you were young,

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:24.026
like when you were a kid.

00:13:24.026 --> 00:13:25.650
When something would
come on the radio,

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.780
what got you in the
mood, in a good mood.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.620
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: OK.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:37.070
Now, this is going to
sound very confusing.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.880
But when I was young,
I didn't really

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.210
know what all my emotions were.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.840
And I didn't realize that the
songs were making me emotional.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.900
I just realized that there
was a difference whenever

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.950
certain songs came on, and
chord changes would come.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:56.510
Different patterns would make
me feel a certain kind of way.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.950
And it would mostly happen
in Stevie Wonder songs.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.640
Or Earth Wind and Fire songs.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.090
It's those jazz progressions,
they mean everything.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.440
They just, they lift you.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.090
Ask Elton John, he knows.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:10.950
Chords do things.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.690
Chords are actually coordinates.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.800
Because they take you
to a different place.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.370
LYNN HIRSCHBERG:
But it's interesting

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:17.495
that you talk about chords.

00:14:17.495 --> 00:14:19.160
Because you started
out as a drummer.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.749
So you would think your
thing would be rhythm.

00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:23.290
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
It is at the core.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:29.270
But I think what really just
makes me move is chords.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.030
I don't know why.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.372
Chords and a melody is
just kind of like, oof.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.320
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: That's
why "Happy" works.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.600
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Man,
I'm just glad that it did.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.350
Because the thing is,
I was lucky enough

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.020
at the time to have CeeLo
on the song with me.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.950
And he sounded so amazing.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.200
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: I never
even knew he was on the song.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.199
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:55.730
CeeLo Green was on
there with me at first.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.680
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: He's
in the movie version?

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.490
There are two versions, right?

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.750
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: No, he's
actually on another song

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.860
that they elected
for him to be on.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.640
But he was on there
with me originally.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.900
And I have to tell you guys, he
sang it way better than I did.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.240
That's why-- I've even
brought it up, I was lucky.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.448
I'm like, man, if y'all
woulda heard CeeLo's version.

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:20.000
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: But you still
have to give me a Stevie Wonder

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.290
song.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.130
Just give me one.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.110
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: I
tried to get out of it.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.990
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Just pick one.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.534
"Signed, Sealed, Delivered"?

00:15:28.534 --> 00:15:30.200
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
Yeah, I mean, there's

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.660
"Signed, Sealed, Delivered,"
there's "Blame It on the Sun,"

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:43.910
there's "April Showers,"
"Don't Worry 'Bout a Thing,"

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.880
"Do I Do," "All I Do."

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.169
He's done it all.

00:15:49.169 --> 00:15:51.210
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: When you
meet somebody like him,

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:52.001
do you get nervous?

00:15:52.001 --> 00:15:56.299
Or is it just like you have
that common language of music?

00:15:56.299 --> 00:15:58.090
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: I'm
too busy paying them

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.302
compliments and taking notes.

00:16:00.302 --> 00:16:01.260
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: I see.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.330
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Yes.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.320
Because when you're
around masters,

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.540
like the abbot that
Stevie Wonder is,

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.320
when you're around
someone like that,

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.485
you listen to his
every utterance.

00:16:13.485 --> 00:16:15.580
Because you're lucky
to get that time.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.120
That guy has moved mountains.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.860
"I Just Called to
Say I Love You."

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.485
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Now
that's a good one.

00:16:22.485 --> 00:16:25.097
I think everyone loves--
see, everyone went awww.

00:16:25.097 --> 00:16:27.430
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Or "You
Are the Sunshine of My Life."

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:28.250
He's done this.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.634
He's done "Happy"
20 billion times.

00:16:30.634 --> 00:16:31.800
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Not really.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.580
I mean, he has.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.411
But the thing about
"Happy"-- he's

00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:36.550
done it in a different way.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.750
Those songs have a
different-- I think

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.440
because it's a different time.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.440
"Happy" has a certain
cohesive thing.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.580
It brings people together
in a different way.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.663
I think that was a different
time, when there were

00:16:48.663 --> 00:16:52.110
more songs on the radio and
things felt less-- "Happy"

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.950
feels very special in that way.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:57.230
It feels very-- even when you
do like five seconds of it

00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:00.420
on "The Voice," I get happy.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.327
When that girl-- in case
you guys didn't see it,

00:17:03.327 --> 00:17:04.910
there was one of the
girls auditioning

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:05.868
who was in high school.

00:17:05.868 --> 00:17:07.630
She didn't make the show.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.089
But Pharrell sang
"Happy" with her.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.000
And it was an incredible moment.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.109
You sort of changed that
girl's life in a second.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.109
It was great.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:16.670
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
Well, she changed mine.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.119
It made me get up.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:21.200
It was one of those things,
it's like, it's in the room.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.339
That's the thing.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:27.079
If we could just continue to
surrender to the things that

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:31.340
just feel just and
right, like what

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.999
you've got to do at that
moment, it'll be a better place.

00:17:35.999 --> 00:17:37.290
But that's what today is about.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:41.790
Today is about everyone
taking on the idea

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.540
that happiness is a
birthright to everyone.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.107
And so is freedom, by the way.

00:17:47.107 --> 00:17:47.940
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: OK.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.398
So that brings up
my next question.

00:17:49.398 --> 00:17:53.510
You have, correct me on the
word, synesthesia, right?

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.460
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: A
lot of musicians do.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.834
LYNN HIRSCHBERG:
Is there a color

00:17:56.834 --> 00:17:58.510
that you saw when
you did "Happy"?

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.900
You guys know what
synesthesia is, yes?

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.560
Explain synesthesia to them.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.260
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: OK.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:09.940
Here we go.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:18.010
All neuroscientists,
forgive me ahead of time

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.845
if I start to use words
that don't really fit.

00:18:21.845 --> 00:18:23.220
I'll start speaking
metaphorical.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.140
Which is a side
effect of synesthesia.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:32.790
So, synesthesia
is when your mind

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.800
sends ghost images to
other sensory departments

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.000
of the brain.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:45.150
So if you hear something,
because, in a sense-- OK,

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.990
don't hold me to this, because
this is the world watching.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.500
But in a sense, it's like
all of your nerve endings,

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.310
when you're born, they're
supposed to prune.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.329
And some of them stay connected.

00:18:55.329 --> 00:18:56.870
And so if your sight
and your hearing

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.730
are connected, then
if one sees something,

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.090
then it sends a ghost
image to the other one.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.350
So if I'm hearing
something in my mind

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.310
where the perception is,
my mind is telling me

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.720
that I'm seeing colors as well.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.360
But there's all
kinds of synesthesia.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.480
There are people who
actually taste colors.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:22.200
Or are there are
people who see sounds,

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:31.430
or people who can taste
feelings or smell a feeling.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:32.930
Or they smell a color.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.760
Like they smell purple and
it doesn't smell grape.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.379
It's pretty weird.

00:19:38.379 --> 00:19:39.420
A lot of artists have it.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.875
A lot of writers have it.

00:19:42.875 --> 00:19:45.070
A lot of artists have it,
just across the board.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:49.460
From fashion to architecture,
they will tell you.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:54.960
And it's no coincidence that
the blues is called the blues.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:02.750
Or bluegrass, there's definitely
colors associated with music.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:06.280
And the ROYGBIV, ironically,
just so your know,

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.810
it matches the keys,
the Western keys,

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:15.800
that we recognize--
the 12 notes.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.925
Those controversial things.

00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:18.591
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: So
when you were young,

00:20:18.591 --> 00:20:20.500
did this freak you out
that you saw colors?

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.110
Or did you just get into it?

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.340
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: I thought
everyone was like that.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.990
And a lot of people are, though.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.090
It's not rare.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:32.630
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: So
"Happy," what color?

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:33.737
Yellow, I guess.

00:20:33.737 --> 00:20:34.820
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Yellow.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.610
There's orange, and
there's like red.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.770
Those fiery colors.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.610
And I think it's
because of the nature

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:48.960
of like the jazzy, bluesy
colors in the chords--

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.640
chords in the chorus colors.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.630
And in the verses, it's major.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:21:01.040
So it's very church, and kind of
does that to you a little bit.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.390
Did I just describe that
in front of everybody?

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:05.920
And poorly, by the way.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.600
But that's why I see the
yellow and the orange and red.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.170
But they made "Happy" yellow,
obviously, behind the minions.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.360
And it fit perfectly.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.700
It feels bright.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.460
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: So
here's a question

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.543
I asked you before that
you had a great answer to.

00:21:19.543 --> 00:21:22.720
What are your five favorite
non-musical sounds?

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.096
Sounds that are not made
by a musical instrument.

00:21:27.096 --> 00:21:28.470
You don't remember
what you said?

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.809
You can give me one,
just give me one.

00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:32.350
Because I don't want
to pressure you.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.450
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: I'm
so afraid of what I said.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:34.750
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: You
said great things.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:35.688
You said great things.

00:21:39.204 --> 00:21:40.120
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: OK.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.411
Ask the question one more time.

00:21:41.411 --> 00:21:45.840
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Five-- one
favorite non-musical sound.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.400
Like champagne corks
popping, or a dog sighing,

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.900
or waves, or traffic, or--

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.720
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
My son's voice.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.985
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: There you go.

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:00.610
A lot of people say
their son laughing.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.180
Does your son have a good laugh?

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.278
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: He does.

00:22:04.278 --> 00:22:05.190
He does.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:10.170
And the things that he
laughs at are so wrong.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.855
We have that in common.

00:22:12.855 --> 00:22:14.094
Like father, like son.

00:22:14.094 --> 00:22:16.010
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: He'll
just start cracking up.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:18.660
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
Oh man, he falls out.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.470
And sometimes you have to,
Rocket, that's not funny.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.074
You're not supposed
to-- that's not right.

00:22:24.074 --> 00:22:24.990
Just when we get home.

00:22:26.829 --> 00:22:28.870
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Does he
do a version of "Happy"?

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.630
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: He
doesn't in front of me.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.250
It's really interesting, my son.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:40.320
Like he watches so intently.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.300
And then you see it
coming out of him later.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.240
But it's never a thing.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.000
He's just now saying
sometimes, Dad, I

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.960
want to go to the
studio with you.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.080
He's just now saying that.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.490
Other times he comes
in and he's just

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:54.550
like, I want to go to the booth.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:55.758
I don't want to do your song.

00:22:55.758 --> 00:22:57.740
I want to do my song.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.650
OK, not that.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.510
Let me do this.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.950
And then he's in the booth
for like 20 or 30 minutes.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:05.437
LYNN HIRSCHBERG:
Does he have a song?

00:23:05.437 --> 00:23:07.020
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
Oh, he has several.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.680
And I'm proud of him.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.100
It's been amazing
to see the stuff

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.150
that he comes up with
at his young age.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.525
LYNN HIRSCHBERG:
That's so great.

00:23:13.525 --> 00:23:14.230
How old is he?

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.920
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: He's six.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.794
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Wow.

00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:17.230
That's a great age.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.990
OK, so what's the rest
of your year look like?

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.840
I imagine you have
a long, big plan.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.560
Do you have a new record?

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.570
I say record, because I'm old.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:28.670
Do you have a new album?

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.180
Do you have a new, whatever, CD?

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.240
What do we call it now?

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.730
Do you have new music?

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.970
I don't have a computer even.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:39.000
I'm old school.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.583
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
I'm in the kitchen.

00:23:40.583 --> 00:23:42.230
LYNN HIRSCHBERG:
You're in the kitchen.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:43.160
But you're a busy man.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.320
You have "The Voice,"
and the kitchen,

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.820
and the saving the world thing.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.250
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Musically.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:48.842
Musically, I'm in the kitchen.

00:23:48.842 --> 00:23:50.550
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: And
what does that mean?

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:51.940
Although it sounds
very exciting.

00:23:54.647 --> 00:23:56.230
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
It means I'm trying

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:03.550
to be poker-faced about it.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.120
But I'm so excited.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:05.690
I really am.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:07.550
LYNN HIRSCHBERG:
Do you get, I mean,

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.220
do you feel pressure because
of the enormous success

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.490
in the last couple of years?

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:13.570
Does that make it
more difficult,

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:15.124
or does that not
affect you at all?

00:24:15.124 --> 00:24:16.040
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: No.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.498
You only feel that
kind of pressure

00:24:17.498 --> 00:24:19.552
when you think you did it.

00:24:19.552 --> 00:24:20.760
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Interesting.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.820
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: When
you realize that you

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:22.780
don't have that control.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.321
And the only thing
you can do is just

00:24:24.321 --> 00:24:26.140
make what feels
good to you, then

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:29.964
you let go and let God,
and let the people.

00:24:29.964 --> 00:24:31.630
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: So,
how is "The Voice"?

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.530
What is it like
being on "The Voice"?

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.330
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
It's an honor.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:42.830
You meet all these
incredible spirits.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:48.600
You meet these people who
have the craziest stories.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.665
Take a kid like Sawyer.

00:24:51.665 --> 00:24:52.915
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: He's amazing.

00:24:52.915 --> 00:24:55.700
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: He's 15.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.455
He's never heard
of Robert Johnson.

00:24:57.455 --> 00:24:58.490
He sings the blues.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:59.620
He sings CCR.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.645
He's from upstate New York.

00:25:07.645 --> 00:25:08.645
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: A farm.

00:25:08.645 --> 00:25:11.380
He grew up on a farm.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.440
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: I
mean, it's just crazy.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:28.010
Or Mia Z. These are
15, and 16, and 17.

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:32.160
This girl, Corinne,
17 years old.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.590
Beautiful, but when
she sings, you just

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:39.010
hear the grounding of the Earth.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.130
And I was like, how do you?

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.100
When I was 15, I would
be so embarrassed

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.370
for you to read those lyrics.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.044
Or hear anything that I
was doing at that time.

00:25:49.044 --> 00:25:50.710
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: You
were probably great

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:51.600
when you were 15.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.810
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Oh man,
but these kids are superior.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.802
They're superior to
what we were doing.

00:25:56.802 --> 00:25:59.260
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: Is that what
surprised you about the show?

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.259
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:26:00.259 --> 00:26:05.750
Because you-- first of all,
I've never been in a room

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:10.520
or in a situation with
that big of a concentration

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.660
of that much talent in one
room and under one roof.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.840
And then, because there's
so much talent there--

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.730
like the scouts
there are genius.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:21.800
But because there's
so much talent there,

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.390
you realize two things.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:27.846
Some people have it in
them and they sing amazing.

00:26:27.846 --> 00:26:29.970
And some people sing amazing,
but they don't really

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:31.100
know where they want to go.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.808
But what you guys are
seeing on TV is you

00:26:32.808 --> 00:26:37.040
guys are seeing
people show themselves

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.900
and it being
determined, like them

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.580
determining their own
fates right then and there.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:45.790
I know where I'm going and
I know what I want to do.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.271
Or I don't know and I
want you to save me.

00:26:48.271 --> 00:26:49.770
And so that's what
we're faced with.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.950
But it's such an honor
to do such every week.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.200
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: It's amazing.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.030
I think it almost
takes you by surprise

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.670
how deep you get into it.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:56.920
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.520
Because you're like
helping people.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.604
And that's, man,
without the help,

00:27:00.604 --> 00:27:02.270
I don't know where I
would be right now.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.920
So it's my responsibility
to pay it forward.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.062
And that's what being on
"The Voice" allows me to do.

00:27:08.062 --> 00:27:09.520
LYNN HIRSCHBERG:
And Happiness Day.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.810
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Yes.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.360
LYNN HIRSCHBERG:
Thank you so much.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.360
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: I would
like to say thank you

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.672
to you, Lynn Hirschberg.

00:27:16.672 --> 00:27:17.880
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: My pleasure.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.421
PHARRELL WILLIAMS:
And also to Google

00:27:19.421 --> 00:27:24.040
for this amazing opportunity
to say hello and be

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.550
a part of this Happy Day.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:28.460
And also the UN and Ban Ki-moon.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.649
And I can't believe
he's even-- you know.

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:33.190
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: I
was pretty excited

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:35.406
when I heard it on the
radio this morning.

00:27:35.406 --> 00:27:37.280
That's why we should
all listen to the radio.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.570
Then we'll hear these things.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:39.778
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: We should.

00:27:39.778 --> 00:27:42.514
Radio is good to us.

00:27:42.514 --> 00:27:43.180
Thank you again.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.638
LYNN HIRSCHBERG:
Thank you so much.

00:27:44.638 --> 00:27:47.610
[APPLAUSE]
