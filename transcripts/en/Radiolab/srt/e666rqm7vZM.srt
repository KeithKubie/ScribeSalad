1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,680
You are listening to radio
lab radio from W N Y.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,210
S? Yup.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,180
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich Radiolab and today

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,680
we're going to hit the phones. Hello. Hi.

5
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:22,850
Can I speak to mark starting with
this guy, Mark Morrison. Hey mark,

6
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:24,470
this is jad calling from radio lab.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,770
Hey Jack. Good to hear Ya.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,730
Got Ahold of him at his
home in Olympia, Washington

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,900
that hanging out on the front porch
cause the kids are running around so you

10
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:32,950
might hear some traffic.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,480
Okay, Gotcha. Um, alright,

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,850
maybe we should just jump in and
you should just tell me this story.

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,830
Okay. So, um, I was deejaying
a wedding, um, out in Lacey,

14
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:45,350
which is the next town over. It was a hot,

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,210
like late spring kind of
feeling like summer kind of day.

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,670
And uh, we were in uh, a little,

17
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:57,671
a rented facility that had like windows
on all sides and all of a sudden the

18
00:00:57,831 --> 00:01:02,831
power starts flickering and
it starts raining really hard.

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,790
Okay. Then trees are falling over,

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,160
the wind is gusting and it,

21
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:15,190
the sky turned tonight and this
is like three 30 in the afternoon.

22
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,220
So mark takes off, goes back home.

23
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,270
My inlaws are visiting in town to
hang out with a new baby and um,

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,400
we open up the curtain,

25
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,380
turned off all the lights and we're just
kind of marveling at the insane power

26
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:35,850
of this storm that's happening.
My wife is sitting on the couch,

27
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:40,851
my two year old is watching Charlie Brown
or something on the iPad and then all

28
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:45,570
of a sudden there's just a loud snap,

29
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:48,000
like the sound of a whip cracking or like,

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,450
like a two by four being snapped in half
and about a foot and a half to two feet

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,490
in front of my face right next
to my mother in law and the baby,

32
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,343
there's a little

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,350
fear of white, white light,

34
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,860
just a little or the size of like maybe
an orange or a grapefruit kind of blurry

35
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,500
edges around it floating in mid air.

36
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,030
As bright as like the sun and like
the bright, it lit up the entire room.

37
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,913
Wow.

38
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,560
All screened.

39
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,420
Everybody in the room, in the unit then,

40
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,290
and mark says this son Orb just sort
of hovered in front of his face,

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,340
kind of going, Wong, Wong, Wong,

42
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,700
Wong for maybe a second

43
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,990
when all of a sudden poof, it was gone.

44
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,103
Yeah.

45
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,590
That's some x files that right there.

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,830
Yeah. None of us had any
idea what the heck happened.

47
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,980
Well, did you go around the room
being like, did you guys see that?

48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,660
Did you see that?

49
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,200
Yeah. Everybody thought everybody side.

50
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,370
I'm by mother-in-law thought that I had
liked taken some kind of like fireworks

51
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,900
and thrown it up in the [inaudible].

52
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,010
Like what? What did you

53
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,340
do? Like I didn't do anything.

54
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,230
So what I did was I started trying
to Google it and there's, you know,

55
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,710
I mean, imagine trying to Google that
and you're not gonna find anything.

56
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,820
What w what did you type into? Google?

57
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,220
A sphere of light floating in, indoors.

58
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,490
Um, I didn't get very far. Yeah.

59
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,240
But, um, I just, I just wanted
to get to the bottom of it.

60
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:34,230
And so what mark did is he sat down on
a computer and he typed up this email

61
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,930
basically saying like, what
the Hell is this thing?

62
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,170
And then he sent that email into the void,

63
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,370
which would be us, yes to our
email inbox and a, you know,

64
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,000
it sat around for awhile because we
tend to get these kinds of questions

65
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,720
a lot. Are there more stars
in the universe or grains
of sand on earth? A lot.

66
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,820
A lot. Is it clean and neat?
The sticker off the apple.

67
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,720
Why do some birds walk and others hop?
How do fish here? Why are horses special?

68
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:07,240
We get things a leg. What's
up with traffic jams?

69
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,400
Random questions like
Gilliam is a finite resource.

70
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:12,010
Why are we wasting it on
balloons out of coop questions.

71
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:14,500
Why is different animals poops
differently? A lot of poop.

72
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,040
What happens when you flush a toilet on
the equator and they just sort of pile

73
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,490
up? We sort of put them in this bucket
and then feel guilty about not answering

74
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:24,070
them. And over the years they keep coming.

75
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:28,150
So the bucket gets fuller
and fuller and fuller.

76
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,640
So finally today we decided, okay,

77
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,300
let's just dump the bucket out

78
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,980
and so we're going to try and answer some
of these questions today. Bunch of us.

79
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,360
Hello, beginning with the question about
the orb. Can I speak to Martin please?

80
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,550
You're talking to him. Try
and answer Mark's question.

81
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:54,050
I called up a guy named Martin Newman,

82
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,220
professor of electrical and computer
engineering at University of Florida.

83
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,750
Thank you. Is this still
a good time to chat?

84
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,370
Uh, it was about the only time because
I'm going to go to dinner in about 10

85
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:03,910
minutes.

86
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,760
All right, excellent. Uh,
so we'll just jump right in.

87
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,880
All right. How long
were you going to talk?

88
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,730
Well, W so I, uh, told Martin the story,
thunderstorm, boom, glowing or boof,

89
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,410
glowing orb gone. Yeah. So maybe I'll
just put the most basic question to you.

90
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:17,250
Like what is that?

91
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,820
Well, that observation is not uncommon
and it's called generally called ball.

92
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,480
Lightning

93
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,020
ball lightning. Yeah, that's what it's
called in. According to Martin Ball,

94
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,670
lightning is timeless.

95
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,960
Some Greeks described exactly the same
thing in the 19th century and 18th

96
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:37,610
century. They used to commonly come down
the chimney, come out the fireplace.

97
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,850
Oh Wow. But now it says Martin, we
are living in an electronic world.

98
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:43,500
And so these balls of lightning

99
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,810
sometime to come out of a wall socket
sometimes out of a telephone. Huh.

100
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,830
Or they happen in airplanes.
They happen in submarines.

101
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,380
Whoa. That actually, that's been reported.

102
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,910
Yeah.

103
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,070
Lightning strikes outside an airplane
and a ball comes through the and floats

104
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:59,030
down the whole plane.

105
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,230
What if I'm in that plane? I'm thinking

106
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,490
you're going to hope you have your diaper
on, right. Where are your, depends.

107
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,050
Anytime you've got electrical stuff
going on you can make a ball of fire like

108
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:10,370
that.

109
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,630
So do we know anything about
what causes what it is exactly?

110
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:18,290
Is it just another form of lightening
that somehow manages to ball itself up and

111
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,070
hang around?

112
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,720
Well, probably

113
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,740
Martin is actually one of the few people
who has studied ball lightening in the

114
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:28,640
lab. He actually got funded by DARPA
to try and figure out how it works.

115
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,930
Wasn't quite able to.

116
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,760
He says what's likely happening is
that when a bolt of lightning strikes,

117
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,510
it might hit something.

118
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,180
Soil, water, tree,

119
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,140
whatever it is, some substance.

120
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,490
Yeah. It's lit up and somehow
forms itself into a sphere,

121
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:44,740
like a balloon or a bubble or something.

122
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,110
Like if you imagine lightning
hits some dust shocks,

123
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:52,370
the dust changes its chemistry so
that it forms some kind of spiritual

124
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,470
scaffolding and then the lightning
sticks to the scaffolding or something.

125
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,160
Yeah.

126
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,000
Maybe that's what's happening.
But you can't prove it. I mean,

127
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,700
there's some theory which
indicates that that might happen,

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,060
but if you go into the laboratory and
you try to make it, you can't make it,

129
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:11,350
so can't prove it. And uh,

130
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,000
if you got a book on ball lightning
or do you get my book and look at the

131
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,320
chapter on ball lightning,

132
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,520
you'll see probably a list of 50 different
theories that people have come up

133
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:23,580
with. Oh.

134
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,050
From all the way to black
holes and continuity's and
time space and things that

135
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:35,690
are just, you know, completely
almost out of this world.

136
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,960
So they remain in ministry. But, uh,

137
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,480
well observed history.

138
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,640
Did you know that people don't have any
good maps for how light and get started

139
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:47,474
in a cloud?

140
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,800
Really? I didn't know that.

141
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,160
We don't know what, how lightning can
can get started. It shouldn't be able to.

142
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,850
It shouldn't really be based on what
the math says. There's not enough

143
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,260
the measurements that have been
made of a conditions in clouds.

144
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,900
Huh. So you're saying

145
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,050
all those things that aren't understood,

146
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,890
almost nothing is understood.

147
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,540
Yeah.

148
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,910
We're floundering around.

149
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,463
Do you,

150
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,690
do you find yourself thinking about
ball lightening and then suddenly just

151
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:19,820
tiptoeing into an existential crisis?

152
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,820
How little we know of the world?

153
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,770
Hello? Sorry. Make my living
is trying to uncover a little,

154
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,760
little more bits by little more
bits, but yeah, there's lots of,

155
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,380
is it not about everything?

156
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,190
[inaudible] wow.

157
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,590
Next up producer Tracy
hunt goes on a field trip.

158
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,380
Do some very hallowed ground man. I
think I finally reached the library,

159
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,620
the New York Public Library,

160
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,950
the New York public life within
it's white marble walls, the store,

161
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:35,440
the son of man, which
in its glory days. Okay.

162
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,310
Right here in the grand hall is like
Beautiful Chandelier's all over the place.

163
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,420
These gorgeous Collins was filled
with seven floors of style,

164
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,250
millions of books in every field
of human endeavor, row upon row,

165
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:52,030
upon row of shelves, smiles up shelves,

166
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,110
close to 50 centuries of
human thinking and experience.

167
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:59,160
And every year millions of visitors like
Tracy would walk through these hallowed

168
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:02,640
halls each has a question with
questions fueled by curiosity,

169
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:05,250
the desire for truth, for
knowledge, for wisdom,

170
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,630
people trying to unravel the
mysteries of the universe.

171
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,850
[inaudible]

172
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,170
I came here to ask them a question
about catnip cabinet. Yes.

173
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,050
Katnik Whoa, wait, why?
Why can't I sit back up?

174
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,100
So we actually got like 500
questions from our listeners,

175
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,090
so I thought it might be good idea
to take some of them to the library.

176
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,800
Hey Resin. So I met up with this
woman. Nice to meet you. I'm Tracy.

177
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:38,480
Nice to meet you, Rosa. And she walked
me into this office. There's about like,

178
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't know, 12 people
sitting at their desk.

179
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,510
Why don't you just introduce yourselves?
Okay, sure. So my name is Rosalie.

180
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,130
I manage asking YPL and I've been in
this department for about five years.

181
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,350
I would ask and why P L it's nine one
seven ask and YPL I'm putting the phone

182
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:58,610
number out there and if you call
them and you ask them a question,

183
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,110
it's their job to answer it. Yes.
So we are like a call center.

184
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:07,190
So our typical day starts with questions.

185
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,120
And like in a typical day, how many phone
calls do you get? Typical Day? About

186
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,090
150 to 200.

187
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,850
And residents telling me that most of
the questions they get it a little,

188
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,790
whether it be like this
weekend I'm very boring. Hey,

189
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:24,270
my library card expired or I want to
renew this book. But you know, also they,

190
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:27,550
they get some weird ones.
We take them all. Yeah. Um,

191
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,910
so I got a list right here and in the
past they've gotten things like what kind

192
00:11:31,911 --> 00:11:34,940
of apple did he eat? Is it proper to
go alone to reno to get a divorce?

193
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,230
And the statistics on the
lifespan of the abandoned woman.

194
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,100
Do candles have to be licensed in India?
What is the natural enemy of the duck?

195
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,800
Can I get a book telling me how to be
a mistress of ceremonies at a musical

196
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:45,350
orgy? What does it mean when you dream
you're being chased by an elephant?

197
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,850
And do they answer all those?
They'll try to, you know,

198
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,940
I was maybe a little dismissive
for a few of them. I mean,

199
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,490
all the questions of course
are very important. We
welcome all questions please.

200
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,430
This by the way, is Bernard
Bernard and Mar Savine.

201
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,380
He has been working for asking YPL since
about 2001 and so the question though,

202
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:06,910
he did answer my catnip question,

203
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:11,230
which is do large feline species like
tigers and lions have the same reaction to

204
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:15,280
catnip as domestic cats?
Yes. I'll Catholic catnip,

205
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,650
apparently tigers, at
least that I'm, you know,

206
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:21,040
I had all these questions so I actually
had them pick one that they thought was

207
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,940
super interesting. Yeah. Which
one did you pick two to answer?

208
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,380
Let me get the exact wording
out of, so yeah, so here we go.

209
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,390
Could you play a meaningful game of
Frisbee on the surface of Mars? Yeah,

210
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,510
and I really liked that.
That was a good one.

211
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,760
And I think the word that makes it
like just really shine is meaningful.

212
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,690
So the first thing he does, you'll
want to get me kind of doing some,

213
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,010
some searching, you know, again, back of
the envelope kind of stuff here in he,

214
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,550
I guess I was a little disappointed that
we didn't invest that. Any like books,

215
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,700
I'm just looking up a
frisbee aerodynamics.

216
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,740
You literally just turn it just
computer inside of googling.

217
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:03,340
How's a Frisbee behave here on
earth? The spin of the Frisbee,

218
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,690
of course lift, drag. So he looks
all that stuff up. Let's see.

219
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,700
Then he looks at like aerodynamics
on Mars. On Mars, it's very thin,

220
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,400
the air there. So because
it airs within on Mars,

221
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:18,720
you wouldn't get that spinning lifting
thing that you always get frisbees.

222
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:23,890
It might not have the same
sort of hovering effect that
a first bee does here on

223
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:28,660
earth. It probably would be
more like just throwing a ball.

224
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,130
It would just go from 10 feet away, 15
feet away. I don't think that that's,

225
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,870
that counts as a meaningful
game of Frisbee. You still
throw it back and forth.

226
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,660
But the meaningful to me,

227
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:45,220
the question is like you're
playing Frisbee on Mars.

228
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,130
I mean that's just, that's just
inherently meaningful, you know,

229
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,640
growing up I remember seeing uh,

230
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,223
alright, sorry.

231
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,790
You know where you broadcast of a, you
know like the astronauts on the moon.

232
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,570
Oh yes. In why you are looking at,

233
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,120
you might recognize what I
have in my head is the uh,

234
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,213
playing golf

235
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,820
and no further continued example return.

236
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,700
It just still happen to have it next time
I brought him over to my birthday and

237
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:17,470
I have a [inaudible]
American. I dropped the damn

238
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,810
and I'm sure that they were
not playing like, you know,

239
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,760
PGA golf

240
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,050
but I've got to try it. Old Sam shot here,

241
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,160
all the [inaudible]

242
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,820
they were just, you
know, amateur duffers but

243
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,760
no,

244
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,470
they were golfing on the moon.

245
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,950
Nah, one more.

246
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,740
Oh and miles and miles.

247
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,470
I mean to me that's pretty great.
Pretty, that's pretty impressive. So the,

248
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:51,304
the, the, the

249
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:52,520
uh,

250
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,520
kind of makes the whole endeavor
meaningful I think in it.

251
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,553
And its way

252
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,950
[inaudible]

253
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,970
thanks to producer producers.

254
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,750
I actually did ask them
my dragons question. Oh,

255
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,600
well then her next up, Tracy Hunt

256
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,960
and dragons. Hi, this is
Christina. Hi Tracy. Hi.

257
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,980
Hey, are you coming back? This
question is from Christina. Hard quiz.

258
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,900
I am a native of Nevato

259
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,080
out in northern California.

260
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,020
Um, and I was born and raised
here. So yeah, love this place.

261
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,070
And you, and what was your question too?
Is if you remember what it was roughly?

262
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,621
Yeah,

263
00:15:41,621 --> 00:15:46,621
so I came across this article about
these creatures called ohms that I guess

264
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,140
we're being, you know, washed out
of these caves in eastern Europe.

265
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,063
What did they call,

266
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:54,540
um,

267
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,540
the o l m these sort of like
blind cave dwelling amphibians.

268
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:05,480
They're totally white. Their skin is
translucent, very like other worldly.

269
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,960
And the article touched on
the idea that, you know,

270
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,990
folklore thought that these little
creatures were actually like dragon babies

271
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,710
being pushed out of, of these caves where,

272
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,450
where these huge dragons live.

273
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,710
So I started digging into it a little
bit and of course you can only find so

274
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:25,521
much on the Internet,

275
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:30,521
but there was this idea of dragons being
a sort of like a universal [inaudible]

276
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,910
yeah, a cross, you know,
different disparate cultures.

277
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,080
And Christina started to wonder why it
seemed that so many cultures all over the

278
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,450
world all had myths about dragons.

279
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,240
Is it about like humans that will
cause them to believe in these like

280
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,890
huge airy, fire-breathing animals?

281
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,990
Is that true that cultures all over
the world have dragons? Well, sorry,

282
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,620
now you have the northern European
dragon that we're all familiar with

283
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,490
[inaudible] then there's the Chinese
dragon, which is a little different.

284
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:05,170
It doesn't have wings,
doesn't breathe fire.

285
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,580
Then there's other dragon looking
sort of things. The Nana Boli

286
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,850
[inaudible] Soto people
in Southern Africa.

287
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,660
There's the Amaru associated
with the Incan Empire. Yeah,

288
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,950
I think there's no doubt that we have
dye abuelas awesome creatures like

289
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:24,970
dragons, uh, in almost
every culture in the world.

290
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,160
So this is Adrian Mayer.

291
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,220
I'm a research scholar in the classics
department at Stanford and I'm most

292
00:17:32,771 --> 00:17:36,760
interested in is what sorts of
things found in nature might have led

293
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:41,761
pre-scientific people to believe that
dragons or monsters or other fantastic

294
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:46,750
creatures really existed. At least in
the past or even maybe in the present.

295
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:51,060
Adrian actually wrote a book called the
first fossil that lays out this theory

296
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:56,050
that a lot of these stories were actually
based on people finding old, you know,

297
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,600
fossils and bones,

298
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,160
fossil bones or teeth or claws
or footprints in bedded in stone.

299
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:07,260
So they see a set of old bones that
they couldn't explain with any modern

300
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:08,094
creatures.

301
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,930
So the creature they go to is
this dragon shaped thing. Yes,

302
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,160
but I do want to point out though that
we can never know for certain which comes

303
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:17,600
first,

304
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,600
the observations of mysterious traces
of of unknown animals or the stories of

305
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:24,540
dragons. We don't know which comes first.

306
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,100
She says it could be that the story about
the dragon was already there and then

307
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:30,300
when they found some bones,

308
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,630
they just sort of applied those
bones to the dragon myth. What if,

309
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,750
if the dragon came before the
bones, where did it come from? Well,

310
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,310
there's another theory.

311
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,650
Some scholars have said they're
like monsters of the [inaudible].

312
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:46,670
They arise from ancient memories of very
real predators that were faced by our

313
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:50,191
ancestors.

314
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:54,780
Basically dragons are composited that
these creatures that used to eat us and in

315
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,460
Honduras and kill us like crocodiles,
Saber Tooth Tigers and lions, cave bears,

316
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,870
gigantic serpents, snakes,
pythons, condo raptors.

317
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,440
So you can take like this
scaly skin of the crocodile,

318
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,620
the claws of the saber tooth
tiger and its saber teeth.

319
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,740
The wings of these raptors
put them all together.

320
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,610
So this is all the old
terrorist rolled into one

321
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,650
boom together. Yeah,

322
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,820
they tapped into all those fears that
are ready are in ready inside of this

323
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,360
theory. I'm going to go for that
one. Yeah, I like that. That works.

324
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,410
Then that feels like an
answer. Well, you know, like,

325
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,190
like they're very powerful. I
mean that can be very scary.

326
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:36,420
They can be very destructive.
But what's kind of magical in,

327
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:41,610
in game of Thrones is that the intimate
scenes also melt your heart and bring

328
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,970
you closer to these creatures that should
be, you know, burning your face off.

329
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,123
Okay. So I, I,

330
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,510
I should admit that I actually just use
this whole dragon thing to talk to this

331
00:19:50,511 --> 00:19:51,800
lady at gay from game of Thrones.

332
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,200
[inaudible] her name is Paula Fairfield
and she makes all the dragon noises for

333
00:19:57,201 --> 00:20:00,590
game of Thrones. Oh, she
makes the dragons. Right.
Well, what did you ask her?

334
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:03,380
I guess what did you want to
know? Well, I wanted to know,

335
00:20:03,381 --> 00:20:06,090
I wanted to know like
how does she make these

336
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,620
sounds? And it was really
interesting cause you know,

337
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,240
we're talking a little bit about, uh,

338
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:19,040
you know how dragons are
composite creatures and she
basically uses composites

339
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,310
to make these noises. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

340
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,830
I absolutely take some laces from birds.

341
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,350
Ricci shrieky bird sounds, insects,

342
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,480
different kinds of reptilian
recordings and stuff.

343
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:36,560
And gays are always scary animals.
Well, depends on what dragon that she,

344
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:39,140
you know, which of the dragons
that she's trying to actually, um,

345
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,003
create a performance.

346
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,590
I have sounds,

347
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:46,270
I might choose simply by
certain personality traits
that I might want to push

348
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:50,170
forward. Um, so in the case of Drogon

349
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,550
[inaudible]

350
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,590
so, um, on the show there's Dinero

351
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,220
[inaudible] Dragon Queen and she has
three dragons and one of them is named

352
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,783
Drogon.

353
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,800
She named that dragon
after cal Drogo, her,

354
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,310
her hot late husband. Um,

355
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,540
so drogue on his like her lover. Yeah.

356
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,850
He kind of has like a very
affectionate central relationship.

357
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,003
Okay.

358
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,420
He's whistling at her all the time.
He's looking at her butt and going,

359
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,313
Ooh Baby,

360
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,813
does it happen?

361
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,010
And so in order to kind of push forward
this sort of like drag in sexual

362
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:47,590
attention, I guess she uses the sounds of

363
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,730
too dry and tortoise is, you know,
mating. Oh, toured tortoise as well.

364
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,880
It sound like, well, um, you
know, I'm, I'll just play it.

365
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,953
Hello.

366
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,873
Whoa, whoa.

367
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:09,110
But the grown of the male actually
became with some work and,

368
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:12,630
and you know, adjustments and
stuff became, I'm the source,

369
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,870
the basis for dro guns per with her,

370
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,150
with the narrows. How
far did she come to me?

371
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:27,963
We need to [inaudible]

372
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,880
my people need me.

373
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,690
And the funny thing about the per what
Drogon was watching people watch it and

374
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:36,600
giggling when they heard it,
but not really knowing why.

375
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,630
And to me it's because it had that
essence that that kind of sensual sexual

376
00:22:42,031 --> 00:22:45,420
essence, that person. Yeah. No, I
use from all all kinds of things.

377
00:22:45,421 --> 00:22:46,350
And you know,

378
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,380
I also used for dragon fly wings
to make that kind of funny,

379
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,880
flatter of the thorns that's as moving
like especially on the end of his tail

380
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:58,440
this year as he moved through,

381
00:22:58,441 --> 00:23:01,560
there was like a Chitter and
that was like dragon fly wings.

382
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,790
Dragon fly wings. Yeah. Really.

383
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,590
I was wondering if you ever had a question
about dragons that you would like to

384
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:09,340
have answered.

385
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,230
Yeah, no, it's,

386
00:23:10,231 --> 00:23:14,500
it's curious because I think the thing
that differentiates the dragons from

387
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,660
creatures and makes them slightly
either worldly is the fire thing.

388
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,500
Where did the idea for that kind of
long, that's a good question. Yeah.

389
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,790
Where did that come from?

390
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,360
Well, there are many theories
about that. Actually,

391
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:29,100
I take that question back to Adrian Mayer.

392
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:34,130
The one that I like is connected to the
devastating weapon called Greek fire,

393
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,310
which was this unquenchable fire
can't be put out by water. In fact,

394
00:23:38,311 --> 00:23:40,980
it burns in water. And
so it was a naval weapon.

395
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:46,250
And I believe that scholars have found
that some of the nozzles for lasting

396
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,360
Greek fire were shaped like dragons so
that the boat looked like it had a dragon

397
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,500
on board breathing fire out the
enemy ship. Oh, that's so cool.

398
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,660
The stories of they had
dragons that breathe fire, uh,

399
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,480
would make it back to uh, to northern
Europe. That's the best theory I've heard.

400
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,000
Oh, that's interesting.
So it's like if the drag,

401
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,980
it is a composite of all the things,

402
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:17,000
creatures that have scared us now we're
part of that composite technology now be

403
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,740
it is built, becomes part of
the creature that frightens us.

404
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,340
[inaudible] thanks Tracy. You're welcome.

405
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,160
Who is, what is, uh,

406
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,890
what is uh, uh, [inaudible]

407
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,560
who is,

408
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:59,450
uh, uh, anything coming to mind? What is a

409
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,010
Oh oh six something.

410
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,720
It's a fedora. I should have known
that. He shouldn't have known that.

411
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:10,950
All right, we're going to take a break.

412
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,930
This is Marnie Campbell from the beautiful

More information
aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

416
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,610
jad Robert Radiolab man, we
are back with more questions.

417
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,820
Next one comes from
producer Rachel Cusick.

418
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,400
So this question comes from Liam
hamburger from Denver, Colorado.

419
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,920
No [inaudible].

420
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,650
I was browsing meanings on my Instagram
feed and there was meme where the

421
00:25:55,651 --> 00:25:58,080
picture was of a husband and
wife trying to go to sleep.

422
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,450
The wife was looking weird.

423
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,060
She was like looking irritated and the
husband was looking like this kind of

424
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,660
confused on the opposite side
of bed and a capsule utter.

425
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,100
He's probably thinking of
other girls and then him,

426
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,170
I wonder if I bought milk
from the same cow twice.

427
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,590
What'd he say? When do what?

428
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,390
Yeah, so he said, I wonder if I've ever
bought milk from the same cow twice.

429
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,110
So if I go to the store, I buy a
gallon of milk and then I go back.

430
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,240
Maybe a week later I get
another gallon of milk.

431
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,760
What are the odds that the same cow is
in both of those gallons of milk? I see.

432
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:33,680
[inaudible]

433
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,670
I would say the answer
is almost certainly. Yes,

434
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,953
100%

435
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,010
that's our Benjamin. He's a math
professor. Yep. At Harvey Mudd College

436
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,690
in Claremont. And I'm
also a mathemagician.

437
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,100
And how is he so sure that it's 100%
well, according to Art Benjamin,

438
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,660
it all comes down to a [inaudible]

439
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,780
ability. Statistics and dare I say,

440
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:58,090
hey, how cute. So take a farm
like Dale's here. Oh, here we go.

441
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,850
My name is Dale Mattoon,
pine hollow dairy.

442
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,330
Dale has about a thousand
cows and 20 at a time.

443
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,090
These cows walk into a
milking parlor, they line up,

444
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:09,540
it looks like a [inaudible]
all day and all night long.

445
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,900
And they get hooked up with these
black rubber hoses area here.

446
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:15,750
And every once in a while is the guy
putting the machine on a cow and he hits

447
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:16,590
the button,

448
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:20,580
it turns on a vacuum and any pumps the
milk out of their utters into this big

449
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:22,440
hose along the bottom of the floor.

450
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,400
You through the hose down into this line
and it's meeting up with all the milk

451
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:27,450
from all the other cows

452
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,590
and then it goes from that room into
another room or it gets cool down the milk

453
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:37,070
out. Put your hand on this
pipe. Oh my gosh, it's cold.

454
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,780
There's condensation on it. Very
cool. Once it's cooled down,

455
00:27:39,781 --> 00:27:43,680
it goes into this rocket ship looking
thing outside called a milk silo where all

456
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:46,020
the milk from Dale's farm is
just hanging out together.

457
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,260
Silo gets filled up and up
and up and up until it's full.

458
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:54,280
We're sending out over 8,000 gallons
of milk today on a trek. The trailer,

459
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,211
his truck comes along,

460
00:27:55,211 --> 00:27:58,270
picks up that milk and it stops at
another farm and another farm and another

461
00:27:58,271 --> 00:28:00,310
farm until that truck is full,

462
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,450
right full goes to the processing plant
and once you're at the processing plant,

463
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,720
all that milk is just mixed around
even more with milk from all the cows.

464
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:12,400
[inaudible] Maria and

465
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,053
I still have my,

466
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,950
my back of the envelope that
had the calculation here.

467
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,350
Here's where the math comes in.

468
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:25,390
There are about 90,000 drops
of milk and a gallon and uh,

469
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,181
oh, I don't know,

470
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:30,160
100,000 cows who are contributing
to a particular processing plants.

471
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,150
When you were in the odds of a drop of
milk from any one cow getting into any

472
00:28:34,151 --> 00:28:35,230
particular gallon,

473
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,263
probably the case,

474
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,190
every gallon of milk contains
most of those cows contributing.

475
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,730
And here's the thing. In one drop of milk,

476
00:28:43,731 --> 00:28:46,580
you could probably have a bunch of
different milk molecules from a bunch of

477
00:28:46,581 --> 00:28:47,310
different cows.

478
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:52,020
And so one glass of milk might have, yeah,

479
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,021
thousands,

480
00:28:53,021 --> 00:28:57,910
maybe hundreds of thousands of
different how molecules in my glasses.

481
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,960
Oh Wow. Crazy. Oh my God.

482
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,170
So going back to Liam's
original question, uh,

483
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,990
arts argument is that when
you're drinking a glass of milk,

484
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:11,310
there's like so many different bits
of milk from so many different cows,

485
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:15,260
then it's probably the case that after
just two glasses of milk, you're,

486
00:29:15,261 --> 00:29:19,690
you're almost certain to have, um, a cow
that was represented in both of them.

487
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:23,190
So you're bound to run into at least
a little bit of one of those hundred

488
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,300
thousand cows. Again,

489
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,940
the point being that every
glass of milk has, you know,

490
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,740
has thousands and thousands
of different cows contributing

491
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,470
a little bit of 10,000 cows and every
glass, every glass. I love that.

492
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,540
I don't know that I do. No, it's great.

493
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:42,250
It's like you're enjoying the collective
efforts of this entire almost. No,

494
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:42,551
no.

495
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:46,210
I think it should be the product of one
or two cows and you can picture in your

496
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:49,870
head and maybe pat on the nose. Thank
you. You could say, yeah, I dunno.

497
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,030
I would both of you I
feel like weirds me out.

498
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:54,760
But I also think it's kind of cool
at the same time. Well, you know,

499
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,180
become a thing of it. What happens if
you drink a glass of milk in New York,

500
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,020
get on a plane, fly to Atlanta,
then have another glass of milk.

501
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:04,690
Are you getting the same 10,000 in
each class or are they different?

502
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:05,380
10,000 yeah,

503
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,980
so I tried calling around a little bit
to answer that question and it seems like

504
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,560
no one really wants to
pay to ship milk that far.

505
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:16,000
And so basically a different processing
plant might mean a whole different group

506
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:16,834
of cows.

507
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,310
If you really want to figure out exactly
which plant your milk is coming from,

508
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:24,550
you can go to where is
my milk from.com. Yeah,

509
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,060
and you input the little code on the top
of your carton and see how often that

510
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:32,800
number comes up. Again, each
processing plant has its own code

511
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,810
and yet there's so many stores.

512
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,000
Thank you, Rachel. Thank you. Um,

513
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,810
and just a big thanks to dairy farmer
Dale Mattoon over at pine hollow dairy.

514
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,930
Are you a big milk drinker? Oh yeah.
How often do you drink milk? Oh,

515
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:48,720
well I have it on my cereal in the Martin.

516
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,210
I have a glass or two for lunch
and a glass or two for dinner.

517
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,470
Probably two glasses each. Each
meal. If I don't drink milk,

518
00:30:56,471 --> 00:31:00,330
I don't feel good. Like if I go away on
vacation. And a lot of times you go to

519
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,270
[inaudible]. No, now

520
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:39,983
[inaudible] [inaudible]

521
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,580
all right. This next one came from
a couple, a married couple. Hello,

522
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:49,630
is this Marie? Yup, this is Matt kilty
calling from Radiolab. How are you?

523
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,980
I'm good. Thanks. I have you on
speaker phone and that goes right here.

524
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:57,230
Oh, Hey Zach, how's it
going? So Zack Murray,

525
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,030
it was years ago actually,

526
00:31:59,031 --> 00:32:02,600
they send us an email about what I think
is like one of the most confounding,

527
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:06,290
perplexing, mysterious devices that you
can find inside anybody's home. Okay.

528
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:10,030
So the microwave, I guess, I guess
what I'm wondering is how one,

529
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,730
why were you microwaving
peppers? Uh, and too you,

530
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,080
do you remember the moment this happened?

531
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,770
Oh, I know what it is. I know
that's what happened. So,

532
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:22,600
okay, so quick scene set. Uh, Portland,
Maine, a kitchen around dinner time,

533
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,940
I think we're like cooking a tomato sauce.

534
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,270
Zack was on bell pepper duty.

535
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,420
Try and take a shortcut,

536
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,870
take them in a microwave to make them
a little warm or soft or something.

537
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,310
And I said, oh that don't put those
in the microwave. They'll spark.

538
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,560
And Zach was just like, hmm,

539
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,010
you're crazy. Hogwash. Believe you

540
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,610
at all. And uh, reads like none of them
know. I remember seeing it as a kid.

541
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,290
You said there was a couple times her
mom put some peppers in a microwave and

542
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:46,800
they sparked

543
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,740
yes. My first thought was that,
and I never even was wrong.

544
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,690
[inaudible] bet your memory was wrong.

545
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,260
Like there must've been a piece of metal
in the microwave and you just don't

546
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:54,800
remember that.

547
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,590
And that's what was sparking up.
Cause festivals wouldn't do that.

548
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,810
And this is going back and forth in
yes and no and sparks and nothing until

549
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:05,350
I think it was like have to, we have
the ability to find this out and uh,

550
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,860
prove this wrong.

551
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,490
So that was like five
years ago in the past.

552
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:15,080
So we decided that we would actually do
our own experiment in the present to get

553
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:18,320
to the bottom of this. Do Green
peppers spark in the microwave

554
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,690
Maserati first things first. I
actually went and bought a microwave.

555
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:28,850
Has It gone off guy on craigslist?
I, yeah, so, uh, 50 bucks,

556
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:33,820
50 bucks, 50 bucks. Alright. Alright
baby. And carried it like uh,

557
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,050
hey eight blocks back to work.

558
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,980
Also bought a bunch of crosiers because
we were going to do more than just a

559
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:43,280
peppers test. And for reasons
I'd rather not get into. Uh,

560
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,870
decided not to start with the peppers.

561
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,760
Baby carrots. Carrots. Yeah.
Produce producer and Macewan.

562
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:54,760
Then we're going to kitchen.
Really? Yeah. Couldn't tell carrots.

563
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:01,160
Okay. And as the Great Runco
says of infomercial fame,

564
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,060
I don't know who the great Ron
go is. Great. Round. Go set it.

565
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,710
Alright, two minutes. Let's
see what happens. [inaudible]

566
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,273
and all of a sudden

567
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,600
this little yellow spark to shout out
from one of our slices of carrots.

568
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,360
That was crazy. As a little spark. Oh
yeah. There you see another one? Yeah,

569
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:29,260
I just saw a little flash.
Wow. Cause little tiny spark

570
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,090
carrots. Hmm. Okay.

571
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,520
Next Kale

572
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,970
[inaudible] this is where it gets a
little crazy because the Kale, oh, there.

573
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,540
Same thing. Boom, boom, boom.
Sparks smoke. It's a smell.

574
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:55,580
[inaudible] Jesus. Delicious.
Also. That is smoke.

575
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,500
Um, we're going to try
to base Maddie said it.

576
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,130
Woo. We started driving out
of a crowd in the studio.

577
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,700
Why was the electricity coming out of
the blueberry next I'm to get this.

578
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,160
Repeat those scripts.

579
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,060
[inaudible] and he means any time cook.

580
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,750
Whoa. All right. What's up
next? Okay. Jumbo francs.

581
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,990
Can I got Turkey? Frank
did set it. Spread it.

582
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,170
Oh my God. Okay. Pepper. Yes. Set it.

583
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,540
Okay. Both red and green bell peppers.
Green is crazy. Hey pepper. Yes,

584
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:46,120
it's green diced tomatoes. Heres
decorative gourd down again

585
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,730
and also a flaming lips city. There we go.

586
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,360
Who needs fireworks when you've got
a CD in the business? KZ shots up.

587
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,440
I wish that. Yeah, cause I don't
want it. Yeah. Is it gonna?

588
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:03,480
It looks like he was on fire. He's
this smoking in here. Yeah. Oh,

589
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:08,010
that smells really bad. I had to
take a break. Everybody. Oh God.

590
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,770
Yeah. We want to keep the door open.

591
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:18,530
What did you say to Maria after the
peppers sparked in the microwave?

592
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,540
I think I was, I don't know.
I was probably speechless.

593
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,280
I said I was a, yeah, I believe
that you're right. And Murray,

594
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:29,830
did you say anything in return? Oh
wait, something to the effect of,

595
00:36:29,831 --> 00:36:30,664
I told you so.

596
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,920
So pepper, sparky, the
microwave. That was settled,

597
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:35,210
but then there was the debate about,

598
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,840
he doesn't believe my understanding
of how microwave's work. Why?

599
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,890
Maybe it's just that pepper has
a lot of moisture in it. Yeah.

600
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,960
Zach, maybe it's, you put
the pepper in the microwave.

601
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:45,210
All that water gets really high.

602
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,030
The skin acts as like Tinder and that
light's on fire quickly. But Marie,

603
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,970
we always have peppers in our house
and I think that the green wine taste a

604
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:56,290
little bit. MCKAYLA,

605
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,650
the, it's like maybe these peppers is,

606
00:36:57,651 --> 00:37:01,130
have like some little bit of metal
in there that's sparking. Yeah.

607
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,860
And your next step to find
the appropriate scientist.

608
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,510
Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm definitely gonna
try and put this case to bed. Yeah,

609
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:12,930
just give us one moment. So ended
up tracking down this woman.

610
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,130
It's a Carolina Carolyn, is it
Kyle is Caroline. Caroline. Okay.

611
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,270
Her name is Caroline Ross.

612
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,690
I'm a professor in the
Department of material science
and engineering in MIT and

613
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:27,450
experienced microwave. I've done it
with them with roast potatoes. Oh,

614
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:31,830
you've seen sparks? Yeah, I've seen
sparks for most potatoes. Huh. All right.

615
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:33,170
So yeah, maybe we should just slate.

616
00:37:33,171 --> 00:37:36,090
So I asked her in the case
of the peppers or you know,

617
00:37:36,091 --> 00:37:39,630
the red potatoes or the grapes, like
all the different food that we tried,

618
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:44,280
like what happens in a microwave?
It makes the food just go late,

619
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,790
right? So let's say I got some pieces
of pepper put 'em in the microwave,

620
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,960
I press start like what,
what happens next? Okay.

621
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:56,580
So there was a gadget in the microwave
oven that produces the microwave's,

622
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:00,630
it's called a magnet farm. And, um,
it's, uh, an interesting thing in itself.

623
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,561
Okay. Quick side note.

624
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:03,840
It's basically like this hunk of
metal that makes the microwave.

625
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:05,160
But Kaitlin told me
this really cool thing,

626
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:09,120
which is they actually used to be
used, uh, in World War II for radar.

627
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,660
That was in the forties. And then in 1945,

628
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:17,661
there was an engineer at Raytheon who
was working on these devices and he found

629
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:21,300
that some candy bar he had in his
pocket got hot. I was like, oh,

630
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,230
this cooks food.

631
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:26,580
And so eventually a magnetron got thrown
inside of a metal box and thus was born

632
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,960
the microwave. So it's an
interesting thing in itself, but, uh,

633
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:34,710
it produces a beam of microwaves and
they bounce around inside the microwave

634
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:36,420
oven. Moving at the speed of light.

635
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,730
What are the, are the pounding
into the pepper or maybe not.

636
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,980
I don't really like shooting into the
painting absorbed, yeah. Being absorbed.

637
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,250
And these microwaves, um,

638
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,680
they are the right kind of frequency to
cause the molecules in food to oscillate

639
00:38:51,691 --> 00:38:54,630
back and forth. Ah, you've
put a pepper in there.

640
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:59,030
So the purpose got a lot of water in
it. It's got all the things as well.

641
00:38:59,690 --> 00:38:59,900
Um,

642
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,190
and those molecules start absorbing the
microwave's and dancing back and forth

643
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:06,680
and hitting each other and heating up.

644
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,920
And then that bit gets even hotter and
even hotter and eventually it could burst

645
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:12,890
into flames.

646
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,730
But that is not what we're seeing with
our pepper or any of the food in the

647
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,830
microwave. It's not, no, because, uh,

648
00:39:19,831 --> 00:39:23,670
as Caroline explained to me a flame
is very different than a spark.

649
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:28,620
So one thing to keep in mind is that,
um, the pepper is fairly conductive.

650
00:39:28,621 --> 00:39:29,940
It's got all this water in it.

651
00:39:29,941 --> 00:39:33,870
We know that water can conduct
electricity and the water isn't pure.

652
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,680
It has a lot of salts dissolved in
it, minerals, things like that. Okay.

653
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:42,040
In that sense it's a little bit like
a piece of metal metal as we know,

654
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:45,370
absorbs microwave energy rather
well as we all know. Yes.

655
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,643
So,

656
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,113
um,

657
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,290
okay. So let's say you get these pieces
of pepper in the microwave and they're,

658
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,520
you know, carefully keeping up.
Okay. Now the thing is the microwave,

659
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,450
like the wave itself,

660
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,480
it has an electric field which oscillates
back and forth rather high frequency.

661
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,580
So when these make waves shoot
into these pieces of pepper,

662
00:40:07,581 --> 00:40:12,410
what happens is this electricity starts
swishing back and forth through the bits

663
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:12,770
of pepper.

664
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:16,360
So there's a cone flowing and it's more
microwaves are absorbed in these bits of

665
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:16,670
pepper.

666
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:20,000
You can get quite big cones current
so big that they start to create this

667
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:24,770
electric field around the food and that
electric field builds up and up and up

668
00:40:24,771 --> 00:40:29,771
and eventually it's big enough
to cause the air to glow

669
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,400
around the food because now there's
actually electricity coursing through the

670
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,120
air like a fluorescent light bulb can.

671
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:44,650
And says at this point you can start to
see these glowing balls of gas floating.

672
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,440
It's actually the air turning into plasma.

673
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,810
Now back in the center of the microwave
are are little bits of pepper where

674
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,500
there's still this electrical current
swishing back and forth through those bits

675
00:40:56,501 --> 00:41:00,720
of pepper. And if you have sharp corners
like the actual corner of a pepper,

676
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,340
even on the skin, like these
tiny microscopic little points,

677
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,780
you're like trisomy in the pepper,

678
00:41:04,781 --> 00:41:08,680
the electricity in the air can get
concentrated at those sharp corners like a

679
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,010
lightning rod. And at those
corners, electricity bill,

680
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,160
Bill ill until

681
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,060
[inaudible] you got some
mini lightening bolt.

682
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,460
And then Katelyn said everything in
the microwave, just sort of [inaudible]

683
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,610
palms down until the electric field
builds up again and it does it all over.

684
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,090
Letting loose these mini lightning
bolts. So it's a very dynamic,

685
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,530
you've got things being ionized,
you've got things recombining,

686
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:41,120
you've got charged flowing, you've got
light being emitted, things get hot,

687
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,740
there's a big current flowing all for
that tiny fraction of a second lot of

688
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,270
quantum physics in there.

689
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,430
And then we hear a little Ding and
then we're done and then we're done.

690
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,730
But I just had one last job to do. How
are you two doing? Okay, good. Okay.

691
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:02,200
All right. So I think called up second.

692
00:42:02,201 --> 00:42:04,630
Marie told him everything I learned
about their sparking pepper.

693
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,760
And then even though both of them
didn't have the exact theory,

694
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,610
lake sac was right. Water's important.
Part of Murray was, you know,

695
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,560
kind of onto something with
this metal thing. Yeah.

696
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,230
It feels like it's almost like a little
bit of like a, um, a marriage of sorts,

697
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:18,290
pardon the pun, uh, between
both of your ideas that, uh,

698
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:22,700
kind of is what is happening
inside this black box.

699
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,290
Alright. So, yeah. Okay.
That's the way we were.

700
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,860
We have some of the elements
there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

701
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,410
Um, so that's a, that's
about it. Okay, excellent.

702
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:37,643
Oh,

703
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,990
there was one thing that I
actually thought was kinda
interesting and all these

704
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:43,770
questions we were getting in there
was like this tiny little pattern of,

705
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,640
of married couples sending us
in, uh, arguments that they can,

706
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,880
there is, there was one
couple that was like, uh,

707
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:56,460
they were arguing about the nutritional
value of microwaving a potato. Um,

708
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:01,350
there was another couple that sent in
a very long email about how they'd been

709
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,050
debating about how we perceive color. Um,

710
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,800
you've actually had a similar
dispute. Yeah. Oh, over color

711
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,630
was the couch. Oh yeah.

712
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:18,790
They have some sort of like drab
tone that I thought was rain.

713
00:43:19,001 --> 00:43:22,950
And you thought it was brown, Gray. I
agree that, yeah, I think that, yeah,

714
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,120
we had that couch for like
between different houses
and different combinations

715
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:29,000
for probably like five or six
years and maybe seven years,

716
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,290
10 years and a lot of
licensed. And I was, yeah,

717
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,090
I always thought it was gray and still do.

718
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:37,130
But apparently you and your
sister thought it was green.

719
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,560
You're like lived together for
years and just never realized.

720
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:42,680
You're seeing something completely
differently. Like what do you mean?

721
00:43:42,681 --> 00:43:45,410
Our green couch. I have no idea.
We don't have a green couch

722
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,560
producer, Matt guilty.

723
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,753
[inaudible]

724
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:06,170
all right, so that's just a few
of the questions you asked us,

725
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:10,220
which we tried to answer, but that's
just the first part of our effort.

726
00:44:10,221 --> 00:44:13,820
We have another whole sequence of
questions and answers coming up.

727
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,940
So if your question hasn't been
answered yet, um, hang tight,

728
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:21,740
never know the next batch. Put in your
question and it's coming very, very soon.
