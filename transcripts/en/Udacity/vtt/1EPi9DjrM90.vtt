00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.140
To get started, let's replace
the hashtag in our delete link

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.640
with the path for
/restaurants/idnumber/delete.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.289
Here, inside my doGet block, I make a
confirmation page that informs the user

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.810
that they are about to delete
a restaurant from the database.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.630
Within it, I create a POST form that
only contains the button element to

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.030
confirm the delete.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.370
Then I use wfile to write my
output back out to the client.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.920
Similarly to my edit post,
I grab the ID part of my URL and

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.640
create a query to find
that restaurant object.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.600
I then call session.delete on the object
and commit the delete to the database.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.380
I redirect once again to
the main restaurants page.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.470
Let's save our code and
fire up the server one more time.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.900
And we see that we can now create,
read, update, and

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.170
delete via our web page,
all objectives complete.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.660
And of course, the source code for

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.530
objective five can also be
found in the instructor notes.
