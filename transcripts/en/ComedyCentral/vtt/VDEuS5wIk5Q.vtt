00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:03.403
There's no way
that he can win.

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:05.038
No, mm-mm, no.

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:06.807
So, anyway, what did you think
of the season finale

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.774
of <i>Game of Thrones?</i>

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:09.543
- [gasps]
- Right?

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.078
- That was--
- No, no, no.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.312
I'm reading
the books.

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:14.581
Oh, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:15.782
And he reads slow.

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:17.251
[laughter]

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:19.219
We can never
talk about it.

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:20.721
We're never
gonna talk about it.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.122
Okay.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.257
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.393
Hey, has anybody seen
that new Russell Crowe thriller?

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:27.261
'Cause let me tell--

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:28.695
Ah, ah, ah!

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.531
Ah.

00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:32.232
Sorry, it's just

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.134
we're going tomorrow,
and I don't want to know

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:35.502
a thing about it.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:36.803
Doesn't want
to know a thing.

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:39.673
- Got you. Okay, all right.
- Sure, yeah.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.543
Yeah, yeah.
That is--

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:44.077
How--who won the game?

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:46.713
- I think--
- N-n-n-n-n-n-n.

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:49.283
That--I'm--
I'm gonna watch it later.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:50.817
- Oh, you're--
- Oh, you have a DVR.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:51.585
- I got it--
- Sorry, okay.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:52.486
Mum's the word.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.089
- Yeah.
- So...

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.064
- So...
- Yeah.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.499
What's the weather
gonna be like this--

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:08.202
[squawking]

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.137
[dog barking in the distance]

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.772
Sorry.
It's, uh...

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:13.106
[sighs]

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.541
We're having
a barbecue this weekend,

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.376
and I don't want to stress
about the weather.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.111
- No, of course you don't.
- We just--Yeah.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:19.413
Yeah.
You know, yeah.

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:22.082
[clears throat]

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.825
This three-bean
casserole is--

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.095
[scatting]

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:38.098
I'm so sorry, babe.
I just--

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.100
- I hadn't tasted them yet.
- I'm sorry.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.803
- I'm sorry.
- Really looking forward to it.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.104
You know?

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.706
Don't talk about
the ingredients, I know.

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:46.473
It's a surprise
for your mouth.

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:49.409
- Yeah.
- Really.

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:56.350
Oh, uh...

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:58.285
[laughs]

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:00.721
You know that
commercial with--

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:02.422
Okay, never--

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:04.424
Oh.

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:05.559
[laughs]

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.060
[laughing]
Okay.

00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:12.699
(woman)
Never mind.

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.601
That's probably best.

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:18.105
- Yeah.
- [clears throat]

00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:22.376
Oh.

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.581
No, it's fine.

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:35.088
- Cheesecake.
- [gasps]

00:02:35.122 --> 00:02:36.557
- What?
- Huh?

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.625
We got cheesecake.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:39.660
- I mean...
- Oh, yeah.

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:42.262
No, I'd love
some cheesecake.

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:42.829
- Yeah.
- Let's do that.

00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:43.730
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:44.798
All right,
what the hell?

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:45.866
- Okay, cheesecake.
- Cheesecake.

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.136
I mean, I've been watching
my cholesterol intake,

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.237
but what the hell, right?

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.472
We're all gonna die
someday anyway.

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:53.473
- What?
- Honey.

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:54.541
- Wow.
- Come on.

00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:55.242
Are you
kidding me?

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.778
You just ruin it
every time!

00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:58.812
I'll see you
at home.

00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:00.047
- But wait a second.
- So rude!

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:01.114
Now, how would you not know
that that was taking place?
