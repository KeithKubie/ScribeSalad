00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.895
 You need wood fire to ignite, you need auto oil to move, 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.885
 And you need food to support every aspect of your life. 

00:00:08.885 --> 00:00:13.790
 So what happens to your body if you suddenly stop eating? 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.540
 To understand what happens to the body without food, 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.580
 First we need to understand what happens when you eat. 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.660
 The process begins from the sun, which gives its energy to photosynthesis and plants, 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.820
 Then we consume that stored chemical energy, 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.480
 Either directly by eating plants such as tomatoes, 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.280
 Or by eating an animal, such as a chicken that feeds on herbs and grains. 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.119
 If we take the hamburger as an example 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.180
 You will absorb fat from fat-filled sauces, 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.040
 A protein of beef, 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.900
 And carbohydrates from a slice of bread. 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.620
 Then your digestive system uses several processes such as chewing, stomach acid and enzymes, 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.780
 To break the food into particles small enough so that you can absorb it into the bloodstream. 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.160
 Excess glucose is stored in the liver and muscles in the form of glycogen, 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.280
 While some are converted to fat. 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.800
 You can visually see some fat stores in those fat parts of your body. 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.860
 There are about 37 trillion cells in your body, 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.080
 These cells begin to collect energy from food and put it into the mitochondria. 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.760
 This is where the glucose and fat cracking has been to the acetyl acetate A. 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.920
 Then start the citric acid cycle, 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.100
 Where they are continuously rotated to release large amounts of energy carrying the particles. 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.200
 The energy of these molecules is then used to pump protons, 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.240
 In a layer of mitochondria becoming dense and surrounded by protons, 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.900
 Making it need to deploy in a less crowded area, 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.460
 It does this through a protein called adenosine triphosphate. 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.900
 As a result, adenosine triphosphate, the most important source of energy in your body, 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.520
 You use about 10 ⁵ molecules of adenosine triphosphate every day. 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.000
 When adenosine triphosphate degrades adenosine diphosphate in your body, 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.780
 The bond is broken and energy is excreted. The detachable energy helps several things, such as electrons that form bonds, 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.180
 Essentially, you support all aspects of your ability to live. 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.100
 If you stop eating, within 6 hours your body will break down glycogen into glucose, 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.720
 The fat will be broken down into acetyl A, and this is done to maintain vital processes, 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.000
 This is very normal, but after 72 hours, 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.920
 Your body will need to break down protein to create glucose from amino acids, 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.300
 Otherwise your brain will starve. 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.780
 This happens because the fat used for energy can not cross the blood-brain barrier, 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.300
 Since a person does not consume vitamins and minerals, people may get sick within a week. 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.760
 After several weeks of hunger, fat stores are depleted, 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.180
 All that remains of energy is protein. 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.420
 At this point basic proteins are used to survive, such as antibodies used to fight infection, 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.820
 Or muscle proteins used for strength - will be used by the body to make glucose. 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.040
 The loss of essential proteins may lead to serious diseases. 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.140
 Death may approach a rate of up to three weeks to 70 days, 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.860
 Usually a heart attack due to deterioration of the tissues in the heart, diaphragm and body. 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.640
 One factor in the length of your life is the extent of your body's moisture, 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.300
 As well as the number of stores fatty. 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.780
 Although it is amazing to think that you may stop eating this day, 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.620
 And that she is likely to live for another 70 days, 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.720
 But please, do not try this at home.
