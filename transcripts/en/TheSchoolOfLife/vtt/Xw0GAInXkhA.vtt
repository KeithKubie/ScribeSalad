00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.569
At the centre of our societies is a hugely
inventive force dedicated to nudging us towards

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.650
a heightened appreciation of certain aspects
of the world. With enormous skill, it throws

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.490
into relief the very best sides of particular
places and objects. It uses wordsmiths and

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.160
image makers of near genius, who can create
deeply inspiring and beguiling associations

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.500
and position works close to our eyelines at
most moments of the day. Advertising is the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.800
most compelling agent of mass appreciation
we have ever known. Because advertising is

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.290
so ubiquitous, it can be easy to forget that
– of course – only a very few sorts of

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.930
things ever get advertised. Almost nothing
in the world is in a position to afford the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.149
budgets required by a campaign; advertising
is a form of love overwhelmingly reserved

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:02.059
for those wealthy potentates of modern life:
nappies, cereal bars, conditioners, hand sanitisers

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:09.720
and family sedans. This has a habit of skewing
our priorities. One of our major flaws as

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.150
animals, and a big contributor to our unhappiness,
is that we are very bad at keeping in mind

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.210
the real ingredients of fulfilment. We lose
sight of the value of almost everything that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.479
is readily to hand, we’re deeply ungrateful
towards anything that is free or doesn’t

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.159
cost very much, we trust in the value of objects
more than ideas or feelings, we are sluggish

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.090
in remembering to love and to care – and
are prone to racing through the years forgetting

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.550
the wonder, fragility and beauty of existence.
It’s fortunate, therefore, that we have

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.810
art. One way to conceive of what artists do
is to think that they are, in their own way,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.200
running advertising campaigns; not for anything
expensive or usually even available for purchase,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.220
but for the many things that are at once of
huge human importance and constantly in danger

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.259
of being forgotten. In the early part of the
twenty-first century, the English artist David

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.741
Hockney ran a major advertising campaign for
trees. image03

David Hockney, Three Trees Near Thixendale,
2007

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.689
At the start of the sixteenth century, the
German painter Albrecht Dürer launched a

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.680
comparable campaign to focus our minds on
the value of grass.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.620
And in the 1830s, the Danish artist Christen
Kobke did a lot of advertising for the sky,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.880
especially just before or after a rain shower.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.459
In the psychological field, the French painter
Pierre Bonnard carried out an exceptionally

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.060
successful campaign for tenderness, turning
out hundreds of images of his partner, Marthe,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.440
viewed through lenses of sympathy, concern
and understanding.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.700
In an associated move, the American painter
Mary Cassatt made a pretty good case for the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.160
world-beating importance of spending bits
of one’s life with a child.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.760
These were all acts of justice, not condescension.
They were much needed correctives to the way

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.280
that what we call ‘glamour’ is so often
located in unhelpful places: in what is rare,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.609
remote, costly or famous. If advertising images
are to blame for instilling a sickness in

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.290
our souls, the images of artists are what
can reconcile us with our realities and reawaken

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.900
us to the genuine, but too-easily forgotten
value, of particular bits of our lives. Consider

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.400
Chardin’s Woman Taking Tea. The sitter’s
dress might be a bit more elaborate than is

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.629
normal today; but the painted table, teapot,
chair, spoon and cup could all be picked up

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.769
at a flea market. The room is studiously plain.
And yet the picture is glamorous – it makes

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:50.010
this ordinary occasion and the simple furnishings,
seductive. It invites the beholder to go home

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.839
and create their own live version. The glamour
is not a false sheen that pretends something

00:03:55.839 --> 00:04:01.329
lovely is going on when it isn’t. Chardin
recognises the worth of a modest moment and

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.460
marshalls his genius to bring its qualities
to our notice.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.660
It lies in the power of art to honour the
elusive but real value of ordinary life. It

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.310
may teach us to be more just towards ourselves
as we endeavour to make the best of our circumstances:

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.319
a job we do not always love, the imperfections
of age, our frustrated ambitions and our attempts

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:31.730
to stay loyal to irritable but loved families.
Art can do the opposite of glamourise the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:38.840
unattainable; it can reawaken us to the genuine
merit of life as we’re forced to lead it.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.960
It is advertising for the things we really
need.
