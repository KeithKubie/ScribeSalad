00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:55.745
You're winning.

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:57.283
You're like making a mockery of

my normally devastating return game.

00:00:59.284 --> 00:01:00.276
Why are you emoting?

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:02.582
- My dad got me with this
super top notch agency

00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:06.036

fuck load of opportunities.

00:01:06.036 --> 00:01:09.936

but, like, do you know
what an audition is?

00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:16.803
You have to like drive there and like

00:01:18.714 --> 00:01:19.547
- Hey, you guys done?

00:01:40.158 --> 00:01:41.826
Like, you look like a talent.

00:01:41.826 --> 00:01:44.942
I feel sort of like lost, you know

00:01:44.942 --> 00:01:48.196

- Yeah, I'm sorry, that driving

00:01:58.822 --> 00:02:00.040

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.932
Why don't you just like not go, you know?

00:02:02.932 --> 00:02:06.842

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:08.217

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:10.742
What the fuck was that?

00:02:10.742 --> 00:02:11.880
- That's game.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.380
- Fuck, fucking piece of shit.

00:02:15.258 --> 00:02:16.764

It's pretty messed up man.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.120

00:02:58.001 --> 00:02:59.951
- Oh, I'm sorry, dad.

00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:03.165

and I gotta say, I'm floating on air.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.967
The first time in my life, it was like

00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:26.892
I wasn't just fucking, I was making love.

00:03:26.892 --> 00:03:27.725

- Fuck, ow dude.

00:03:36.546 --> 00:03:38.340
Stop serving so hard.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.628
- I don't want to say
that I'm in love with her,

00:03:40.628 --> 00:03:44.577
but, I'm definitely
falling in love with her.

00:03:44.577 --> 00:03:45.575
- Fuck.

00:03:45.575 --> 00:03:47.200
Jesus, Andre Agassi.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.461
About Carolyn like she's my sister.

00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:51.741
I've watched her fuck
up like a hundred guys.

00:03:51.741 --> 00:03:53.287
You just fucked her once.

00:03:53.287 --> 00:03:55.608
I'm not gonna let her do that
to my best friend, all right?

00:03:55.608 --> 00:03:56.871
- If you were my best friend

00:03:56.871 --> 00:03:58.332
you would want me to be happy.

00:03:58.332 --> 00:03:59.970
I want something with substance, dude.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.053
You had that.

00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:04.361
- And she died, dude.

00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:06.393
- Yeah, I'm aware dude, you never

00:04:06.393 --> 00:04:08.593

- Fuck you dude!

00:04:09.443 --> 00:04:11.486
- Ow dude! Aaaah.

00:04:11.486 --> 00:04:12.970
- Dude, I'm sorry, but you're not supposed

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.704
to talk shit of the dead dude.

00:04:14.704 --> 00:04:16.587
- What the hell's going on in here?

00:04:16.587 --> 00:04:17.794
Do I smell weed?

00:04:17.794 --> 00:04:18.944
[Both] Fuck you.

00:04:18.944 --> 00:04:20.734

00:04:22.114 --> 00:04:23.660
- I don't know, are we?

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.123
