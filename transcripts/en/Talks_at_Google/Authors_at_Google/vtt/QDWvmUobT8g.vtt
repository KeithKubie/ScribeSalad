CHET HAASE: Donuts and coffee.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.490
So we wanted to give this
talk because we like talking

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.490
about donuts and coffee.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.490
More specifically, we're going
to talk about self-publishing,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.320
if anyone's curious about
that, and talk about the books

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.960
that we self-published
in particular.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.695
The process of self-publishing,
the pain and turmoil

00:00:15.695 --> 00:00:17.640
of doing e-publishing.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.530
And we were thinking
that we would call

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.860
it self-publishing for fun.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.820
Profit doesn't
really enter into it

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.960
unless you pursue it a
lot harder than we do.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.442
ALON HALEVY: Or if you daydream.

00:00:28.442 --> 00:00:29.150
CHET HAASE: Yeah.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.920
I daydreamed when I
originally published,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.740
of actually making
money at it, and then I

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.620
realized that if you don't
actually market your book,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.900
it doesn't magically
happen somehow.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.526
Things don't go viral
on their own it--

00:00:39.526 --> 00:00:40.566
ALON HALEVY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.860
CHET HAASE: --turns out.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.470
So there's alternative
titles that we

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.830
thought of for the
presentation, how

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.090
to turn $20,000 into a
warehouse full of books.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.260
That was your personal
experience I believe.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.968
ALON HALEVY: It was
a bit more than that.

00:00:54.544 --> 00:00:55.460
CHET HAASE: Excellent.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.560
AUDIENCE: What was the dollars?

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.970
ALON HALEVY: More than $20,000.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.370
CHET HAASE: But you didn't need
that money for anything anyway.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.390
Also, writing is the easy part.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.740
Turns out the process
of actually publishing,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.267
especially all the
follow-on things

00:01:10.267 --> 00:01:12.600
like do you want to get it
in that store, in this thing,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.100
in the marketing thing we
haven't completely figured out.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.200
Those are all real work.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.090
The writing's just the fun part
that you do at the beginning.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.590
And also, who says you need
marketing to sell products,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.006
and it turns out
that we say that.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:25.570
ALON HALEVY: We will say that.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.070
CHET HAASE: And I
had nothing better

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.500
to do with my weekends
and all of that spare time

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.316
that I spent actually whipping
these things into shape to do

00:01:32.316 --> 00:01:32.330
this.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.121
ALON HALEVY: I thought
you work on Android.

00:01:36.624 --> 00:01:38.020
Do you have weekends?

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.600
CHET HAASE: No comment.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.990
I thought that it would
be appropriate to start

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.240
with a reading.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.465
ALON HALEVY: Do you want to--

00:01:49.465 --> 00:01:50.340
CHET HAASE: If I may.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.170
This is going to
be somewhat solemn,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.450
but we'll see how this goes.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.710
"Donut and coffee,
together again.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.446
I haven't had these two
since I don't know when.

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:04.320
But wait, just last
Friday before the weekend

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.111
I had three or
four or five then."

00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:11.360
I don't know why this is here.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.068
ALON HALEVY: OK, this
is my introduction.

00:02:13.068 --> 00:02:16.380
So Chet is too humble,
way too humble.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.070
And this is my excuse,
this is my explanation

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.870
for why he's going to be funnier
than me during this talk.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.460
So he is actually the official
winner of the unofficial title

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.080
of the funniest man
in Silicon Valley,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.750
and I believe he got this
through an official/unofficial

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.290
competition.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.027
CHET HAASE: Yeah, it's what some
of these people actually saw.

00:02:38.027 --> 00:02:40.110
ALON HALEVY: So you know
what we're talking about.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.776
CHET HAASE: Yes.

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:42.150
So-- There's no pressure.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.110
ALON HALEVY: No pressure on me.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.990
CHET HAASE: I'm just
shifting blame, as it were.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.076
So we were going to talk
about various phases-- hey,

00:02:54.076 --> 00:02:54.985
look at that!

00:02:54.985 --> 00:02:56.110
Let's talk about our books.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.110
Why don't you add a slide
about your books here?

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.690
So I want to write
a book about coffee.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.740
I wrote three
comedy books so far,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.280
mostly the one
about donuts today.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.820
There's various stages in the
process of actually developing

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.069
the idea and writing this
thing, and then figuring out

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.457
how to publish it, and then
figure out e-publishing,

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.290
so we're going to sort
of walk through these

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.830
and compare and contrast.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.990
We went different routes.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.656
I do think that it's
interesting to look

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:20.580
at the-- do a high
design thing and then do

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.300
a pre-buy of a bunch
of books route,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.200
versus the print on demand,
which makes this much more

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.960
approachable and
cheap for people that

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.030
don't have more than $20,000
to populate a storage

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.320
thing with books.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.120
ALON HALEVY: It's in
the USA, Kentucky.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.620
OK.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.328
CHET HAASE: OK, well,
it's cheaper there.

00:03:38.328 --> 00:03:38.980
So go.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.646
ALON HALEVY: OK.

00:03:39.646 --> 00:03:41.820
So my book is "The Infinite
Emotions of Coffee."

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.220
it's sitting there on the table.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.409
It's a book about
coffee and culture.

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.950
So the reason I
wrote this book was I

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.370
realized that everywhere
I travel in the world,

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.580
I get different cultural
experiences when

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.969
I go to different cafes.

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.260
And so I figured nobody-- I
couldn't figure out anybody

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.426
who wrote a book about this.

00:03:58.426 --> 00:04:00.950
I figured somebody has
to do it, so I did it.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.620
I traveled to
about 30 countries.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.190
I talked to farmers,
roasters, baristas,

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.010
all kinds of eclectic people
in the coffee industry.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.530
I drank a lot of
coffee-- a lot of coffee.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.550
I can now drink 10 cups
of coffee within a day

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.180
and not have my head explode.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.820
And this is the
result of the book.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.339
I mean this is the result.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.900
And if you don't
believe me, you want

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.692
to believe Vint Cerf, the
inventor of the internet,

00:04:26.692 --> 00:04:31.930
who I want to say reached
out to me to have his quote

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.460
on the back of the book.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.970
It's not exactly
the way it went.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.595
CHET HAASE: Go ahead
and say it anyway.

00:04:36.595 --> 00:04:37.460
He's not here.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.668
ALON HALEVY: He was involved.

00:04:40.137 --> 00:04:41.970
For those of you who
are not caffeinated up,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.240
I'll read this out. "The
histories of communication--"

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.740
Get it?

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.530
Communication.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.560
Internet.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.060
Vint Cerf.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.620
"And coffee's impact
on socialization

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.660
are interconnected.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.100
From the combined perspectives
of a computer scientist--"

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.870
That's me.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.290
"And the coffee culturalist--"
I guess that's me too.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.945
"This book elucidates--"
this is really funny.

00:05:01.945 --> 00:05:03.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.917
CHET HAASE: Never
read this before.

00:05:05.917 --> 00:05:07.500
ALON HALEVY: "How
coffee conversations

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.210
have evolved from the
age of exploration

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.127
that characterize
the 15th century--"

00:05:14.127 --> 00:05:15.710
CHET HAASE: "Through
the 15th century,

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.400
through the
Information Age where

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.020
the Internet
spheres of influence

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.609
in the world of
coffee continue--"

00:05:20.609 --> 00:05:21.650
ALON HALEVY: "To expand."

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.220
CHET HAASE: --"to expand."

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.950
It's beautiful.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.939
That's beautiful.

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:26.230
Did he know that he wrote that?

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.083
Did he actually just
have someone who

00:05:28.083 --> 00:05:30.082
works for him write this thing?

00:05:30.082 --> 00:05:31.540
Or was it just like
algorithmically

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.340
generated on some [INAUDIBLE]?

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.999
ALON HALEVY: It's actually
more complicated than that.

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:38.540
But I'm not sure I
should go into it.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.320
He said yes.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.424
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:43.424 --> 00:05:45.590
CHET HAASE: From one of the
programming books that I

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.410
did when we wrote
about Java and Swing,

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.550
we got James Gosling to
agree to do a forward to it,

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.470
which if you're going to publish
a Java book is pretty huge.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.660
That was fantastic.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.280
Except for the part where
he never actually did it,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.789
and we got down to like,
well, the publisher's

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:02.580
going to actually print
the books tomorrow,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.470
so it's too late.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.060
We'll have somebody else,
like my dog, write something,

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.170
and I said, thanks, James,
but we really need to move on.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.000
And then he quickly
sent me something

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.470
that was clear that it
would work for the book

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.887
and that he hadn't actually
read any page of the book.

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:18.470
Had no idea what it
was, but it didn't

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.720
matter because we got James
Gosling's name on the book

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.460
cover.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.860
ALON HALEVY: That really
generated a lot of--

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.130
CHET HAASE: I don't really know.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.990
I'm still getting
royalties from a book

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.080
on an obsolete technology
that's eight years old.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.790
So maybe that's due to him?

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.180
So the book that I wrote
was "Round and Holy."

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.750
It's poems, and they
actually manage to rhyme,

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.960
and they're about donuts,
because, you know, why not?

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.970
I also brought in an illustrator
friend of mine, an artist

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.940
that I knew for
years and years and I

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.562
love his sort of
black sense of humor.

00:06:51.562 --> 00:06:53.520
And I thought wouldn't
it be fun to actually do

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.500
a project with someone else.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.380
So instead of just me
doing words, words, words,

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.110
I brought this friend in.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.610
He came in for the weekend, we
just sort of jammed on ideas,

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.990
and he did a bunch of
pictures for the book.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.322
So this was a departure
from my previous books

00:07:04.322 --> 00:07:06.530
where it was basically just
like me wrapping up stuff

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.180
that I posted on
my blog or wherever

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.760
and putting it out
as fast as I can.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.970
This one was collecting the
words and sort of designing it

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.130
around the pictures that sort of
illustrated what was going on,

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.570
because I think there's nothing
more tedious than a poetry

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.419
book that's just words.

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:25.460
So we thought maybe it
would be a little more fun

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.400
if it actually had pictures
to go along with the words.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.652
I wanted to break
here and do a--

00:07:30.652 --> 00:07:32.360
ALON HALEVY: I hope
this one will be more

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.340
upbeat than the previous poem.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.340
CHET HAASE: It's poetry.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.310
Poetry's not meant to be
upbeat or very serious.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.470
"The problem's not
solved by a donut or few,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.466
and even those problems
are solved by two."

00:07:45.466 --> 00:07:49.765
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:49.765 --> 00:07:52.361
So we have a little bit of
background in real publishing

00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:52.860
as well.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.410
This fed into, well, could
we do a book on something

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.160
that we're actually
interested by instead?

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.900
So years ago, I wrote this
Swing book, a programming

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.970
book [INAUDIBLE], and I
spent six or nine months sort

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.180
of writing and editing,
and editing, and editing,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.929
and editing, and
editing, and finally they

00:08:08.929 --> 00:08:09.844
published the thing.

00:08:09.844 --> 00:08:11.010
It's actually still selling.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.385
I don't know who
is buying a book

00:08:12.385 --> 00:08:13.950
in this obsolete technology.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.500
I followed that up about
four years later by a book

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.860
on Flex, which seemed like a
really good idea at the time,

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.230
and then the platform
died within about a year.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.459
Not a lot of people
buying that book.

00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:26.000
These were both a
whole lot of work--

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.110
we were working with
real publishers.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.930
To a great extent, "Flex 4
Fun" was a smaller publisher,

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.159
but there was real
editors working

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.289
on this thing in
these specific formats

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.669
that they needed
you do things in.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:42.789
This is in direct
opposition to the process

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:46.220
that I used for the books
that I self-published.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:46.970
ALON HALEVY: Yeah.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.178
So I wrote actually in
parallel with the coffee book.

00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:51.200
I wrote a book about
data integration.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.700
You'll see it over
there on the left

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.910
with two of my former Ph.D.
students, which didn't make it

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.710
less work than
writing it on my own.

00:09:00.614 --> 00:09:02.780
Yeah, this was published
by Morgan Kaufmann I think.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.192
Is that the MK on the cover?

00:09:05.192 --> 00:09:05.900
CHET HAASE: Sure.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:06.890
Yeah.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.560
ALON HALEVY: It took
about five years.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.170
550 pages of--

00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:13.500
CHET HAASE: Words.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.375
ALON HALEVY: --words.

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:15.840
Theorems, too.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.471
CHET HAASE: Yeah.

00:09:17.471 --> 00:09:17.970
Equations.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.850
Yeah, if anybody wants to
write a technical book,

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.562
I would suggest you
don't, unless you really,

00:09:25.562 --> 00:09:27.770
really want to spend a long
time with that technology

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.230
and not actually get much
out of it in the end.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.470
People will buy these things.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.640
There's a little
more discrete thing

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.006
they are purchasing than the
random interest topic that

00:09:37.006 --> 00:09:39.130
gets you to write the coffee
book or the humor book

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.070
or whatever.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.536
But the amount of effort you
put into programming books

00:09:43.536 --> 00:09:45.910
right now compared to the
number of people that buy books

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.530
specifically, that market
basically evaporated

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.540
around the year 2000.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.450
People look out on Stack
Overflow and copy and paste

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:54.950
stuff.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.560
They look for free
content on blogs

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.980
and wherever they can find it.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.980
And they're not really
turning to books anymore.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.925
So they still exist.

00:10:01.925 --> 00:10:03.800
People will still pick
up books occasionally,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.880
but it's sort of depressing
to put that much of your life

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.899
into projects right now just to
have not many people actually

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:10.440
pick them up.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.108
So I've been planning to write
an Android book for years now

00:10:13.108 --> 00:10:13.733
and I haven't--

00:10:13.733 --> 00:10:14.340
ALON HALEVY: It won't happen.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.600
CHET HAASE: --because of that.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:15.980
What's that?

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.813
ALON HALEVY: You don't
want to kill Android.

00:10:17.813 --> 00:10:19.782
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:19.782 --> 00:10:22.240
CHET HAASE: It was pointed out
that both of these platforms

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.900
did actually start a steep
decline after our books came

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.924
out.

00:10:26.924 --> 00:10:28.840
ALON HALEVY: So actually
with data integration

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.051
that's not the case.

00:10:30.051 --> 00:10:30.800
Data integration--

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.855
CHET HAASE: It's still new data.

00:10:31.855 --> 00:10:33.646
ALON HALEVY: Data
integration is guaranteed

00:10:33.646 --> 00:10:36.990
to be a problem
that will interest

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.510
about 17 people in the world
at any given point in time

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.840
for the foreseeable future.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.365
And there's no other book
about it, guaranteed.

00:10:45.365 --> 00:10:48.344
CHET HAASE: So people could
write other books on data for--

00:10:48.344 --> 00:10:49.010
ALON HALEVY: No.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.635
Yeah, other books on data,
but not data integration.

00:10:50.635 --> 00:10:51.920
You don't want to
compete with that.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.545
CHET HAASE: No.

00:10:52.545 --> 00:10:53.350
No.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.830
ALON HALEVY: No.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.100
CHET HAASE: OK, so the big
ideas behind the books.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.480
ALON HALEVY: Big idea?

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:58.960
CHET HAASE: Do you
have to big idea?

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.890
ALON HALEVY: Did you meant--
Did you say something about--

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.820
Did we have to have a
big idea to come here?

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.111
CHET HAASE: Make one up now.

00:11:06.111 --> 00:11:06.610
Go.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.400
ALON HALEVY: A big idea.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:08.900
Wow.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.400
OK.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.790
How big does it have to be?

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.310
CHET HAASE: Medium.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.210
ALON HALEVY: So my idea
was to travel the world.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.240
So I was doing a lot of
traveling even before I start

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.880
writing this book because I do
a lot of-- I give a lot of talks

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.520
all over the world,
so I go places,

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.550
and I realized that
everywhere I go,

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.440
I actually go and sit
in cafes because that's

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.270
where I get to see
the people, I get

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.464
to try the different Wi-Fi
networks and stuff like that.

00:11:39.464 --> 00:11:40.630
And so that's how I started.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.670
And then the idea
of the book was

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.300
to actually explore that at
scale, because everything

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.530
we do at Google we do at scale.

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.750
So scale doesn't
just come like that.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.520
It's actually hard work.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:58.470
So this is an example of--
this is an Irish coffee which

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:02.460
is a combination of
espresso, cream, and whiskey.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:08.510
This is made by an Icelandic--
the Icelandic Irish coffee

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.629
champion who--

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:12.420
CHET HAASE: I didn't
know that was a thing.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.120
OK.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.995
All right, there's
categories for everything.

00:12:14.995 --> 00:12:15.994
Great.

00:12:15.994 --> 00:12:17.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.420
CHET HAASE: What's that?

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.344
AUDIENCE: The funniest
man in Silicon Valley.

00:12:20.344 --> 00:12:21.010
CHET HAASE: Yes.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.040
Exactly.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:22.540
Thanks.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.110
ALON HALEVY: You have to be a
little bit more open-minded.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.576
You can't just be funny.

00:12:25.576 --> 00:12:26.575
This guy's very serious.

00:12:26.575 --> 00:12:28.580
So this is an interesting
story, because I

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.620
went to the world barista
championship, which

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.270
is an event that
happens every year.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:38.570
And this guy's daughter was
the Icelandic barista champion.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:44.082
His son was the Icelandic
coffee tasting champion,

00:12:44.082 --> 00:12:45.790
which is-- there's a
competition on that.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:47.831
And so he felt he needed
to do something in order

00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:49.720
to hang out with his children.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.530
And so he saw there
was an opening

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:56.210
to compete for the Icelandic
Irish coffee championship--

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.820
CHET HAASE: And it turns out
he was the only contestant.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.861
ALON HALEVY: Actually no.

00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:02.577
He was one of six, so he made
it to the finals by default.

00:13:02.577 --> 00:13:04.910
But then he won and he actually
did better than his kids

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.360
in the world championship.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.100
He scored eighth in the world.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.010
And so I came to him-- and
this was in London in the world

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.509
championship-- and
I said, you know,

00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:13.620
I need to write about
you guys in my book

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.350
because you make a great story.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.820
So he said, well, why don't
you come visit us in Iceland?

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.372
And I was like, OK.

00:13:22.372 --> 00:13:24.330
So I bought a ticket to
Iceland and the weekend

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.010
after I was in Iceland in
this little town called

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.500
Selfoss, Iceland, which is
mostly known for the place

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:35.570
where Bobby Fischer the
famous chess player died.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.850
CHET HAASE: OK.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:42.050
ALON HALEVY: So there I was in
a little house-- their summer

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:47.010
house-- and he was making
Irish coffee for everybody.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.330
And this is my big idea.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:50.830
I have more.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.330
So then I went-- this
is an exploration.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.880
This is in Ethiopia, the
birthplace of coffee,

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.377
where I had to see
the real growers.

00:14:00.377 --> 00:14:01.210
This is interesting.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:05.210
So what these guys are doing
is they're smoking khat.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:09.660
Khat is a plant that is
a competitor to coffee

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.080
in the sense that it's easier
to grow multiple times a year.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.600
And if you chew enough
of it, you get stoned.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.910
And so the value
proposition was much higher.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.522
In fact, most people--
the Yemenite economy

00:14:24.522 --> 00:14:25.980
was basically ruined
because people

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.740
are smoking khat all day.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.550
So I wanted a picture
of people smoking khat

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.200
in Ethiopia, so I
actually hired these guys

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.570
to sit there and chew this
thing for an hour, which was not

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:39.700
hard to convince them to do.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.650
And this the photo.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.206
This is my big idea.

00:14:45.206 --> 00:14:46.580
CHET HAASE: The
actor is from LA.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.000
Hired them-- flew
them to Ethiopia.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.666
ALON HALEVY: No, I
couldn't afford that.

00:14:49.666 --> 00:14:52.890
And there's a long story
about why I got to Bosnia

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.330
as part of my research.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:55.075
I'll skip that.

00:14:55.075 --> 00:14:55.700
CHET HAASE: OK.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:56.960
ALON HALEVY: Because
we only have one hour.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.900
CHET HAASE: Yes.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.390
ALON HALEVY: But as you can
see, this woman is Laila.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.140
She's a friend of a
friend of a friend who

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.260
I met through a
person who argued

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.787
that I should go to Bosnia
to try out the coffee there.

00:15:10.787 --> 00:15:13.120
So what I did was the way I
got into the coffee industry

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.760
was I bribed people.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.068
I would buy them Google--

00:15:17.068 --> 00:15:18.460
CHET HAASE: Cake.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.110
ALON HALEVY: No.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.056
Hats and sweaters and t-shirts.

00:15:22.056 --> 00:15:24.180
At certain points, coffee
people would get together

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.150
and they would see
that they each had

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.140
a Google shirt or something and
they would form the connection.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.850
This was her birthday.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.950
Her mom baked her a Google
cake because my visit there

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:39.870
was such a big event.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.140
Anyway, that's my big idea.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:41.520
CHET HAASE: All right.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.395
ALON HALEVY: Now you
follow that [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:43.395 --> 00:15:44.840
CHET HAASE: I have huge ideas.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.230
So my ideas behind
the poetry book

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.310
were that I really liked donuts.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.090
Every Friday we bring in donuts.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:52.257
There's a little donut club.

00:15:52.257 --> 00:15:53.881
People bring in donuts
and we eat them,

00:15:53.881 --> 00:15:55.290
and it's a fantastic tradition.

00:15:55.290 --> 00:16:00.740
I like them actually a lot,
and I also like writing a lot.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.040
I like to think about funny
writing, clever writing, word

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.490
play, all of that stuff.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.450
And it dawned on
me at some point

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.450
a few years ago that poems
are like word puzzles,

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.610
and I happen to
like puzzles a lot.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.500
But you take the genesis
of an idea-- sometimes

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.694
it's an image that you have
that you'd like to convey.

00:16:22.694 --> 00:16:23.860
A lot of times it's a meter.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.943
I will have a phrase, a
sentence that occurs to me

00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:28.420
and I really like the
meter of that sentence

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.161
and I'd like to express
an idea around it.

00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:33.160
So it usually starts from
that one little nugget

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.701
and then I build
something around it.

00:16:34.701 --> 00:16:37.730
The puzzle is how can you get a
rhyme scheme and a meter scheme

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.660
to work and still get that
same idea across and remain

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.830
consistent and hold
to the original idea.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:48.320
And can you throw in other
things along the way,

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.810
like word plays,
and get the word

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.481
plays to occur at the right
time, at the end of a verse

00:16:52.481 --> 00:16:52.980
or whatever.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.790
And so I like all the mechanics
of actually putting the poems

00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.370
together so that they pull all
of these elements together.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:05.721
So the idea for the coffee
book began all over the world,

00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:06.220
apparently.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:06.928
ALON HALEVY: Yes.

00:17:06.928 --> 00:17:09.990
So I was trying out Google
Maps and I made a plan,

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:11.069
this is my plan.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:13.319
I put a green
thingamajig, marker,

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.530
everywhere I felt like
I needed to go in order

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:19.050
to fully understand the vast
majority of the coffee world.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.117
And I start executing.

00:17:21.117 --> 00:17:22.950
CHET HAASE: I should
have had a map for mine

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:26.790
that would have just had a
green marker in Pleasanton.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.100
ALON HALEVY: Yeah.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.150
So the process.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:36.110
So what I did was I
researched, I went somewhere,

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.580
I met with people,
I learned stuff,

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.160
and then I started writing.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.990
So I started in Google Docs
because that was the simplest

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.490
thing.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.640
I realized Google
Docs really sucks.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.590
Sorry-- this is being recorded.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.290
At the time, when
it started-- it

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.450
was the initial
days of Google Docs,

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.420
and it wasn't up to the
level that it is today.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.525
I would say also it is
not a publishing platform.

00:17:57.525 --> 00:18:01.649
It is a convenient way to
record basic text stuff

00:18:01.649 --> 00:18:03.440
and you've got to do
some basic formatting,

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.190
but actually doing a
book in there I think

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.024
is beyond the scope.

00:18:06.024 --> 00:18:06.773
ALON HALEVY: Yeah.

00:18:06.773 --> 00:18:07.690
So then I would start.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.898
I would think maybe I can
do it in Word because I can

00:18:09.898 --> 00:18:11.110
do a little formatting there.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:15.780
I gave up on that really quickly
because Word is really bad.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.150
And the engineer in me, or the
academic in me tried LaTeX.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:21.301
Have you heard of LaTeX?

00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:22.092
CHET HAASE: Uh-huh.

00:18:22.092 --> 00:18:22.594
Uh-huh.

00:18:22.594 --> 00:18:23.890
Uh-huh.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:26.550
ALON HALEVY: Because
in LaTeX, you

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:27.870
can actually get anything done.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.570
But then I thought that
maybe down the line

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:39.310
if I work with a publisher or
someone who will do my design,

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.240
they might not know LaTeX.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.700
CHET HAASE: You think?

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.974
ALON HALEVY: I wasn't sure.

00:18:44.974 --> 00:18:46.390
So then you write
and you rewrite.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.004
After a while I got
very good at this.

00:18:48.004 --> 00:18:50.170
So I would do my research
and I would start actually

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.240
writing the chapter on
a particular destination

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.830
before I left, so that
way the questions that I

00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.160
had when I got to the
destination were much clearer.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.600
So I didn't have any
preconceived ideas yet.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.780
But then I would write,
and then I would travel,

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.680
and then I would rewrite,
and that worked out better.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.820
So now if you ask me to
write about some coffee

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:17.602
region in the world, I'm a lean,
mean coffee writing machine.

00:19:17.602 --> 00:19:19.560
AUDIENCE: What did you
write at him at the end?

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:24.802
ALON HALEVY: In the end-- Huh?

00:19:24.802 --> 00:19:26.010
CHET HAASE: Was it in design?

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:26.718
ALON HALEVY: Yes.

00:19:26.718 --> 00:19:29.020
So in the end I gave all
the text to the designer

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:33.162
and I told her to
do the best she can.

00:19:33.162 --> 00:19:34.620
The book is actually--
if I may say

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.570
so myself because I didn't
do the design-- is beautiful.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:39.550
CHET HAASE: It's true.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.710
It's slightly higher
designs than mine.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:44.900
I used a different process.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.850
The donut book actually
started with two previous books

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.970
that I had.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.110
I had written a series
of essays on my blog

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.117
called "When I Am King--"
these silly ideas that I had.

00:19:54.117 --> 00:19:55.950
And eventually I wrapped
up a bunch of these

00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:01.110
into the book strangely
titled, "When I Am King."

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.080
I wrapped them up.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.390
I collected them all and
then I self-published this.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.410
I used-- Did I talk
about Word there.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:08.110
I used Word.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.290
I did not have that
problem with it.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:10.740
I have various
problems with Word,

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.750
but it did accomplish
what I needed it to.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.971
The images-- moving
things around in Word

00:20:17.971 --> 00:20:19.470
gets a little bit
funky, but it does

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.439
allow you to stylize the
text and the chapters

00:20:21.439 --> 00:20:22.980
and the headings
and stuff like that.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.938
You can have footnotes.

00:20:23.938 --> 00:20:26.430
You can do the basic publishing
stuff that you certainly

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.989
could not do in Docs.

00:20:27.989 --> 00:20:29.280
So that was good enough for me.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.240
Certainly sitting
on my own and--

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.615
ALON HALEVY: Well,
maybe when you

00:20:32.615 --> 00:20:35.610
do this there wasn't Docs yet.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.060
CHET HAASE: I guess
that might be the case.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.290
But I wouldn't use it
now either because I

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:42.650
depend on these things
to sort of put it

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.310
in book form, which is quite
different than online form.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.890
And then I kept writing these
silly essays on my blog.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.575
Eventually I wrote this second
book, I wrapped things up.

00:20:50.575 --> 00:20:53.830
I spent a little bit more time
sort of designing and putting

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:57.740
this thing together, but again,
using Word to do all the stuff.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.260
And then eventually
I started eating

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.590
a lot of donuts on Friday
and writing poems and odes

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:06.900
to those donuts because.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.485
And then I convinced this
artist friend of mine

00:21:09.485 --> 00:21:10.860
to actually fly
out to California

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.670
and do some pictures.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:12.993
And I kept trying
to tell him, Mark, I

00:21:12.993 --> 00:21:14.320
gotta make money on this thing.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.200
And he came anyway,
so that was great.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.900
One of the ideas that
I wanted to pursue here

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.380
was that I was very successful
at publishing comedy books that

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.330
didn't sell very well.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.520
And I thought if there's
any book in the world that

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.870
doesn't sell well, it's
a slim volume of poetry.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.620
So if I want the best
non-selling book in the world,

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.146
clearly I needed to
publish some poetry.

00:21:35.146 --> 00:21:36.020
So that's what I did.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.750
So now there's a
slim volume of poetry

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.610
that even more people can't buy.

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:41.340
So why--

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.036
ALON HALEVY: I
actually-- So Chet

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:45.910
is talking a lot about
donuts and he probably

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.430
feels guilty for talking
so much about donuts.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:50.150
CHET HAASE: Why?

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:50.816
ALON HALEVY: No.

00:21:50.816 --> 00:21:52.047
Maybe he's not.

00:21:52.047 --> 00:21:54.380
The interesting story behind
all of this, the reason why

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.338
this talk is happening
is because the two of us

00:21:56.338 --> 00:21:58.370
actually met at the gym.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:01.030
OK, so we actually work out
at the gym at the same hour

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.910
Monday, Wednesday,
Friday with George.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:06.540
And we realized both of us
have very similar experience

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.880
about books that haven't quite
hit the top, the "New York

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.949
Times" bestsellers yet, but
there's still room to grow.

00:22:15.949 --> 00:22:17.990
So it's not like we just
eat donuts all the time.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:19.662
We actually work out.

00:22:19.662 --> 00:22:21.620
CHET HAASE: Because we
eat donuts all the time.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:22.119
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:22.119 --> 00:22:23.580
So one engenders the other.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.330
ALON HALEVY: Yeah.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:25.225
CHET HAASE: I would
like to point out, too,

00:22:25.225 --> 00:22:27.250
I have another book
that I haven't talked

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.600
about today, which is a
number one "New York Times"

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.740
national bestseller.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.905
That's the working title,
but it's still in progress.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:42.236
ALON HALEVY: OK, so now it's
like-- Oh, so publishing.

00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:43.860
So I did spend some
time trying to find

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.560
a publisher for
my book, thinking

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.547
coffee is a topic
that should interest

00:22:49.547 --> 00:22:50.630
at least a billion people.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.480
And even if we get a
small chunk of that,

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:57.619
the publishers will be happy.

00:22:57.619 --> 00:22:59.160
So I talked to a
bunch of publishers.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.800
I even got an agent at some
point, like in New York City,

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.130
67th floor, on a street
with a number, an avenue

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.210
with a number in New York.

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:14.030
But then some of the
publishers, they really

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.670
looked deeply at the book.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.170
And they basically
said, I've looked

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.330
at your CV and your book.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:24.640
And they suggested very
kindly, very constructively,

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.082
that maybe I instead write
a book about big data.

00:23:28.082 --> 00:23:29.040
Which was a compliment.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.623
At least they thought
I know something

00:23:30.623 --> 00:23:34.750
about big data, which is nice.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.439
And since I was
already doing that,

00:23:37.439 --> 00:23:39.230
I didn't think I want
to write another one.

00:23:43.962 --> 00:23:45.670
The other thing about
the publisher side,

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:47.670
at some point I realized
that whatever publisher

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.210
I get either wouldn't be very
effective in terms of-- I

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.606
mean you could always get
a second rate publisher.

00:23:52.606 --> 00:23:55.872
Well, third rate-- but they
wouldn't provide much value,

00:23:55.872 --> 00:23:57.830
and they would take more
control than I wanted.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.130
And I wanted complete
control over this book,

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.750
which I didn't want to give up.

00:24:05.986 --> 00:24:08.110
CHET HAASE: On my side, I
heard this awesome quote.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.510
I was reading online
because a few years ago

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:12.551
I thought wouldn't it be
cool if I could actually

00:24:12.551 --> 00:24:13.590
sell some books.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.710
And somebody asked
a famous agent

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.210
that sells things
like comedy books,

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:20.830
they said, well, how would an
author get published and sell

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:21.330
books?

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.380
And the answer was be famous.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.000
Apparently that is the strategy.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.041
If you're selling something,
especially something

00:24:27.041 --> 00:24:29.580
as nebulous as humor,
the only reason

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.000
that people will pick it
up is because maybe it

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.680
strikes a particular
nerve, but more probably

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.930
because they know that person.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:37.684
They know that Tina
Fey is very funny

00:24:37.684 --> 00:24:39.100
and so they will
pick up her book.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.370
It turns out to be
a fantastic book,

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.920
but they probably wouldn't
have bought an autobiography

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.069
by someone they hadn't
heard of before.

00:24:46.069 --> 00:24:47.610
Similarly, they're
probably not going

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.250
to buy a book on
someone that wants

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:52.390
to become king if they haven't
heard of that person before.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:56.930
So it turns out that I don't
really have that going for me.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.005
So yeah, what do you get when
you take an unknown author

00:25:00.005 --> 00:25:02.130
an idea for a humor book
and queries the publishers

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:02.947
and agents.

00:25:02.947 --> 00:25:04.030
And the answer is nothing.

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.155
You get nothing whatsoever.

00:25:05.155 --> 00:25:06.696
So I'd send out
queries occasionally,

00:25:06.696 --> 00:25:07.630
I'd get no response.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.136
Or I would talk to my publisher
of my programming books

00:25:10.136 --> 00:25:11.510
and say, hey,
you're a publisher.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.880
You must know about this thing.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.630
What I really want to
write is-- and again, I

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:15.460
would get no response.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.168
They'd just be flummoxed
by the question.

00:25:17.168 --> 00:25:19.120
Like I publish
programming books.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.006
I really don't know how to
deal with your pet project.

00:25:22.006 --> 00:25:23.380
So at that point
of life, well, I

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.460
was really interested in
publishing my own thing

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:30.377
and it didn't really matter,
fortunately that I didn't

00:25:30.377 --> 00:25:32.710
have a publisher because all
of a sudden print on demand

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:36.700
and self-publishing became
a real thing a few years ago

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.849
where anybody could
start to do this.

00:25:38.849 --> 00:25:40.640
ALON HALEVY: I want to
point out, actually,

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.190
publishers who don't publish
your books come into two types.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:48.330
Those who will waste a
huge amount of your time

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:49.050
and not publish.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.560
And those who will tell
you right off the bat, no.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.090
OK?

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:55.719
I had both kinds.

00:25:55.719 --> 00:25:57.510
CHET HAASE: I just had
the single kind that

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:58.976
didn't actually get back to me.

00:25:58.976 --> 00:26:00.392
ALON HALEVY:
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:02.110
They still waste your
time, because you

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.400
need to write a nice email.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.850
CHET HAASE: It also takes
a fair amount of homework

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.350
even to reach those
people, to figure out

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:08.090
who they are to send
the query letters,

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.735
to actually try to get
in touch with them.

00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:13.312
I have a friend who came, he's
a refugee from the publishing

00:26:13.312 --> 00:26:15.020
industry, and he
suggested that you never

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.519
use a publisher anymore, because
a lot of what they're doing

00:26:17.519 --> 00:26:18.640
is actually busy work.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.140
They are sending
out press releases,

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.350
they're sending out
letters, they're sending out

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.431
information that
goes into the rags

00:26:24.431 --> 00:26:26.180
to get the reviews at
the right time year,

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.804
they're distributing the books,
they're getting the books back.

00:26:28.804 --> 00:26:31.710
It's basically the grunt
work of simply pushing

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:34.760
letters and communication
and books around.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.242
And he thought
it's much better--

00:26:36.242 --> 00:26:37.700
and then in the
meantime, they take

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.470
95% of the revenue
from the book,

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.860
and then the author
is left with not much.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.282
Which I agree with that.

00:26:44.282 --> 00:26:46.490
On the other hand, I don't
want to do the grunt work.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.060
Wouldn't it be nice if
someone else did it instead.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:49.600
Formatting.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.372
So the nitty-gritty of
actually writing this thing.

00:26:52.372 --> 00:26:53.080
ALON HALEVY: Yes.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.460
So after I finished writing
and rewriting and rewriting,

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.800
I found a designer through a
connection in coffee industry.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.700
Somebody who had actually
worked on "Barista" magazine,

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.177
the shirt that I'm wearing.

00:27:04.177 --> 00:27:06.510
So she actually had a lot of
connections in the industry

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.207
and she was able to find
photos that I didn't have.

00:27:09.207 --> 00:27:10.790
She actually had a
passion for coffee,

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:14.490
which is really good if you're
formatting a book about coffee.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.810
She lives in Portland,
so she was pretty cheap.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:18.525
Got it?

00:27:18.525 --> 00:27:21.490
She lives in Portland
so she was unexpensive.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:22.530
CHET HAASE: OK.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.600
ALON HALEVY: So
anyway, $3,500 got

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.400
me the whole design of the
book, which could be considered

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.420
the highlight of the process.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.890
She was in design.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:35.720
CHET HAASE: I did not pay.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.130
Instead I used Microsoft Word.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:38.220
Styles are very helpful.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.200
You can say this is the
title, this is a verse,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.970
and it sort of automatically
formats a bunch of stuff.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.810
And then you sort of dork around
moving images, stuff like that,

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.780
but fairly straightforward.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.010
There are templates
available from publishers.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:56.430
So I published-- all
three of my books

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.180
right now are going
through CreateSpace,

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.630
which is owned by Amazon.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.200
And they had
templates for things

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.170
like the interior
and the cover, so you

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.610
can say here's how
big my book is,

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.610
and they'll give you a
template for a cover that

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:09.880
matches that spine
size, as well as

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.160
the overall format of the book.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.560
And same thing for the interior.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.410
The donut book happens
to be a four by five,

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.230
and they have templates that
you can customize for that,

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:22.110
and then suck them
right into Word

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.610
and get the basics
of that going.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:27.010
So it didn't cost me anything
to format the entire book

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:27.630
by myself.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.100
Arguably, it is not as
pretty as the coffee book.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.580
And also it tends to take a lot
of time sort of futzing around

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.020
with Word to sort of
shoehorn it into the place

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.060
you want it to be with
the various styles.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.540
And then you change
things around

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.370
and that sort of normal thing.

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:46.130
So a little bit more work for
doing everything on your own,

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:47.190
obviously.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:48.190
Self-publishing process.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:49.606
This is where it
gets interesting.

00:28:49.606 --> 00:28:51.360
The sort of do you
print ahead of time

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.679
or do you do print on demand.

00:28:52.679 --> 00:28:53.470
ALON HALEVY: Right.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:58.940
So I was imagining sales
of many millions of copies.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:02.930
So I had to print ahead of time.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.620
So I found a publishing
house in Kentucky.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.570
OK, this was at the time where
doing anything in the USA

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:11.355
was considered patriotic.

00:29:14.807 --> 00:29:16.390
I could have done
it cheaper in China,

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:17.780
but then the
shipping costs would

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.520
have outweighed the benefit,
so I didn't do that.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.490
I may have printed
a bit too many.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:27.680
For some unclear
reasons, the contract

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.930
with the guys in Kentucky are
such that they don't charge me

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:36.420
for storing books, unless they
will tell me years later which

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.651
they haven't yet.

00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:38.900
So it working out pretty well.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.260
Whenever Amazon makes an
order I send them the order

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.070
and they send it to Amazon.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:46.840
And every now and then
I'll replenish my garage,

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.599
and it works out nicely.

00:29:48.599 --> 00:29:51.140
I contributed to their Christmas
fund, and their Easter fund,

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:54.045
and another Christmas fund.

00:29:54.045 --> 00:29:55.985
I'm doing good for Kentucky.

00:29:55.985 --> 00:29:58.610
CHET HAASE: The print on demand
model is quite a bit different.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:59.990
The best thing
about it, and this

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.931
is the reason why I would
say everybody can consider

00:30:02.931 --> 00:30:04.930
doing this if they want
to actually sort of have

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.260
a publishing project, is
there's nothing that you pay.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.930
All you pay is your time.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.030
So as long as you have the
software that you need,

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:12.613
you can write it in
whatever you want.

00:30:12.613 --> 00:30:14.480
You upload it in PDF format.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.340
So there was only the cost
of the computer resources

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.030
and the software
that I was using,

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:24.890
and then my time to actually
write and format this thing.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.610
The way the money works
out in print in demand,

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:28.800
it's built into the sale.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.350
So you tell them how much you
want to charge for the book

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.620
and it has to be
above some minimum

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:37.380
so that they can make the
raw cost from printing

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.300
the book back.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.110
So then they get
their raw cost back,

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:41.835
plus some percentage
of the rest,

00:30:41.835 --> 00:30:43.710
and then you get the
royalties that are left.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.168
So the more you
charge for the book

00:30:45.168 --> 00:30:47.020
the higher your royalties
are going to be,

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.644
and the more you're
going to scare away

00:30:48.644 --> 00:30:50.050
your potential customers.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.990
So the first time I
tried this Lulu.com

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.530
had a lot of good press,
so I went with them.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.120
It turns out they're
quite expensive.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.450
It was slightly higher
quality I thought

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.040
on the cover and the paper.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.190
But I ended up having to charge
a price for the book that

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.870
was basically asking
all of my friends

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:08.530
to buy my book as a favor
to me, which I really

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:09.829
didn't like that dynamic.

00:31:09.829 --> 00:31:11.370
Then they feel bad
because they don't

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:16.120
want to spend $13 on
a 170-page humor book.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.340
So I abandoned them when I heard
of CreateSpace because they're

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.264
much lower cost.

00:31:20.264 --> 00:31:21.680
I didn't have to
charge that much.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.140
I can basically get away
with the donut book is $4.95,

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:29.230
and then the humor books are
basically $6 and $7 each.

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.349
And I can do that because,
well, a) my royalties

00:31:32.349 --> 00:31:33.890
are really low
because that's kind of

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:35.850
irrelevant in this whole thing.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.450
But also that the cost of
them simply printing on demand

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:40.240
is so cheap.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.230
In particular, the dynamic that
pushes the price up, especially

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:45.920
for Lulu.com-- this
is one of things--

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.000
is if they wanted to
put it into a channel

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.110
so that people would
actually buy it somewhere,

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:53.050
which I thought was kind of
a requirement for a book.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:55.930
They basically need to
build in high enough price

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:59.840
because the retail place is
going to take half of that.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.340
So it has to be high enough
that the place that's selling it

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.050
is taking half of it, and then
all of their cost and profit

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:06.390
are built into the rest.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.930
With CreateSpace
you have the option

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:11.710
to only sell it through Amazon
and CreateSpace directly,

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:12.820
which is what I do.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.260
And so then there's
basically no retail cost.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:19.070
If I wanted it to be available
so that Barnes &amp; Nobles could

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:23.670
actually sell these books in the
two stores that they have left,

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.210
then I would have to
basically double that price.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:29.060
Then it would become
a $10, $12, $13 book

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.230
through CreateSpace as well.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:32.647
So I opted not to
do that, and now

00:32:32.647 --> 00:32:34.855
if people want to buy the
book they can go to Amazon.

00:32:34.855 --> 00:32:35.530
It works for me.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:37.155
ALON HALEVY: Then if
it were expensive,

00:32:37.155 --> 00:32:39.737
people would have an
excuse not to buy it.

00:32:39.737 --> 00:32:40.820
Now they're not buying it.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:41.528
CHET HAASE: True.

00:32:41.528 --> 00:32:44.530
Now I have to rationalize
that they just don't like me.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:45.422
ALON HALEVY: Yeah.

00:32:45.422 --> 00:32:46.380
CHET HAASE: OK, thanks.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.170
Thanks for that.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.830
Appreciate it.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.070
I think I explained this thing.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.600
Yeah, I did.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.992
So here's some of the numbers
involved with print on demand.

00:32:56.992 --> 00:32:58.450
So the first book
that I published,

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.110
it retails for $5.95.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.270
I will occasionally see
it on sale in Amazon.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.780
Sometimes it's $5.49,
sometimes it's $5.36.

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.130
I have no idea how
they set these prices.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.590
They can't be based on volume
because these books don't

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:10.840
hit volumes.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.900
But I think it's just whim.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.540
So it retails for $5.95.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.425
Out of that I get
a royalty of $0.68.

00:33:17.425 --> 00:33:18.800
And then you can
go in their site

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.091
and basically say what if I
charge $6 for it, what if I

00:33:21.091 --> 00:33:22.900
charge $5, and then
you can see how

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.890
that affects the royalty price.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:27.080
I basically wanted to
pick a price that was a 95

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.550
price, because everybody does.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.300
So basically $4.95, I think
I couldn't sell it that low.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.600
And $6.95 was too much.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.330
So $5.95, royalty of $0.68.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:40.574
If I buy it directly from
CreateSpace it's $2.89.

00:33:40.574 --> 00:33:42.740
This turns out to be a
pretty good thing, especially

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.110
in the world where it's
nice to give these gifts,

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.490
or sell them to people when
you go to coffee conventions

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:48.200
or whatever.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.230
And then at that point, you can
buy them much cheaper in bulk

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.977
and then just distribute
them however you want.

00:33:53.977 --> 00:33:55.560
The next book was a
little bit longer.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.420
ALON HALEVY: The
problem with gift

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.040
is you don't want
to give somebody

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.190
a gift that cost you $6.95.

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:01.740
That's like saying--

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.820
CHET HAASE: Here's $7.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:03.571
ALON HALEVY: Yeah.

00:34:03.571 --> 00:34:05.320
So that's why-- so
somebody gave me advice

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.460
when I was pricing my book.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.400
Make it expensive so if somebody
wants to buy it as a gift,

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.249
it's a nice gift.

00:34:10.249 --> 00:34:12.290
It has nothing to do with
the book itself, right.

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:13.449
It's just about the price.

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:13.679
CHET HAASE: OK.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.090
So I should jack the
price on my books.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:15.520
ALON HALEVY: $25.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.311
CHET HAASE: Thanks.

00:34:16.311 --> 00:34:17.315
Thanks for that.

00:34:17.315 --> 00:34:18.690
The next book was
more expensive.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:22.489
All their prices are determined
by how thick is the book.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:25.707
How many trees are they killing
every time they print one.

00:34:25.707 --> 00:34:27.790
So the next book I had to
charge a little bit more

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:29.590
for because it was
a little bit larger.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.020
So now it's $6.95 book.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.170
I make a massive
royalty of $0.85.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.850
I pay only $3.32 if I
want to buy them in bulk.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:37.540
And then the donut
book is much cheaper.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.050
It turns out if it's a
slim volume of poetry,

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:42.030
there's not many pages in it.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:44.190
So it retails for $4.95.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:47.449
Fairly pittance, $0.82 royalty.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:48.830
So that's how that works out.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:50.420
And then the author
price is $2.15.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.836
All of that's a
really good thing,

00:34:51.836 --> 00:34:54.684
except with CreateSpace you tend
to pay a bunch for shipping.

00:34:54.684 --> 00:34:56.850
I think this is where they
make some of their money,

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:58.940
just basically charging
you an arm and a leg

00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:59.750
when they ship you the book.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:01.200
So you have to figure
that in, and you also

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.600
have to figure in the
cost of the donuts

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.683
in the corner of the room.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:06.970
E books.

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:07.720
ALON HALEVY: Yeah.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.000
I think a bunch
of futzing around.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.790
So I put my book on
Kindle, iTunes, and Google

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:16.755
Play, thinking
Google Play would--

00:35:16.755 --> 00:35:17.630
CHET HAASE: Be huge.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:18.380
ALON HALEVY: Huge.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.040
CHET HAASE: It would be huge.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:19.790
ALON HALEVY: Yeah.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:20.660
CHET HAASE: Yeah.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.535
ALON HALEVY: And two of
these three platforms

00:35:22.535 --> 00:35:24.214
generated sales.

00:35:24.214 --> 00:35:25.630
AUDIENCE: Non-zero
sales you mean?

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:26.850
ALON HALEVY:
Non-zero sales, yes.

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:27.349
Thank you.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:33.720
The truth is-- the truth
is that both of our books

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.880
are very gifty books.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.250
You want to give them as a gift.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.490
And so giving an
electronic book as a gift

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:41.120
still hasn't worked out yet.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.239
And buying somebody an iPad just
in order to give them a $5 book

00:35:44.239 --> 00:35:45.280
seems a little expensive.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:51.610
So even though the print costs
of the Kindle are very low,

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:54.080
they haven't generated
that many sales,

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.527
compared to the massive sales--

00:35:55.527 --> 00:35:56.360
CHET HAASE: Massive.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.950
ALON HALEVY: It's
a safer version.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:03.420
CHET HAASE: So I did the ebooks
for my first two books, not

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.270
the poetry book.

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:06.360
The poetry book,
like it's really

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.220
as much about the illustrations
as it is about the words.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.950
And I like the way books
feel, and I like the way

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.190
the text flows around it.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:17.710
And if you stick that on a
Kindle or a tablet or whatever,

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.380
it's going to
completely mess it up.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.100
Like the images that I have
in my previous comedy books,

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.250
they're not as good
in e-form as they

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:25.459
are in the books themselves.

00:36:25.459 --> 00:36:27.500
It doesn't matter there
because that's not really

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.480
what the book is about.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.430
But when it's about
the illustrations,

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.730
I wanted it to be
preserved as is.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:35.070
I may produce a
version that's just PDF

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:37.116
and is sort of pre-formatted
to get around that.

00:36:37.116 --> 00:36:39.490
But in the meantime, I figure
this is not really a market

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:40.490
I care about.

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:43.670
But I did bother to do ebooks
for the previous two comedy

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:44.170
books.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:46.810
And my experience was I
didn't do the Apple approach.

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:49.090
I didn't put these
things out on iBooks.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:50.610
Kind of time thing--
I didn't really

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.570
feel like spending
the time doing that.

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.412
Kindle, they made
the process easy.

00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:56.885
Basically, you can
go Word to HTML.

00:36:56.885 --> 00:36:58.260
You futz around
a little bit, you

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.270
see how it looks on
these virtual devices,

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:02.960
these emulators that
they have, and then

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.190
you edit the HTML directly
to sort of shoehorn it

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:08.240
into what they need,
and then you're done.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.330
It's really cool.

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.630
So then I did the same
thing for Google Play Book,

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:15.440
so I used Word and then I
output the HTML into Word.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.610
Turns out that's not as easy.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:18.750
You upload this thing.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.051
You say, OK, here's my
HTML file that Kindle

00:37:21.051 --> 00:37:22.300
was happy with, how about you?

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.640
And it says nope,
there's errors.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.202
What errors exactly?

00:37:26.202 --> 00:37:27.910
They didn't really
want to tell you that.

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:30.326
So then you can go to external
validators and you can say,

00:37:30.326 --> 00:37:31.782
well, here's a
whole bunch of XML.

00:37:31.782 --> 00:37:33.240
Why don't you
validate this for me,

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.830
and it comes back with like
700 errors on this file

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:37.910
that Word produced.

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:41.760
Things like improperly
nested HTML tags.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.260
It turns out that
Kindle, I think,

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.450
is basically much more
forgiving of errors in HTML.

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:49.740
So I don't blame
Google Play Books

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.370
for not accepting the
HTML because it was crap.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.840
Because Word was doing
a very bad job of that.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.356
However--

00:37:55.356 --> 00:37:56.730
ALON HALEVY: You're
blaming Word.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:58.550
CHET HAASE: I am blaming
Word for having horrible

00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:59.230
[INAUDIBLE].

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:00.110
ALON HALEVY: Finally you
have someone to blame.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:02.443
CHET HAASE: [INAUDIBLE] about
web formats, I don't know.

00:38:02.443 --> 00:38:05.215
But it would be nice if they
were a little more forgiving.

00:38:05.215 --> 00:38:07.340
What I ended up having to
do with Google Play Books

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.950
was rewrite it in HTML.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.380
I took all of the text
from each of these books

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:13.770
and I just put it
directly in some--

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.775
I think I used Dreamweaver.

00:38:16.775 --> 00:38:18.650
And then there's another
program you can use.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.014
I used Calibre.

00:38:20.014 --> 00:38:21.305
Didn't you use Calibre as well?

00:38:21.305 --> 00:38:21.550
ALON HALEVY: Um-mmm.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:23.080
CHET HAASE: And that
turns it from HTML

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.760
into an epub format,
which is basically

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.990
an XML wrapper around HTML.

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:29.170
And it worked.

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:31.994
It just took a few more
weekends to get it there.

00:38:31.994 --> 00:38:34.160
And then Google Play Books
was happy enough with it.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.844
And it looks
reasonably good there.

00:38:35.844 --> 00:38:37.260
Again, I probably
wouldn't do that

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.920
with a graphically-rich
book like this one.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.460
It just doesn't make sense.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.272
One of the reasons
to do ebooks is,

00:38:44.272 --> 00:38:45.730
obviously, some
people prefer that.

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:50.070
I do get-- especially a lot of
the followers that I have on G+

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:52.940
are really into their devices,
and so they wanted these things

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.350
available in ebook form.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:56.530
OK, that's nice for them.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.821
Also, it's better for royalties
because there's nothing

00:38:58.821 --> 00:39:01.430
being printed so the costs are
much lower for the publisher.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:03.160
So with both of
my comedy books I

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.324
went through Kindle
Direct Publishing,

00:39:05.324 --> 00:39:06.740
which I believe
is owned by Amazon

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.540
or at least
affiliated with them.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.080
I can charge as low
as $3 for this book

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.970
and I'm making $2 back in
royalties which is pretty good.

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:16.410
I think with one of my books
I charged $1.99 because, hey,

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:17.660
why not?

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:21.320
So it's almost free
money, but then the market

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:26.010
is not as good for these
books is what I found.

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:27.112
So not as many sales.

00:39:27.112 --> 00:39:28.570
Also the sales that
you're getting,

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.670
like the dynamics of where
people buy from is interesting.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:34.119
Like you found very
little from the Play

00:39:34.119 --> 00:39:35.410
Books when you published there.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.910
I found more on Play Books
than I did for Kindle

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:40.710
because a lot of the people
that follow me on social media

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:43.340
are clearly in the Google camp.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.410
So they're following me
on G+, they're getting

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:47.520
their information through there,
they're obviously comfortable

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.200
buying on Google Play Store,
so there was more of a shift

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.570
toward Play Store sales
instead of Kindle sales.

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:55.130
ALON HALEVY: Yeah,
see I have a life.

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:56.640
So--

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.804
CHET HAASE: What is this
thing you speak of, life?

00:39:58.804 --> 00:39:59.970
ALON HALEVY: I don't-- yeah.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:01.280
CHET HAASE: OK, marketing.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.960
What do we do about marketing?

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:03.860
Go.

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:04.985
ALON HALEVY: Oh, marketing.

00:40:04.985 --> 00:40:08.487
Yeah, so I was the chief
marketing officer of my book.

00:40:08.487 --> 00:40:09.320
AUDIENCE: Well done.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.278
ALON HALEVY: Thank you.

00:40:10.278 --> 00:40:11.800
I go to coffee
conferences because I

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.424
get a lot of free
coffee, and I get

00:40:14.424 --> 00:40:17.090
to meet a lot of interesting fun
people from all over the world.

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:20.340
So there I did a
bunch of marketing.

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:22.470
There was a bunch
of coffee media

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:25.900
that I managed to get
covered by all of them.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:29.860
I'm on a couple of top
10 lists for niches that

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.240
don't have 10 books in them.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.701
But it went well.

00:40:32.701 --> 00:40:34.700
There are a bunch of good
articles about my book

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.810
that came out.

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:40.240
I usually, whenever I go
and give a talk sometime,

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.301
I will add another
talk about coffee,

00:40:42.301 --> 00:40:44.050
like around dinner or
something like that,

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:45.540
if the hosts are interested.

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:49.746
I actually contributed
books to the NPR fund drive.

00:40:49.746 --> 00:40:50.940
CHET HAASE: How'd that work?

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:51.470
ALON HALEVY: How did that work?

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:53.340
I went to a party
and I met this guy

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.590
whose name I forget right now.

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:59.149
He runs the NPR fund drive every
year, every quarter-- sorry.

00:40:59.149 --> 00:41:01.190
And we started talking,
and he said why don't you

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:02.356
contribute a bunch of books?

00:41:02.356 --> 00:41:04.300
We'll talk about
your book on NPR.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.040
And I'm like, sure.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.454
So that happened.

00:41:08.454 --> 00:41:10.870
I actually went to a bunch of
local bookstores and I sold.

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.830
I went to a bunch of
cafes, and actually my book

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:18.890
is selling in 10 countries or
something like that, in cafes.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:22.020
So that was just one-on-one,
so this doesn't scale.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:25.610
Mostly to people who-- cafes
owned by people I wrote about,

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:29.870
so they felt guilty
that they needed to buy.

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:32.770
And for some reason
I got hot in Japan,

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:39.160
because I wrote about one of
the most popular cafes there.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:44.670
And the owner used my book
as an English textbook.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.786
So people that used
to come to his shop

00:41:46.786 --> 00:41:48.910
would love to read my book
because they would learn

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:50.785
about-- they were
interested in coffee anyway

00:41:50.785 --> 00:41:53.110
and they wanted to learn
English, so by reading my book

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:56.614
they killed two birds
with one stone, literally.

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:57.280
CHET HAASE: Huh.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.274
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:59.274 --> 00:42:00.690
ALON HALEVY: Things
that you never

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:05.340
expect when you write a book.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.660
CHET HAASE: On my book,
it's basically word of mouth

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:08.925
and it's social media.

00:42:08.925 --> 00:42:11.050
My social media outlets
are basically a whole bunch

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:13.090
of followers on G+ and Twitter.

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:14.550
But they're in a specific niche.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.091
They follow me
because they think I'm

00:42:16.091 --> 00:42:17.662
going to talk about Android.

00:42:17.662 --> 00:42:19.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.680
ALON HALEVY: So they're
buying your book by mistake.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.287
CHET HAASE: Or not,
as it turns out.

00:42:24.287 --> 00:42:26.620
I keep hitting them with
comedy, and then eventually I'd

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.300
say, by the way,
here's some books.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.680
Some of them buy it.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.510
But other than
that, word of mouth

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:35.550
turns out not a real huge
way to market your books.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.029
I think you need to do things
like go to these conferences.

00:42:38.029 --> 00:42:39.320
You go and you give book talks.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.430
This is what real authors do.

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.490
They go to bookstores,
they advertise this thing,

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:43.277
they give a talk.

00:42:43.277 --> 00:42:45.110
It's a little bit harder
if your book is not

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:46.660
about a particular thing.

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:49.720
I think you have more luck if
you are trying to teach them

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.557
about coffee, if you're trying
to have a particular experience

00:42:52.557 --> 00:42:54.640
that you're driving with
that, as opposed to, hey,

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.260
here's some funny essays.

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.968
ALON HALEVY: The other
thing, by the way,

00:42:57.968 --> 00:43:01.090
is give a talk about your book
two weeks before Christmas.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:05.180
That's what I did at Google
before when my book came out.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:05.680
So then--

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.300
CHET HAASE: The gift thing.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.508
ALON HALEVY: --then the gift
thing works really well.

00:43:10.782 --> 00:43:13.240
CHET HAASE: So it turns out
that publishers I believe still

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.531
offer a service, which is
actually marketing your book.

00:43:15.531 --> 00:43:17.430
Whether they do that
effectively or not,

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:19.780
it's certainly part of the
business that they're in.

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:23.700
So maybe that's something
that authors still

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.200
take advantage of.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.910
OK, so why did we do this again?

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:30.340
To me, publishing a
book is a great way

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.300
of finishing a project.

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.950
I really enjoy writing.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:37.180
What I found personally was that
I got much more into writing.

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:40.780
I had thought about writing
more for about 20 years,

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.360
and then when blogging
started, I actually

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.300
started posting things
online, and that actually

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:49.030
made me start writing instead
of talking about and thinking

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.930
about writing.

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:53.030
The idea that I could have
an idea, I could finish it,

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:55.904
I could sort of craft it
in away with that I would

00:43:55.904 --> 00:43:57.070
like other people to see it.

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:58.528
I was happy enough
with the results

00:43:58.528 --> 00:44:00.380
that I could have
other eyes on it

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:04.090
was a great experience for me
actually doing more writing

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:05.530
stuff that I was interested in.

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:08.820
So I started publishing those
blogs in jokes and videos

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.950
and whatever all
along, and then books

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:14.610
are sort of the ultimate
version of that.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.110
It's a way of
finishing the project.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:18.640
It's a way of saying
I did all this stuff,

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.530
and then I edited it, and
I crafted it into this form

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:22.760
that I'm really proud of.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.700
Then you put it in a
book and you're done.

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.890
And you can point to and
say, that's what I did.

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.222
Maybe not a lot of
people know about it,

00:44:29.222 --> 00:44:31.430
but if they're curious about
it you can sort of point

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:33.530
to this particular thing,
as opposed to saying,

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:35.821
gee, I'd really like to write
some more about something

00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:36.550
someday.

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:38.300
So to me it's about
finishing the project.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.970
It's about having this idea,
putting it all in somewhere

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:45.180
and packaging it up and
actually finishing it.

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.610
Turns out they're
also great gifts

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:51.030
that you can give to people
that don't expect it.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:52.570
Did you get the same book twice?

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:53.700
ALON HALEVY: I may have.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:54.550
I don't know.

00:44:56.689 --> 00:44:58.105
CHET HAASE: We
don't want to know.

00:44:58.105 --> 00:44:59.021
ALON HALEVY: Yeah, no.

00:44:59.021 --> 00:45:03.105
CHET HAASE: And it's the best
thing that Alon ever did,

00:45:03.105 --> 00:45:03.864
apparently.

00:45:03.864 --> 00:45:04.530
ALON HALEVY: No.

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:06.760
It was a wonderful experience.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.730
It actually-- I don't know.

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:11.840
A big part of my identity
is now tied to coffee.

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.550
You can talk to people
in this room who

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:16.590
have enjoyed having
a coffee guy around,

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:20.620
or find it a bit
overwhelming, or too much.

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:25.089
But yeah, no, it's been a
great exploration and project.

00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:26.880
CHET HAASE: Oh, I wanted
to point out, too,

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.890
the book that I've
been reading here.

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:31.490
This as one weird thing
about print on demand

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:35.910
is George ordered some
books, and one of them

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:37.390
came in this bizarre format.

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.410
The actual book
is about this big,

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:43.440
and they cut this from a
different size piece of paper.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.640
It was the strangest thing.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.700
So a little
non-deterministic sometimes

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.636
in how they print these things.

00:45:48.636 --> 00:45:50.760
ALON HALEVY: Yeah, see,
these are the random things

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.010
that happen to you when you
write a book about coffee.

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.410
So this is a coffee
farmer from Brazil sitting

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:59.680
in a cafe in San Francisco
holding up my book,

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.140
being tagged on
Facebook for doing that,

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.570
and I had nothing
to do with this.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.324
It just-- and these
things happen.

00:46:06.324 --> 00:46:08.240
CHET HAASE: Random
stranger sucking up to you.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.489
ALON HALEVY: A random
stranger-- yeah, they're not-- I

00:46:10.489 --> 00:46:14.570
mean I don't know
what he's doing.

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:18.840
CHET HAASE: This is right before
he winged it at the cameraman.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.970
So I wanted to end
on a serious note.

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:26.016
"When there is a donut,
there's nothing wrong at all.

00:46:26.016 --> 00:46:27.640
Life could be ruined,
people could die,

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.320
nations could crater and fall.

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.925
But if there's a donut,
just one single donut,

00:46:31.925 --> 00:46:33.300
then everything's
good as can be.

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.640
I open my mouth and suck it
all in an I am a happier me."

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.740
"Some people might find
me vapid, my philosophy

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.825
lacking and sad, but when I
taste the warm sugar and fat,

00:46:41.825 --> 00:46:43.805
I figure it can't be that bad."

00:46:43.805 --> 00:46:45.180
"Everyone has
their own weakness,

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.010
their own special
things they adore.

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.780
For some it's true love or power
or clothing or shopping all day

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:50.970
at the store.

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:52.970
For others it might be
fun gadgets or video

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:54.800
games played all day long.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.570
And who am I to
judge these pursuits

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:58.890
or tell everyone
that they're wrong?"

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:00.470
But meanwhile, I
just need donuts.

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:02.029
In fact, I'll just
have that one.

00:47:02.029 --> 00:47:04.070
And then when I'm done
with it I'll have another.

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:05.764
This time a cinnamon bun."

00:47:05.764 --> 00:47:07.180
"So let all the
government's fail,

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.550
and storms break the
Earth's crust apart.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:11.655
As long as I have
my one single donut,

00:47:11.655 --> 00:47:15.070
I'll also have joy in my heart."

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:15.955
Thank you.

00:47:15.955 --> 00:47:21.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:23.890
I don't know if
we have questions

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:26.640
from this rather contentious
and controversial topic,

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.487
but we're happy
to field them now.

00:47:28.487 --> 00:47:30.320
AUDIENCE: Don't always
do marketing for you.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.010
Apparently they only do that for
you if you are already famous

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:35.260
or if they have some reason
to think that your book is

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.224
going to be famous.

00:47:36.224 --> 00:47:37.640
But my friend who's
been published

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.349
by Random Penguin and some
other famous publisher--

00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:42.140
ALON HALEVY: It's Random
House and Penguin.

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:43.540
AUDIENCE: Well,
they've joined forces,

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:44.530
so now they're Random Penguin.

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:45.680
ALON HALEVY: OK,
Random [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.435
AUDIENCE: Well,
I don't know what

00:47:46.435 --> 00:47:47.559
they're calling themselves.

00:47:47.559 --> 00:47:50.030
Anyway, she's had to do
all of her own marketing

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:52.860
and talk to the bookstore owners
to get them to carry her book.

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:53.990
ALON HALEVY: But don't they
do enough marketing just

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:55.320
to cover their costs?

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah, they do
enough to cover their costs,

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:58.868
and they do enough to get
into some major bookstores.

00:47:58.868 --> 00:47:59.940
They do do that, yes.

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.815
But basically, her books
have been a failure.

00:48:01.815 --> 00:48:02.910
You should buy them.

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:05.260
CHET HAASE: And they do
at least the channels.

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:09.380
Like part of the dynamic
that I figured out

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:11.510
is, wow, to get
into these channels

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:14.260
so that Barnes &amp; Nobles could
actually buy this thing,

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.320
I need to charge this
much money, as opposed

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.867
to like the publisher has the
scale where they can publish it

00:48:18.867 --> 00:48:20.950
at a lower cost and it'll
still be in the channel,

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:23.760
and that is going to be pushed
to all of the people that

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.140
buy from them.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.360
There's some amount of
just busy work stuff

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.840
that they're doing beyond
the sheer marketing.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.970
But yeah, at the end of the
day, your friends on a $10 book

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:35.299
might be making
$0.50 or something.

00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:36.340
Yeah, it's a little hard.

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.160
I mean this is why my friend
in the publishing business

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.740
was pushing me, like no, no, no.

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:40.990
Do your own homework.

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:42.160
You can totally do this.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.965
This is not something that
requires an advanced degree.

00:48:44.965 --> 00:48:46.840
You figure out when the
review deadlines are.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.240
You figure out what
the magazines are.

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.180
You get the addresses.

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:50.846
You send these things
out every quarter.

00:48:50.846 --> 00:48:53.260
Like it's all very
straightforward.

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.360
But it turns out I have
a job that I would really

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.760
rather spend my time doing.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.340
So yeah, where's the trade off?

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:05.610
AUDIENCE: So if you were doing
another book like the coffee

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.432
book, what will
you do differently?

00:49:07.432 --> 00:49:09.140
ALON HALEVY: What
would I do differently?

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:17.990
I remain an eternal optimist.

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:23.369
I think that if I actually
would do more marketing

00:49:23.369 --> 00:49:24.160
it would do better.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.743
The other thing I
could do is actually

00:49:25.743 --> 00:49:28.840
try to figure out what
people care about reading

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.220
and tailor it more to that.

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:34.680
The book right now
is, it's a bunch

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.110
of stories about
different coffee cultures

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:39.280
in different countries.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.110
But it wasn't possible
for me to really test out

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:46.737
what people care about
reading in the coffee world.

00:49:46.737 --> 00:49:48.320
And people in the
coffee world itself,

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.653
even though they bought a lot
of books, they don't read.

00:49:50.653 --> 00:49:52.470
They drink coffee.

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:53.030
OK.

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:55.990
They read tweets.

00:49:55.990 --> 00:50:01.490
But in general, I mean
books about food and drinks

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:04.280
don't do very well, which
is part of the reason

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:09.030
that publishers were
nice but not forthcoming.

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:11.226
So maybe I would write
a book about big data.

00:50:11.226 --> 00:50:12.140
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.380
So a coffee table
book should be bigger,

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.780
because most people-- yeah.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:20.990
If I were to do it again, I
would do a very interactive--

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:24.640
something really out there,
like an interactive book that

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.678
enables you to--

00:50:25.678 --> 00:50:27.112
AUDIENCE: Pop-up book.

00:50:27.112 --> 00:50:28.842
A pop-up book.

00:50:28.842 --> 00:50:30.300
ALON HALEVY: No,
no, like something

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.450
that you can put on
your iPad and you really

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:33.840
have an experience.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.910
That you can-- I don't know--
that'll actually help you make

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:38.250
the coffee or--

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:40.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:42.450
CHET HAASE: Thanks for coming.

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:44.000
[APPLAUSE]
