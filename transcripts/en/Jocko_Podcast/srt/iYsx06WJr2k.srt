00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,570
We'd love to hear tips for moving to
wake up earlier alarms and not disturbing

2
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:10,820
your spouse. Keeping alert throughout the
day. You know, when you wake up early,

3
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:12,480
this is, these are,
yeah, these are things.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,800
So tips for managing the implications
around making that change to get up

5
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:21,240
earlier while keeping the space or the
keeping the speed or keeping the peace at

6
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:25,480
home and work and work. He work.

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,140
He either made a typo or he's, he's
on the inside. Shit. What that is,

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,680
is that's an homage to the
Portuguese accent. Yes.

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,530
It's a homage to the fake Portuguese
accent. No, it's the real one.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,150
Worki well,
anything adding like e at the end,

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,230
like it'll come out. Oh yeah. Yeah.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,870
It can be exaggerated though by
certain people, myself included. Yeah.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,990
Okay. So, so how to wake up
in the morning, number one,
let's, let's talk about, oh,

14
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,170
one important piece of this. How do you
do it without disturbing the spouse?

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,530
Because we don't wanna we don't
wanna make the spouse angry.

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,370
No adversarial relationships with
this bus at four 30 or four 30.

17
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,840
So one of the things, real, real easy, one
out of the gate get an escalating alarm.

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,200
So what that means is it starts off
quiet. Sure. And it gets louder.

19
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,550
It gets progressively louder.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,780
I am a much lighter sleeper than my wife.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,970
So this is not that big of a deal to me.
And I can't answer,

22
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,500
but I've, I've, I've slept with
roommates at wanting to sleep, you know,

23
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,920
like in the military, you know, you got,
you got bunked together or whatever.

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,240
So I've dealt with this a little bit,
but it's really no factor.

25
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,470
Did an escalating alarm. And then
when that thing goes off, um,

26
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,230
you wake up before it gets
too loud to wake your spouse,

27
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,980
it should be on your side of the bed so
you can make it happen or you can pick a

28
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:54,270
song that starts off nice and
mellow and that kind of builds.

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,610
And for a long time, for this
particular reason, I used to have,

30
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,970
um, there's a band called the sword. Sure.

31
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,390
And they have a song called Iron Swan.

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,910
And it starts off nice and mellow. And
if you don't get up in time, it's common.

33
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,283
So you got it.

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,510
So it's like a Kinda like a game within
the game right there where you got to

35
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:20,880
beat the clock too. Yes. Yes.
You gotta beat the clock.

36
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:25,881
You've got to get up and turn that thing
cause otherwise it's an event and then

37
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:30,210
you're too late. What is it? Black
Swan? No Iron Swan. What's the source?

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,850
Yeah,
cause there's,

39
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:37,851
there's times in my life where I will put
like the ultimate shocker of a tune in

40
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:42,120
my,
um,

41
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,040
in my playlist that if I need to get
up and I need to get up and get on it,

42
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,100
like there's a song called re
repeat process by 100 demons.

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,510
That song will get you out of bed. It
will get you out of bed. When it kicks in,

44
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,460
it just comes, it comes to,
it's like, it's like getting,

45
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,350
it's like an explosion happens in your
room and it's a great song by a great

46
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,960
band. But anyways, so if,

47
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,040
but in this case you don't want
to go with a hundred demons. No,

48
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
you don't want to go
with repeat po process.

49
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,920
You want to go with the sword
iron song or on escalating alarm.

50
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,960
Now once you do that,

51
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,430
you kind of have the gear pre-staged
the gear has the morning gear has to be

52
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,870
pre-staged so,
so we're not in the dressing,

53
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,220
we're not pulling open drawers are not
flipping on lights are not searching for

54
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:34,510
stuff. No, we get up, we walk out of
the room. Yeah, quietly. Stealth mode.

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,610
Then you get to either the bathroom.
Now if you have the bathroom on sweet,

56
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,030
maybe you have some stuff staged
in the other bathroom in the house.

57
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,430
So you just walk right out of the room,
shut the door and you're good.

58
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,930
You made your escape, you know. Oh
and I'll tell you another thing,

59
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,860
little heads up.
Make sure that you set off your secondary,

60
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,980
I mean that you turn off your
secondary and your tertiary alarms.

61
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,100
So if you're like me and you
sleep with multiple alarm clocks,

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
if you leave cause they go
off sequentially, right.

63
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,740
You know you've got your first one iPhone,

64
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,340
then you've got your
second one battery powered,

65
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:08,590
or then you get your third one wind up.

66
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:13,260
The windup is the gnarly last
one with the [inaudible]. Right,

67
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,730
right.
If you leave that thing,

68
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,180
if you forget to shut that
thing off before you walk
out, you can hear about it.

69
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,330
You hear about,
cause now when it goes off,

70
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,810
it's a startle duller cause it doesn't
go off. I mean most of the, you know,

71
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:29,770
50% of the time I'm up before the alarms
but, but if you leave that one on there,

72
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,270
it's a starter and then then your,

73
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,250
your spouse's waking up in a panic mode
because now they don't know where it is.

74
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,290
There's effort, they're being attacked.
It's, it's, it's a gnarly situation.

75
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,710
So shut off the secondary and tertiary
alarms and then get out of the room and

76
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:48,220
then you know,

77
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,720
maybe even have your toothbrush and
your toothpaste staged and another in

78
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,910
another bathroom or in the kitchen
or whatever. Get your workout gears.

79
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,500
Not in a drawer by the bed where you're
pulling that open, making that racket. No,

80
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:04,270
you just get up and
you leave. So then, um,

81
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,660
that's, that's how you do it.
That's how I do it. And again,

82
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,050
I have an advantage because my
wife is a pretty heavy sleeper.

83
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,820
She gets mad that when I come home
from a trip and late at night,

84
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,350
I do some unpacking in the night.
That can be a little frustrating for her.

85
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,020
But anyways, that's what you do. Now,

86
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,180
the next piece of this question was
for alertness throughout the day.

87
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,100
What do you do to stay
alert throughout the day?

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,050
I think one of the things you
gotta do is check your diet, right?

89
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,430
Check the Diet, make sure, in my opinion,

90
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:44,431
make sure you're not ingesting a tone
of carbohydrates because those are going

91
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:46,330
to make you tired.

92
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,470
They're going to make you excited or
make you fired up for about 20 minutes.

93
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:51,230
I don't know,

94
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,100
haven't had them in a long time for
like 20 minutes before you eat them.

95
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,950
Like right when you actually,
that's really what they're for.

96
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,280
Or currently instant energy. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, and they put you to sleep.

97
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:03,050
So when when you,
when you eat it,

98
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:08,140
it's basically the really basic
sequence is I'm going to do some output,

99
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,630
you know, in the wild. I'm going
to go hunting and whatever you,

100
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,330
I'm going to gather whatever,
do some output that expended some energy.

101
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,520
I'm going to need some energy and I'm
going to need some rest. When you get the,

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,080
the energy, carbohydrates,
food in any way,

103
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,240
Serotonin, all these other chemicals
that induce you to go rest,

104
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,260
that's the sequence. That's the process.
Don't forget about insulin. Yeah.

105
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,890
Cause the insulin all squared away
then was gonna make you tired too.

106
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,270
So check your diet, check your
dying. I just had a guy on Twitter.

107
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,470
Ah Man, he, he's, he's like, hey man,
I'm tired during the day. I'm dragging.

108
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,350
I was like, well we'll check your diet.
And he's like, well I think it's okay.

109
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,700
I'm drinking a lot of energy drinks.
No,

110
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,280
not good. The energy drinks are
addictive. Yeah, they're tasty.

111
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,170
They're addictive.
And they're,

112
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,700
they're filled with
sugar most of the time.

113
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,150
So you're going to get a major sugar
rush and then you're going to crash.

114
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,070
So you gotta be careful that they also,
you don't want to be on,

115
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:13,560
on the crazy amount of caffeine all day.

116
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:17,410
And that's gonna mess up your system as
well. Does the same thing as the sugar,

117
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,470
the caffeine rush, and then the
crash, that's the same thing. Oh yeah.

118
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,360
You have more than sugar. Yeah. In,
in, well, I'll tell you right now,

119
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,540
people ask me all the time and they're
surprised that I work out without

120
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:35,320
caffeine in the morning. But I'm
telling you, give it a try. Yeah.

121
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,870
Because it'll be harder. Maybe it's
harder for you to get out of bed.

122
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,240
Maybe it's harder for you to get ready.

123
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:47,040
Maybe it's harder for you to get into
the gym with no caffeine and maybe it's

124
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,440
harder for you to start your
workout with no caffeine,

125
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:52,760
but once you start the workout,
yeah.

126
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,980
I don't think it's going to be that
big of a deal. Yeah. And if it is good,

127
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,850
make your workout harder. You know, I
don't think it's that big of a deal.

128
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,630
So don't become addicted to the caffeine
and that's going to be cause that can

129
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:07,770
get problematic. And then, um,

130
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,310
power nap talked about this before. If
you need to, you take a little power nap.

131
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,650
You take six to eight minutes,
you set your alarm clock,

132
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:18,700
you elevate your feet above your heart.
You lay down and you black out.

133
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:20,980
If you're really tired,
you six to eight minutes of your feet,

134
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:24,160
like you feel like a rock
star after one of those. Nope,

135
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,570
I agree in another thing you can do if
you're tired during the day, no big deal.

136
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,590
Just find a little corner somewhere.
Go Bang some pushups out.

137
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,940
Go Bang out 10 burpees. Yeah, I get the
blood flowing and get the blood flowing.

138
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,690
Yeah. There's no way it's, it's,

139
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,700
it's physiologically
impossible to do burpees and,

140
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,430
and remain tired. Whatever. Burpees,

141
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:53,000
you can tell you since you turned into
a physiology major over here tonight,

142
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,730
if you want to tell me what that
does physiologically, I don't know,

143
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,490
but I do know this. If you knock out
10 burpees, it's a small purse, Paul,

144
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,720
small prescription. You will not be
tired for at least a half an hour.

145
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,980
You're not going to be 10 burpees and
then feel tired. It does. He can't do it.

146
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,760
I can tell you why physiologically
endorphins get released.

147
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,840
This stuff adrenaline, like when you know
you're going to do physical activity,

148
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,880
when you know it, you have
it. I'm not saying a huge
adrenaline, just a little bit,

149
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,820
little, yeah, a little bit.
She's still going part of it.

150
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,780
So that's,

151
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,820
those are some tips I guess for
alertness throughout the day that I use.

152
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,740
Yeah. Go and forgetting that a better
early in the morning. Hey and by the way,

153
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,410
go to bed earlier at night,
go to bed earlier at night.

154
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,940
I go to bed like I'll usually around 11.
Um, I don't recommend that. I don't run.

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,760
Recommend going to bed at 11
and getting up at four 30. No,

156
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,580
I don't recommend that. I recommend
going to bed when you get tired,

157
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,020
shut your computer off.

158
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,700
Stop looking at the Inter webs
and go to sleep and you know what?

159
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:57,800
Go read an actual book because that made
you tired. Yeah, that will make you tie.

160
00:09:57,801 --> 00:10:02,100
That's like the opposite of
burpees. Go read, go read a book,

161
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,720
you know, and just sit there and
you will get more tired. Yeah.

162
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,280
Unless like a real exciting or interesting
book. Whoa. And read some more.

163
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,490
Of course,
of course.

164
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,050
Don't read blood Meridian because
when you go to bed and you're,

165
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,580
cause you're a fast sleeper. Fast sleeper.
Well you don't need that much sleep,

166
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,050
but yeah, yeah, yeah. The no sleep
thing that'll get you so quick.

167
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,560
It'll promptly put you into
a crash the next day. Yeah.

168
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,850
I don't know where you can
power through. Well I dunno. I,

169
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,450
if I can go to the next man. I've even
when you had the latest little baby,

170
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,940
you came in here on a couple hours sleep,

171
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,090
you look rolled in here ready to record.
You sat here, you got after it. Yeah.

172
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,570
It's true. And there's all
these different, does that
make you realize? Yeah.

173
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,570
It makes you realize how much more
you can do. I think a lot of people,

174
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,990
it's like this, and I don't want to
go into this full subject right now,

175
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,660
but the other day I did a 72 hour fast,
right?

176
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,130
No food for 72 hours and there's a
bunch of reasons we could talk about it.

177
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,790
Maybe we'll do it on a later podcast. I
will say this though, one small thing,

178
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,320
if you go 72 hours without eating it
recalibrates your hunger meter because we

179
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,500
just think, oh, I haven't
had a donut in two hours.

180
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:19,620
I'm starving like, no,
you're not starving.

181
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,910
You're not even hungry and I'm close
to hungry, so recalibrate that thing.

182
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,820
Do a fast.
Even if you just don't eat for 24 hours,

183
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,840
you realize that most of your hunger
signals that are coming to your brain are

184
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:35,010
lies, and I'm not saying they're
lies like, oh, don't eat,

185
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,540
but I'm saying you don't need to eat.
And how liberating is it that I was,

186
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,510
I was having so much fun. I was, I
was on this fast and I'm just like,

187
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,630
don't even need food. I don't
eat food. I don't need to eat.

188
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,170
That's the ultimate control,
right? What I don't need food,

189
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,650
food is food is for fruit is if
you're weak. You know what I mean?

190
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:56,140
It's that of you get that mentality
going in. Then guess what?

191
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:59,710
Now you go on a travel day and you go,
Oh man,

192
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,410
I'm going to be in the airport all day
today and I dunno what I'm going to eat.

193
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,740
Don't eat anything. Yep, you're capable.
You're totally, you can go 72 hours.

194
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:08,740
As a matter of fact,
you can go 30 days without food.

195
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,210
So going three days is not that big of a
deal. It's not even that big of a deal.

196
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,360
Yeah,
I did when I just did this 72 hour fast.

197
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,430
He was just not like I did
everything normal. I went to
Jujitsu, I did worked out,

198
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:25,270
I did squats and pull ups. Everything
was normal, everything was normal.

199
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:27,310
It's not that big crazy deal.

200
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,630
Just we just get so accustomed to to
just feed the machine all the time.

201
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,710
And you could have a,
you know,

202
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:36,600
you've got to have a meal every six hours
and it's so at our fingertips. It's so,

203
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,860
but it's also you.

204
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,620
This is what I realized is so inconvenient
to have to eat all I know man.

205
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,210
You know flack.
You're right.

206
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,090
So it's kind of Nice to just eating
know once a day this happened. Boom,

207
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,370
put a big old steak on and get after
it. Yeah, I mean, and again, I hate,

208
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,680
there's all kinds of people mean
there's people that know this is,

209
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,300
this is one of the reasons I don't like
talking about this particular topic, um,

210
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,270
is cause there's,

211
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,980
there's a lot of people didn't like study
this and know a bunch about this Nepal,

212
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,800
all these facts.
So if I go and do the research,

213
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,720
well I know the facts too, but I don't, I
can't, I'm considering quote them. Right.

214
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,780
I don't have the in depth knowledge
that Peter a Tiaa has on fasting.

215
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,180
You know what I mean? Or Dom D'agostino,
those guys, their Ph, they're doctors.

216
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:27,070
I'm not a doctor. I'm a knucklehead.
That was, and another thing is people,

217
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,760
you know, what did you do to prepare for
your faster? I was like, oh, I didn't eat.

218
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,380
Yeah,
I was,

219
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,380
I was with leaf and we were on a trip
and we had like a lunch and then we did a

220
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,210
Gig that night and I don't
like to eat before I do a gig.

221
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:44,440
And then after that we stayed up a little
bit and did some work and then woke up

222
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:46,930
in the morning at an early flight. And
then I came home and I wanted to train.

223
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:49,270
So I worked out and I got done with
that and I went and did something else.

224
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,410
And next thing I knew it was
24 hours, I guy, you know what?

225
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,860
And the next day I didn't feel too
hungry. So I was, I just held on.

226
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:57,490
So it wasn't no preparation,
just got after it. Again,

227
00:13:57,491 --> 00:14:02,491
people don't do this anecdotal check with
a physician or whatever you gotta do.

228
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:05,380
Don't listen to me.
Yeah.

229
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:09,760
As far as like a recommendation you should
do because you know you are different

230
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,730
and 17 hour fast, hey Dee, I dig it man.

231
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:17,050
But I think really kind of the point that
you're making or one of them anyway I

232
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:19,990
think is absolutely true.
So you're, you know,

233
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:24,550
a lot of it is habitual hunger, but it
goes beyond just like psychological,

234
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:26,830
habitual. It's like
physiological. It's like, okay,

235
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:28,630
I'm used to getting food every four hours.

236
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:31,450
So when the four hour mark comes
around physiologically, your,

237
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,200
your stomach going to be like,
word of my food. Yeah. Your,

238
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,920
you're malting me where my food. And
then after a while, if you're like, hey,

239
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,160
you don't get food this time, your songs,
you're okay. Sometimes we don't get food.

240
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,610
Yeah. So let's kind of act right. You
know? And then when the food comes, okay,

241
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:43,840
we'll do that.
When that happened,

242
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:48,430
recalibration is real low because then
after I started eating again and then the

243
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,450
next day I go, oh, I'm, I'm feeling
hungry. I'm gonna eat something now.

244
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,760
I'm actually not hungry, so
why am I eating? Why am I
eating if I'm not hungry? Mm.

245
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,310
Yeah. That's, it's my mind is controlling
me when I should be controlling my mind.

246
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,460
Yeah. You know, so, and that's another
thing where, um, you're, you're, uh,

247
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,180
this nothing new, right. Your
mind is so strong or whatever,

248
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:07,670
so you can trick yourself into schools.
For sleep too.

249
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,510
So if you think that you
got nine hours of sleep,

250
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,410
you'll be way less tired then. Okay.
Let's say two people, exact people,

251
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,230
they're identical twins, identical
life experience, whatever.

252
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,220
One guy believes the next morning
they both got eight hours sleep.

253
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,090
One guy believes he only got four hours
sleep and one guy believes he got 10

254
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,560
hours sleep placebo scenario.
Yeah,

255
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,240
but that's how your mind it knows like
basically it's your mind accommodating

256
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,960
what it thinks the stimulus
is. So, so the other twin,

257
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:37,640
the four hour sleep believer,

258
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,100
he's going to be way more tired
and he's gonna be like, Dang,

259
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:42,670
where's that nap I was looking forward,
I need or whatever the other one.

260
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:44,240
Imagine if you woke up
every day and you were like,

261
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,090
I only got four hours of sleep and
I'm going to crush to exactly right.

262
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,280
I actually believe I work better on
less sleep. How you like them apples.

263
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,700
Exactly, exactly. And that's, that's
what was going to be my point there.

264
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,420
Where you're like, you told you, I've
told you that before. Yeah, I've, I've,

265
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,670
so I've told the echo before that
when we're getting ready to record the

266
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:08,600
podcast, the day before I
record the podcast, that night,

267
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,200
I like to sleep less like four hours
because I feel like it sharpens,

268
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,790
I'll tell you what, to be quite
honest, what I think it does, it,

269
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,950
it brings it,

270
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:29,330
it brings my emotions a
little closer to the surface.

271
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,570
So like you feel like we're, I'm kind
of under attack, so I better wait.

272
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,430
I bet are like,
pardon up right now.

273
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:41,030
I better like get my two notes that
it's like, no, this is what it is.

274
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:46,130
I can get more. Like when I'm reading
something, I'm more focused on it.

275
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:50,600
I'm more into it, like
actively, like, yeah. Because
I think when I'm well rested,

276
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:54,800
I'm like, like, uh, like rock solid,
right? I'm just like, Oh yeah, we're not,

277
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,150
the went on a little where I sleep less,
I'm a little bit more exposed.

278
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,840
I'm a little bit more vulnerable.
Right. Mentally. Right.

279
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,400
And I need that, right. Because
otherwise I'd just become very,

280
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,630
mmm mmm.

281
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,790
Detached. I become very
detached and it's, it's, I know.

282
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,070
So I want it when I come in here,
I want to be on though.

283
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:19,290
I want to be on the fringe a little
bit. Right. You know what I mean?

284
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,960
That's what I want to be exposed. I want
to be walking in here and being like,

285
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:25,260
man, this is going to be, this
is an intense, this thing,

286
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:28,980
not a walk in the park today. This
is going to be hard to let me. Yes.

287
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:33,870
I want to be stressed a little bit. When
I come in here, I can dig it and I feel,

288
00:17:33,871 --> 00:17:35,940
I always feel that way.
Like it's the same thing in Jujitsu.

289
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:40,830
I feel better when I'm stressed and
when I'm a little bit more, yeah,

290
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:42,450
a little bit more stressed,
a little bit more attention,

291
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:45,410
a little bit more pressure on myself.
I want to be there,

292
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,580
don't want to be there all the time.
And I'll tell you what,

293
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,391
just so everybody knows,

294
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:52,980
there's some days I'm tired
where I'm just tired and I just,

295
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,950
sometimes I just need a power
nap so bad at Mocad I'm going up,

296
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:59,610
I'm literally falling asleep,
you know? And I hate that.
That's a horrible feeling,

297
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,540
which, you know what? Elevate
your feet. Set an alarm clock
for eight minutes, boom,

298
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,410
you're going to wake
up field next superman.

299
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,450
It's Kinda like when people hit
themselves before they go live because it

300
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:15,060
weighed, you mean they're like
slap themselves. Yeah, for sure.

301
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,490
So on the surface it looks like,
oh, he's getting fired up, but yeah.

302
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:20,250
Why is he getting fired up for the exact
same reason that you're talking about?

303
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:24,090
Because if it's like [inaudible] like
I'm getting these things where I got to

304
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:26,160
kind of bounce back from,
right. I'm under attack.

305
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,620
Legitimate root adrenaline rush
too. Right. So physiologic.

306
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,170
That's the same exact
sequence right there.

307
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,820
But you're just doing it consciously
and instead of slaps it's lack of sleep.

308
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,570
Yes.
Or what have you.

309
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,850
There you go. That's um, yeah.

310
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,670
Answer in. Everyone's going to attack
me on social media for not sleeping,

311
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,590
not eating and all that. Yeah. Yeah.

312
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,930
Well, sorry, I don't know what
to tell you. What? Hey tacos.

313
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,730
I appreciate your advice. I know I
should. I do know I should sleep more.

314
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,940
I do know I should eat, you know
better. Oh, I'm sorry. Well,

315
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:09,600
what does that even mean? Should the
word should, what does that even mean?

316
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:14,400
You should, it's, yeah. Anyway, that's the
whole [inaudible] don't be you anymore.

317
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,650
Well that's true. Be Different
than you. That's what that, well,

318
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,260
I actually actually the point,
oh,

319
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,240
what I was gonna say earlier is
just like what you're saying,

320
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:28,410
the f like you're not citing all this
science and making claims about like how

321
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:30,630
this is going to benefit you or nothing
like that. That's not what you're doing.

322
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:31,890
It's,
it is anecdotal.

323
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:36,420
And I think the point is that if you
push yourself through certain situations

324
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,320
and you prove it to yourself that you can
function just fine with, I don't know,

325
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,770
five hours sleep rather than eight
one or two times or whatever,

326
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,320
or however many you know that you
can do that. Like really, you know,

327
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:51,000
we'd talked about this before where you
get kind of dependent on certain things

328
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,480
and then to the point where you believe
that you can't function without it.

329
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,190
Whether it be sleep, whether it be coffee
in the morning, w w you know, whatever.

330
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,570
Or eating every four hours.

331
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:04,560
Like when I was really into like
weightlifting and bodybuilding type stuff,

332
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,560
I remember thinking, man, I
gotta, I gotta hurry up and eat.

333
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,700
It's four hours or whatever. And then kind
of later on in life, man, I've got like,

334
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:15,690
I haven't eaten yet today and
it's late in the day. I'm fine,

335
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,040
you're not, I'm not losing my gaze.
Yeah, whatever games. But Games game,

336
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,980
whatever. Yeah. So once
you prove it to yourself,

337
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:26,910
it's like if you stay up all night when
you have work the next day and you do

338
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:30,210
your work when you go to bed you
can be like, hey, if I had to,

339
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,620
I could do that again.

340
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,660
That is another thing that I enjoy about
pushing those envelopes is it feels

341
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:38,280
really good to go to bed when
you've been awake for a long time.

342
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,400
It feels really good to eat a meal
once you haven't eaten for for awhile.

343
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,300
You appreciate it more. Yeah,
that's good. That's true.

344
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:50,070
But that's kind of a cycle
wave of invoking appreciation.

345
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,260
In my opinion.
Understood.
