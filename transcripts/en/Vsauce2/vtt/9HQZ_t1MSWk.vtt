A smart phone app that can send smells, and
this bridge concept for a river in Paris is

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.459
an inflatable trampoline!

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:21.459
Vsauce. Kevin here! This is Mindblow.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.869
This simulation shows an updated theory on
the formation of the Moon as made up of Earth

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.419
parts. A very fast, spinning Earth collides
with a planet nicknamed Theia. Theia is mostly

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.940
vaporized along with part of our planet, with
some material escaping Earth and forming a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.630
huge disk around it, eventually forming the
Moon, and this could explain how the Moon's

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.650
composition so closely matches that of the
Earth's.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.590
The PRIMER V4 is a robot that can walk a tightrope,
unaided. Created by Dr. Guero the robot has

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.430
grooved feet that slide along the 4mm thick
steel wire and it maintains its balance using

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.400
its arms that react to an inclination sensor
by making quick movements and allowing the

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.240
body to stay balanced.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.409
The Quad Ski is the first commercially available
amphibious vehicle to go over 10 mph on land

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:19.409
and in water. It can drive up to 45 MPH on land,
and with the press of a button it takes 5

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.939
seconds for the wheels to fold up and tuck
into the sides once it hits the water, where

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.229
it then also has the ability go 45 MPH.&nbsp; It's
been in development for almost two decades

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.979
and is scheduled to go on sale in the U.S
by the end of the year for around $40,000.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.039
Here's the most detailed picture ever taken of Uranus.

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.780
A Beluga Whale was recorded trying to make
human sounds. No one claims that he was trying

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.139
to communicate with humans, but most researchers
seem convinced that, at the very least, he

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:55.139
was attempting to mimic the sounds he heard
coming from humans.

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.249
These Future Socks will never get a hole,
never droop, or wear out on the bottom. The

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:13.110
Socrates sock company is making men's socks
with Kevlar-Carbon Matrix reinforcements to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.870
make the socks extraordinarily durable. Find
the link below for more information.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.720
Got strange-colored, foul-smelling, or awful-tasting
pee in the 16th century? Diagnose your disease

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.840
with this genuine Urine Wheel!

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.970
Darpa's Pet-Proto robot can now navigate obstacles.
It uses autonomous decision-making, dismounting

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.840
mobility and dexterity, and it's part of the
Darpa Robotics Challenge - the goal being

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.690
the development of ground robots capable of
executing complex tasks in dangerous, human-engineered

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.690
environments.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.730
NoPhoto is a digital smart license plate frame
that aims to stop camera-based tickets. It

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.700
prevents traffic cameras from taking a picture
of your license plate at red lights or speed

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.410
traps by blasting the license plate with light,
making it too bright for the camera's sensor

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.410
to handle and leaving the image overexposed.
They claim it's perfectly legal, and that

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.230
traffic enforcement cameras are an invasion
of privacy - find the link below to read more.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.790
Finally, Hominid is an X-ray style animation
created by Brian Andrews at the Expression

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.790
College for Digital Arts of animal human hybrids...

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.090
I'm gonna leave you with a dancing baby stingray
and, as always, thanks for watching.

00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:51.701
[Drops on Drops on Drops]
["When falling onto another liquid layer, water droplets typically bounce then coalesce.]

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:55.041
[If the surface is vibrating, however, the droplets will continue bouncing, as seen in this video."]
