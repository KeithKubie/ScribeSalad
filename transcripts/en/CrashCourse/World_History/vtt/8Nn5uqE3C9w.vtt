Hi, my name is John Green; you’re watching
Crash Course World History and today we’re

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.259
going to talk about India, which is hard because:

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.510
A. I only have 10 minutes...

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.500
Past John: Mr. Green, Mr. Green!

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.540
Present John: I don’t have time for you
today, Me from the Past!

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.360
B. When we study history we tend to study
unified polities that we can label like “The

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.100
Roman Empire” or “China" or “Beliebers,”
and this emphasis on unity tends to:

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.500
C. lead to labels that mask a lot of historical
difference, like for instance “Europe,”

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.590
which is such a weird and nebulous word that
we don’t even know what it means. Plus:

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.160
D, no offense Europe, but there are not many
histories more complex than India, and...

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.909
E. a lot of what we know about Indian history
comes from British historians, who both used

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:38.900
and embodied the phrase “historical bias,”
all of which

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.010
F. makes it very unfortunate that we only
have 10 minutes. But we will do our best!

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.250
Okay, we’re gonna make this like Voldemort’s
soul and split up into eight parts.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:55.160
[theme music]

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.400
Part 1, The Vedas. So as you no doubt remember,
the Indus River Valley was one of the earliest

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.350
cradles of civilization, But that original
civilization basically disappeared sometime

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.900
after 1750 BCE. Then there was a long period
of Aryan migration, and by Aryans we do not

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.080
mean like prehistoric Nazis, we mean people
from the Caucasus who migrated down into the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.250
Indo-Gag gig gag gi... Stan, can you just
spell it for me? Thank you.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.810
We know about these Aryans primarily because
they left behind religious texts, the earliest

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.530
of which is called the Vedas. The Vedas are
also the earliest texts of what will come

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.990
to be known as Hinduism, although it wasn’t
known as Hinduism then. And they’re responsible

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.520
for tons of stuff, but we only have 10 minutes
so let’s just cut to:

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.260
Part 2, The Caste System. The caste system
is one of India’s most enduring and fascinating

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.800
institutions. Let us read from one of the
Vedas about Purusha, the universe-pervading

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.510
spirit. When they divided Purusha, in how
many different portions did they arrange him?

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.600
What became of his mouth, what of his two
arms? What were his two thighs and his two

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.310
feet called? His mouth became the Brahmin,
his two arms were made into the Kshatriya;

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.640
his two thighs the vaisyas; from his two feet
the shudra was born.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.390
So this section gives a divine explanation
for the caste system. Brahmins – who as

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.200
Purusha’s mouth speak to the gods are at
the top. Kshatriyas – from Purusha’s arms

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.950
became the warriors, as you no doubt know
if you’ve ever attended my gun show. Vaisyas

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.340
– the merchants and artisans who provide
money for the priests and the warriors came

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.560
from Purusha’s thighs. Because everybody
knows that the thighs are the money makers.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.160
And the Shudras – are at the bottom. They’re
the feet, the laborers and farmers who are

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.890
the foundation of the social order. Also,
the rest of us stand on them.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.370
The caste system becomes much more complicated
than this, but that basic division into 4

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.340
classes remains throughout much of Indian
history. In spite of the efforts of many reformers

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.760
whom we’ll be meeting in future episodes
of Crash Course. The Caste System is the foundation

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.940
for another big concept in Hinduism,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.599
Part 3, Dharma. Dharma is basically one’s
role in life and society and it is defined

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.540
primarily by birth and by caste. The whole
idea is explained nicely by this passage from

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.560
the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna is talking
to the warrior, Arjuna. “Having regard to

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.870
your own duty also, you ought not to falter,
for there is nothing better for a Kshatriya

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.599
than a righteous battle.” The Bhagavad Gita
is a section of a much larger epic poem the

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:09.489
Mahabharata which tells the complicated and
long story of a war between two kingdoms.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.520
And we can really see how important dharma
is in this passage because Krishna is basically

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.709
telling Arjuna that because he is a warrior,
a Kshatriya, he must fight. Even if he’s

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.880
bad at it – like for instance if he gets
killed – it’s still preferable to not

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.770
living his dharma. It’s better to be a bad
warrior if you’re a Kshatriya than to be

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.239
the world’s best baker. Basically, you’re
better off fulfilling your own dharma poorly

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.680
than doing someone else’s well. That leads
us to:

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.190
Part 4, Saṃsāra, Moksha, and Karma – there
are both personal and social reasons for doing

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.459
your dharma. Right, the social reason is obvious
that dharma and caste combine for excellent

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.300
social cohesion. You get the exact right number
of bakers and the exact right number of warriors.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.650
We could stand in to implement this system
in the United States, actually, where everyone

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.019
knows we suffer from a shortage of electrical
engineers and a surplus of people who want

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.690
to be on reality TV shows. That would not
have happen in ancient India. But, say that

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.750
your dharma is to scoop animal dung your entire
life, why do you keep doing that when you

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.599
see other lives that at least appear to be
far more fulfilling?

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.849
That leads us to the concept of Saṃsāra,
or the cycle of rebirth often called reincarnation.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.129
The basic idea is that when you die your soul
is transferred to another living thing as

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:21.279
it is being born. And if you fulfill your
dharma, things improve and you get re-born

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.479
into a higher being. You don’t have to scoop
elephant dung anymore.

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.860
But the ultimate goal is not to be re-born
as a Brahmin. The ultimate goal is to be released

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.949
from the merry-go-round altogether. And that
release is called moksha. The law that holds

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.229
all this together is Karma which is summarized
really nicely in the Aranyaka Upanishad. "The

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:43.969
doer of good becomes good. The doer of evil
becomes evil. One becomes virtuous by virtuous

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:46.760
action, bad by bad action."

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.860
The Upanishads, by the way, are later religious
texts that began as commentaries on the Vedas,

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.129
but later became sacred writings in their
own right. This is a really great way to organize

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.229
a social order from top to bottom. Everyone
has a role, and, because that role has a religious

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.300
dimension, society stays in balance.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.879
But as a religion, Hinduism has a problem,
at least if you want to start an empire; everyone’s

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:08.520
path to “salvation” is individual. The
original Brahmins tried to set themselves

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.689
up as political leaders, but Hinduism doesn’t
really place a premium on worshippers obeying

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:16.489
their leaders. And if you are a leader trying
to make your subjects listen to you, that’s

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:18.340
kind of a bummer. Which brings us to:

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.020
Part 5, Buddhism. We can’t establish this
historically, but according to traditional

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.939
biographies, our story begins in the 6th century
BCE. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:30.559
So there was this prince, Siddhartha Gautama,
whose father kept him locked away in a palace

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:35.599
because a prophecy foretold that the family
would lose the kingdom if he ever left. But

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.309
as house arrests go, this was a good one:
Siddhartha had great food, great entertainment,

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:42.769
a hot cousin for a wife, etc.

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:47.939
But he suspected that there was more to life,
so he snuck out of the palace a few times.

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:54.439
On these travels, he encountered an old man,
a sick man, and finally a corpse. Having realized

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:58.059
the ubiquity of suffering, Siddhartha left
the palace, renounced the crown and sought

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:04.239
out all the holiest men to try to find out how it could
be possible that life would come to such a terrible end.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.099
Eventually Gautama became an ascetic, fasting
and meditating for days at a time, hoping

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:14.469
to find enlightenment. And finally, after
meditating for about a month under a tree,

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:19.229
it came to him. Nirvana. No, not that one.
Yes, that one.

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:22.649
He finally understood the meaning of life
and began teaching it to people who would

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:28.149
become his disciples. He had become the Buddha,
which means teacher, and he taught the Four

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:29.869
Noble Truths. Which are:

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:32.439
1. All life is suffering.

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:39.979
2. The source of suffering is desire. Not
just sexual desire, but all wanting of stuff and prestige.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.700
3. To stop suffering, you must rid yourself
of desire. This sounds simple enough, but

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:51.330
if you’ve ever been dumped by someone, you
know that it is not that easy to just stop desiring.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:57.129
4. So how do you do it? By following the Eightfold
Path, which as you might suspect is a set

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:00.729
of eight prescriptions on how to live that
we don’t have time to talk about. Because,

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:04.909
oh wait look, Thought Bubble, you put some
learning in our learning so we can learn while

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:06.449
we learn. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:10.679
So as a religion, Buddhism involves a lot
of meditating and moderation and there aren’t

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:14.879
that many fun rituals, and if you’re a Buddhist
monk you don’t get to have power like most

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:18.960
holy people do; you have to renounce everything,
including your hair. And, yes, some of them

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.300
get to be kung-fu monks, but only in China,
where Buddhism eventually migrated and became

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.229
a religion with fun rituals and all kinds
of great stuff that Siddhartha Gautama probably

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:28.270
wouldn’t even have recognized.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.819
But we’re not talking about fun populist
religion, we’re talking about old-school

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:35.589
ascetic Buddhism. Sure, you might be happy
and fulfilled if you follow the Eightfold

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:39.179
Path, but from everything we’ve learned
so far, it would appear that humans don’t

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:42.520
want to be happy and fulfilled or else they
never would’ve stopped foraging.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.869
But Buddhism was very attractive if you were
a low-caste Hindu, because there is no caste

00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:50.860
system. In theory, anyone who follows the
Eightfold Path and renounces desire can be

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.949
freed from suffering and achieve nirvana,
maybe even in THIS life. Instead of having

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:59.270
to get re-born for maybe millennia and knowing
that each time there is only a tiny chance

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.209
that you will end up something awesome, like
a honey badger. By the way...

00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:05.509
Totally Tangential Part 6, Did you know the
game Chutes and Ladders has its origins in

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:09.240
ancient India? They call it Snakes and Ladders.
The ladders are steps forward on the path

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.990
to moksha, and the snakes take you away from
it. Which reminds me, it’s time for the

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.929
Open Letter.

00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:23.719
That is very close to my head. Wow. But first
let’s see what’s in The Secret Compartment.

00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:29.369
Oh look, it’s a golf club. Must be so I
can play Disco Golf.

00:08:29.369 --> 00:08:31.219
An open letter to Chutes and Ladders:

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:39.120
Dear Chutes and Ladders,This is Disco Golf.
It’s a game of skill. My success at Disco

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.590
Golf is entirely dependent on whether I am
good at Disco Golf. Now, listen Chutes and

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.490
Ladders, I remember your game being awesome
when I was a kid, but I have a 2-year-old

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.620
son myself and I recently bought him Chutes
and Ladders and you know what happened the

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.780
first time we played? HE BEAT ME.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.540
Chutes and Ladders, this is a child who regularly
refers to helicopters as heli-flopters. I

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.500
don’t want to say that he’s not my intellectual
equal, but I’m potty trained. You know why

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:06.270
he beat me? Because there is no skill involved
in Chutes and Ladders at all. It is completely

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.590
random and capricious and arbitrary and cold
– just like the universe.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.640
I don’t want to play games that are like
the universe – I want to play games so that

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.280
I can forget what the universe it like.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.940
Best wishes,
John Green

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:23.690
Okay, Part 7, Ashoka. Remember that for most
of Indian history, India it was not one unified

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.240
place. It was tons of different principalities
and city-states and everything else. But India

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.260
did experience indigenous political unity
twice, first under the Mauryan Dynasty in

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.220
the 3rd century BCE. And then again under
the Gupta Dynasty from the 300’s to the

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.560
500’s CE, but we’re not going to talk
about that because it bores me.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.940
Right now, we’re interested in one particular
leader from the Mauryan Dynasty, Ashoka, because

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.380
Ashoka attempted to rule through quasi-Buddhist
principles. So Ashoka was initially a warrior

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.890
who ended up expanding the empire that his
grandfather started. And Ashoka experienced

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:57.300
this conversion to Buddhism after he saw his
own army devastate the Kingdom of Kalinga,

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.190
something I bring up primarily so that I can
say Kingdom of Kalinga.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.530
Stan, is there anyway we can write a song
a song about that, like, Kingdom of Kalinga/

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.670
I’m sorry you got destroyed...

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.800
So, Ashoka built stupas, (stoopas?) Hold on...

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.180
HowJSay: Stoopah.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.640
John: Could he have said that any more pretentiously?
Stupas.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.040
So Ashoka built stupas, these mound-like monuments
to the Buddha, all over his kingdom to show

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.230
his devotion. And he also put up pillars throughout
his empire that proclaimed his benevolent

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.470
rule and said he was going to rule through
something he called dhamma, which according

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.300
to one of the pillars went like this: "proper
behavior towards servants and employees, respect

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:38.050
for mother and father, generosity to friends,
companions, relations, Brahmans and ascetics,

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.740
and not killing living beings."

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.470
So those are not individualistic goals like
we see in Hinduism; they’re relational goals,

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.090
like we’re gonna see next week when we study
Confucianism. And that’s one of the reasons

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:51.490
why Ashoka’s empire wasn’t actually very
Buddhist because ultimately Buddhism isn’t

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.450
that concerned with the order of the world.
Buddhism argues that the fulfillment of the

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.330
self will lead to the order of the world.
In the end, Ashoka’s empire didn’t outlast

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.860
him by much, and soon enough Buddhism declined
in India, almost to the point of extinction.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.990
Part 8: The Big Finish. So as anyone who has
ever practices yoga knows, Hinduism is the

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:12.050
most flexible of all the world religions,
which is part of the reason it’s often described

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.350
as polytheistic. The belief that god(s) can
take many different forms makes it easy for

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.470
Hinduism to assimilate other religious traditions.
Which is exactly what happened with Buddhism.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.080
In time the Buddha came to be worshipped as
another incarnation of one of the Hindu gods,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.920
and not as a mortal teacher. So in the end, Hinduism,
rather than purging the Buddha, enveloped him.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.930
So all this means that while Hinduism has
a tremendous amount of variety and flexibility,

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:38.520
its core tenets of samsara, karma, and the
caste system have provided a remarkable amount

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.260
of cultural and social unity to the Indian
subcontinent for millennia.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.520
Fortunately for the Buddha, his teachings
migrated East to China. We’re gonna make

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.150
that same journey next week. I’ll see you
then.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.820

Last week’s phrase of the week was “Right
Here in River City”. If you want to guess

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.480
