00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:11.001
Honeybees are fascinating creatures 
for a number of reasons:

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.382
their incredible work ethic,

00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:14.320
the sugary sweet syrup they produce

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.468
and their intricate social structure.

00:00:16.468 --> 00:00:19.754
But another reason is 
that honeybees are, in fact,

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:21.767
excellent mathematicians.

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:25.292
Scientists claim the tiny insects 
can calculate angles,

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:28.692
and can even comprehend
the roundness of the Earth.

00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:31.252
But there's particular
mathematical bee genius

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:34.961
behind the most important aspect 
of honeybee life: the hive.

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:38.954
Just like humans, bees need food
and shelter to stay alive.

00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:41.032
The hive is not only the bees' home,

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:43.731
but doubles as a place
to store their honey.

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:46.433
Since it's so central to survival,

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:49.793
honeybees have to perfect
the hive's architectural design.

00:00:49.793 --> 00:00:52.616
If you examine any piece of honeycomb,

00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:54.092
you'll see that it's constructed from

00:00:54.092 --> 00:00:58.175
tightly packed hexagonal, 
or six-sided, cells.

00:00:58.175 --> 00:00:59.686
Of all the possible designs,

00:00:59.686 --> 00:01:02.038
why do honeybees choose this one?

00:01:02.038 --> 00:01:04.817
To understand, you need
to think like a bee.

00:01:04.817 --> 00:01:08.372
Bees need a secure place 
for their entire colony to live.

00:01:08.372 --> 00:01:10.227
Similarly, there needs to be a place

00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:13.085
where their nectar can 
be stored and ripened suitably

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:14.585
until it turns into honey.

00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:18.519
That means there's a need
for some serious space efficiency.

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:22.060
A good solution is to build
little storage units, or cells,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.680
just big enough for a bee to fit into,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.361
which can also double as the containers
in which nectar is stored:

00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:30.650
The bees' very own honey jars.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.558
The next thing, is to decide what
the little cells should be made out of.

00:01:34.558 --> 00:01:37.484
Bees don't have beaks
or arms to pick up things,

00:01:37.484 --> 00:01:40.030
but they are capable of producing wax.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.412
The thing is, producing it 
is a lot of hard work.

00:01:43.412 --> 00:01:45.939
Bees have to consume 8 ounces of honey

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.618
to produce just 1 ounce of wax.

00:01:48.618 --> 00:01:50.386
So they don't want to waste it.

00:01:50.386 --> 00:01:53.032
So, they need a design 
that allows them to store

00:01:53.032 --> 00:01:55.302
the largest possible amount of honey

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:57.578
using the least amount of wax.

00:01:57.578 --> 00:01:59.065
What shape does that?

00:01:59.065 --> 00:02:01.133
Imagining for a minute 
that all bees had to

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:04.153
attend architecture academy 
and go to math class.

00:02:04.153 --> 00:02:06.681
Let's say they asked 
their geometry teacher,

00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:10.011
"What shape would give us
the most space to store our honey,

00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:12.418
but require the least amount of wax?"

00:02:12.418 --> 00:02:14.007
And then geometry teacher replied,

00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:16.686
"The shape that you're seeking 
is the circle."

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:19.362
Leaving the bees to return
to their trial construction site

00:02:19.362 --> 00:02:23.047
and begin building their honeycomb
using circular cells.

00:02:23.047 --> 00:02:25.590
After a while, some of them 
might have noticed

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.259
a problem with their design:

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:29.837
small gaps between the cells.

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:32.508
"We can't even fit in there! 
That's wasted space!"

00:02:32.508 --> 00:02:34.103
they might have thought.

00:02:34.103 --> 00:02:35.952
So, ignoring the geometry lesson,

00:02:35.952 --> 00:02:38.229
and taking matters into their own hands,

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:39.921
the bees went back to the drawing board

00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:42.147
to rethink their beehive design.

00:02:42.147 --> 00:02:43.719
One suggested triangles,

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.319
"We can use triangles. Look! 
They fit together perfectly."

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.950
Another bee suggested squares.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.035
Finally, a third bee piped up and said,

00:02:52.035 --> 00:02:55.305
"Pentagons don't seem to work, 
but hexagons do!

00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:58.081
We want the one that will use 
the least amount of wax

00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:00.553
and be able to store 
the most amount of honey.

00:03:00.553 --> 00:03:02.990
Yes, I think that's the hexagon."

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.175
"Why?"

00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:06.281
"It looks more like the circle 
than the others."

00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:08.072
"But how do we know for sure?"

00:03:08.072 --> 00:03:10.902
To find out, the industrious 
insect architects

00:03:10.902 --> 00:03:14.804
calculated the areas of the triangle,
the square and the hexagon

00:03:14.804 --> 00:03:17.002
and found that the hexagon was, in fact,

00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:20.251
the shape that gave them
the most storage space.

00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:23.389
They agreed on an ideal size 
and returned to work.

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.229
The space efficient comb that 
is a bee's trademark today,

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.670
is probably the result 
of this trial and error,

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.611
but over long periods 
of evolutionary history.

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.363
However, it paid off.

00:03:33.363 --> 00:03:34.664
Peek into any hive --

00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:37.063
with your protective goggles 
and netting on, of course --

00:03:37.063 --> 00:03:40.826
and you'll see the end result: 
a beautiful compact honeycomb

00:03:40.826 --> 00:03:43.812
that any architect would have 
be proud to design.
