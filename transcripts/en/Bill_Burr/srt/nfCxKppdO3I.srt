1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,170
Like a boss. I didn't realize this,

2
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:11,690
I guess like a year ago or two years ago.

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,040
You know that actress Shelley Duvall,
who crushed it in the shining?

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,200
Dammit. Let me open up God damn door.

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,240
Well, she's in her sixties
now and I guess she's having,

6
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:30,000
I don't know what she's having. She's
having some sort of mental issue.

7
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,010
I don't know what it is. Okay.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,080
But she's old and she needs
medical help. That scumbag.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,130
Dr Phil,

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,050
who I called it the second I
saw that guy I called it I,

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,520
I was at, that guy looks like a fucking
crooked cop. The second I saw him,

12
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:51,030
I was like, that guy looks like he
planted a fucking gun on you. You know,

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,460
he fucking shoot you over some routine
fucking traffic stop. And He'd pull out.

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,120
He do that to a white person. That's
how fucking nuts this guy is, right.

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,950
He's not your standard, you know,
bad cop going after minorities.

16
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:07,560
This guy would do it. This guy's like
a see it as a serial killer look,

17
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:11,910
doesn't he? Um, anyways,

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,720
that piece of Shit fucking interviewed
Shelley Duvall and talked to her is if he

19
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,860
was trying to help her.

20
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,183
Okay.

21
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,923
Okay.

22
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,310
And she was saying all of this stuff
about how Robin Williams was still alive

23
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:47,210
and fucking, you know,

24
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:50,660
the earth is flat and just all kinds of
stuff like that where it's clearly like,

25
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:53,030
oh my God, all right, shut off the
cameras, shut off the cameras, come on,

26
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,230
let's not do this to her. And he's sitting
there talking to her life. So like,

27
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:58,160
he's going to try to help her.

28
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:03,161
So like you think that a
Robin Williams is still alive?

29
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,840
Okay. Um, I'll think you need, like he,

30
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,610
he was acting the entire fucking time.

31
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,210
Like he was trying to help her rather
than completely exploiting this famous

32
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:41,860
actress who's now in like, you
know, this mental condition.

33
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:45,980
It's just photos. It was, I
don't, I don't, how do people,

34
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,790
how do you still sit down and
watch that guy's fucking show?

35
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,940
Fuck that guy and everything.
He's fucking connected to

36
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,900
Jesus. You don't have enough
fucking money. You can't,

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,330
you don't drag enough fucking penniless
people onto your fucking show.

38
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,390
You don't have enough honey booboo,
people coming on your fucking show.

39
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,860
You got to do that.

40
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,850
Jesus fucking Christ. But you know,

41
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:15,450
I've been meditating and I guess I'm
not supposed to get upset about this.

42
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:17,220
I should really, you
know, I should expect it.

43
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,470
I should expect that behavior out of him.

44
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,610
So you're saying that you're hearing
these voices in your head are or

45
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,740
[inaudible] I don't. I'm making up
all of this shit. I couldn't get,

46
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:32,760
I couldn't get,

47
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,390
yeah,

48
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,860
I don't think I got 20 seconds.

49
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:38,920
30 seconds to do it the second she said
the Robin Williams thing and then they

50
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:40,360
cut to him. Go. So your,

51
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,870
and once he did that I had
to just so I shut it off.

52
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,700
Shut it off, shut it off.

53
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,133
Okay.

54
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,580
Dr Phil, have you no shame.

55
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:53,963
Yeah,

56
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,880
I swear to God, that fucking guy.

57
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,550
I'm trying to think what
he wouldn't interview.

58
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,313
Okay.

59
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,960
You know what wouldn't
you like? First of all,

60
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:09,961
I love that people watch those shows is
I is if they're like watching somebody

61
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:11,980
trying to help somebody, they're not,

62
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,830
you can't fix somebody
in a half hour episode.

63
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,730
Oh that time when he had that girl
on that little girl on there, the a,

64
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:23,820
you know, catch me. I'm sad how my
dad, that one that went fucking viral

65
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,560
did, did you say the, the,
the are laughing. Yep.

66
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,480
So the audience are a bunch of homes.

67
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,463
Yeah.

68
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,663
[inaudible] kicked me out.

69
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,170
Got You. Outside.

70
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,700
What does that mean and what I just said.

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,030
And then he has her back on again.
He's like, people thought, oh,

72
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,470
the explorer Naruto we took
out the studio audience. Yeah,

73
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,980
but you still broadcasted it. Yeah.

74
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,010
Danielle cheesier park
back. Where does everybody,

75
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,190
there's no homeless. I'm getting
a lot of tension on the Internet.

76
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,853
No. Before I came on here.

77
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,453
Thank you for that.

78
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,500
I don't know, but you know something.
I'm a hypocritical cut. All right.

79
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:21,420
Because I still watched the, uh,
catch me outside. How about that?

80
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,800
I just kept seeing it on Twitter and I
was like, I have to see what that is.

81
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:28,560
And I'm not gonna lie to you. I
did watch it and I did enjoy it.

82
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,730
So maybe I've got to knock
back my criticisms. Criticism.

83
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,270
Why don't you just exploit people that
still have their whole life ahead of

84
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:40,270
them. Jesus fucking Christ. I don't know.

85
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,470
Did I become the asshole by the end of
that? I don't remember. I don't again,

86
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,230
I don't know where the fuck
that whole thing went. Um,

87
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,890
do you want to take the top five?
Cause I think they could bring cameras.

88
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:55,020
I thought really? Cause
I think I flipped you.

89
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,180
You want to do it again then you
don't get all tall. Please vote.

90
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,050
This is not the place and this is
not to sit down. All Right Dan,

91
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,640
let me now.
