00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.909
So, it might be the case that, were you to
be decapitated, you could see your own headless

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:05.799
body before you die.

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.940
Good luck sleeping tonight guys!

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.040
Hello everyone!

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.420
Amy with you on DNews this Monday, and Monday
means we’re doing a viewer question!

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.030
EMU MON asked whether a person or animal can
survive being decapitated, and if so, how?

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.030
Oy.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.030
Dark, man.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.580
Creepy though the thought may be, questions
about humans surviving decapitation aren’t

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.580
new.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.690
There are reports of severed heads reacting
or even trying to speak going back centuries.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.680
One particularly chilling story comes from
Dr. Gabriel Beaurieux who studied a beheading

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.100
in 1905.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.739
The condemned man’s head was cleanly severed
by a guillotine blade and left to fall into

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.940
a basket at which point the face started twitching.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.890
Then, when Beaurieux called out the dead man’s
name, the severed head’s eyes lifted up

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.760
and met Beaurieux’s in the same way, he
later wrote, that any whole person’s would

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.309
when pulled from a daydream.

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.940
There’s actually some modern scientific
evidence to support the idea that the dead

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.920
man’s look might have been a somewhat conscious
reaction.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.690
In 2011, Dutch scientists ran an experiment
on mice to see how decapitation affected their

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.160
neurologic activity.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.520
They hooked an electroencephalograph or EEG
to the brains of the doomed mice, cut off

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.780
their heads, then measured brain activity
in the severed heads.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.970
Incredibly, the results showed electrical
activity continued in the brains at frequencies

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.550
indicating conscious activity for almost four
seconds.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.530
Similar studies done on smaller animals suggest
that brain activity can last even longer once

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.960
the head is no longer attached to its body.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.840
If that four seconds ball-park time extends
to human decapitation, that’s well long

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.830
enough for a victim to take in their surroundings
before dying.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.520
New York City medical examiner Jonathan Hayes
also confirms it’s possible.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.250
Writing for New York Magazine, he explains
that If someone’s heart stops, they could

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.250
be conscious for up to fifteen seconds as
the brain burns through the last of its oxygenated

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.250
blood.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.560
Of course, that time would decrease with blood
loss associated with a beheading, but the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.120
fact remains that there would be some blood
in the severed brain for a few seconds, which

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.060
could mean a few seconds of consciousness.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.520
Decapitation means the head has been cut cleanly
at the neck, severing the spinal cord at the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.520
same time.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.980
So no severed head could just regain the connections
with a body that would allow the brain to

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.210
control the limbs.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.220
There's no way you could survive that kind
of decapitation.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.760
Unless you happen to be decapitated during
a whole head transplant… then, maybe, you

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.769
could.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.709
Dr Sergio Canavero of the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation
Group in Italy proposed the controversial

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.950
idea for a head transplant as something wants
to use on patients whose muscles and nerves

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.349
have degenerated, fusing their sound mind
with an equally sound body.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.829
He’s developed a technique involving fusing
the spinal cord.

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.060
The process involves cooling the to-be-transplanted
head to extend how long the cells can live

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.360
without oxygen.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.540
Next he’d dissect the tissue around the
neck, tie off the major the blood vessels,

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.970
then cut the spinal cord.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.769
Then the recipient’s head is moved onto
the donor body and the two ends of the spinal

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.200
cord are fused together.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.359
This is the most delicate part of the process.

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.260
Canavero hopes to do this fusion by flushing
the area with polyethylene glycol followed

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.090
by injections of the same material at regular
intervals.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.090
If it works, the process will be akin to spaghetti
sticking together in hot water: the cells

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.409
membranes in the two spinal cords would mesh.

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.920
From there, the new hybrid human would be
kept in a coma for up to a month with electrodes

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.450
stimulating the spinal cord.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.050
Within a year, Canavero says, the patient
would be able to walk.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.719
Of course, the head is foreign to the body
so the immune system would likely reject the

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:17.719
head.

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.540
Canavero says he should be able to manage
this part of the process with drugs.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.409
But a successful head transplant has never
been done, and experts say it’s probably

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:25.489
impossible.

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.310
Bodyless heads talking and head transplants
sounds like Victorian mad science to me.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.360
But thanks for your question anyway, EMU MON!

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.879
And just a reminder that if there’s something
you’re dying to know, just ask and we might

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.040
make a video about it.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:45.489
For instance, one viewer wanted to know why
some organs come in pairs:

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:54.659
We’ll leave a link to that video in the
description if you’re on mobile.

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.920
Thanks for watching and if you haven’t done
it yet, please subscribe for more DNews every

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.700
