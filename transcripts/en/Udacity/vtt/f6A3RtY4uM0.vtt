00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How is it that charge can be both attractive and repulsive?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
How does it know when to behave in which way?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, charged objects can either be positive or negative.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This is totally different from mass, which when we described an object's mass we said 5 kg.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We didn't have to say +5 or -5. It doesn't make sense to talk about a negative mass.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And the key thing to remember with charge is that opposite charges attract each other

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but like charges repel.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now this is really amazing.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now the key thing with charges is that opposite charges attract and like charges repel.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Let's say you have these two charges and you are somehow able to hold them in your fingers.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Right now, there exists some force between these two charges.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If I let go and allow these charges to move,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I want to know what will the charges look like after I allow them to move.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Will they look exactly the same like nothing happened?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Will they come together and be really close?

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Will they fly apart from each other? Choose the best answer.
