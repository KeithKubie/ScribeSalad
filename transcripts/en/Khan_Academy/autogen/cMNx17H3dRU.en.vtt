00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.130
 There is a reason to pay much attention 

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.760
 of the individual cells. 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.400
 Cells are the main building block of life 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.120
 and are themselves remarkable. 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.160
 As we have seen in other videos, 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.750
 inside the cells a whole universe is gathered. 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.890
 They are much more complex, 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.617
 than many of us imagine before we begin to study them. 

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:21.260
 But how we move from cells to tissues. 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.550
 If you look 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.720
 your skin, this is the fabric of your skin, 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.800
 or the tendons or the heart, 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.190
 different organs have different tissues. 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.290
 How we move from different tissues 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.960
 to 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.960
 a whole multicellular organism. 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.890
 All tissues and organs 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.350
 they build a whole organism. 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.750
 But how cells are collected and coordinated, 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.220
 how they are stacked in different structures so they build me or you. 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.800
 Part of the answer 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.850
 includes the extracellular matrix, 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.880
 extracellular 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.773
 matrix. 

00:01:02.773 --> 00:01:05.353
 We said it inside the cells 

00:01:05.353 --> 00:01:07.683
 there is not just a handful of organelles that swim around, 

00:01:07.683 --> 00:01:10.243
 besides them there is a cytoskeleton that gives structure 

00:01:10.243 --> 00:01:13.123
 inside the cage. 

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:15.093
 Thanks to it, the cage can move, divide, 

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:16.663
 to transport different things. 

00:01:16.663 --> 00:01:19.333
 Assuming this circle 

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.693
 here is a cell, 

00:01:21.693 --> 00:01:22.593
 what is colored in yellow, 

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:25.093
 is the cytoskeleton inside the cell. 

00:01:25.093 --> 00:01:27.493
 But there is an analogous structure and outside, 

00:01:27.493 --> 00:01:31.383
 it assists the coordination of cells between them, 

00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:32.723
 this structure 

00:01:32.723 --> 00:01:36.603
 is the extracellular matrix. 

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:39.102
 It is surrounded by different species 

00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:42.713
 fibers, proteins and glycoproteins, 

00:01:42.713 --> 00:01:45.593
 the most famous of which is 

00:01:45.593 --> 00:01:47.263
 collagen. 

00:01:47.263 --> 00:01:49.263
 I'll paint the collagen in yellow here. 

00:01:49.263 --> 00:01:53.653
 This is a collagen thread here. 

00:01:53.653 --> 00:01:58.033
 Collagen is a very common protein in mammals. 

00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:01.983
 The threads in yellow 

00:02:01.983 --> 00:02:03.617
 are collagen, 

00:02:03.617 --> 00:02:05.523
 I have seen that collagen is around 

00:02:05.523 --> 00:02:08.793
 25-35%, on average 30%, of proteins 

00:02:08.793 --> 00:02:12.993
 in mammals. 

00:02:12.993 --> 00:02:17.213
 30% of the proteins 

00:02:17.213 --> 00:02:18.923
 in mammals. 

00:02:18.923 --> 00:02:23.283
 Roughly speaking, about 30% of the proteins in your body are collagen. 

00:02:23.283 --> 00:02:25.823
 Much of the collagen forms these fibers, 

00:02:25.823 --> 00:02:28.353
 who are involved in the construction 

00:02:28.353 --> 00:02:31.623
 of the extracellular matrix. 

00:02:31.623 --> 00:02:32.853
 Look at these cells here, 

00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:34.423
 the things I've painted around them 

00:02:34.423 --> 00:02:37.083
 make them look as if they are embedded in the extracellular matrix. 

00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:38.653
 They may be fixed. 

00:02:38.653 --> 00:02:40.463
 They look like hanging 

00:02:40.463 --> 00:02:42.753
 for the matrix, it helps them occupy a certain position. 

00:02:42.753 --> 00:02:44.816
 This is true of the extracellular matrix, 

00:02:44.816 --> 00:02:48.163
 collagen fibers and other elements constituting the extracellular matrix, 

00:02:48.163 --> 00:02:52.033
 attach the cells and help them get organized so that they build fabrics. 

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:54.263
 The extracellular matrix, as well as other factors, 

00:02:54.263 --> 00:02:56.293
 can tell the cell when to grow, when to divide 

00:02:56.293 --> 00:02:58.383
 and even when to die or when to produce 

00:02:58.383 --> 00:03:01.053
 different types of molecules. 

00:03:01.053 --> 00:03:02.333
 To understand better 

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:03.933
 what is actually happening, 

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.693
 how the cage is attached, 

00:03:05.693 --> 00:03:06.833
 we have to take a closer look here, 

00:03:06.833 --> 00:03:10.563
 for example in this box. 

00:03:10.563 --> 00:03:12.723
 We will look closely at the cell membrane, 

00:03:12.723 --> 00:03:14.313
 we can switch to this diagram, 

00:03:14.313 --> 00:03:18.123
 it occupies most of the screen. 

00:03:18.123 --> 00:03:20.963
 This diagram shows an enlarged view of the enclosed box. 

00:03:20.963 --> 00:03:23.863
 On this side we have the inside of the cage. 

00:03:23.863 --> 00:03:26.993
 This is the inside of the cell, 

00:03:26.993 --> 00:03:28.953
 we see that there is 

00:03:28.953 --> 00:03:32.783
 actin microfilament, 

00:03:32.783 --> 00:03:36.523
 which forms part of the cytoskeleton. 

00:03:36.523 --> 00:03:38.093
 We also have collagen fibers, 

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:41.710
 which form part of the extracellular matrix. 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.193
 We see that these two parts are connected, hooked to each other through 

00:03:44.193 --> 00:03:46.333
 these proteins. 

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:49.583
 These proteins are called integrins. 

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:50.583
 Integrins. 

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:53.053
 They are located in the membrane 

00:03:53.053 --> 00:03:55.884
 of the cage and other fibers, 

00:03:55.884 --> 00:03:58.023
 such as fibronectin, 

00:03:58.023 --> 00:04:01.963
 can be linked to 

00:04:01.963 --> 00:04:03.921
 extracellular matrix. 

00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:05.361
 This is really interesting because, in this way, 

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:09.221
 structurally binding the extracellular 

00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:10.761
 matrix 

00:04:10.761 --> 00:04:13.591
 and the interior of the cell, 

00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:16.776
 and the cytoskeleton. The connection is thanks to these proteins. 

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:18.661
 They help 

00:04:18.661 --> 00:04:21.561
 these things connect, lock them in place. 

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:23.961
 In addition, they can also be used for signaling, 

00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:25.561
 they can count their voltage 

00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:26.831
 depending on the type of cell, 

00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:28.951
 can signal the cell 

00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:33.421
 to activate or deactivate. 

00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:34.751
 It's really remarkable. 

00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:36.511
 I want to make it clear, 

00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:38.161
 that very often when you study biology 

00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:39.761
 even at the most basic level, 

00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:41.801
 you will see the things written in textbooks 

00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:43.561
 and you may think, "Oh, of course, we have integrals, 

00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:46.561
 which pass through the plasma membrane 

00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:48.121
 and are attached to fibronectin 

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.151
 and for the cytoskeleton, 

00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:54.091
 of course they are related to collagen, 

00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:55.791
 through the extracellular matrix. " 

00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:57.201
 It sounds like the whole biology is open, 

00:04:57.201 --> 00:04:58.761
 learned and clear. 

00:04:58.761 --> 00:05:01.191
 But the answers to questions like 

00:05:01.191 --> 00:05:03.621
 how exactly all these proteins work together, how they signal, 

00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:05.001
 how cells understand what to do 

00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:06.701
 based on how much tension 

00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:08.791
 has on them or how much "populated" with other cells a given area. 

00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:11.541
 These answers are still being sought through active research. 

00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:12.951
 In fact, if you get a little older 

00:05:12.951 --> 00:05:15.091
 in everything I speak of, 

00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:17.001
 I recommend you do it, 

00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:19.231
 you will find new scientific articles, 

00:05:19.231 --> 00:05:20.521
 in which people ask, "How this one 

00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:22.591
 integrin knows exactly what to do? " 

00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:24.670
 or "How exactly does it send an alert to the cell?", 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.891
 or "How to connect 

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:32.621
 with the cytoskeleton or extracellular matrix? " 

00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:34.791
 These are interesting scientific questions 

00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:36.000
 and people are dealing with them 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.721
 for a long time, as there are always new questions 

00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:40.801
 about how these extremely complex proteins 

00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:44.001
 and glycoproteins - Fibronectin is a glycoprotein, 

00:05:44.001 --> 00:05:45.980
 the side chains of its protein moiety 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.961
 have 

00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:52.551
 carbohydrate chains, sugar chains, 

00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:54.121
 who are branching out of them. 

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:55.861
 How all these things interact 

00:05:55.861 --> 00:05:57.951
 and how they know what to do, 

00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:00.091
 how do all these complicated signaling mechanisms work? 

00:06:00.091 --> 00:06:01.751
 This is a very interesting area of ​​research. 

00:06:01.751 --> 00:06:03.792
 I hope this video showed you 

00:06:03.792 --> 00:06:06.498
 and helped you appreciate, 

00:06:06.498 --> 00:06:07.631
 the complexity of the structures they build, and they make the one that you are. 

00:06:07.631 --> 00:06:09.867
 We have already talked about the fact that cells themselves are complex, 

00:06:09.867 --> 00:06:12.751
 but they are found in the extracellular matrix, 

00:06:12.751 --> 00:06:14.751
 which helps defining tissues, 

00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:17.551
 it also helps the cells 

00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:18.921
 to live in "society" 

00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:21.891
 and to know how to relate and relate to each other. Also the extracellular matrix 

00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:24.811
 has a role in signaling from the external environment to the cell. 

00:06:24.811 --> 00:06:26.091
 Here I drew one 

00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:29.451
 integrin complex, 

00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:30.621
 but there are many of them 

00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.046
 along the membrane 

00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:34.551
 and they are not the only proteins. 

00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:36.051
 This is a remarkable detail for the cell membrane, 

00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:39.021
 which you will often see, painted only as a dual phospholipid layer. 

00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:40.591
 Actually, the membrane is located 

00:06:40.591 --> 00:06:42.191
 any proteins, 

00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:44.221
 which can be used as receptors allowing different molecules 

00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:45.791
 to enter or exit the cage. 

00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:48.691
 We see the cells 

00:06:48.691 --> 00:06:49.891
 are like big cities that 

00:06:49.891 --> 00:06:52.251
 can communicate with their more remote environment.
