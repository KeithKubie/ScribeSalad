MALE SPEAKER:
Hello, everyone, and

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.570
welcome to our third
installment of the Pride Series

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.640
in Mountain View.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.700
We have today with
us Samual Brinton,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.080
and we'll be talking
about ex-gay ministries

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.330
and conversion
therapy, which I like

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.260
to think Sam is one of
my closest role models

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.280
just because of how far he
has come with this story

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.770
and sharing that with
others, and as a survivor

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.980
myself, knowing how
far you can come.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.370
I met him, I believe,
four years ago now

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.490
and found myself from
a super small town

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.110
in Iowa all the
way to Google here.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.440
Definitely a testament
that things can change

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.250
and how far you can come.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.110
With that, Samual Brinton.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.240
SAMUAL BRINTON: Thank
you so much, Charles.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.070
Awesome.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.172
It is great to be
here with you today.

00:00:46.172 --> 00:00:47.880
I will probably be
walking back and forth

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.270
a bit, because standing
in one position for me

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.689
is little bit weird.

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:54.980
Today we're going to be
talking about-- I have a title,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.510
but it's a work
in progress-- "You

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.140
Can't Change What
We Never Chose."

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.710
Today, I'll be talking
about conversion therapy.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.140
Conversion therapy is also
known as reparative therapy

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.780
or sexual orientation
change efforts,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.630
or whatever we want to call it.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.900
In actuality, pretty much
what I'll be talking today

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.960
is about the torture that
we have legalized here

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.954
in the United States and in 48
states, which is a huge problem

00:01:14.954 --> 00:01:16.370
and something that
we're hopefully

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.780
going to be able to address.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.180
I'll try to tie-in a little bit
of how activism and academia

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.770
have been coalescing
in these spaces,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.499
and we'll have a lovely journey.

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:29.790
As we go through today, if
you ever have any questions,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.998
feel free, of course, to ask.

00:01:30.998 --> 00:01:32.740
We'll also definitely
have a lot of time

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.781
for questions at the end.

00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:36.010
It's very, very
important to me that I

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.600
get through this
experience and then

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.964
we discuss what we think
we're going to do next.

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:42.630
Please have questions
ready because it's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.600
really awkward at the end if
I'm standing here looking pretty

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.975
and you don't have
any questions.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.370
Let's get started.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.450
Initial questions--
who is this person?

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.730
Hi, I'm Sam Brinton.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.650
I was a graduate student at MIT.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.640
I just graduated two weeks ago,
I just got two Masters'-- one

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.420
in nuclear engineering, and
the other in technology policy.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.150
I work in nuclear
waste management

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.567
and disarming nuclear weapons
are my two areas of expertise,

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:12.150
which I know you
probably haven't seen

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.520
very many nuclear engineers in
heels before, but this is OK.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.209
We're going to work
on this together,

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.750
and soon, the entire
nuclear industry

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.460
will be fashion forward.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.200
Why am I talking?

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.460
I'm talking because this is
an important issue that's

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.100
affected me personally.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.940
But at the same time,
I recognize that even

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.398
without a personal
investment, this

00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:33.980
is something that is being
silenced in our community.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.160
For example, I live
there in Massachusetts.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.650
For 10 years, we
have had the ability

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.920
to have same sex
marriages, yet we still

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.580
have the legality of
converting our children

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.030
from gay individuals to
straight individuals.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.040
That is still a
completely legal practice

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.610
in Massachusetts
and 47 other states.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.350
While we may be
having a great debate

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.890
about a lot of
other issues, this

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.480
is something that I see as
a very important space that

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.760
is not getting enough attention.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.544
What am I going to
learn in this session?

00:03:04.544 --> 00:03:05.960
You're going to
learn a little bit

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.179
about the history of
conversion therapy.

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.720
You're going to learn a little
bit about my experience, which

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.920
is one experience.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.600
I should be very,
very, very clear.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.500
One experience of many
different types of experiences.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.760
You'll also learn a
little bit about how

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.370
we're addressing this currently.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.840
It's kind of a history
lesson, a sob story,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.490
and then a really
happy story of how

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.740
we're going to make it better.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.680
You're in the wrong room,
and should you leave,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.580
the exits are located
to the rear end.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.337
It's totally OK if
during this conversation,

00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:43.920
it gets a little too
emotional and you

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.840
feel like you need
that space to walk out.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.224
I work a lot with survivors.

00:03:48.224 --> 00:03:49.640
What I'm going to
be going through

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.960
is in front of you
rehashing of my story, which

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.220
can be very traumatic.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.060
It's very possible that at some
point during my presentation,

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.230
I might start crying.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.490
That's OK, because guess what?

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.280
Humans cry.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.030
This is a thing.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.610
I want to make sure that if
you're a survivor in this room,

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.962
I don't know what you look
like-- because guess what?

00:04:07.962 --> 00:04:09.920
Not all survivors have
as good fashion as I do,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.270
but other than
that, this space is

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.180
that survivors don't
look any different.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.399
Just because as the LGBT
community doesn't necessarily

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.550
stand out, and we're
in all communities--

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.400
survivors are in
all communities.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.860
We have to recognize that
some of you in this room

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.000
may also be that.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.420
Feel free to go out.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.070
Is he ever going
to stop talking?

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.355
I've been told I only have
so much time with you all,

00:04:34.355 --> 00:04:36.630
so I'm going to try
to stop talking.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.770
It's a work in progress.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.700
I also definitely tend
to go off on tangents.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.490
So if I end up on a
tangent, I'm going

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.744
to try to pull myself back.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:46.910
But we'll see where it goes.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.220
If you haven't guessed, I'm
also moderately energetic.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.270
If you need to be
boring, just let me know,

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.430
and I can sap all energy
and be monochromatic.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.300
That's pretty much where
we are for the intro.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.070
I use humor a lot in order to
get through this experience.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.560
History 101-- if you don't
know about the LGBT community,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.920
we've always existed,
so that's step one.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.880
Step one, the world is created.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.870
Gays make the world
a little bit better.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.020
Step two.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.060
Then over time because a
lot of different features,

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.690
we were classified
as a mental disorder.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.590
In that experience,
I tend to bring up

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.990
Sigmund Freud because he's
a well known psychoanalyst.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.630
In that space, Sigmund Freud was
influenced about homosexuality

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.950
by another researcher
who will go unnamed

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.930
at this point who believed that
homosexuals could be changed

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.190
to heterosexuals
by simply replacing

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.050
the testicles of a
straight man and putting

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.880
those testicles into a gay man.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.120
Question one-- how many straight
boys are raising their hands

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.200
and are like, give my
balls to the gay dude?

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.780
Please give my balls
to the gay dude.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.800
Not really a huge population
that are doing that.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.190
Two, sanitation in
surgery at the time

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.620
is not the highest quality, so
we're losing a lot of patients

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.550
not to heterosexuality,
but to infection.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.560
After a while, this practice
was thankfully ended.

00:06:21.216 --> 00:06:24.450
After a while, this practice
is thankfully ended.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.250
We over time start to
realize that maybe it's

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.160
not a useful process, and
maybe homosexuality itself

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.720
isn't the mental disorder.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.980
We go into those
spaces and we keep

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.947
trying to get it all
a little bit better.

00:06:38.947 --> 00:06:40.530
As soon as we are
no longer classified

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.610
as a mental disorder,
predominately religious

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.340
organizations step up being
like, nope, still a problem,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.210
still needs to be fixed.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.460
A majority of conversion therapy
spaces did occur in the past.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.586
I'm not negating that fact.

00:06:52.586 --> 00:06:54.210
But they're still
occurring, and that's

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.582
why we're still addressing this.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.290
But the reason that
they started to occur

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.748
was because religious
organizations

00:06:58.748 --> 00:07:01.600
were like, we can still help
you get away from this disorder.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.650
Those organizations
include Love in Action,

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.300
which tends to run the
large campus to help train

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.480
individuals on how
to be straight.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.290
Exodus International, which was
a large umbrella organization

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.930
of a lot of practitioners
trying to help

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.570
connect parents to a
way to help their child.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.130
Then you have NARTH,
the National Association

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.650
for the Research and
Treatment of Homosexuality.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.650
NARTH is the MIT of
conversion therapy science,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.610
i.e. tries to bring in
research into this area.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.110
If an individual from NARTH
is in the room, I apologize.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.170
I'm going to bash your
field for a pretty much

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.020
the entire conversation,
so good luck.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.770
NARTH, highly discredited,
not scientific.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.400
You're here at Google.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.490
I will allow you to
do your own research.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.775
Most of their research has
obviously been conversations

00:07:51.775 --> 00:07:55.490
right as a person leaves
an ex-gay facility.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.620
Well, if you just paid tens of
thousands of dollars to change,

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.380
you're likely right
after you leave

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.340
to say yes, it's had
some type of effect.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.930
If you don't do a
follow up and you

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.300
don't watch these
individuals, obviously, we're

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.030
never changed, and
have actually come out

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.600
to live healthy,
productive LGBT lives.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.600
You don't really get the
research going forward.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.975
A lot of people
have, thankfully,

00:08:15.975 --> 00:08:17.262
discredited their work.

00:08:17.262 --> 00:08:19.720
You also have organizations
like the American Psychological

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.570
Association, which
in 2009, stated

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.631
that all of these things that
we were doing were just wrong.

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.130
This is no longer
a mental disorder.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.270
Not only is that true,
but the health impacts

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.320
of this conversion
therapy is intense

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.890
on these poor individuals.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.950
Also discredits a lot
of NARTH information

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.710
that this is not an
actual conversion.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.409
These are not really conversions
of people, and as well,

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.750
speaks about the
health impacts, mostly,

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.530
which were most important.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.840
You also had individuals
like Spitzer,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.500
who in their original
research stated

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.070
that there's these NARTH spaces.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.210
These individuals have
the ability to change.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.830
And thankfully, in 2012,
comes back out and says,

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.470
this was not a strongly
scientific space,

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.210
and I pretty much recant
what I've said before.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.270
I apologize for
science trying to be

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.690
used to harm these individuals.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.400
If we go on into the most
what I would call modern age

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.750
conversion therapy,
in general, these

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.030
have been led by
religious organizations.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.930
I need to be very,
very clear right now.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:26.620
I am myself a QPOF-- a
Queer Person of Faith.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.800
I was praising my Jesus on
Sunday, and it was wonderful.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.067
Really good music.

00:09:34.067 --> 00:09:35.900
That's really important
for me, but it's not

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.970
important for everyone.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.178
But I do want to recognize
that what I'm going to say

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:41.940
may sound anti-religious, but is
not in any way, shape, or form.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.590
It is simply that a minority
and loud voice in that community

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.700
is getting too much attention
that these processes are

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.230
actually valid.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.820
The majority of
the faith community

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.540
is starting to recognize
that this is not

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.920
something we should be
doing to our children.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.800
I want to make sure to
make that association.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.626
However, for example,
the Mormon church

00:10:01.626 --> 00:10:03.125
has one of the more
famous examples.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.212
There was a number
of individuals

00:10:07.212 --> 00:10:09.420
who were attending Brigham
Young University in Provo,

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.503
which is a beautiful city.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.130
These individuals were
found out to be gay,

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.790
and the university told them,
you will either convert and go

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.290
through this process, or we
will kick you out of university.

00:10:23.817 --> 00:10:26.150
In case you haven't figured
out, that's called coercion.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.941
That's not a really
good scientific process

00:10:27.941 --> 00:10:31.790
for getting your
candidates for your study.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:35.370
These individuals go through
this process-- electroshock,

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:39.940
all types of very, very
excruciating experiences,

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.800
similar to if you ever have
seen the movie "Latter Days."

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.030
It kind of captures
parts of this story.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.600
Once they come back out,
many of these survivors

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.430
later would commit
suicide or die

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.870
because of the mental trauma.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.930
The university originally
ignored that it ever

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.500
happened, saying
that nope, we never

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.450
put these people through
anything like this.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.950
Once it's pretty
much scientifically

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.470
proven that there can't be this
many stories of this experience

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.100
without some corroboration,
the University says, well,

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.080
they volunteered.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.370
We have this space, which is a
central tenet of the conversion

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.580
therapy question
of, well, sorry.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.710
They decided that they
wanted this change.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.100
Coercion is never
a form of want.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.470
For myself and my
story, I was forcibly

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.090
coerced into this space.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.867
Especially if you're a minor
or a student in college,

00:11:28.867 --> 00:11:31.200
you're just starting to develop
your sexual orientation.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.100
You're just starting
to figure out

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.180
how you actually
relate to this space.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.420
Being told that there's
this easy way out

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.020
and that it's not
going to be hard,

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.932
don't worry-- with enough
prayer, you'll be fine is a lie

00:11:43.932 --> 00:11:46.390
that we're telling our children
and can be very, very, very

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.140
harmful.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.000
We need to recognize that
there may be faith spaces that

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.880
don't align with
sexual orientation,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.550
but that for many
of us, we have found

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.390
a community of sexual
orientation and faith together.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.980
I'll go through a
few trigger warnings.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:11.110
I'm about to go into my actual
personal story in this space.

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.436
One, if you're a survivor,
highly graphic content.

00:12:14.436 --> 00:12:16.310
I will be going through
all of my experience,

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.770
so if you are a survivor, I
want to mentally prepare you

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.069
that this is my chance
to kind of share

00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:23.610
with a non-survivor
community, so I'm

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.350
going to lay it all
out on the line.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.020
There will be multiple
trigger warnings,

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.040
for example-- abuse,
suicide, a lot

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.040
of anything with electroshock.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.417
Also, I have already warned
you about my emotional state.

00:12:37.417 --> 00:12:39.000
I'm finally getting
to the point where

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.360
I can get through this story
without completely emotionally

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.200
breaking down, and I will have
a lot of lemon sorbet tonight,

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.630
which is my coping mechanism
to get through this.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.870
But I want to warn you that
especially since we have people

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.970
watching online and this
will be recorded, that if I

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.884
do emotionally
breakdown, that's OK.

00:12:56.884 --> 00:12:57.800
I will get through it.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.370
I'll probably stop the
story, and we'll just

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.328
move onto the next section,
because guess what?

00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:03.495
It's my story to share when
I want with who I want.

00:13:03.495 --> 00:13:04.870
I'm sharing it
with you because I

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.634
want to inspire you to do
something good with a story.

00:13:07.634 --> 00:13:09.050
You are free to
take it out, but I

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.352
ask that you do provide
these trigger warnings people

00:13:11.352 --> 00:13:13.310
as you share the story,
because you don't know,

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.510
again, what a
survivor looks like.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.490
Let's get started with
[HIGH PITCHED VOICE]

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.270
some of my favorite
pictures in the world.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.186
I was talking high,
sorry. [LOW PITCHED VOICE]

00:13:21.186 --> 00:13:23.270
Some of favorite
pictures in the world.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.280
So that's me as a baby.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.940
I'm adorable.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.210
If you haven't noticed,
you can kind of see it,

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:34.390
but my hair pretty much matches
the color of that red fire

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.460
truck.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.560
My mom loved to do this
with me as a child.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.268
She would put me up
next to a fire truck,

00:13:39.268 --> 00:13:42.000
and you couldn't tell where
my hair stopped and the truck

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.230
began because I literally
had that bright red hair.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.520
So I just consider this
going back to my roots.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.590
This is not my
actual hair color.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.800
Just letting you know.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.630
Also, I wanted to
point out my family.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.860
That's my father.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.129
Me and my sister.

00:13:57.129 --> 00:13:58.920
Obviously, both of us
have such wide smiles

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.339
that we can't ever
seem to show our eyes.

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:03.130
And then my baby brother,
12 years younger,

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:06.200
who's getting to the
same level of smiling.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.930
I grew up as a Southern
Baptist missionary,

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:16.170
traveling to South America
and across the globe

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:21.140
trying to share the love
of Christ with others.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.710
My passion for that was mostly
through humanitarian spaces.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.041
Obviously, as a child, I
recognized the importance

00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:29.290
of faith, but I was definitely
doing it more of a, oh,

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.290
we're doing this good
work in a village.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:36.860
We're teaching a language, or
we're giving them written word.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.712
A lot of these kind of spaces.

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:40.670
We moved back-- I'm not
going to go through all

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.086
my missionary life
because we only

00:14:42.086 --> 00:14:44.749
have so much time-- we
moved back to Florida.

00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:46.790
You may be wondering why
there's a random Playboy

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:52.700
on this screen--
because I adore Playboy.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.050
The missionary child has a very
limited scope of information.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.270
We didn't, one, have
Google that we really

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:04.720
accessing at that time, and
two, we were very much censored.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.690
If any of you grew up in
the evangelical community,

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.710
the largest thing that
I got to experience

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.090
was Veggie Tales,
which are large,

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:15.197
singing vegetables about Christ.

00:15:15.197 --> 00:15:16.780
I will not go into
the song right now,

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.531
because if anyone
else sings it, we'll

00:15:18.531 --> 00:15:19.780
all start singing it together.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.196
It'll be really
creepy, and you'll

00:15:21.196 --> 00:15:23.840
be like, what do they drink?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.170
Anyway, imagine moving
from Christian vegetables

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.620
to a Playboy magazine.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.320
That's a large, large
social jump for a lot of us.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.680
We'd found one out in the trash.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.920
All of the boys start
getting excited.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.130
I consider myself so
holy and righteous

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.730
that it doesn't
affect me, and started

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.300
praying for the sinners,
starting praying.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:51.030
Go to my parents, and my
dad's very proud of me

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.070
that I didn't react.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.192
Because I told them everything,
I look at my father, and I say,

00:15:58.192 --> 00:15:59.900
yeah, but sometimes
I have those feelings

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.920
when I think about Dale.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.000
Because it was a natural thing
that literally came out just

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.055
like that like.

00:16:05.055 --> 00:16:07.180
Like, you tell your parents
when you sin sometimes.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.140
Because you know what?

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.690
I have problems too, Dad.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:12.277
I'll pray for myself,
and I'll work on it.

00:16:12.277 --> 00:16:14.860
I thought it was totally OK to
have it with Dale, just like it

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.670
would be OK to
have it with Sarah.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.680
Doesn't everyone just
have these feelings?

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.619
My dad's face dropped.

00:16:20.619 --> 00:16:22.410
Dale, if you haven't
guessed at this point,

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.910
is a male identified individual.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.150
I sometimes identify as male.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.510
At that time, I was.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:33.170
It was a very interesting space
of my father's face dropping,

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.810
him coming toward me,
and then I woke up

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:41.150
in the emergency room of the
mission organization, which

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.500
was just down a few floors.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.220
My father had
knocked me out cold.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.130
I would get beaten
a few more times

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.630
before my parents
would finally recognize

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.200
that maybe this wasn't working.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.160
This wasn't quite the space
that we wanted for him.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.002
We moved into
conversion therapy.

00:16:59.002 --> 00:17:00.960
I still don't know how
they found out about it.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.310
It could have been
googling for it

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.660
but again, I don't remember
if they did that back then.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.859
Or it could have just been
hearing about it at the church.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:14.770
We showed up to the
conversion therapy site,

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.719
and it's across from a
beautiful, pristine, blue lake,

00:17:17.719 --> 00:17:19.510
which is useless in
Florida for finding it,

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.700
because there's like
a million lakes.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.920
We walk into the room.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:29.900
There on the coffee table are
seven bibles all in a stack.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.540
To which, I look up at my mom
with the largest grin, which

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:38.550
you've already seen previously,
before saying, oh my gosh.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.820
He loves Jesus just
as much as we do.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.634
I was so happy
that someone would

00:17:43.634 --> 00:17:44.800
be just as excited as I was.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:54.190
My mom looks down and
says, yes, yes he does.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:57.140
He loves Jesus just
as much as we do.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.650
That would begin my
conversion therapy experience.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.080
It ranged from me being
told that I was the only

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.540
gay left in the world, that
the government had come through

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.400
and killed off every other
single gay in the entire globe.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.926
And that somehow,
myself and a few others

00:18:11.926 --> 00:18:13.550
would every once in
awhile get through.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.360
But that was enough
work, it'd be OK.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.140
Some of you in this room,
a mildly intelligent group,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.340
are like wow, Sam, how did
you get through to MIT?

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.120
Because you're obviously the
biggest ditz I've ever met.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.730
Imagine, again,
where I've lived.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.063
I've lived in places where
the government coming through

00:18:31.063 --> 00:18:33.920
and killing off a group of
people, totally normalized.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.650
I've watched people shot
right in front of me.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.392
That was a part of my childhood.

00:18:39.392 --> 00:18:41.433
The government coming
through and killing people?

00:18:41.433 --> 00:18:42.420
Sure.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.387
Obviously, that's something
that could happen.

00:18:45.387 --> 00:18:47.970
That's also a really great way
to keep a person in the closet.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.011
If you think the government
is going to kill you,

00:18:50.011 --> 00:18:51.700
you pretty much
don't tell anyone.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.790
We then moved to the
space of not only

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.329
did the government
want to kill me,

00:18:57.329 --> 00:18:58.870
but the reason they
wanted to kill me

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.169
was because the gays had
brought AIDS into America.

00:19:02.169 --> 00:19:03.960
That was why the
government was purging us,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.460
was they were trying
to save the population.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.590
I've been to South Africa.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.730
I've worked in an
AIDS orphanage.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.390
I know that this
is an actuality.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.060
I know this is a possibility.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.090
I didn't understand
why they had AIDS

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.240
because they didn't
seem to be same-sex,

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.120
but I'd seen what this
horrible disease could do.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.560
So now I'm dying internally,
the government wants to kill me,

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.350
and then the next few weeks
were about how God hated me.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.580
The last straw, this
beautiful central tenet--

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.630
I know that I'm
probably harping on too

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:43.090
much, but for a child like
myself, that was what I could

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:48.300
hold onto was that at
least God loved me still.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.632
That was taken away from me.

00:19:49.632 --> 00:19:51.340
God hated me, we went
through the verses,

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.127
and now I understood that
these abominations were myself.

00:19:54.127 --> 00:19:55.710
We'd always talked
about abominations.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.660
But Jews were abominations.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.007
Catholics were abominations.

00:19:59.007 --> 00:20:01.340
People who wore white after
Labor Day were abominations.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.530
Baptists are very
good at judging.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.610
I wonder how I
turned out like this.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.020
We're very, very
good at judging.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.510
Because I had
become that space, I

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.040
didn't understand that I
was one of those people now.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.630
Once that connection was made,
emotionally, I am devastated.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.670
This is where the suicide began.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.040
This is where I do
prove I'm a ditz.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.940
I'd heard-- I don't
know where-- that if you

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.270
took a lot of pills,
you would die.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.400
Instead of two
Advil, I took three.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.250
I laid down on my bed,
definition of princess.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:37.804
Crossed my arms over
my body, and just

00:20:37.804 --> 00:20:39.470
prayed that God would
just take it away,

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:43.450
like, I'm so sorry that
I failed you so badly.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:48.820
I woke up without a
headache and realized

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.220
that it wasn't going to work.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.890
I tried really hard.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.720
For the next month, I
would wake up praying

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.870
and go to sleep
praying and eat praying

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:04.469
and cry and sob with my
parents, telling them

00:21:04.469 --> 00:21:07.010
I was doing everything I could,
but I just didn't understand.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.102
I was too honest.

00:21:08.102 --> 00:21:09.560
I was honestly
trying to figure out

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.240
why it wouldn't go away, why
this feeling wouldn't go away.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.520
Then we moved into
physical therapy,

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.040
where my hands would
be either placed

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.432
in ice or ice cubes placed
on them while pictures

00:21:19.432 --> 00:21:21.140
of men touching other
the men were shown.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.840
So I would associate
that freezing cold

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.870
with a touch of another man.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:29.782
To this day, is still
hurts to touch another man.

00:21:29.782 --> 00:21:31.740
Heating coils would be
wrapped around my hands,

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.760
and they'd be
turned on with heat

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.650
when pictures of men
touching men were shown,

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:39.340
turned off when pictures of
men touching women were shown.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.950
I'm supposed to
associate that it's

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.830
going to be horrible
if you touch a man,

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.120
but it's going to be OK
if you touch a woman.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.210
If you have ever taken
a psychology class, what

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.340
they were doing to
me was Pavlov's dogs.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:59.762
It culminated in
electroshock therapy.

00:21:59.762 --> 00:22:02.480
Electrodes were
attached to my fingers

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.810
and then shocks were
given to me while I

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.870
was shown pornographic images
of men having sex with men.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.960
This would be later on-- my
first kiss, within seconds,

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.300
I would puke just simply
from the excruciating pain

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.560
of remembering what
that felt like.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.720
To this day, any male-identified
individuals in this room

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.260
or whoever I meet, I
tend to pull them in

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.951
to hug me because I
don't want to have

00:22:29.951 --> 00:22:31.200
them be the one that hurts me.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.505
I want to hurt myself
when I touch them.

00:22:33.505 --> 00:22:35.130
It's also a very
important space for me

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.670
that they feel OK to touch me
because the concept of being

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.160
a leper is even worse.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.910
Recognizing what this
has done to our children

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.800
has complete-- I was
in the exact zone

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.199
that I was mentally developing.

00:22:49.199 --> 00:22:50.990
So for the rest of my
life, I will probably

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.290
have some of these effects.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.100
It's getting way better.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.310
I happily have had boyfriends.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:59.176
I've happily moved to
a lot of these spaces

00:22:59.176 --> 00:23:00.800
where I can deal with
this, because I'm

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.760
a champion in those zones
that I'm able to move forward.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.130
But those lasting
effects are eternal.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:16.370
I finally realized that
there's nothing left.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.990
I tried a few other
suicide attempts,

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.180
and finally, say goodbye to
my family-- my sister, excuse

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:26.830
me-- go to the roof, and I'm
about to jump because I just

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:27.974
can't deal with it anymore.

00:23:27.974 --> 00:23:30.140
Suicide's a sin, but let's
be honest, at this point,

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.723
there's nothing
really that much worse

00:23:31.723 --> 00:23:34.210
than what I'm at this point.

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:37.409
My mom finds me, tells me
that she will love me again

00:23:37.409 --> 00:23:39.200
if I will just change,
which is not a thing

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.366
to say to your child who
is about to commit suicide,

00:23:41.366 --> 00:23:43.830
just for future reference.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.840
Then, because I'm moderately
logical-- thankfully,

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.400
not ditsy at this
point-- I turn and say,

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.544
he did it, meaning
God had changed me.

00:23:52.544 --> 00:23:54.210
Because I looked down,
I was like-- if I

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.080
don't die with this fall, it's
going to really hurt a lot.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.380
I'm not going to
do this anymore.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.760
I realized that lying
was a bad thing,

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.770
but it was all I could
do at this point.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.030
Instantaneously, whoosh.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.030
Everything stops.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.290
We don't talk about
any of my past.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:14.481
It is as if everything has
changed, and we're now in Oz.

00:24:14.481 --> 00:24:15.480
Everything is beautiful.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.880
Funny that we said Oz.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.490
We would then move to Iowa
where my dad had grown up.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.780
I would go to high school.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.480
I would convince my parents
let me go to public high school

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.760
so I could be a missionary
to the other kids.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.867
I would do most of my schooling
at home and then move over.

00:24:36.867 --> 00:24:37.950
It was a beautiful moment.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.854
It was this space that I
could finally experience.

00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:42.270
I still thought
the government was

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.630
going to kill me if I came out.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.171
I'd never met another
gay individual.

00:24:45.171 --> 00:24:47.030
I'm in middle of Iowa
where the only person

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:50.850
that I heard that
was gay was literally

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:56.400
dragged behind a truck
by the football team.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.150
This is not something that
I'm experiencing, ever.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.330
We never, in all of my
years of high school,

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.170
ever mentioned the
word "gay" once

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.850
in my school, which
is fascinating to me.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.420
I'd now look at
their current spaces

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.961
and be like, that
would never happen.

00:25:10.961 --> 00:25:12.990
But in my space, it was
completely normalized.

00:25:16.474 --> 00:25:18.890
Decided to be a nuclear engineer
because my parents wanted

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:20.920
me to go to Kansas State
University in Kansas--

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.814
excuse me.

00:25:21.814 --> 00:25:24.230
My parents wanted me to go to
Pensacola Christian College.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.646
Pensacola Christian
College didn't

00:25:25.646 --> 00:25:27.020
have nuclear engineering.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.728
I chose nuclear
engineering so I wouldn't

00:25:28.728 --> 00:25:30.550
have to go to Pensacola
Christian College.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.130
Probably a better reason to
choose nuclear engineering

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.210
than to not go to Pensacola
Christian College,

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:35.959
but it worked really
well, and I liked it,

00:25:35.959 --> 00:25:38.340
and it was a good
academic challenge.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.690
Went to university
and would later

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:45.980
come back out after
finding a community, which

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.100
we can talk about more
in the questions space,

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.400
but then would start talking
about the story thinking

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.870
that other people had gone
through exactly what I'd

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.065
gone through and started
realizing that people

00:25:55.065 --> 00:25:57.440
like Charles and others had
gone through this experience.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.460
That I wasn't the
only one who had

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.470
gone through these pains
and these sufferings.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.470
That's why we work on this, is
because although that is one

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:10.620
story, and there are
thousands of others,

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:15.670
they're all that wretched mental
torture, which is completely

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:16.840
legalized in this country.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.570
Again, I can't fathom it.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.840
We would never allow this
to happen to prisoners,

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.720
and yet we do it to
our own children.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.490
This is the space that I'm at.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.410
Let's talk about how
we get that to stop.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:34.900
One, we get professional
organizations on our side.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.060
If there's an APA in
the country-- except

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.430
for the podiatry
association, or something,

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:44.880
I don't know-- hahaha, heels.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.980
They are against
conversion therapy.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.070
It is blatantly been shown
by professional organizations

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.660
to not work and
be very damaging.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:53.160
Great.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.720
So we have professionals
on our side.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:00.220
Social workers, medical doctors,
psychologists, psychiatrists,

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.872
everyone says this is a problem.

00:27:02.872 --> 00:27:04.580
The challenge is that
just because you're

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.920
a professional organization
doesn't mean that you actually

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.520
have control over
the entire situation.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.040
These organizations actually
came out awhile ago saying it,

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.170
but yet, it was still
massively practiced

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:19.280
because a lot of people were
just ignoring this fact.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.170
One, we have special
organizations on our side.

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:26.730
The problem is we don't
have mass education.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.940
No one knows that this
is still happening,

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.740
and so because of it,
we're not actually

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.480
making the major
strives that we need,

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.654
which is where you come in.

00:27:36.654 --> 00:27:38.570
A lot of my friends will
every once in a while

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.520
invoke issues-- both
in nuclear weapons

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.170
and in conversion therapy,
be like, the 1980s called.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.550
They want their issue back.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.080
And I'll be like, 2014 called.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.670
Still an issue.

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.359
We still have many
nuclear weapons.

00:27:50.359 --> 00:27:52.900
In case you didn't know, 23,000
nuclear weapons in the world.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.600
Trying to disarm them, but
it's a slow-going process.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.550
We also have
thousands of students

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.430
who are put through
this conversion therapy

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.645
every single year.

00:28:01.645 --> 00:28:03.270
The National Center
for Lesbian Rights,

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.311
which I'll cover a little
bit more in the future,

00:28:05.311 --> 00:28:06.860
is starting to
work on this issue

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.530
and starting to really delve
into why this is a problem.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:12.914
But a lot of other major
LGBT organizations are not.

00:28:12.914 --> 00:28:14.330
This is my call
to them, that they

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.480
need to start telling
these stories.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.935
They need to start working
together as organizations so

00:28:18.935 --> 00:28:20.560
that we can actually
make a difference.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.870
Because if we can be
married for 10 years

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.530
but can still electrocute
our kids, something's wrong.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:29.460
This is why we need more
of this educational space.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.750
We also need to protect those
who've gone through this.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.640
For myself and for
others here at Google

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.330
and for other survivors
across the country,

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.740
we are highly prone to suicide.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.350
Let's talk a little
bit about why.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.270
You've just gone through
conversion therapy

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.720
with a therapist, so
who are you supposed

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.840
to talk to about your
feelings once you're

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.470
done with conversion therapy?

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:55.190
The person who was
horrifying traumatic to you?

00:28:55.190 --> 00:29:00.130
Going into a mental health
situation for me was horrible.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.230
I couldn't go into--
I can't sit on a couch

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.440
opposite of a therapist.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.540
It took me years to
be able to do that.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.260
In the last three
months, I've finally

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.820
been able to sit on the couch
opposite of another male

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.980
while we talk about
mental health.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.720
It took me that long
because I couldn't

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.280
experience all of
the trauma again.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.340
We have this major issue
that we have no one to go to.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.110
Our partners--
again, I told you,

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.350
I puked a few seconds after
my very first gay kiss.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.600
That's not a very great
way to start the date,

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.990
was just letting you
know of that right now.

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:37.770
Boyfriends have had to
not be able to touch me

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:40.570
when I'm crying.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.590
That's the moment
you want to be there

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:45.340
for your friend and your
partner, and you can't do it.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.240
We feel very alone.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.170
Because of that, it
obviously leads--

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.630
the APA and others have said
to substance abuse and suicide

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.540
and major, major mental
health connection problems.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.770
I highly recommend, in
case you don't have it

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:04.780
in your repertoire,
the Trevor Project.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.130
We work for the Trevor Project.

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.360
They know about survivors.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.980
They know about how
to deal with us.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.850
Just telling us that
it's going to be OK

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:12.226
and that it's OK
to be gay is not

00:30:12.226 --> 00:30:13.641
the best system
for a person who's

00:30:13.641 --> 00:30:16.070
just been told for years that
it's not OK to be themselves

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:17.990
and that by even
using the word gay,

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.030
they're going to
eternal damnation.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.996
You probably shouldn't
use some of those terms.

00:30:21.996 --> 00:30:23.370
They've worked
with these phases,

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.540
and they're really good
helping us deal with it.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.290
Connecting a survivor
community to say

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:28.824
that you're OK as
you are, and we're

00:30:28.824 --> 00:30:30.990
going to work with you to
find you the mental health

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:35.060
that you need is a
very important space.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.160
Then we have to work to
actually make it stop.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:42.604
Not only do you educate
about the history

00:30:42.604 --> 00:30:44.020
and work with the
survivors, which

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:48.820
I consider more important, but
you also have to make this end.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.260
Exodus International-- the
group that I told you about,

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.718
that I was telling
you earlier on--

00:30:52.718 --> 00:30:54.900
has thankfully been shuttered.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:00.240
It has been changed over in part
to the Restored Hope Network.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.676
Umbrella organizations
are tough,

00:31:01.676 --> 00:31:03.050
because when you
tumble the head,

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:05.010
you still have all the
babies, and they still

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.830
keep flying all over
doing evil damage.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.420
There's more networks that are
going to keep coming forward.

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.060
Until you start actually
addressing all of those sites,

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.730
you're going to
have these problems.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.896
You also have organizations
like Focus on the Family

00:31:17.896 --> 00:31:19.880
or the Family Research
Council, which

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.670
produces books like, "How to
Make Men be Like Men" and "How

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:24.760
to Make Women be
Like Women," which

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.307
may seem to only be
a slight challenge,

00:31:27.307 --> 00:31:28.890
but it's obviously
conversion therapy.

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.820
This is blatantly
telling you, you're not

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.028
fitting into the gender
identity or the gender spaces

00:31:33.028 --> 00:31:35.000
that we expect of
you to act like,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.160
and therefore you
must be changed.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.170
In case you haven't
figured out, I don't always

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:41.544
fit into the gender identity
and gender expression spaces

00:31:41.544 --> 00:31:44.090
that I was assigned at
birth, but that's OK,

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:46.460
because I'm being myself and
I'm OK with those spaces.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:50.850
We have to be able to create
those self-centering spaces.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:55.114
We also have individuals
like Michelle Bachmann.

00:31:55.114 --> 00:31:56.780
I realize this is now
recorded, so there

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.450
goes my political
career, but anyway.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.840
You can't really see it,
and I apologize for it,

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:09.210
but Crazy Eyes, as I lovingly
referred to her as-- obviously,

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:11.800
if you haven't guessed,
ran a presidential campaign

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.850
and actually did pretty
well, whose husband

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:18.350
practices conversion
therapy on individuals.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.720
It's not like this is the
most hidden organization

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.940
and not-talked-about thing.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.400
It is blatantly known that
Michele Bachmann's husband

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.500
practices conversion
therapy, which

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.280
means that we had a
presidential candidate who

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:36.690
the first "lady" would have
practiced conversion therapy.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:37.830
That's a problem.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.820
When it's not called out for
what it is, that's a problem.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.270
This is why we're needing
each of you to be involved.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:46.260
Here's what we need you to do.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.180
The ultimate goal is
that anyone under 18

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.650
should not be able to
undergo conversion therapy.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.100
It should be outlawed.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.680
Some of you are like,
whoa, what about over 18?

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:59.020
I can't stop you from eating
as many Big Macs as you want.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.334
You can do it.

00:33:00.334 --> 00:33:01.250
It's not good for you.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:02.620
I can tell you all the health.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.790
I can put as many warnings
on it as possible,

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.780
but I can't stop me you
doing it, necessarily.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:10.970
I can stop you from force
feeding Big Macs to children

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.770
because that's called abuse.

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.460
What I'm doing is I'm creating
a space where at least I

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.670
can get the children
out of the home

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.570
or into a safe space where they
can learn about the damages

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:21.780
that this can cause.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.130
Over 18, you shouldn't do it.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.330
Conversion therapy
is bad, it's harmful.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:30.110
But I can always try to
warn you as a person who

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.340
will have to choose to go
through all of this red tape

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.530
and say OK, I want to
make this damage happen.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.300
Under 18, you don't
have that option.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.860
You never had that choice.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.030
That's what I'm trying
to protect first.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.220
I know we can have
a debate about that,

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.510
and I'm totally fine
with it, but that's

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:45.020
at least where we're starting.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:48.030
Let's go with that space.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:51.800
This is literally the best
week to be presenting this.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.046
On Monday, for the very
first time in my life--

00:33:54.046 --> 00:33:55.920
hopefully not the last,
because nuclear waste

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.461
is going to be solved
at some point--

00:33:57.461 --> 00:33:59.670
I was interviewed
for Time Magazine.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:04.590
We had the front page of Time
talking about the Born Perfect

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:05.170
campaign.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:07.360
This is actually San Francisco.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:13.139
This is the Golden
Gate Bridge Park,

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.070
and I actually went to
the same spot on Monday

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:17.829
just to remember what it
felt like to be there.

00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:19.620
This is a campaign from
the National Center

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.679
of Lesbian Rights
specifically targeted

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.820
to end conversion therapy.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.440
The first campaign of its kind.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.107
There's no country
that has outlawed it,

00:34:27.107 --> 00:34:28.606
but there are two
states which have,

00:34:28.606 --> 00:34:30.290
and I'll talk a little
bit about those.

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:31.831
This is a space
where we can actually

00:34:31.831 --> 00:34:34.210
start to have a conversation
about conversion therapy

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:35.239
on a national scale.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:38.590
We can actually begin to
make this something that

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:40.311
is important and a conversation.

00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:42.310
I will talk a little bit
more about Born Perfect

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.270
and I'm happy to
answer questions,

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:46.949
but I wanted you to know that
this finally becoming a space.

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:51.139
Our two successes far,
of many, is Senate Bill

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:52.949
112 here in California.

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:54.510
I'm literally
talking to the choir.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.010
You're the very
first time I've ever

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.550
spoken about this in California.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.490
It's the time that
I can actually say,

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:01.879
you've already done it.

00:35:01.879 --> 00:35:03.670
Because no other state
has, really, so it's

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.970
been a lot of work.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:09.670
You have actually made it
illegal for conversion therapy

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:10.910
to occur here in California.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:12.826
To those of you who are
watching, you haven't.

00:35:12.826 --> 00:35:14.460
You have work to do.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:15.960
Or if you're watching
in California,

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.880
you're kind of-- anyway.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.210
The second state that
we have made it illegal

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:22.620
is in New Jersey.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.740
A Republican governor
and a Democratic governor

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.800
have both signed legislation
making this illegal.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.780
This is a nonpartisan.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.380
When this gets to a
vote, it is very hard

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.530
to say no, I really want
to shock my children.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:39.120
That is not something that is
a very easy thing to argue.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.070
Yes, there will be
arguments against us.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.570
There will be First
Amendment issues

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:43.330
that they're going
to try to raise.

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.895
There are going to be
religious exemptions

00:35:44.895 --> 00:35:46.353
that they're going
to try to raise.

00:35:46.353 --> 00:35:49.130
But in general, when
we get this to a vote,

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:51.762
is pretty one-sided
that we're going to win.

00:35:51.762 --> 00:35:53.220
The challenge is
just that we don't

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.970
have enough education about
people talking about this.

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:59.150
There are amazing other
survivors other than myself.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:02.370
There are not a lot of us who
are able to speak about it.

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:06.000
Again, what I just went
through-- not to sound sad--

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.400
was traumatic.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.140
I'm going to have
trauma tonight because

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.150
of what we talked about.

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:12.760
And that's OK, because
it's important space.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.562
Other survivors do
the same exact thing,

00:36:14.562 --> 00:36:16.020
but it is very hard
for us to do it

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.770
because we don't always
have the strongest

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:19.420
network of people
who support us.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:23.750
There's Deb, who I just
met this weekend, and as

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.640
another person of
faith, is recognizing

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.550
that the traumas that
she was put through, yes,

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.220
happened in the name
of faith, but do not

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.030
represent that faith.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:37.010
There's Ryan, who worked here
in California to pass the bill

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:39.980
and just graduated from
Columbia, a champion

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.980
among these spaces
who stands beside me.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.550
We hug each other
knowing that it hurts,

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.440
and look at each
other saying, well,

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.042
we made it through another day.

00:36:50.042 --> 00:36:52.000
There's Matthew, who's
working to currently get

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.020
the bill passed in New York
State, a man who recognizes

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.756
that the trauma that he went
through does define his path,

00:37:01.756 --> 00:37:03.630
but does not define his
future and recognizes

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.040
that although he may have
had a horrible experience,

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.300
he can do great
things with his story.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.650
These survivors like myself
are trying to get the word out

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.240
and are trying to
get the space out,

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.823
but there's not very
many of us and we

00:37:14.823 --> 00:37:17.270
need people like you
to share our stories

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.340
and to share what is
going on, so that it

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.600
doesn't happen again.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.790
Here's where we are.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:25.570
You can see New Jersey
and California, orange,

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:29.430
which is, first of all, not
a beautiful color to wear.

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:31.210
I'm just, as your
fashion police,

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:32.700
be very careful with it.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.410
Be very careful if you're
going to wear orange.

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:36.520
Anyway.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.240
Sorry, dejection.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.890
Orange, yay, states
that we've passed.

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:44.140
Green are states with
active legislation,

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.990
and yet even more are
considering legislation.

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:49.770
Each day, we have more and
more spaces with the National

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:52.270
Center for Lesbian Rights and
other organizations coalescing

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.040
to say, this has got to stop.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.810
12 states alone this
legislative cycle

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:59.110
have added legislation
just considering it.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.760
This is the definition of
the beginning of a movement,

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.280
and we're excited.

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.020
When I got the invitation
to come and speak,

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.050
this is exactly the spaces
that we can actually

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:10.133
start making a difference.

00:38:10.133 --> 00:38:12.720
We can start taking
this story out there.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.070
As you can see, they're
starting to take over.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:19.340
We will, in five
years, have eradicated

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.450
this horrible torture.

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:25.040
Now it's your turn-- because I
went to a school that gave me

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:29.140
a lot of homework, so it's
my turn to give homework.

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.710
First, you need to tell
people about this session.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.670
You can mention the
bright red stilettos.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:35.730
You can mention the red mohawk.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:37.100
I don't care what you say.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.550
But you need to talk about
this awesome session-- well,

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.404
it was awesome.

00:38:40.404 --> 00:38:41.320
There's other options.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.320
It was an awesome session--
this awesome session

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.500
that you went to, and
then take the story out.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.560
That's a very important space.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.460
Talk about Born Perfect.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.330
It just came out on Tuesday.

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:53.055
There's so much press
about it right now

00:38:53.055 --> 00:38:54.430
that it's something
that you need

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:57.780
to be at this moment catalyzing.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.800
Then, read an
article about this.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.240
My story is one voice.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.740
There's many other
voices out there,

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:06.940
and I want you to be able
to get a perspective of how

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.660
wide the range can be.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:13.240
Also, I know that we're at
Google, but Facebook friends.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.150
I have a public page where I
talk about all of these spaces.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:19.400
Please go on and actually
check out the page and we'll

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.100
happily have a conversation.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.500
This is my Gmail account.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:28.460
I changed it this morning so
it wasn't my MIT email address.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.010
I was like, ah yes.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:32.310
This is how I'll
tailor it to you guys.

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:34.260
There you go.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.207
You're welcome.

00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:38.040
I would happily have a
conversation with you

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.600
also about these
kinds of spaces.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.680
That's where we wrap up
the conversation here.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.497
I'm looking forward
to your questions.

00:39:44.497 --> 00:39:46.080
Like I said, please
don't make me just

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.260
stand up here looking pretty.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:52.250
We'll obviously take questions
from the stream, as well.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:53.440
Thank you for being here.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.747
I hope that was helpful.

00:39:55.747 --> 00:39:57.330
You can't choose
what you never chose,

00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:59.710
but you can change
this horrible torture

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.740
to make sure it doesn't
happen to another child.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:02.240
Thank you.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:06.647 --> 00:40:08.605
AUDIENCE: My parents
didn't believe in therapy.

00:40:08.605 --> 00:40:10.210
They sent me to a doctor.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:11.760
They gave me hormones.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.480
I had a hormone treatment
for like three years

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.710
that sent me up and
down, up and down

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:19.970
all the time until
I went to therapy.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:22.380
The therapist was like,
you should get off

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.220
of all the medicines.

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.445
The law will include
something like that?

00:40:27.445 --> 00:40:29.330
Or it's going to be just--

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:32.140
SAMUAL BRINTON: That
is a great question.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.194
We talk a lot about therapies
that also-- and especially

00:40:35.194 --> 00:40:36.610
in this legislation,
that identify

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:40.670
with gender identity-- I
would consider a good lawyer

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.700
would be able to connect that
forcing hormones onto someone

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:46.760
is probably somehow related
to how you're expecting

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:50.570
their gender expression or their
gender identity to coalesce.

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:55.634
I would say that in my
non-lawyer experience, that

00:40:55.634 --> 00:40:57.550
is something that would
definitely be covered.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:01.050
Because it's connected to
trying to change someone's

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:05.930
sexual orientation or
gender identity spaces.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.540
There are stories like
this of overloading

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.290
a boy with testosterone
because you really

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.500
think it'll make him a man,
which, if you haven't guessed,

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.070
is not the best system
for your health.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:18.754
Be very, very, very careful
as it's going through.

00:41:18.754 --> 00:41:21.170
One, thank you for sharing
your experience, because that's

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:25.640
a very important thing and a
very hard thing, sometimes,

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.630
to share.

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:28.710
But yes, these
types of legislation

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.240
will help correct that.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.934
Thank you for asking.

00:41:31.934 --> 00:41:34.100
AUDIENCE: Also not a lawyer,
but the California law,

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.141
the way I was reading it,
said something specific

00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:38.280
about mental health
professionals.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.980
Does that wording
make it limiting?

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.572
Do you wish that
would be more broad?

00:41:43.572 --> 00:41:45.405
SAMUAL BRINTON: This
is why I shouldn't just

00:41:45.405 --> 00:41:46.113
have Sam up here.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:52.090
The first space that I'll enter
would be yes, it is limiting.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:54.620
That is partially how you get
some of these bills through,

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:59.520
is by limiting it to licensed
mental health professionals

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.310
and making that addressed.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:06.605
Other conversations also start
to relate it to a responder.

00:42:13.054 --> 00:42:15.910
Anyone like a librarian or
a teacher or someone that

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:20.164
can hear-- someone that is
forced to tell about abuse,

00:42:20.164 --> 00:42:21.830
some of the legislation
is also starting

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.371
to address them, as well, saying
that this is not something--

00:42:24.371 --> 00:42:27.490
if you hear about this and it's
not through a mental health

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:30.080
professional, at
least we can find you

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:34.240
and say no, that's something
we can protect against.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.120
You can't take a license
away from someone

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.809
who doesn't have a license.

00:42:37.809 --> 00:42:39.350
Religious organizations
will probably

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.930
practice this for
the rest of time,

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:44.995
unless I can figure
out a way to stop it.

00:42:44.995 --> 00:42:47.680
I may not able to find
every little camp.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.880
I may not be able to
find every pastor.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:54.730
But I can make it something
that culturally is unacceptable.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:59.752
Three years ago-- again, we wish
we would've screen shot this--

00:42:59.752 --> 00:43:01.710
if you would have looked
up conversion therapy,

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:03.918
it would've been Exodus
International, the very first

00:43:03.918 --> 00:43:05.334
one, with lists of providers.

00:43:05.334 --> 00:43:07.500
Everything would've been
about these positive spaces

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.180
about how to get connected.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:12.970
And now, it is holy crap,
this is a horrible thing.

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:14.567
It's illegal in two states.

00:43:14.567 --> 00:43:16.900
It's much more difficult for
people to get access to it.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.487
That's kind of the way
that I address this.

00:43:19.487 --> 00:43:21.070
We actually have a
lawyer in the room,

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:22.751
so if I'm not
completely correct,

00:43:22.751 --> 00:43:24.250
we can correct some
of those spaces.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:26.900
But that's a space
that as I see it,

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.340
is that yes, it's directly
addressing mental health

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:33.920
professionals, but it's also by
proxy affecting everyone else

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.820
because it's getting
that reporting spin.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:38.700
Is that correct?

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:39.915
AUDIENCE: It is correct.

00:43:39.915 --> 00:43:40.790
SAMUAL BRINTON: Yeah.

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:43.262
AUDIENCE: You said that in
the beginning, you loved God,

00:43:43.262 --> 00:43:45.220
and you believed in God
and Jesus and all that.

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:48.990
How exactly has your
situation changed?

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:50.440
Has it altered it at all?

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.350
And if so, how did
you get through that?

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:54.340
SAMUAL BRINTON: Great question.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.680
Definitely.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:59.440
My degree is partially
in system dynamics.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.210
This system has been quite
dynamic in my faith journey.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:11.410
Initial therapy, why
does God hate me?

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:15.130
Post therapy, God hates
me, but at least I

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.680
can act like-- I had to
go to church every Sunday

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:22.190
anyway, so I might as
well act like the space.

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:26.570
Second coming out, where
I find that I'm not alone,

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:28.320
and I have been involved
in inter varsity.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.444
I have been involved in
all of these organizations,

00:44:30.444 --> 00:44:33.030
because that was my community
who then again turned

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:35.540
against me, and
that was last straw.

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.740
Like, come on, God.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:39.220
You're not going to
do this twice to me.

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:45.900
I rejected, went to study
abroad in Shanghai, China,

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.930
and found an underground
church and realized

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:52.244
that these people were dying
for the faith that they held.

00:44:52.244 --> 00:44:53.910
If something was that
important, maybe I

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:57.030
should least understand
why I rejected it.

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.500
And then starting to
have the study of whoa,

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.120
this is the concept
of man made religion

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.480
versus personal relationship.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.732
That's how I started
to evolve and move to.

00:45:08.732 --> 00:45:10.190
Ah, I just used
the word "evolved."

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:11.220
That's really funny.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.910
I still don't
understand evolution.

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:17.376
I've been trained for many,
many years on how to refute it.

00:45:17.376 --> 00:45:19.750
I'm an MIT graduate who doesn't
necessarily quite believe

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:21.830
in evolution, which is
really, really confusing.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:22.580
Ah, but I just used
the word "evolved."

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:23.670
Yay.

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:26.090
Moving forward.

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.800
Or backward.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.000
I don't know.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.980
Heathen.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.240
Liberal heathens, anyway.

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.680
The space for that, to
get back to your question,

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.960
is that currently
I live in a space

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:43.480
where I believe that
interpretation, in the past,

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.920
has been damaging
and that relationship

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.990
in the current and
future is enlightening.

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:53.310
I find it as a space where I
can connect, where I can center,

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:56.650
and where I can find a home.

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:59.760
That doesn't mean that I have to
be in a specific denomination.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.520
I was raised Southern
Baptist and I still

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.730
feel the most comfortable
in Baptist churches,

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:08.990
but I can go to a Catholic
mass and sing beautiful music

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:11.310
and realize that that's
OK for me at that time.

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:14.940
I can go to a Unitarian
Universal Church

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:19.960
and see a message that is in
line with what I'm believing

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.580
because it's a
relationship space.

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.510
I know that this conversation
is kind of interesting

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:24.810
because it's about
conversion therapy,

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:25.780
but a lot of
conversation therapy

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:27.655
is centered around these
faith conversations,

00:46:27.655 --> 00:46:30.190
so welcome to Google having
a lot of faith conversation

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:31.390
right now.

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:34.360
But that's an
important space for me.

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:35.960
It's good in my life.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.050
I don't prescribe it
to others because I

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:41.700
don't want to force a
way of thought on others,

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.090
but don't take it away from me.

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:47.000
I think a big part
of the LGBT community

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.570
is so anti-faith because of
what has happened that they're

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:52.430
damaging their own
brothers and sisters

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:55.217
and non-identified individuals.

00:46:55.217 --> 00:46:56.800
I should be able to
practice my faith.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.729
That isn't something you
should be taking away from me.

00:46:59.729 --> 00:47:00.770
You should be supporting.

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:02.160
OK, you found it.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.800
Not for me, but you found it.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.290
That's how I address
it right now.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.610
It's not always easy.

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:11.299
I do personally
love also getting

00:47:11.299 --> 00:47:13.090
into the arguments
about faith, because you

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:14.964
get a lot of battle.

00:47:14.964 --> 00:47:17.380
I'm a missionary kid, so I can
quote a lot of these verses

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:19.040
in the original
Greek and Aramaic.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.080
I can be like, OK, I just
quoted you the verse.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.870
If you can translate that for
me, we can have a conversation.

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:25.560
OK, so we're done.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.580
That's the space that
I'm at, in that you

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:28.650
have to study this issue.

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.399
You have to know what
you're talking about

00:47:30.399 --> 00:47:32.650
rather than just being
told what to believe.

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:35.532
It is a personal moment,
and especially when

00:47:35.532 --> 00:47:37.490
it comes to my sexual
orientation and my gender

00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:40.530
identity, you don't get
to define it for a God

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:44.310
that you haven't talked to
about this specifically.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:45.595
Yep, that's where I'm at.

00:47:45.595 --> 00:47:46.970
AUDIENCE: This is
in no way meant

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:48.553
to be an attack or
anything like that.

00:47:48.553 --> 00:47:50.842
I'm just speaking
towards inclusion.

00:47:50.842 --> 00:47:53.050
I'm just curious, for the
Born Perfect message, which

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:56.900
I think is really bold
and captures this,

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:01.370
but does that really speak
to our trans friends?

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:04.000
SAMUAL BRINTON: A
great question, and one

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.350
that we've been getting
a little bit of.

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:10.540
We are born perfect
and we tell our story.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.510
I'm sorry, we.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:14.710
I sometimes identify in
that space, sometimes not.

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:16.030
So I won't speak as a member.

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:20.160
I will speak trying to
represent that space.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.740
Trans individuals
are born perfect,

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.371
we just aren't
listening to them.

00:48:23.371 --> 00:48:25.620
We're not hearing the stories
that they're telling us,

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:29.000
and we're not hearing that
what we're identifying them as

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.790
and what we're placing
on them is not perfect.

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:36.740
I feel that Born Perfect
captures that sentimentality,

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.230
that internally, we
are born perfect.

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:41.680
We're born the way
we're supposed to be.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.849
We're just not
listened to sometimes.

00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:45.390
Whether that be in
sexual orientation

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:47.940
or whether that be
in gender identity,

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:50.030
the stories aren't
getting heard.

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:52.130
This is a campaign to say no.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:53.250
No longer.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:56.050
Let them be who they are.

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:58.570
That's the way I would
address that question.

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:00.130
Thank you, again,
everyone, so much.

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:02.580
[APPLAUSE]
