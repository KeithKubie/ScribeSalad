00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.224
So, we've seen in this lesson how intelligence, creativity, and problem solving

00:00:04.224 --> 00:00:08.828
are similar yet distinct. Intelligence is our ability to understand complex

00:00:08.828 --> 00:00:12.412
ideas, to think abstractly, to reason, and to remember and successfully use

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:17.690
information to solve problems. Creativity is the capacity to think or in behave

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.148
in both original and adaptive ways. And solving problems can be done

00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:27.258
systematically, step-by-step, or by sudden and unexpected insight. We have to

00:00:27.258 --> 00:00:30.216
shed mental blinders we bring to problems if we are to solve the really

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:36.052
difficult problems we face. Remember to always try to think outside the box. We

00:00:36.052 --> 00:00:38.674
hope that this lesson has helped you better understand the nature of

00:00:38.674 --> 00:00:42.944
intelligence, creativity and problem solving. And better yet, that you will be

00:00:42.944 --> 00:00:47.810
able to solve problems on your own more intelligently and more creatively.
