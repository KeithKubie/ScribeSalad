is teachable now the question of whether

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960
is teachable now the question of whether
 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.080
is teachable now the question of whether
this logic is teachable I think this

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090
this logic is teachable I think this
 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.119
this logic is teachable I think this
logic is even more teachable in the

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129
logic is even more teachable in the
 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.490
logic is even more teachable in the
sense that it doesn't depend on any

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500
sense that it doesn't depend on any
 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.560

have to give you some kind of
psychological tests and say you know

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780
psychological tests and say you know
 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.240

venture it's not about that kind of
 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.760
venture it's not about that kind of
thing but given that you want to start a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770
thing but given that you want to start a
 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.039
thing but given that you want to start a
venture there are lots of things that

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049
venture there are lots of things that
 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.959
venture there are lots of things that
are teachable there are lots of basic

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969
are teachable there are lots of basic
 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.169
are teachable there are lots of basic
techniques like cash flow and you can

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179
techniques like cash flow and you can
 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:16.289
techniques like cash flow and you can
teach but I think I'm very fortunate to

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299
teach but I think I'm very fortunate to
 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.209
teach but I think I'm very fortunate to
have found something that is teachable

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219
have found something that is teachable
 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.029
have found something that is teachable
also at the worldview level so there are

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039
also at the worldview level so there are
 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.249
also at the worldview level so there are
ways to teach people to think

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259
ways to teach people to think
 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.199
ways to teach people to think
differently just like you can teach

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:25.209
differently just like you can teach
 

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:27.389
differently just like you can teach
people to think scientifically it

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399
people to think scientifically it
 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.399
people to think scientifically it
doesn't mean they're you know not going

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409
doesn't mean they're you know not going
 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.340
doesn't mean they're you know not going
to you know refuse to walk under a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350
to you know refuse to walk under a
 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.779
to you know refuse to walk under a
ladder it doesn't mean that they all

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789
ladder it doesn't mean that they all
 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.940
ladder it doesn't mean that they all
become some kind of super rationalist

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950
become some kind of super rationalist
 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.279
become some kind of super rationalist
like Newton but everybody can pause and

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289
like Newton but everybody can pause and
 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:39.449
like Newton but everybody can pause and
think but let me look at that

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:39.459
think but let me look at that
 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:41.459
think but let me look at that
scientifically you know maybe I

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469
scientifically you know maybe I
 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.199
scientifically you know maybe I
shouldn't be superstitious and that's

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.209
shouldn't be superstitious and that's
 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.179
shouldn't be superstitious and that's
teachable I think it's in that sense

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189
teachable I think it's in that sense
 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.339
teachable I think it's in that sense
entrepreneurial thinking or this logic

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:47.349
entrepreneurial thinking or this logic
 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:48.599
entrepreneurial thinking or this logic
of entrepreneurship is very much

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609
of entrepreneurship is very much
 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.819
of entrepreneurship is very much
teachable I can't force people to

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829
teachable I can't force people to
 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.279
teachable I can't force people to
actually get out and do something but if

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289
actually get out and do something but if
 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:54.809
actually get out and do something but if
they want to do something I think there

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819
they want to do something I think there
 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.359
they want to do something I think there
are lots of things that we can teach

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369
are lots of things that we can teach
 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.330
are lots of things that we can teach
them about how to do it better that is

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340
them about how to do it better that is
 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.269
them about how to do it better that is
more likely to lead to novelty it's more

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:03.279
more likely to lead to novelty it's more
 

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:06.510
more likely to lead to novelty it's more
likely to lead to a more satisfying kind

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520
likely to lead to a more satisfying kind
 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.070
likely to lead to a more satisfying kind
of entrepreneurship if you were so the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080
of entrepreneurship if you were so the
 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.320
of entrepreneurship if you were so the
lots of things that are teachable

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330
 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.520
assuming people actually want to learn

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
assuming people actually want to learn

how to start a venture one of the first

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230
how to start a venture one of the first
 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.170
how to start a venture one of the first
things I tell them is started and so

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180
things I tell them is started and so
 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.650
things I tell them is started and so
people look at me like what but the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660
people look at me like what but the
 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.050
people look at me like what but the
thing is I ask them okay so you want to

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060
thing is I ask them okay so you want to
 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.270
thing is I ask them okay so you want to
start a venture what venture do you want

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280
start a venture what venture do you want
 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.160
start a venture what venture do you want
to start and people would say things

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170
to start and people would say things

don't have an idea all right you know I
 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.360
don't have an idea all right you know I
have an idea but I don't have money so I

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370
have an idea but I don't have money so I
 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.210
have an idea but I don't have money so I
try to go through that list and take

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220
try to go through that list and take
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.660
try to go through that list and take
away their reasons for not doing it and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670
away their reasons for not doing it and
 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.940
away their reasons for not doing it and
it's very easy to do that because you

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950
it's very easy to do that because you
 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.320
it's very easy to do that because you
can come up with examples of

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330
can come up with examples of
 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.740
can come up with examples of
entrepreneurs over and over again who

and almost all the time and people think
about here are three things that you

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130
about here are three things that you
 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.309
about here are three things that you
need before you start a venture almost

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319
need before you start a venture almost
