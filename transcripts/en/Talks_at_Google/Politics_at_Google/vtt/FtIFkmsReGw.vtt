JON RAPPING: But I want
to start by thanking

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.270
Kent for supporting this event.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.720
Emanuel and Steve for all you've
done to put this together,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.070
I really am grateful.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.110
And it's such an honor to
be here in Silicon Valley.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.448
I want to kick things off
by showing a quick video.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.988
- Daddy is the sweetest
daddy in the world.

00:00:39.988 --> 00:00:40.488
- Mm-hm.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.785
- Daddy is the most handsome.

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:51.855
The smartest.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.080
The most clever.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.717
The kindest.

00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:12.214
He is my Superman.

00:01:12.214 --> 00:01:14.130

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.790
Daddy wants me to
do well at school.

00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:22.570
Daddy is just great, but--

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.250
he lies.

00:01:32.172 --> 00:01:35.581
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.120
He lies about having a job.

00:01:55.924 --> 00:01:58.260
He lies about having money.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.645
He lies that he is not tired.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.680
He lies that he is not hungry.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.517
He lies that we have everything.

00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:39.942
He lies about his happiness.

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.882
He lies because of me.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.160
JON RAPPING: So that video
moves me every time I watch it.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.640
It moves me because
I'm a father.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.710
It moves me because I
have a little girl that

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.820
means the world to me.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.060
But mostly it moves me
because I've met that man.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.280
And I've met him many times.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.900
I've represented him
in countless cases.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.820
Our prisons and
jails in America are

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.370
filled with men just like him.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.910
Fathers who love their children,
men who are looking for work,

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.620
but can't find it, who will do
any odd job to make ends meet.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.650
But at some point they just
can't find that next odd job,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.290
and then they're
faced with a question.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.960
Do I let my baby girl go hungry,
or do I do something drastic?

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.340
And I think to myself, if I
were faced with that situation,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.580
would I do something drastic?

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.530
Would I maybe steal a sandwich?

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.910
I know for me the answer is yes.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.120
And if that man does
that, and he's caught,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.400
he will be arrested, he will be
processed into a court system,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.320
and he'll be given a label.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.390
In courtrooms
across this country

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.790
he'll be labeled a thief.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.090
And without an advocate,
without a lawyer,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.510
to provide a counter narrative
to show him as a father,

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.260
as a caring person,
as a hard worker,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.600
he will be processed into
a cell with no thought

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.490
about his daughter.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.740
We won't know if perhaps
she drops out of school,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.590
perhaps ends up in an
orphanage, winds up

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.150
in the juvenile justice system.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.170
We won't know because we
won't know the counter story.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.900
What I've learned in
my over 20 years now,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.000
working in the criminal
justice system,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.170
is that if anything defines
criminal justice in America,

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.830
it's that we are indifferent
to most people processed

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.510
through the system every day.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.610
I started my career
in Washington, DC.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.270
I was fortunate to be in a
well-resourced public defender

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.880
office for 10 years.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.820
I had the resources, and
I had manageable caseloads

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.430
to give every client
what they deserved.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.550
I work seven days a week,
but in working that hard

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.720
I could give people
what they deserve.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.450
And I came to think
after 10 years

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.750
that that is generally how
justice worked in America.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.180
And then I moved to
the South to help

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.940
with an effort to build
a new criminal justice

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.530
system in Georgia.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.720
And I started to meet these
young, passionate public

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.620
defenders.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.800
They were every bit as talented
as the lawyers I knew in DC.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.660
But they went into
systems that had

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.840
come to accept an embarrassingly
low standard of justice

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.460
for poor people.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.450
They went into systems that
expected them to go along

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:32.740
with the processing.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.010
And after a while many of
them either quit, or became

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.290
resigned to the status quo.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.110
Perhaps most
emblematic of that was

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.090
when two years after
being in Georgia

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.600
I left to spend a year helping
rebuild the Public Defender

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.317
Office in New Orleans in the
wake of Hurricane Katrina.

00:06:49.317 --> 00:06:51.400
And I remember when I went
to New Orleans I walked

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.107
into a courtroom
for the first time,

00:06:53.107 --> 00:06:54.940
it was the most amazing
thing I'd ever seen.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.430
There were people
everywhere in suits.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.070
There were-- there were
men and women in suits

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.420
scattered across the courtroom.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.202
You didn't know who
the defenders were.

00:07:03.202 --> 00:07:04.660
You didn't know
who the prosecutors

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.859
were because no one was
tethered to a particular table.

00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:09.400
You knew who the
judge was because he

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.780
was on the bench with a robe.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.640
And you knew who
the accused were

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.310
because they were men in
orange jumpsuits lined up

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.810
and shackled.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.420
And the judge started
calling cases,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.230
and the judge would call a name.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.000
And a voice would float
up from the suits.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.220
You didn't know what
suit the voice belong to.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.900
No one in a suit ever stood next
to someone in an orange jumper.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.600
And a voice would float up
and within 10 or 15 seconds

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.330
they'd move on to the next
case, and the processing just

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.410
went on.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.300
Until eventually the
judge called a name

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.220
and there was no voice.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.130
And the judge turned to the
orange jumpsuits and said,

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.330
is Mr. So-and-so here?

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.480
And a man stood up and the
judge said, where's your lawyer?

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.850
And the man said I
haven't seen my lawyer

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.800
since I got locked up.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.440
And the judge said, well, how
long have you been locked up?

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.600
The man said 70 days.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.820
Judge said, thank you
sir, sit down, and went on

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.050
with the processing.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.030
And what shocked me
more than the fact

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.480
that a man was locked up for
70 days without a lawyer,

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.810
was that no one in that
courtroom was fazed.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.600
Not the judge, not
the prosecutors, not

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.540
the defenders who were
charged with being

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.660
the voice of these men.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.930
It was my introduction to
something that really forms

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.730
the basis of Gideon's Promise.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.590
And that is that
the greatest problem

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.130
we have in the criminal justice
system is a cultural problem.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:33.500
We have come to accept the
processing of poor people

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.799
as normal.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.320
This painting, by a
man named Frank Wu,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.659
simply captioned,
"Indifference."

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.809
It's really quite a
moving painting to me.

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:45.970
Its message is so simple.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.980
Right, it's these
robotic legs walking

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.405
past this homeless veteran
curled up in a fetal position.

00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:52.780
And the message
is that all of us

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.750
are bombarded every day
by so much misery, so much

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.470
poverty, so much injustice, that
it just becomes human nature

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.420
to walk by it.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.660
We build up a wall around
us as a defense mechanism,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:10.110
not because we're bad people,
but because it's human nature.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.414
My kids are two of the
biggest homeless advocates

00:09:14.414 --> 00:09:15.080
you'd ever meet.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.970
My son, who is eight,
said to me not long ago.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.840
He said, daddy,
when you grow up,

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.450
I love that, when you grow
up, he thinks I'm young.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.229
He said, when you
grow up, if you

00:09:25.229 --> 00:09:27.770
could be anyone in the world,
who would you be other than me,

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.590
or my sister Ailyah, or mommy?

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.960
I said, well, I don't know,
Lucas, who would you be?

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.750
He said, why either be Antonio
Brown, his favorite football

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.720
player, or a homeless person.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.160
I said, a homeless person why?

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.110
He said, well, because then I
would know what it feels like,

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.440
and I could grow up to
do something about it.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.690
His sister, my daughter
Ailyah who's 12,

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.230
she's been a homeless advocate
since she was a child.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.940
Ever since she was
five or six years old

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.010
she'd break open her
piggy bank in the morning

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.690
and put change in
a baggie to give

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.540
to the homeless man
who is on the off ramp

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.130
on the way to school.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.150
And one day we were
walking down the street

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.729
and a man said to me, sir
can you spare a dollar?

00:10:07.729 --> 00:10:09.520
And I said, I'm sorry
sir I can't help you,

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.478
and we kept on walking.

00:10:10.478 --> 00:10:13.080
And I felt this tug on my
sleeve, and I looked down,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.280
and it was my daughter.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.554
And she said, daddy?

00:10:15.554 --> 00:10:16.470
And I said, yeah baby?

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.510
She said, daddy,
doesn't that man need

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.100
a dollar more than you?

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.770
And I thought to myself,
of course he does.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.690
And I thought to myself,
where did she learn that?

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.340
She learned it from me, and
she learned it from her mother,

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:30.860
Illy.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.600
And she learned these
things from her parents,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.580
but it was a reminder
to me that all

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.450
of us, all of us if we don't
guard against indifference

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.470
can forget the values we
hold dearest, the values we

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.990
teach our own children.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.070
It's a lesson that I understand
not only about my children,

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.630
it's a lesson about life.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.240
It's a lesson about the work
we do in the criminal justice

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.850
system.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.940
The nation was awakened a
little over two and half years

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:05.040
ago to a cruel reality that
equal justice in America

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.080
doesn't really exist.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.860
We were awakened to it when
the news of the shooting death

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:17.520
of Michael Brown in Ferguson,
Missouri took to social media.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.790
And then from there news of
Eric Garner's death, being

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.560
choked to death, in New York.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.670
12-year-old Tamir Rice being
shot in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.250
Sandra bland dying
down in Texas.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.260
Freddie Gray in Baltimore.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:38.030
We've been awakened to the fact
that some communities simply

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.970
aren't seen as human.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:45.090
Some communities are treated
much more brutally in America.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.150
And I think we come to believe
that's a problem about abuse

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.120
of policing.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.010
And it is, but we
have to remember

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.840
that for every person
shot and killed

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.760
by a police officer in America,
tens of thousands are arrested.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.010
They are thrown into a
criminal justice system.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:05.210
They are processed
into cells frequently

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.790
with a heroic public defender,
but a public defender

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.720
who is overwhelmed, beaten
down, and under-resourced.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.120
That routine injustice,
that injustice

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.530
that flies under the radar, that
is crippling poor communities

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.480
across America.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.260
It's that routine injustice
that the public defenders

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.350
deal with every day.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.800
Last September a man
named Keith Lamont Scott

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.020
was shot and killed in
Charlotte, North Carolina.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.690
And I'm sure you all heard about
it because the protests were

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:39.750
broadcast across the nation.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.580
And while those
protests were going

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.760
on a 9-year-old girl,
Zianna Oliphant,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.090
testified before the
Charlotte city council.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:53.040
She talked about how she
knew at the age of nine

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.160
that her community
wasn't respected.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.860
She said we are black
people, and we deserve

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.410
to be treated with rights.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:06.130
It broke my heart to see a
9-year-old girl who understood,

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:11.650
at such a tender age, that
she came from a community that

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:16.260
didn't matter, certainly not
as much as other communities.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.470
It made me think of
Illy's story because when

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.630
Illy and I co-founded
Gideon's Promise,

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.140
I came at it from the
perspective of a lawyer who

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.270
saw lawyers as a
critical vehicle

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.350
to ensuring that
justice is done.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.260
Illy wasn't a lawyer,
she was a schoolteacher.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.560
She got involved in this
work because as a child

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.930
she was like young
Zianna Oliphant.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.480
She had experiences
that made her realize

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.640
her community didn't matter.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.970
At the age of five her
father went to prison

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.000
after being accused
of a crime that he

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.020
had committed years earlier.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.060
Years before he
married her mother,

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.030
years before he opened
up a fish market,

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.060
years before he had three
children with a fourth

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.470
on the way.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.180
He was given a court
appointed lawyer

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.690
that never told his story.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.830
And without his
story being told it

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:10.450
was easy to usher him
into a prison cell.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:13.860
Illy's youngest
sibling, her brother,

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:18.900
himself now has grown up to be
incarcerated despite the fact

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.700
that he went to Cornell.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.120
And she helped raise him
and brought him to college.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.120
She couldn't help him avoid
the criminal justice system,

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.530
and he's locked up now.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:33.870
Every man in her life has been
in the criminal justice system.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:38.430
Children across America, like
Illy, like Zianna Oliphant,

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:43.640
understand that the
injustice isn't just

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.890
flowing from police killings.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:50.080
They learn it through our
criminal justice system.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.020
They learn it when they
see the people they love

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.180
funneled through courtrooms.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:01.302
Every day they watch fathers and
mothers and uncles processed.

00:15:01.302 --> 00:15:03.760
- They learn it when they have
to speak to their loved ones

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.360
through thick glass
on telephones.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.630
They know that their
loved ones are warehoused

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.030
in intolerable conditions.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.520
And if they ever
get out many of them

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.450
won't be able to return to
their homes, or their jobs.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.910
They won't be able to vote,
or get educational loans.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:26.790
Many of them will be
rendered homeless.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:31.670
If they happen to
not be citizens

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.950
they may be pried
from their families

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:39.110
and sent away perhaps never
to see their children again.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.170
The criminal justice
system is wreaking havoc

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:45.320
on our most marginalized
communities.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.140
It is, I would
argue, the greatest

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.050
challenge we face
today as Americans.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.290
In America we have 2.3
million people locked up

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:59.520
in prison, seven million
people under some form

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.660
of control in the criminal
justice system at any given

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.510
time.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.810
People are warehoused
in cells that none of us

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.860
would want to spend a day in.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.550
And yet where's the outrage?

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:19.160
We couldn't do that to people
if we saw them as human beings.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:24.040
In Arizona, up until recently,
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.530
Arpaio was the leading voice
of the criminal justice

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.270
system there.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:30.900
He recently got
voted out of office,

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.470
but he was elected
popularly six times

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.180
on a tough-on-crime platform.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:40.560
He built tent cities in
the sweltering desert heat.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.580
Tent cities to house pretrial
detainees who weren't

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.070
even convicted of crimes.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.320
He forced them to wear
pink underwear because

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:54.050
in his mind that
somehow was an effort

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:58.625
to shred them of every shred
of humanity that they had.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:07.119
And here in California, in
2012, inmates across the state

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:08.119
went on a hunger strike.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:09.778
Some wouldn't eat
for up to 60 days.

00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:11.319
They were literally
saying I'd rather

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:14.109
be dead than housed
in these conditions.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:19.210
We couldn't do that to people
if we saw them as human beings.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.220
Some of you may have
watched the story

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:26.020
on TV of Kalief Browder,
a 16-year-old boy who

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.070
was accused of stealing a
backpack in New York City.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:35.490
He went to Rikers Island, the
detention center in New York,

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.600
and he was given a bond that his
family couldn't afford to pay.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.060
So he stayed there
for three years

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.560
maintaining his innocence.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.050
He spent roughly two and
a half of those years

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.850
in solitary confinement.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:52.230
He endured beatings at the
hands of guards and inmates.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.690
And then after three years
when the state couldn't

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.570
produce the evidence
to bring him to trial,

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.130
his case was dismissed.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.620
But the damage was done.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.860
Kalief Browder went home.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.105
Two years later his mother
found him after he hung himself.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.550
Where were all of
the men and women

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.730
responsible for
overseeing justice

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:23.170
in America while this was
happening to Kalief Browder?

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.510
They couldn't have
stood by if they truly

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.860
saw him as a human being.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:35.770
Mayra Machado was 31 years
old when she was deported back

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:36.800
to El Salvador.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.010
She moved here when
she was five years old.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.890
She didn't know life
anywhere but America.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.770
As a teenager she
made a stupid mistake

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.270
and passed some bad checks.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.040
She spent some time
in a boot camp.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.820
And more than a decade later
she was living her life

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.940
with three children when
she was pulled over.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.370
And based on her
prior conviction

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:03.510
held in a detention
facility for over a year.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.510
Just this year she was
deported back to El Salvador.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.430
Her children lost their mother.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:14.770
We couldn't do that to people
if we saw them as human beings.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:19.560
The damage that was done
to Ms. Machado family

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.920
started when she went into
a criminal justice system.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:29.140
Advocates who understand the
consequences of going through

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.130
the system, who speak
up for individuals,

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.530
who make decisions
that will protect them,

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.230
not only while they're going
through the criminal justice

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:44.080
system, but beyond, are
the key to saving lives,

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.240
like Ms Machado's.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.250
But we simply
don't have the will

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.430
to make sure those
advocates are supported.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.950
There is an African
proverb that says,

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.340
until the lion learns
to write, the story

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.320
will always glorify the hunter.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.800
There are communities across
America who are preyed upon.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.600
Their humanity is
defined by others

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.590
because they're
not given the voice

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.780
to help shape their own stories.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.790
They're not given the voice
because the public defenders,

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.070
who are responsible
for speaking for 80

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.160
percent of the people in
the criminal justice system,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.700
have been beaten
down and overwhelmed.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:36.400
In 1963, this man, Clarence
Earl Gideon, his case

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.610
went to the Supreme Court.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.610
And the Supreme
Court used that case

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:44.560
to say that lawyers are the
vehicle necessary to ensure

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.960
that justice is
done in the courts.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.310
That we can't have
justice without lawyers.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.930
That our system of
laws and procedure

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:58.840
are just too complicated for a
lay person to maneuver alone.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.840
We see Gideon versus
Wainwright narrowly

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.900
as a case about providing
counsel to individuals

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.950
when they're in trouble.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.460
But I would suggest to you that
looking at that case that way

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.870
is too narrow.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.330
We have to understand
Gideon versus Wainwright

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.190
in the context of the times.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.530
It was decided in 1963.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.590
The same year as the
March on Washington.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.880
The same year as many
civil rights milestones.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.490
The same year that as a nation
we were grappling with the fact

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.190
that we were depriving
basic civil and human rights

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.570
to huge populations of
people in all walks of life.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.650
In education, in commerce,
in transportation,

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.050
in voting rights, and
not least among them

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.210
in the criminal justice system.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:48.350
Gideon versus Wainwright
is a civil rights case.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.950
It belongs on that
menu of legislation

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:57.800
in Supreme Court cases that
define our civil rights

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.760
landscape.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.100
And when seen that
way, the lawyers

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.740
who represent people in
the criminal justice system

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.340
are doing our most
important civil rights work.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.500
As I mentioned, more
than 80% of the people

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.570
in the criminal justice
system are poor,

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.210
disproportionately they
are people of color.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.310
The criminal justice
system is rendering

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:18.750
them second class citizens.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:23.360
There is no greater civil
rights crisis facing us.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.270
Five years after that
march on Washington,

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:30.290
the Memphis sanitation
workers took to the streets

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.300
with signs saying, I am man.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.240
A very simple message
recognizing we're

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.940
simply not being
treated as human beings.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.310
Treat us as human beings.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:44.320
And we like to think
that we've overcome that.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.080
But aren't activists
in the streets

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.650
today carrying signs simply
saying, Black Lives Matter.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.660
Aren't they saying
the same thing?

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:56.550
Aren't they saying, we
still aren't truly seen

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.060
as full human beings?

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.740
Hands reach out in our
criminal justice system

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.010
desperately needing help.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:10.210
And the public defender
is the advocate

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.640
responsible for
giving them that help.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.280
But all across the country
our public defenders

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.320
are overwhelmed.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.430
This picture of a public
defender surrounded by files

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:25.210
shows how overwhelmed so
many public defenders are.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:30.570
But keep in mind every one of
those files is a human being.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.330
Every one of those
files is a person

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:37.620
who won't get the care, the
attention, the protection we

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:42.320
would all expect
for our loved ones.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.310
I was thinking about
this when I was watching

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:48.910
a video of a man who
was one of the leaders

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:52.280
of the indigent defense
community in Tennessee.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.160
He was the public
defender who was elected

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.010
by all of the other
Tennessee public defenders

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:57.880
to speak for them.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.310
He was the president
of the Public Defender

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.577
Conference in Tennessee.

00:24:01.577 --> 00:24:03.160
And he was at a
budget hearing, and he

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.240
was asked a very
simple question,

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.200
do you have enough resources?

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.090
He said, well, let me tell
you, I oversee a district

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:13.170
with five counties.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.820
I have five courthouses.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.410
He said, I have five lawyers.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.660
I have one investigator.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:24.750
Last year we closed 4,000 cases,
that's 800 cases per lawyer.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.910
And he went on to say,
so let me assure you

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:31.860
there is one district in
Tennessee that has enough.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.390
We're blessed.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:35.630
I have seen your lawyers.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.740
They're efficient.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.270
They are good at
processing cases.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:47.770
That's the language he used to
describe the work of his staff.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.390
And I think to
myself when I watched

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.910
that video, there's
no doubt in my mind

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:54.940
that man didn't come out of
law school 30 years ago saying,

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.890
you know what I want
to do with my life?

00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:00.520
I think I want to help process
800 people a year into prison

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.870
cells.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:06.360
He was shaped over
time into a lawyer

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:10.140
that he never would have
recognized as a law student.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.560
Not because he's a bad
person, but because he

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.760
is a product of a system
that simply doesn't really

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.000
care about equal justice.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.960
And so that brings me
to Gideon's Promise.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.060
That was the challenge that Illy
and I were thinking about when

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.830
we started this organization.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.200
And it is an
organization designed

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.160
not just to train
lawyers on the law,

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.190
not just to give
them legal skills,

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:40.680
but to build a community
to help them resist

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.280
those pressures to
abandon the values that

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.010
made them want to do this
work in the first place.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.980
It's a community that
gives them strategies

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.880
to resist those pressures
today and to be advocates

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:58.080
to challenge the assumptions
that others in the system

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:02.210
have that lead to the injustice.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:06.290
At the heart of our program
is a three year program

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:09.710
for new lawyers that we
call our Core 101 Program.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:14.600
For three years new lawyers
go through a program

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.140
where they receive training
and mentorship and support.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.390
It starts with a
two week boot camp

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:23.730
where they come together to
learn and to community-build

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.857
and to build support.

00:26:25.857 --> 00:26:27.440
And then they go
back to their offices

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.210
and they're given mentors.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:33.930
And we have an online community,
and they support one another.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.230
But we also recognized, as
our first classes started

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:41.170
to graduate, that if we didn't
continue to support them,

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.520
the cultures they returned
to would soon shape them.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.190
And so we developed
a graduate program.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.460
And the graduate
program was designed

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:55.140
to groom them into the
trainers and the mentors

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.020
that the younger lawyers
desperately needed.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:00.570
We develop the
leadership program,

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.730
so we could bring the
heads of their offices,

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.640
the chief defenders,
together every six months

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.980
to think about how to
support these lawyers.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.740
We developed a trainer
development program,

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.410
so we could get
trainers and supervisors

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:18.210
to learn the curriculum and
support what we were teaching

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:19.680
back in the office.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.630
And we developed a
law clerk program,

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.180
so we could bring the
brightest law students

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.510
from around the country
to Mississippi and Georgia

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:31.200
and Alabama and Tennessee to
support these young lawyers.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.300
But all of those
programs weren't only

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.760
designed to support
these young lawyers who

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.190
were the future of
criminal justice reform.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:44.430
They were also designed to
transform the existing system.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.900
The graduate program also
has an external component

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.560
where we're grooming
those graduates

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.800
into tomorrow's leaders.

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:56.140
The Law Clerk
Program, not only are

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.680
they coming to support our
lawyers during the summer,

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.780
but they're starting to
build avenues, channels,

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.079
so they can come to
the public defender

00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:06.370
offices with the greatest need.

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:10.250
They can become part of this
movement that we're building.

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.790
The leaders aren't
only learning how

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.340
to support their
lawyers in the office

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.260
and change the
culture in the office,

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.880
but they're learning
how to advocate

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.590
for reform in the
communities where they work.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.380
And in our training
development program,

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:26.170
we're not just teaching
trainers to support our lawyers

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:27.940
in our program, but
they're learning

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.760
how to export this model
and to take it back

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.850
to systems across the country.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:38.730
When you look at all of
the offices we've touched,

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:43.160
we have literally had a hand in
helping shape indigent defense

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:48.302
in 27 states across America.

00:28:48.302 --> 00:28:50.850
There is no question
with the human resources

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.430
we are developing
through our programming,

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.380
that we could scale this model.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.495
We have scaled this model
from two states to 27.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:04.810
The only limit to how far
we can go is resources.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.540
But it's also
important to understand

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.450
that not only are we trying
to scale, not only are we

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:12.150
trying to grow our
reach, it is critical

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.770
that we also focus on depth.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:18.550
Because to change culture
you can't just touch a lawyer

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.470
and send them back to a state.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.055
You've got to hold on to them.

00:29:22.055 --> 00:29:22.930
You can't touch them.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:24.490
You have to embrace them.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.230
You have to wrap your
arms around them.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:30.600
You have to support them,
as they develop into leaders

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.760
that you desperately need.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.550
So not only have we touched
offices across 27 states,

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.970
we actually have partnerships
where we have sustained

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:43.290
relationships with over 40
county-level offices across 16

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:44.400
states.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.570
We have a state-wide
partnership in Maryland.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.050
We have literally worked
with every public defender

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.450
in the state of Maryland.

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:53.100
And we're in the process of
forging statewide partnerships

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.460
in Virginia and in Michigan.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:03.270
The impact has been tremendous.

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.570
And we know that the
impact has been tremendous

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.500
from several sources.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.170
We know the impact
has been tremendous

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:11.340
from our own
lawyers' experiences.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.790
For example, there's a
young woman in Georgia,

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.600
named Janelle.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.610
Janelle was one of
our earliest lawyers

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.470
in one of our earliest classes.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.620
And she came to Georgia
because, as she says,

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.810
I wanted to represent
people that looked like me.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:29.800
Janelle grew up in
Brooklyn, New York

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.450
in an African-American
community.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:37.480
She went to Spelman College and
Howard Law School, both HBCUs.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.120
She became a public
defender because she wanted

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.877
to represent people of color.

00:30:42.877 --> 00:30:44.335
And she joined our
program, and she

00:30:44.335 --> 00:30:47.140
happened to be getting placed
in Bartow County Georgia, which

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.180
is about 45 minutes
outside of Atlanta,

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.760
but it may as well
be hours away.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.340
Almost all of her
clients were white.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.237
She was the only
African-American woman attorney

00:30:58.237 --> 00:30:58.820
in the county.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.520
She talks about how she would
walk into the courtroom,

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.490
with her briefcase and
her suit, and how long

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.460
it took before the
bailiff stopped asking her

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.200
where her lawyer was.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.400
And one day Janelle
called me up because she

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.160
was trying to grapple
with a particular problem.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.450
She had a juvenile client who
was going to be sentenced.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:21.950
And she had a
statute, and she was

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.800
convinced that this statute made
clear that the judge couldn't

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.240
detain this young man.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.000
But she said she'd been
talking to senior lawyers

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.120
in the county, and they said
that that argument would never

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.570
work.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:35.760
They said don't
even bring it up.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.532
The judge will laugh at you.

00:31:37.532 --> 00:31:39.240
And she called to say,
what do you think?

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.550
And she talked to me, and
several other of our mentors,

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.440
and we all came to
the same conclusion.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.450
Of course you have
to bring it up.

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:47.880
The statute is clear,
and she steeled herself.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.460
And she walked into the
courtroom, and she stood up,

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.700
and she made the argument.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.350
As she made the argument,
she heard snickers

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:59.550
in the background from some
of the more seasoned lawyers.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:03.640
And then the judge
granted her motion.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.640
And the snickering stopped.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:12.670
But not only did Janelle
disrupt a system of injustice

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:16.120
when she did that,
she began transforming

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.410
that system of justice.

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:19.240
You see, some of
those lawyers who

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.220
were laughing in the audience
now file that very motion.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.830
How else do we know
we have impact?

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:29.400
We recently worked with an
organization called Measures

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:34.650
for Justice, under a grant
from the Department of Justice

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.970
to look at the outcomes
that our lawyers receive.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:42.330
And the initial findings
seem quite positive.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:46.530
Measures for Justice looked at
three of our partner offices

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.950
in Tennessee, Memphis;
Knoxville; and Nashville.

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:58.690
And compared it to a test
office in Chattanooga.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:03.120
And what the preliminary finding
suggests is that our lawyers--

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.520
their clients are more likely
to get pretrial diversion.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.790
They are less likely
to plead guilty.

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.920
They've closed
more cases quickly,

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.030
meaning people weren't
languishing in jail.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:18.600
That their clients are
incarcerated less often.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.440
Those outputs matter.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:26.690
We also know because the leaders
who partner with us tell us so.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.170
As a matter of fact, I get
these emails all the time.

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:30.840
Illy gets these
e-mails all the time.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.850
Just last week, I
share this one with you

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:34.720
because it's literally
the most recent.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.450
I got an email from
Fielding Pringle,

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:40.080
she's the chief public defender
in Columbia, South Carolina.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:44.120
They joined our partnership
about three years ago.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.950
She wrote to tell me
that, before they joined

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:51.770
Gideon's Promise, they would
lose somewhere between five

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:53.810
to nine lawyers a
year in an office

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:56.810
that only had 25 to 30 lawyers.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:00.170
But she said, since we joined
Gideon's Promise, in 2014 we

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:01.820
lost two lawyers.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.280
In 2015 we only
lost two lawyers.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:09.520
In 2016 only one
lawyer left our office.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.030
And she went on to say,
"The impact of retention

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:14.280
on the quality of
representation,

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.489
continuity of
representation, morale,

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:21.090
organizational structure,
and overall smooth-running

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:25.449
of my office has improved
dramatically as a result.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:30.010
I attribute this change to
better hiring practices,

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:34.110
but also, and largely, to the
culture shift that the Gideon's

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.659
Promise attorneys have
brought to our office

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:38.400
and our community."

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.280
She said, "They are different
kind of public defender,

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.889
and they infuse the
attorneys around them

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:47.830
with their spirit, their
confidence, their commitment,

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:50.520
their excitement,
and their drive.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.767
They are a changing force."

00:34:53.767 --> 00:34:55.935
This matters.

00:34:55.935 --> 00:34:57.310
And so this picture,
and then I'm

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:58.851
going to wrap up
with the last story,

00:34:58.851 --> 00:35:01.450
this picture is
a picture of some

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:03.520
of our lawyers at
our last gathering.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.940
We get together every six months
and bring all of our lawyers

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.020
together.

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.650
And a couple of years ago, as
the lawyers leave each other,

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:15.607
some go back to pretty remote
places with little support.

00:35:15.607 --> 00:35:17.440
And a couple of years
ago one of the lawyers

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.390
suggested we should end our
meetings with a group hug.

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:23.790
And he stood up, and
he got in the middle,

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.500
and he encouraged
everyone to come in.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.315
And he brought in one lawyer
who was feeling particularly

00:35:28.315 --> 00:35:30.690
lonely, and brought her in
the middle, and he hugged her.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:31.981
And everyone hugged around her.

00:35:31.981 --> 00:35:34.290
And it became a tradition
because, what these lawyers

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:36.840
really understand, is
the love and support

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.030
they feel when
they get together,

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.950
that has to be sustained.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:44.100
They have to feel that when they
go back to their jurisdictions.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.830
They have to feel that when
they're at their lowest moment

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.050
because this battle
is too important

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:52.475
and their work is too important.

00:35:52.475 --> 00:35:56.690
If they are to stand next to
clients and give them voice,

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.870
if they are to infuse
the system with humanity,

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:04.230
they know they
can't do it alone.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:06.820
And so this is my final story
and then I'm going to wrap up.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:13.580
Every year Illy I
get phone calls.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:16.070
All of our mentors
get phone calls.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:19.110
Because we have young lawyers
that come down to Oxford,

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.730
Mississippi and they spend two
weeks in the initial two week

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:24.920
program, and they get fired up.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.650
And they think they
can change the world,

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:29.150
and they feel like they've got
all the support in the world.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:32.780
And they go back
to their offices.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.610
And then they start
to feel defeated.

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:37.160
And within a couple of weeks
the phone starts ringing.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.320
And the calls go something
like this, they'll call

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.800
and they'll say, hey Rap,
everyone calls me Rap.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.310
Hey Rap, I think I need to quit.

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:47.080
I feel defeated.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.520
I've got 300 cases.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.350
I now know would
every client deserves,

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:53.080
but I just simply
can't give it to them.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:56.760
And I share with them
a story from a book

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.070
I read called "Freedom
Summer," written by a man named

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:04.020
Bruce Watson, where he tells
the story of that amazing summer

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.660
project in 1964.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.880
Where young people, college
students from around

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.780
the country, came to Mississippi
to register people to vote,

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.670
to build freedom
schools, to help people

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.050
pass literacy tests.

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.830
And Bruce Watson tells
his story through the eyes

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:22.290
of people who were there,
now after interviewing them

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:23.940
40 years later.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:28.267
And you learn through this
book that these young folks,

00:37:28.267 --> 00:37:29.850
they went down to
Mississippi thinking

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.058
they could change the world,
and one after the other,

00:37:32.058 --> 00:37:34.920
they started to find doors
being slammed in their faces.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.170
They started to have
people tell them,

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.990
I can't be seen talking to you,
my life could be in danger.

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:43.220
They started to get discouraged.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.100
As the summer went on
they said things like,

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.530
maybe this was a
mistake, maybe my family

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:51.415
was right, maybe
none of this matters.

00:37:51.415 --> 00:37:54.820
And Bruce Watson fast forwards
40 years to a conversation

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.040
with Congressman
John Lewis, who was

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.410
one of the architects
of Freedom Summer.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:01.810
And Congressman
Lewis says, you know,

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:03.880
if it weren't for
Freedom Summer,

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.700
Barack Obama wouldn't
be in the White House.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.310
Quite literally, he was
saying that sometimes change

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:13.760
is so incremental, that
those most involved in it

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.690
don't even recognize
they're doing it.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:18.550
And we share that
story with our lawyers.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:21.680
And we say to our lawyers,
when you walk into a courtroom,

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.220
and you see a judge
who simply wants

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.000
you to sit down and shut up.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.320
Who simply wants you to go
along with the processing.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:34.620
And you stand up and you say,
Judge, I'm not doing it today.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.930
When you refuse
to participate you

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:41.850
may not get the tangible result
that your client wants, or even

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:43.410
deserves.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:46.410
But when you do that,
and your colleagues are

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.560
doing that in a
courtroom next door,

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.850
and another group are doing
it in the next county over,

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:56.070
and another group in
the next state over,

00:38:56.070 --> 00:39:00.180
collectively you are
raising expectations

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:04.460
about what justice should
look like for poor people.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.390
Collectively.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:08.460
You're not just disrupting.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:12.510
You are transforming criminal
justice collectively.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:16.950
You are changing and challenging
the assumptions of the people

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:21.400
who make decisions about
those most impacted

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.020
by our criminal justice system.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.140
So I will end by
saying, my guess is

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:31.460
many of you heard my
friend Brian Stevenson give

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.530
a talk here.

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:35.840
And one thing Brian talks
about his proximity.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.110
And I want to just
emphasize that proximity

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.870
is more than just
getting spatially

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:43.490
close to another person.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:46.520
Our courtrooms are filled
with judges and prosecutors

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:51.470
and probation officers who
are spatially close to people

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:54.200
they are processing in
the cells for intolerable

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.190
amounts of time.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:57.710
Proximity is more than
just standing near someone,

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.210
it's getting to know someone.

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:01.490
It's getting to
understand who they are.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:05.060
It's getting to understand
what they want out of life.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:08.590
It's learning the skills
to tell their story.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:10.880
It is making other
people, not just

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.830
get near those impacted
by their decisions,

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:18.340
but truly understand those
impacted by their decisions.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.520
In our criminal justice
system we quite literally

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.980
can't do that without
public defenders.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:29.060
They are the vehicle that
forces us to get proximate

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:35.770
to people whose lives are
otherwise being thrown away.

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:39.500
And so I want to end by saying,
thank you so much for having me

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:43.390
and Illy here in Silicon Valley.

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:45.790
It's an honor to be here
because you all really are

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:50.770
dealing with some of the world's
most intractable problems.

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.420
You have some of the
most creative minds.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:57.310
You're coming up with some of
the most amazing solutions.

00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:01.170
Technology can solve a lot
of problems, as Steve said.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.420
But it's critical
that we remember,

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.990
as we think about how to use
technology to solve problems,

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:10.200
we don't lose sight of
the humanity of the people

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.460
impacted.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.520
And it takes boots
on the ground married

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:18.270
with the brilliance
of places like Google

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:21.430
to make sure equal
justice is a reality.

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:22.200
Thank you.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.550
