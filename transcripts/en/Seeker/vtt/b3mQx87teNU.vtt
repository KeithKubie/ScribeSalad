00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.740
SpaceX just had its first commercial launch
with its Falcon Heavy and landed all three

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.759
of its reusable rockets.

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.800
But there’s no rest for SpaceX, it's now
launching another mission, sending up numerous

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.840
science experiments including one by high
school students aiming to study DNA repair

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.840
in microgravity.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.200
They’re also sending up tissue chips, a
science fiction sounding technology which

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.210
you may remember from our conversation with
expert Dr. Liz Warren, who spoke about this

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.480
during our Cal Academy night.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.610
SpaceX CRS17 will be utilizing it’s reusable
Falcon 9 rocket, which can both deliver cargo

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.510
and land safely back down on Earth.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.840
But landing them isn’t easy.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.890
It’s a meticulous step-by-step process.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.250
The booster is essentially a large autonomous
robot, whose onboard internal computers successfully

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.620
land the rocket.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.591
The booster can either land on the ground
or at sea, on the company’s droneship, Of

00:00:51.591 --> 00:00:53.140
Course I Still Love You,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.101
an interesting name for a boat, but also a
nod to a famous science fiction novel, The

00:00:57.101 --> 00:00:58.290
Player of Games.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.800
Now, they make it look easy,
10.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.750
but it took many, many failures before SpaceX
managed to successfully land its first rocket

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.720
back in December 2015.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.340
Since then, SpaceX has made multiple successful
landings.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.880
I bet you want to know how it works.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.790
Well, after the rocket reaches an altitude
of roughly 80km,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.000
the first and second stage separate, the latter
continuing on its way to deliver the payload.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.520
In order to reorient itself, the first stage
turns on its cold engine thrusters in preparation

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.009
for its re-entry burn.

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.520
Following this, its 3 engines propel the booster
towards the landing site, allowing for a controlled

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.520
descent.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.060
Small, heat-resistant wings called grid fins
are deployed to help guide the rocket as it

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.799
continues its descent.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.119
From here the engine's landing burn begins,
slowing it down.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.549
And finally, the booster's landing legs unfold
for a successful touchdown.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.610
Yes, these landings are one of the reasons
that SpaceX launches are so exciting to watch.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.610
But we can’t forget about all the innovative
science payloads delivered to the ISS U.S.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.610
National Laboratory.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.540
What’s great about the ISS is that at its
heart, it’s an international collaboration

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.739
of science where anyone can submit an experiment,

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.750
like these students from Minnesota who won
the 2018 Genes in Space contest, where students

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.750
from grades 7-12 compete to have their proposed
DNA experiment conducted on the ISS.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.269
Last year’s winning team was David Li, Michelle
Sung, Aarthi Vijayakumar, and Rebecca Li.

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.450
We got in touch with Aarthi to walk us through
their project.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.790
So our proposal was based off our interest
in the increased risk of cancer

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.299
that astronauts face in space because of the
space radiation

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.699
that can damage their DNA

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.180
even when they're on the International Space
Station.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.129
So the team worked to find a way to study
how cells repair their DNA in microgravity

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.689
and submitted their proposal for the contest.

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.840
So what we're doing is we have yeast cells
that we will use CRISPR Cas9 to induce a break

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.499
in to simulate that space radiation and then
we’ll allow the cells some time to repair

00:02:58.499 --> 00:02:59.499
themselves.

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:03.849
And then we amplify their DNA on the mini
PCR

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:09.589
And based on the resulting sequence we can
see if they repaired their DNA correctly or

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:10.589
not.

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:11.589
[00:15:09][20.9]

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:15.079
So basically, they’ll be creating duplicates
of the repaired DNA using a miniPCR.

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.579
As for analyzing the data,
they’ll be using the minION sequencer which

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.719
provides real-time analysis by taking the
DNA strands and using an electric current

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.180
to determine the order of the bases within
each DNA strand.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.930
The students will then take this information
and determine whether the DNA sequence was

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.309
changed due to damage and if the cells were
then able to repair the DNA correctly.

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:40.569
After becoming finalists, the team spent months
working with mentors from MIT to build their

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.260
proof of concept for the final judging panel.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.329
That meant bringing their proposal to life,
by replicating the realistic timeframe that

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.570
the astronauts would have onboard the ISS
as well as using readily available materials.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.349
Until the conference, we had just not necessarily
been restricted that way.

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.169
And we didn't have to think about how much
of this chemical can you take on the ISS?

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.419
Can you control the heat conditions for these
cells?

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.249
Things like that so that was a really good
experience for us.

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:12.809
The results will hopefully provide more insight
into whether or not astronaut DNA repairs

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:15.430
itself the same way in space as it does on
Earth.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.430
Their project is also making history as the
first time a student-designed DNA sequencing

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.430
project will be tested on the ISS.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.569
But until you know Until we got chosen to
send it up, it became a little bit more real.

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.720
And now it's you know it's tangible, it's
in the near future and we're really going

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.759
to see it launch and it feels really good.

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.780
That's something that we could come up with
and work with so many cool people can

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.530
actually benefit astronauts and benefit other
people in the future.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.550
But it’s not just about astronaut DNA.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.940
There are also four experiments being sent
to the ISS U.S. National Laboratory by NCATS

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.060
&amp; the National Institutes of Health that aim
to gain a better understanding of how the

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.879
human body and organs function, with the ultimate
goal of improving human health on Earth.

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.810
Tissue chips, also known as organs-on-chips,
are small devices that contain human cells

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.300
grown on an artificial scaffold to model the
structure and function of human tissues and

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.300
organs.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.870
These tissue chip models provide an efficient
way to study the mechanisms behind disease

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.410
and test potential new treatments.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.919
One tissue chip study is investigating how
microgravity and other factors affect kidney

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.539
function, since kidney problems occur more
frequently in astronauts.

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.810
Another study is using tissue chips to model
the lungs and bone marrow to analyze how the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.949
immune system responds to infection in microgravity.

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:32.139
A third study is examining the impact of spaceflight
on musculoskeletal disease biology using a

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.930
tissue chip joint model with cartilage and
bone tissues.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.789
The last tissue chip study is focused on the
blood-brain barrier and aims to shed light

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:44.860
on the mechanisms behind neurological disorders
like Alzheimer’s.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.230
While those are the experiments focusing on
human health, others like NASA JPL’s Orbiting

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.789
Carbon Observatory 3 will concentrate on tracking
the distribution of carbon dioxide on Earth

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.210
by collecting measurements on specific types
of atmospheric CO2.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.220
This will give scientists more insight into
carbon sources and storage sinks, which could

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.440
help in predicting the impact of growing atmospheric
heat retention as well as controlling its

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.749
variability.

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:15.139
The OCO3 will be robotically installed on
the Japanese Experiment Module-Exposed Facility.

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.789
Whether they be small or large, all these
investigations help to highlight the incredible

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:24.979
partnerships ongoing in space to keep pushing
the boundaries of what we know of life in

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:26.189
microgravity.

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:29.360

up, so if there’s a specific one you’d
