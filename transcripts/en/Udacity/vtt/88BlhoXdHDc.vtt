00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.370
The answer is we will store a function object in that sagas array.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.870
From the f to the end curly brace is the definition of a function object, and

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.340
that is the value that we're pushing into the sagas array.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.320
A lexical scope is actually just characters of code that you defined in

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.560
a file somewhere.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.420
And that's not actually a value that can be stored anywhere in a variable or

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.770
as an element of an array.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.900
An execution context is one of these boxes that we

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.230
see pictured here wherein we find stored key value pairs.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.650
And fundamentally this is not something you can even have a reference to.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.190
And similarly it can't be stored in an array.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.790
There is no anonymous function being called here.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.150
The closest thing is this function object.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.500
But since there are no parens appearing after it,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.550
we will not be invoking an anonymous function.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.720
And, therefore, we won't be getting the result of an anonymous function.
