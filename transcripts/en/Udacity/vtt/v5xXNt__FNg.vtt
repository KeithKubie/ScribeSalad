00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
One further thin that I want to talk about is

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
do we disable assertions in production code?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
For example, when we run the Python interpreter with the "-O" option,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which causes Python to enable some optimizations,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
it disables assertions in order to make our code run faster.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The question we're asking here is is that a good thing?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It turns out that there are arguments we can make in both directions.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's first look at reasons why we might want to disable assertions.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
One of the main advantages of disabling assertions

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
would be that it let's our code run faster.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Another advantage--and here we're starting to get into something,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which really depends on what we're trying to do with our system--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is that code running without assertions is less likely to stop running.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The code keeps going even after some sort of condition is found within the code

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that would have triggered an assertion violation

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
if assertions had been enabled.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Here we really have to ask ourselves the question

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
what is it that we're trying to do with our system?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Is it better to keep going or is it better to stop?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Remember that keeping going after some condition is true

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that will lead to an assertion violation may lead to a completely erroneous execution.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
On the other hand, possibly, that's better than actually stopping.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now let's move to disadvantages of disabling assertions in production code.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
If our code happens to rely on some side effect performed by an assertion--

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that is to say, if whoever wrote the code that we're using has violated

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
one of the rules for assertions that I gave you--

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
then turning off assertions is going to break the code.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Not only is it going to break the code, but it's going to break the code

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
in an extremely confusing way, because lacking assertions,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we're going to have a very hard time detecting the error

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
except that it's probably going to cause our system to crash in some confusing way

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
or just to do completely the wrong thing.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This is a real risk of turning off assertions in large systems.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The second reason is even in production code

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
it may be better to fail early rather than keep going.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Really, it just depends on what our system is doing.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The question is do our users want the system to die

00:01:49.000 --> 99:59:59.999
or do they want the system to give them some completely wrong result?
