00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.579
We operate with some stock images of the addict:
a person with a heroin needle in a park, or

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:10.950
who nurses a bottle of gin in a paper bag
at nine in the morning or who sneaks off at

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.680
every opportunity to light up another cylinder
of marijuana. However dramatic and tragic

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.600
such cases of addiction might be, they are
simultaneously hugely reassuring to most of

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.210
us – because they locate the addict far
from ordinary experience, somewhere off-stage,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.130
in the land of semi-criminality and outright
breakdown. Such examples are dangerously flattering,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.870
categorising addiction in a sentimental way
that lets most of us off the hook – and

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.640
at the same time, cuts us off from identification
with, and therefore sympathy for, the most

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.230
wretched victims of addiction. There are,
in truth, far more addicts than we think.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.220
Indeed, if we look at the matter squarely:
we are pretty much all addicts. The official

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.640
statistics on the consumption of hard drugs
or alcohol don’t begin to give a fair representation

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.939
of the issue. We need to define addiction
in a new way: addiction is the manic reliance

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.689
on something, anything, in order to keep our
dark or unsettling thoughts at bay. What properly

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.119
indicates addiction is not what someone is
addicted to, for we can get addicted to pretty

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.579
much anything. It is the motives behind their
reliance on it – and, in particular, their

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.100
desire to avoid encountering the contents
of their own mind. Being inside our own minds

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.570
is, for most of us, and very understandably,
a deeply anxiety-inducing prospect. We are

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.100
filled with thoughts we don’t want properly
to entertain and feelings we are desperate

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.500
not to feel. There is an infinite amount we
are angry and sad about that it would take

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.499
an uncommon degree of courage to face. We
experience a host of fantasies and desires

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:04.319
that we have a huge incentive to disavow,
because of the extent to which they violate

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:10.360
our self-image and our more normative commitments.
We shouldn’t pride ourselves because we

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.620
aren’t injecting something into our veins.
Almost certainly, we are doing something with

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.860
equal commitment. We are checking the news
at four minute intervals, to keep the news

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.810
from ourselves at bay. We’re doing sport,
exhausting our bodies in the hope of not having

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.580
to hear from our minds. We’re using work
to get away from the true internal work we’re

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.010
shirking. The most compelling addictions sound
very righteous to the world. To get a measure

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.950
of our levels of addiction, we need only consider
when the last time might have been that we

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.770
were able to sit alone in a room with our
own thoughts, without distraction, free associating,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.480
daring to wander into the past and the future,
allowing ourselves to feel pain, desire, regret

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.110
and excitement. We may start to see how much
we have in common with the traditional addict.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.260
When we come face to face with them, we’re
not meeting anything especially foreign, just

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.520
a part of ourselves in a less respectable
form – opening up new opportunities for

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.310
kindness, towards them, and us. We could start
to think, too, of how we might wean ourselves

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.730
off our chosen addictive pursuit. We need
to lose our fear of our minds. We need a collective

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.110
sense of safety around confronting loss, humiliation,
sexual desire and sadness – knowing that

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.190
we will have to keep running so long as we
do not rehabilitate our feelings. On the other

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:46.750
side of addiction is, in a sense, philosophy
– understood as the patient, unfrightened,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.200
compassionate examination of the contents
of our own minds.
