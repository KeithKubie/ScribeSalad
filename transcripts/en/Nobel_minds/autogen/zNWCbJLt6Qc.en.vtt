transactions in a very simple way

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480
transactions in a very simple way
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.990
transactions in a very simple way
there's a settler who's producing

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000
there's a settler who's producing
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.420
there's a settler who's producing
something and he sells it and there is a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430
something and he sells it and there is a
 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.250
something and he sells it and there is a
buyer who pays a price and consumes this

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
buyer who pays a price and consumes this
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.709
buyer who pays a price and consumes this
good and that's it that's the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719
good and that's it that's the
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.090
good and that's it that's the
transaction but of course you know that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
transaction but of course you know that
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.810

in reality many transactions are much

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.479
in reality many transactions are much
more complicated and they are supported

more complicated and they are supported
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.720
more complicated and they are supported
by more or less complicated contracts

by more or less complicated contracts
 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.420
by more or less complicated contracts
for example employment contracts are

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430
for example employment contracts are
 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.469
for example employment contracts are
typically quite complicated or and final

the coal mine about which the contract
is silent and because the contract is

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:25.149
is silent and because the contract is
 

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:25.919
is silent and because the contract is

there will be a lot of things it's
 

00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:30.929
there will be a lot of things it's
silent about so in this case the key

00:08:30.929 --> 00:08:30.939
silent about so in this case the key

to mine so the point is that because the
 

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.850
to mine so the point is that because the
coal mine is a separate entity the owner

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:41.860
coal mine is a separate entity the owner
 

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.670

mine the high ash content coal or the
low ash content call and the power plant

00:08:51.929 --> 00:08:51.939
low ash content call and the power plant
 

00:08:51.939 --> 00:08:56.519
low ash content call and the power plant
will have to pay the owner to do

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:56.529
will have to pay the owner to do
 

00:08:56.529 --> 00:08:59.360
will have to pay the owner to do
something other than what the the owner

something other than what the the owner
 

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.600
something other than what the the owner
naturally wants okay so is there

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:03.610
naturally wants okay so is there
 

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.389
naturally wants okay so is there
anything the power plant can do to avoid

how does it get the investor to agree to

has to be provide some sort of assurance
that the investor is going to get a

that the investor is going to get a
 

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.190
that the investor is going to get a
return and one way can do that is by

00:14:59.190 --> 00:14:59.200
return and one way can do that is by
 

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.230

this may not be enough the problem is

this may not be enough the problem is
 

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:15.690
this may not be enough the problem is
that the contract between the skipper no

the coal mine that's modernizing the
investor could become the owner of the

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:32.420
investor could become the owner of the
 

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.329
investor could become the owner of the
coal mine rather than having an

00:16:34.329 --> 00:16:34.339
coal mine rather than having an
 

00:16:34.339 --> 00:16:37.360

arm's-length contract with the coal mine
 

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.620
arm's-length contract with the coal mine
and this would allow the investor to

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:40.630
and this would allow the investor to
 

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.509
and this would allow the investor to

the contract to be a debt contract

the contract to be a debt contract
and what that means in particular here

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:04.350
and what that means in particular here
 

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.550
and what that means in particular here
is that the coal mine promises to make a

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:07.560
is that the coal mine promises to make a
 

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.190
is that the coal mine promises to make a
fixed stream of payments to the investor

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200
fixed stream of payments to the investor
 

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.580
fixed stream of payments to the investor
as long as these payments are made the

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:13.590
as long as these payments are made the
 

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.500
as long as these payments are made the
manager of the coal mine remains in

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:15.510
manager of the coal mine remains in
 

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.500
manager of the coal mine remains in
charge so the manager retains control as

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:18.510
charge so the manager retains control as
 

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:23.500
charge so the manager retains control as
long as she's making the payments I

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:23.510
long as she's making the payments I
 

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.670
long as she's making the payments I
think it's a he actually I think the

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:25.680
think it's a he actually I think the
 

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.110
think it's a he actually I think the

she Oh was go confused about that but

she Oh was go confused about that but
anyway if if a payment is not made

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:32.450
anyway if if a payment is not made
 

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.910
anyway if if a payment is not made
control shifts to the investor and the

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:34.920
control shifts to the investor and the
 

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.370
control shifts to the investor and the
investor can then decide whether to

investor can then decide whether to
 

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.890
investor can then decide whether to
replace the manager or sell the mine or

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:39.900
replace the manager or sell the mine or
 

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.670
replace the manager or sell the mine or
do various other things okay so this

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:42.680
do various other things okay so this
 

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.470
do various other things okay so this
what's good about this is that remember

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480
what's good about this is that remember
 

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.120
what's good about this is that remember
the problems that I talked about the

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:47.130
the problems that I talked about the
 

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.310
the problems that I talked about the
managers or Purdue opportunism was

managers or Purdue opportunism was
 

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.760
managers or Purdue opportunism was
paying in self a very high salary or

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:54.900
reinvesting earnings well you know he's
 

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.630
reinvesting earnings well you know he's
got a sort of tight budget constraint if

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640
got a sort of tight budget constraint if
 

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.020
got a sort of tight budget constraint if

he's going to lose control so that's
 

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.960
he's going to lose control so that's
going to give him an incentive to behave

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:05.970
going to give him an incentive to behave
 

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:09.650

less opportunistically debt contracts

the coal mine to borrow quite a lot in
 

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.300
the coal mine to borrow quite a lot in
contrast and this is similar to the

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:08.310
contrast and this is similar to the
 

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.490
contrast and this is similar to the
point I made earlier if the managers

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500
point I made earlier if the managers
 

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.980
point I made earlier if the managers
human capital is terribly important then

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:12.990
human capital is terribly important then
 

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.340
human capital is terribly important then
of course the investor no

if a debt payment isn't made but what

if a debt payment isn't made but what
 

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.159
if a debt payment isn't made but what
use is that to me because it's the

00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:24.169
use is that to me because it's the
 

00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:26.500

that is essential so in that case the

that is essential so in that case the
 

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.240
that is essential so in that case the
investor will be more reluctant to lend

investor will be more reluctant to lend
 

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.730

so the coalmine won't be able to borrow

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:33.740
so the coalmine won't be able to borrow
 

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:38.289
so the coalmine won't be able to borrow
so much the analysis can also tell us

so much the analysis can also tell us
about the maturity of debt contracts so

of the prisoners and this is like the

one way of doing it the other way of
 

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:18.710
one way of doing it the other way of
doing it is that the government can own

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720
doing it is that the government can own
 

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.110
doing it is that the government can own
and control the prison and then the

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120
and control the prison and then the
 

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.330
and control the prison and then the
people who work in the prison the warden

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340
people who work in the prison the warden
 

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.640
people who work in the prison the warden
and the guards and so on will be

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:25.650
and the guards and so on will be
 

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:27.320
and the guards and so on will be
government employees that's like the

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:27.330
government employees that's like the
 

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:31.610
government employees that's like the
power plant buying the coal mine so

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620
power plant buying the coal mine so
 

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.360
power plant buying the coal mine so
which is better

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:32.370
which is better
 

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.779
which is better
well again it boils down to contractual

00:23:35.779 --> 00:23:35.789
well again it boils down to contractual
 

00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:37.940
well again it boils down to contractual
incompleteness and the allocation of

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:37.950
incompleteness and the allocation of
 

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:41.840
incompleteness and the allocation of
residual control rights if the prison is

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:41.850
residual control rights if the prison is
 

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:43.669
residual control rights if the prison is
privately run then there's going to be

00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679
privately run then there's going to be
 

00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:45.890
privately run then there's going to be
this contract with the with the private

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:45.900
this contract with the with the private
 

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.529
this contract with the with the private
company to look after the prisoners but

00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:48.539
company to look after the prisoners but
 

00:23:48.539 --> 00:23:50.480
company to look after the prisoners but
any such contract is going to be

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:50.490
any such contract is going to be
 

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.620
any such contract is going to be
incomplete and that means that the

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:54.630
incomplete and that means that the
 

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.680
incomplete and that means that the
prison company later on may find a way

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:57.690
prison company later on may find a way
 

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.990
prison company later on may find a way
consistent with the contract to save

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000
consistent with the contract to save
 

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.919
consistent with the contract to save
money at the expense of quality which is

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:03.929
money at the expense of quality which is
 

00:24:03.929 --> 00:24:07.029
money at the expense of quality which is
undesirable for the government and

00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039
undesirable for the government and
 

00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:10.279
undesirable for the government and
society for example the company might

00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:10.289
society for example the company might
 

00:24:10.289 --> 00:24:13.850
society for example the company might
find a way to hire cheaper but less

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860
find a way to hire cheaper but less
 

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.120
find a way to hire cheaper but less
qualified less well trained guards okay

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:17.130
qualified less well trained guards okay
 

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:18.560
qualified less well trained guards okay
so this is something which is good for

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:18.570
so this is something which is good for
 

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.990
so this is something which is good for
their bottom line but not so good for

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000
their bottom line but not so good for
 

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.330
their bottom line but not so good for
society because these guards may not be

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340
society because these guards may not be
 

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.970
society because these guards may not be
very good at dealing with violent

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:25.980
very good at dealing with violent
 

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.830
very good at dealing with violent
situations that might arise in the

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840
situations that might arise in the
 

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.950
situations that might arise in the
prison so this kind of action by the

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960
prison so this kind of action by the
 

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.490
prison so this kind of action by the
private company is analogous to the

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:34.500
private company is analogous to the
 

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.980
private company is analogous to the
coalmine choosing to mine high ash

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:36.990
coalmine choosing to mine high ash
 

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.940
coalmine choosing to mine high ash
content coal when the power company

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:38.950
content coal when the power company
 

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:43.529
content coal when the power company
would prefer low ash content coal so

00:24:43.529 --> 00:24:43.539
would prefer low ash content coal so
 

00:24:43.539 --> 00:24:45.149
would prefer low ash content coal so
this is something if the government owns

00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:45.159
this is something if the government owns
 

00:24:45.159 --> 00:24:47.340
this is something if the government owns
the prison it can stop this happening if

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:47.350
the prison it can stop this happening if
 

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.099
the prison it can stop this happening if
the warden shows some inclination to

00:24:50.099 --> 00:24:50.109
the warden shows some inclination to
 

00:24:50.109 --> 00:24:52.019
the warden shows some inclination to
hire these less well trained guards the

00:24:52.019 --> 00:24:52.029
hire these less well trained guards the
 

00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:53.669
hire these less well trained guards the
government can say no you are not

00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679
government can say no you are not
 

00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:55.169
government can say no you are not
allowed to do that because that's our

00:24:55.169 --> 00:24:55.179
allowed to do that because that's our
 

00:24:55.179 --> 00:24:57.090
allowed to do that because that's our
decision we have the residual control

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:57.100
decision we have the residual control
 

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.450
decision we have the residual control
right on the other hand a privately run

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:00.460
right on the other hand a privately run
 

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.779
right on the other hand a privately run
prison might have a greater incentive to

00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:03.789
prison might have a greater incentive to
 

00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:06.710
prison might have a greater incentive to
innovate to be to be more efficient and

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720
innovate to be to be more efficient and
 

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.639
innovate to be to be more efficient and
to innovate actually to be more

00:25:08.639 --> 00:25:08.649
to innovate actually to be more
 

00:25:08.649 --> 00:25:13.409
to innovate actually to be more
efficient in terms of reducing costs but

00:25:13.409 --> 00:25:13.419
efficient in terms of reducing costs but
 

00:25:13.419 --> 00:25:16.169
efficient in terms of reducing costs but
also to innovate say by coming up with

00:25:16.169 --> 00:25:16.179
also to innovate say by coming up with
 

00:25:16.179 --> 00:25:18.539
also to innovate say by coming up with
socially valuable rehabilitation

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:18.549
socially valuable rehabilitation
 

00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:21.899
socially valuable rehabilitation
programs so this is something where the

00:25:21.899 --> 00:25:21.909
programs so this is something where the
 

00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:24.659
programs so this is something where the
incentives may be greater in the private

00:25:24.659 --> 00:25:24.669
incentives may be greater in the private
 

00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:26.879
incentives may be greater in the private
case than in the public case for the

00:25:26.879 --> 00:25:26.889
case than in the public case for the
 

00:25:26.889 --> 00:25:28.919
case than in the public case for the
same reason that I argued that the

00:25:28.919 --> 00:25:28.929
same reason that I argued that the
 

00:25:28.929 --> 00:25:30.989
same reason that I argued that the
manager of the coal mine might not have

00:25:30.989 --> 00:25:30.999
manager of the coal mine might not have
 

00:25:30.999 --> 00:25:34.799
manager of the coal mine might not have
incentives to innovate to have ideas if

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:34.809
incentives to innovate to have ideas if
 

00:25:34.809 --> 00:25:37.259
incentives to innovate to have ideas if
he becomes an employee of the power

00:25:37.259 --> 00:25:37.269
he becomes an employee of the power
 

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:40.289
he becomes an employee of the power
plant rather than rather than owning the

plant rather than rather than owning the
 

00:25:40.299 --> 00:25:45.509
plant rather than rather than owning the
coal mine himself okay so which which

00:25:45.509 --> 00:25:45.519
coal mine himself okay so which which
 

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:48.119
coal mine himself okay so which which
effect is more important will determine

00:25:48.119 --> 00:25:48.129
effect is more important will determine
 

00:25:48.129 --> 00:25:49.889

someone is a you know the benefit of the

someone is a you know the benefit of the
 

00:25:49.899 --> 00:25:51.570
someone is a you know the benefit of the
government being able to intervene and

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:51.580
government being able to intervene and
 

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.619
government being able to intervene and
stop these Puli train guards being hired

00:25:55.619 --> 00:25:55.629
stop these Puli train guards being hired
 

00:25:55.629 --> 00:25:57.779
stop these Puli train guards being hired
that's a plus of government ownership

00:25:57.779 --> 00:25:57.789
that's a plus of government ownership
 

00:25:57.789 --> 00:26:00.119
that's a plus of government ownership
but on the other hand the stifling of

00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:00.129
but on the other hand the stifling of
 

00:26:00.129 --> 00:26:04.739
but on the other hand the stifling of
innovation or efficiency is a minus of

00:26:04.739 --> 00:26:04.749
innovation or efficiency is a minus of
 

00:26:04.749 --> 00:26:07.859
innovation or efficiency is a minus of
government ownership so which effect is

00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:07.869
government ownership so which effect is
 

00:26:07.869 --> 00:26:09.479
government ownership so which effect is
more important will determine whether

00:26:09.479 --> 00:26:09.489
more important will determine whether
 

00:26:09.489 --> 00:26:11.909
more important will determine whether
public or private ownership is better in

00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919
public or private ownership is better in
 

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:15.659
public or private ownership is better in
our 1997 paper we argued that the first

00:26:15.659 --> 00:26:15.669
our 1997 paper we argued that the first
 

00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:18.810
our 1997 paper we argued that the first
effect is likely to dominate the second

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:18.820
effect is likely to dominate the second
 

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.060
effect is likely to dominate the second
in the case of maximum-security prisons

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.070
in the case of maximum-security prisons
 

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:22.680
in the case of maximum-security prisons
where the quality of the guards is

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:22.690
where the quality of the guards is
 

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.479
where the quality of the guards is
particularly important so here dealing

00:26:24.479 --> 00:26:24.489
particularly important so here dealing
 

00:26:24.489 --> 00:26:27.359
particularly important so here dealing
with violent situations is particularly

00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:27.369
with violent situations is particularly
 

00:26:27.369 --> 00:26:30.450
with violent situations is particularly
important and so we've we thought having

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:30.460
important and so we've we thought having
 

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.149
important and so we've we thought having
the government with the residual control

00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159
the government with the residual control
 

00:26:33.159 --> 00:26:35.669
the government with the residual control
rights would be a good thing and so

00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679
rights would be a good thing and so
 

00:26:35.679 --> 00:26:37.769
rights would be a good thing and so
public provision would be better but

00:26:37.769 --> 00:26:37.779
public provision would be better but
 

00:26:37.779 --> 00:26:39.299
public provision would be better but
there of course other cases where the

00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:39.309
there of course other cases where the
 

00:26:39.309 --> 00:26:40.999
there of course other cases where the
trade-off goes the other way and

00:26:40.999 --> 00:26:41.009
trade-off goes the other way and
 

00:26:41.009 --> 00:26:43.529
trade-off goes the other way and
privatization is good and garbage

00:26:43.529 --> 00:26:43.539
privatization is good and garbage
 

00:26:43.539 --> 00:26:46.680
privatization is good and garbage
collection rubbish collection we thought

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:46.690
collection rubbish collection we thought
 

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:50.070
collection rubbish collection we thought
as a leading case of that I think one

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080
as a leading case of that I think one
 

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.940
as a leading case of that I think one
thing which is perhaps

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:51.950
thing which is perhaps
 

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:55.870
thing which is perhaps
useful about the analysis is that it

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880
useful about the analysis is that it
 

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.700
useful about the analysis is that it
shows that economics rather than

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:57.710
shows that economics rather than
 

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:00.460
shows that economics rather than
politics can guide us with respect to

politics can guide us with respect to
 

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:02.200
politics can guide us with respect to
the public-private choice

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:02.210
the public-private choice
 

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:04.480
the public-private choice
this is often this often ends up being

this is often this often ends up being

this is often this often ends up being
an ideological matter when you hear

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:06.590
an ideological matter when you hear
 

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:08.200
an ideological matter when you hear
people arguing about it but what this

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:08.210
people arguing about it but what this
 

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.600
people arguing about it but what this
says is no we should really think about

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:10.610
says is no we should really think about
 

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.810
says is no we should really think about
it in economic efficiency terms Oh at

it in economic efficiency terms Oh at

least that's a useful perspective okay

least that's a useful perspective okay
well I think I'm close to the end so let

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:19.400
well I think I'm close to the end so let
 

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.790
well I think I'm close to the end so let
me just say if I had more time I would

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:21.800
me just say if I had more time I would
 

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.390
me just say if I had more time I would
talk about my recent work over the last
