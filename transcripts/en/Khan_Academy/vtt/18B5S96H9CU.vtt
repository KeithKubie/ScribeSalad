00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.200
- [Instructor] Here's a statistic
that might surprise you.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.200
95% of elected officials
who seek reelection

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.283
in the United States get reelected.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.240
Just look at this graph that
shows the rate of reelection

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.810
for members of the US
House of Representatives.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.530
It hovers all the way up here.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.530
It stands to reason that
if you have two candidates

00:00:29.624 --> 00:00:33.850
for every office, one from each party,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.610
it would be about 50% of
the time the candidates

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.070
would be reelected, but
it's so much more than that.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.390
In this video on Congressional elections,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.910
I want to talk about some
of the structural aspects.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.570
That is, the way things
are set up in Congressional

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.650
elections that leads to
this really high number.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.650
What are the advantages
of being an incumbent,

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.540
that is, the person who already
holds a political office?

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.740
So what kind of advantages
does an incumbent have

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.850
simply for already occupying an office?

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.850
Well, say maybe there's a
Senate race between Candidate

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.690
Green, call her Amy
Green, and Candidate Rose.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.310
Maybe he's Ken Rose.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.574
Now what sort of advantages Amy Green

00:01:36.574 --> 00:01:39.660
just because she already
holds the Senate seat?

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.450
Well, one of her advantages
is that she has a staff,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.380
she has people whose job it is to answer

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.590
the phone calls of constituents,

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.660
make them feel heard.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.330
They can do all sorts
of things to help her.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.850
She also has the advantage of mail.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.530
Members of Congress can
send out mail for free,

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.530
whereas Candidate Rose over
here has to pay for staff

00:02:09.124 --> 00:02:12.730
and pay for mail.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.280
Already, that's a lot of money.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.220
The other thing that Candidate
Green has going for her

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.760
is name recognition.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.740
She's already been a successful
candidate, which shows

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.330
that she knows how to win an election

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.930
and there's a lot of advantage
to having name recognition.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.380
It's its own kind of advertising.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.700
Are you going to vote for someone

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.630
you've never heard of before or someone

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.200
who frequently appears in the media

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.239
who could be going to local

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.970
or state events, school openings.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.970
You get a lot of face time
simply from occupying a seat,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.860
and that's free advertising as well.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.940
The last aspect is money.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.460
Because of this incumbency advantage,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.940
and this is little bit
of a repeating cycle,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.834
interest groups, lobbyists,
and others are far more likely

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:13.330
to give money to the
candidate who is already

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.640
in a position because they know

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.270
that candidate is likely
to win and therefore,

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.988
their money is going to get them access

00:03:21.988 --> 00:03:26.540
to that candidate who will
hear out their concerns

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.530
and perhaps look upon them favorably.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.710
So compared to all of this, Candidate Rose

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.020
has a really uphill battle.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.930
He's got to pay for a lot of things

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.090
that the incumbent doesn't have to,

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.590
he doesn't have the name
recognition or the automatic

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.340
media attention, and he's
viewed less favorably

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.370
by the people who might give money.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.940
He's a bit of an unknown quantity.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.060
Another advantage that incumbents have

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.530
is that they get to draw voting districts

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.430
at least every 10 years in
response to the US Census

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.630
and changes in populations,
the districts and states

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.190
must be redrawn.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.121
Politicians do that redrawing
and they tend to use

00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:14.121
this opportunity to create
safe districts for themselves,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.598
safe being districts where the voters

00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:22.750
who are arranged
geographically will be likely

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.900
to vote them back into power.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.159
Those in power will also
generally use this opportunity

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:33.430
to attempt to harm their opponents

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.723
in a process known as gerrymandering.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.600
There are two other major
factors that contribute

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.610
to whether a Congress member is reelected.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.030
One of them is in each state, the form

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.980
that their primary takes.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.980
Some states like Iowa have
caucuses where party members

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.270
gather to vote on who
their nominee should be.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.030
These are very tightly
controlled by the party.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.030
There are closed primaries where only

00:05:07.137 --> 00:05:09.237
the registered members of a party may vote

00:05:10.572 --> 00:05:11.500
on their party's nominees for election,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.120
and then there are open primaries,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.120
where any registered voter
can vote for a party nominee,

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.070
even if they belong to the opposing party.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.070
So the form estates primary
takes as a strong effect

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.490
on how tight the party
control is over that process.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.120
The last factor affecting
Congressional elections

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.490
is whether or not they coincide

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.150
with a presidential election.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.560
There's much higher voter
turnout for presidential

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.110
elections since there's a
great deal of interest in them

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.020
and money spent on them, and that means

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.980
that you tend to get a broader
sample of the population.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.360
More people are likely to vote,
so you'll have a better idea

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.490
of how the American voting
public is feeling more generally,

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.240
but in midterm elections,
which are those elections

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.070
that don't fall at the same time

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.160
as a presidential election,
voter turnout is lower,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.460
and that means that it's gonna
be the really engaged voters

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.380
who are often strongly
aligned with a party

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.573
that will come out.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.920
Midterm elections also tend
to punish the party in power,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.940
so when the president is highly regarded

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.270
and doing well, his or her
party tends to gain seats,

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.630
but if the president is
doing poorly or has a low

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.770
public opinion rating,
then Congressional seats

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.180
will often go to the opposite party.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.780
You can see here this
chart of net gain and loss

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.530
of the president's
party, and in most cases,

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.840
the president will gain a few followers

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.530
in the first midterm election.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.020
See here, George W. Bush, 2002.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.660
His party gained both
House and Senate seats,

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.660
but often in the sixth year
of a two-term presidency,

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.410
voters harshly punish
the president's party.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.080
You can see that in George
W. Bush's sixth year,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.730
the Republicans lost 30 House seats

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.330
and six Senate seats, and
a similar effect happened

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.350
with Barack Obama in 2014.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.350
The Democrats lost 13 House
seats and nine Senate seats.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.070
So there's a strong correlation
with the president's party

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.480
and the fates of members
of Congress who belong

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.353
to that party.
