00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.420
Complete this statement using
less than or greater than--

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.850
that's what those symbols
are-- for this kind of

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.029
brackets there.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.780
So all they're asking is they
have a 5 and they have a 2,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.740
and they want us to put either
a less than sign for these

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.500
brackets or a greater
than sign.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.400
So we just have a 5 and
a 2, and we're just

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.660
comparing the two.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.250
Which number is greater?

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.540
Well, 5 is greater.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.630
If you count to 5, you're
going to pass up 2.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.690
If you look at a number line
here, if you started at 0, 1,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.460
2, 3, 4, 5, you see that
2 comes before 5.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.120
2 is less than 5.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.310
If I have $2, that's less than
$5, or $5 is greater than $2.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.450
And so the symbol for greater
than, the way you remember

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.910
it-- this is probably the
hardest part of how do you

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.050
remember it-- is you want the
larger side of the symbol

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.360
facing the larger number.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.830
So 5 is the larger number,
so we want the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.460
bigger side of the symbol.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.860
So we want it like this.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.040
The way I think about is that
this right here is the big

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.980
side of the symbol, and this
right here, this point, is the

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.110
small side of the symbol,
so 5 is greater than 2.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.800
If it was the other way, we
would write 2 is less than 5.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.860
Once again, though, we always
have the point pointing to the

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.090
smaller number, and we have the
wide-open part, the big

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.650
part of the symbol, pointing
to the larger number.
