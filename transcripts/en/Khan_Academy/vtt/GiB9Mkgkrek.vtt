00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:01.701
Male voice: In the last
video, we were able

00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:04.401
to calculate the real
return by putting everything

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:06.934
in today's dollars. Put
that $100 we invested

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:08.685
a year ago in today's dollars, figure out

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:12.267
what our actual return
was, our dollar return

00:00:12.267 --> 00:00:14.874
is in today dollars, then
we got our real return.

00:00:14.874 --> 00:00:16.344
What I want to think about in this video

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:17.855
is how we can do it another way.

00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:19.872
We can actually put everything in last

00:00:19.872 --> 00:00:25.768
year's money. We got $110. Let's put $110,

00:00:25.768 --> 00:00:35.771
of today's money in last year's money.

00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:37.663
To think about this, we could do a little

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:39.198
algebra, or you don't have to do algebra,

00:00:39.198 --> 00:00:40.968
but maybe that makes it a
little bit more intuitive.

00:00:40.968 --> 00:00:43.326
There's some amount of money last year,

00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:46.017
there's some amount of
money, let's call that X,

00:00:46.017 --> 00:00:51.525
that if we multiply it by the
inflation rate, so if we grow it by 2%,

00:00:51.525 --> 00:00:58.222
that's going to be worth $110 today.

00:00:58.222 --> 00:01:00.146
Or, to just solve for X, you divide both

00:01:00.146 --> 00:01:05.398
sides by 1.02 and we
get the amount of money

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.152
that if you grow it by
inflation, or that had

00:01:07.152 --> 00:01:10.062
the same amount of purchasing
power as $110 today,

00:01:10.062 --> 00:01:13.333
would be 110 divided by 1.02 which is,

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:16.066
let me move over to the
right at little bit,

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:23.590
this would be 110 divided by 1.02.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.727
This would be equal to
$107.8 just roughly,

00:01:28.727 --> 00:01:33.536
just to round it. This is equal to $107.8.

00:01:33.536 --> 00:01:38.727
So $110 today buys us
the exact same thing,

00:01:38.727 --> 00:01:40.477
if you believe the whole CPI Index,

00:01:40.477 --> 00:01:45.926
as $107.80, maybe I can
even add another digit,

00:01:45.926 --> 00:01:51.229
84 cents, would have bought us last year.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.488
What is our dollar return
in last year's money?

00:01:55.488 --> 00:02:02.343
Dollar return in last year's money.

00:02:02.343 --> 00:02:05.153
Last year's money.

00:02:05.153 --> 00:02:11.005
Well, we ended up with
$107.84 in last year's money.

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:15.653
So 107.84, or $107.84. We had originally

00:02:15.653 --> 00:02:19.143
invested, in last year's money, $100.

00:02:19.143 --> 00:02:21.674
We had originally invested $100.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:27.190
So our dollar return is
$7.84, or if you want

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.847
to calculate the real return, how much did

00:02:30.847 --> 00:02:32.846
our actual purchasing power increase?

00:02:32.846 --> 00:02:39.084
Well, we got a $7.84 return
off of a $100 investment,

00:02:39.084 --> 00:02:41.176
so this is pretty easy to calculate.

00:02:41.176 --> 00:02:45.176
We once again get to the same
7.8% for the real return.
