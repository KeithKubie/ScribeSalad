00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.730
At their very best,
technologies of media

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.610
are engines of empathy.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.090
Cinema, perhaps the
pinnacle, the cathedral

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.790
of communication
technology, allows

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.600
you to experience the world
from another's point of view,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.820
ultimately at its best
acting as a catalyst for you

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.010
to be more compassionate and
empathic towards the other.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.260
Now, looking towards the
future, there's a lot of talk

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.910
now about virtual reality.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.480
The Oculus Rift has
finally captured

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.900
the imagination of the public.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.470
And this is now
becoming real, the idea

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.050
of fully immersive,
technologically mediated dream

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.850
worlds, rendered mind spaces
where you literally inhabit

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.550
another world, portals
to another world.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.505
These are not virtual realities.

00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:02.710
These are going to
be real virtualities.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.374
And what is this
ultimately all about?

00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:07.260
Well, Terence McKenna
says, these technologies

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.360
will allow us to share our
dreams with one another.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.675
Everybody will have essentially
a cosmos of the imagination

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:18.050
where they can build
cathedrals of the mind.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.050
Imagine the intimacy
that becomes possible

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.340
when people meet and they say
hey, do you want to come visit

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.110
my world.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.410
Do you want to see what it's
like to be inside my head?

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.750
What kind of intimacy?

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.420
It's like turning
ourselves inside out.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.880
The metaphor used by Terence
McKenna is that of the octopi.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.710
This is what becomes possible.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.090
The octopi transfigurates to
merge with its environment.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.830
It literally wears
its linguistic intent

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.260
outside its skin.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.970
It wears its mind, its nervous
system, outside its skin.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.970
Its way of communicating is
something that can be beheld.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.620
Language becomes something
that can be visually beheld.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.140
Us humans, you know--
grunts, and voices,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.380
and funny faces to try to
imbue, to read what one another

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.130
is thinking and feeling,
imagine if with virtual reality,

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.830
we all become like
octopi and wear

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.210
our minds outside our skin.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.510
Imagine the intimacy
that becomes possible.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.100
This is really what excites
me about virtual reality,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.300
about these sacred
modalities of intimacy

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.810
exchanging shared
intersubjectivity that

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.070
become possible.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.220
Think about that.
