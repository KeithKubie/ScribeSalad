00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.100
It might help you to think about
your to do list as an object

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.260
called TodoList that contains
objects called Items.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.232
Objects have attributes or properties.

00:00:10.232 --> 00:00:15.220
A TodoList will have a title,
a list of Items and

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.710
Items will have a description,
an ID, and a completion status.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.220
Objects also have methods,
or actions they can perform.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.220
You will want to be able to add or
remove items from a to-do list.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.390
You will also want to be able to update
it's status from not done to done.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.400
You should also have print methods for
both of them,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.530
because what good is a to-do list
if you can't actually see the list?

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.630
Finally, you need a way
to create the object.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.260
That's what the initialize
method is for.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.630
As you continue to work on your program,

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.590
you might add to this list and
that's fine.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.400
For now, we're just brainstorming
the basic structure of our classes.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.590
You can always add to this later.
