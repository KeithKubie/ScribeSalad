00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:02.930
I want to do the same problem
that I did in the last video.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.410
But I want to show you
that there's multiple ways

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.679
to solve these problems that
should hopefully give you

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:08.720
the right answer if you
do them in the right way.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.920
So once again, one
pipe can fill a pool

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.000
1 and 1/2 times faster
than a second pipe.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.850
If both pipes are open, the
pool can be filled in 6 hours.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.130
If only the slower
pipe is open, how long

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.080
would it take to fill the pool?

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.920
So as I said in the last video,
whenever you do these problems,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.400
it's very important to
think in terms of rate.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.840
The rate at which
the slower pipe

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.839
can fill a pool and the
rate at which the faster

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.431
pipe can fill a pool.

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:33.930
Right over here,
I'm going to define

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.900
that the slower pipe
can fill a pool in r.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.830
So its rate is r pools per hour.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.140
So if its rate is r pools
per hour-- and r for rate--

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.960
what is the faster pool's rate?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.950
The faster pool's rate is
going to be 1.5 times r.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.930
It's 1 and 1/2 times faster.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.020
It has 1 and 1/2 times the rate.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.950
So it's going to be able
do 1.5r pools per hour.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.640
And what's their combined rate?

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.080
Well, you can add the rates.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.980
r plus 1.5r-- let me
write this in orange--

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:20.101
so if you say their combined
rate is r plus 1.5--

00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:29.100
what am I doing-- plus
1.5r pools per hour,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.530
which is equal to
2.5r pools per hour.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.370
And they're also telling us
that their combined rate,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.660
if both pipes are open, the
pool can be filled in 6 hours.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.310
So they're telling
us that the combined

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.380
rate is 1 pool in every 6 hours.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.030
So they're saying that
the combined rate is also

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.690
equal to 1 pool in every 6
hours or 1/6 of a pool per hour.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.740
1 pool in every 6 hours
is the same thing--

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.120
so that's this line right over
here-- 1 pool in every 6 hours

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.870
is the same thing as
1/6 of a pool per hour.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.460
And then, once again, we
have 2.5r is equal to 1/6.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.760
We can multiply both sides.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.810
So let me do it this way.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.360
We can multiply both sides by 6.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.600
Let me just rewrite it so
I have some real estate.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.830
2.5r.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.610
The units are the
same on both sides,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.630
so really this needs
to be equal to this.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.172
So 2.5r needs to
be equal to 1/6.

00:02:38.172 --> 00:02:42.210
You can multiply
both sides by 6.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.800
This just becomes 1.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.540
This right over here,
6 times 2.5 is 15.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.020
So you get 15r is equal to
1 or r is equal to 1/15.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.280
And let's see how
that might make sense.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.070
So we know that the slower
pool is r pools per hour.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.510
Or we could say it
is 1/15 of a pool.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.670
1/15 of a pool per hour.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.210
Or you could view it as to do
one pool, it takes 15 hours.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.160
So once again, to answer our
question, if only the slower

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.730
pipe is open, how
long would it take?

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.240
15 hours.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.016
So once again, the
exact same problem we

00:03:25.016 --> 00:03:27.390
did in the last video,
just a different way.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.974
And frankly, a
little bit simpler.

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:30.890
Although, I went into a
little bit more detail

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.265
in the last video
so I don't know

00:03:32.265 --> 00:03:34.500
if I can make that comparison.
