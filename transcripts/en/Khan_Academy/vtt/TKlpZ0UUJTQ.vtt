00:00:00.194 --> 00:00:01.515
- [Voiceover] Hello
again, in the last video

00:00:01.515 --> 00:00:02.795
we were looking at vector fields that

00:00:02.795 --> 00:00:04.382
only have an X component,

00:00:04.382 --> 00:00:05.742
basically meaning all of the vectors

00:00:05.742 --> 00:00:07.854
point just purely to the
left or to the right,

00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:09.970
with nothing up and down going on.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.064
Then we landed at the idea that

00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:13.014
the divergence of V, you know when

00:00:13.014 --> 00:00:15.720
you take the divergence of
this vector valued function,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.565
it should definitely have something to do

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:19.863
with the partial derivative of P,

00:00:19.863 --> 00:00:21.224
that X component of the output,

00:00:21.224 --> 00:00:22.791
with respect to X,

00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:24.373
and here I wanna do the opposite,

00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:26.061
and say, okay, what if
we look at functions

00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:30.405
where that P, that
first component is zero,

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:33.252
but then we have some kind
of positive Q component,

00:00:33.252 --> 00:00:35.792
some kind of positive,
well maybe not positive,

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:38.171
but some kind of non-zero,

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:40.605
so positive or negative Y component,

00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:41.703
and what this would mean,

00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:43.961
instead of thinking about
vector as just left and right,

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.790
now we're looking at vectors that

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.081
are purely up or down, kind of up or down.

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.072
So kind of doing the same
thing we did last time,

00:00:51.072 --> 00:00:52.921
if we start thinking about cases where

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:54.832
the divergence of our function

00:00:54.832 --> 00:00:57.163
at a given point should be positive,

00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:00.587
and an example of that,
you might be saying,

00:01:00.587 --> 00:01:02.905
nothing is happening at the point itself,

00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:06.217
so Q itself would be
zero but then below it,

00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:07.880
things are kind of going away so

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.729
they're pointing down, and above it,

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.151
things are going up.

00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:12.818
So in this case down here,

00:01:12.818 --> 00:01:14.381
Q is a little bit less than zero,

00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:16.779
the Y component of that
vector is less than zero,

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:19.339
and up here, Q is greater than zero.

00:01:19.339 --> 00:01:20.761
So here we have the idea
that as you're going

00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:22.348
from the bottom up,

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:24.928
the Y value of your input is increasing

00:01:24.928 --> 00:01:26.798
as you're moving upward in space,

00:01:26.798 --> 00:01:30.068
the value of Q, this Y
component of the output,

00:01:30.068 --> 00:01:31.409
should also be increasing because

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.110
it goes from negative to zero to positive.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.939
So now you're starting to get this idea

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.497
of partial Q with respect to Y,

00:01:39.497 --> 00:01:41.871
you know, as we change that
Y and move up in space,

00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:44.289
the value of Q should be positive,

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:45.796
so positive divergence seems to

00:01:45.796 --> 00:01:47.908
correspond to a positive value here.

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:49.288
And the thinking is actually gonna be

00:01:49.288 --> 00:01:50.447
almost identical to what we did

00:01:50.447 --> 00:01:52.337
in the last video with the X component,

00:01:52.337 --> 00:01:54.041
because you can think
of another circumstance

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:55.769
where maybe you actually have a vector

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:57.881
attached to your point
and something's going on,

00:01:57.881 --> 00:01:59.997
and there even is some
convergence towards it,

00:01:59.997 --> 00:02:02.391
where you have some fluid flow

00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:03.550
in towards the point,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.077
but it's just heavily outweighed by

00:02:05.077 --> 00:02:08.080
even higher divergence, even higher flow

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.136
away from your point above it,

00:02:10.136 --> 00:02:11.537
and again you have this idea of

00:02:11.537 --> 00:02:13.870
Q starts off small, so here's kind of,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.617
Q starts off small, maybe
it's kind of like near zero,

00:02:16.617 --> 00:02:18.748
and then here Q is something positive

00:02:18.748 --> 00:02:20.271
and then here it's even more positive,

00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:23.889
and sort of making up notation here

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.617
but I want the idea of kind of small

00:02:25.617 --> 00:02:27.487
and then medium-sized and then bigger,

00:02:27.487 --> 00:02:31.549
and once again, the idea
of partial derivative of Q

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.028
with respect to Y being greater than zero

00:02:34.028 --> 00:02:36.487
seems to correspond to
positive divergence,

00:02:36.487 --> 00:02:37.807
and if you want, you can sketch out

00:02:37.807 --> 00:02:39.677
many more circumstances and think about

00:02:39.677 --> 00:02:41.621
what if the vector
started off pointing down,

00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:42.921
what would positive and negative

00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:44.691
and zero divergence all look like,

00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:46.413
but the upshot of it all, pretty much

00:02:46.413 --> 00:02:48.303
for the same reasons I went
through in the last video,

00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:50.702
is this partial derivative
with respect to Y

00:02:50.702 --> 00:02:53.000
corresponds to the divergence.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.111
And when we combine this with

00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:57.450
our conclusions about the X component,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.255
that actually is all you need
to know for the divergence.

00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:02.855
So just to write it all out,

00:03:02.855 --> 00:03:05.521
if we have a vector valued
function of X and Y,

00:03:07.383 --> 00:03:09.030
and it's got both of its components,

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.745
we've got P as the X
component of the output,

00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:14.231
that first component of the output,

00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.740
and Q, and we're looking
at both of these at once,

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.023
the way that we compute divergence,

00:03:21.023 --> 00:03:25.191
the definition of divergence
of this vector valued function,

00:03:25.191 --> 00:03:28.767
is to say divergence of V

00:03:30.387 --> 00:03:32.854
as a function of X and Y,

00:03:34.917 --> 00:03:38.172
is actually equal to the
partial derivative of P

00:03:38.172 --> 00:03:41.827
with respect to X, plus,

00:03:41.827 --> 00:03:45.836
the partial derivative
of Q with respect to Y.

00:03:47.743 --> 00:03:50.665
And that's it, that is the
formula for divergence,

00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:52.514
and hopefully by now,
this isn't just kind of

00:03:52.514 --> 00:03:54.142
a formula that I'm plopping down for you,

00:03:54.142 --> 00:03:55.845
but it's something that
makes intuitive sense,

00:03:55.845 --> 00:03:58.002
when you see this term, this partial P

00:03:58.002 --> 00:04:00.094
with respect to X, you're thinking about,

00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:01.757
oh yes, yes, because if you have

00:04:01.757 --> 00:04:03.566
flow that's kind of increasing

00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:05.476
as you move in the X direction,

00:04:05.476 --> 00:04:07.527
that's gonna correspond
with movement away,

00:04:07.527 --> 00:04:08.747
and this partial derivative of Q

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:10.213
with respect to Y term,

00:04:10.213 --> 00:04:11.736
hopefully you're thinking, ah yes,

00:04:11.736 --> 00:04:14.579
as you're increasing the Y component

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.206
of your vector around your point,

00:04:16.206 --> 00:04:19.109
that corresponds with less
flow in than there is out,

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.039
so both of these correspond to that

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.519
idea of divergence that we're going for,

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:25.126
and if you just add them up,

00:04:25.126 --> 00:04:27.621
this gives you everything
you need to know.

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:28.901
And one thing that's pretty neat,

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.468
and maybe kind of surprising,

00:04:30.468 --> 00:04:32.761
is that the way we just
came across this formula,

00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:34.000
and started to think about it,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.100
was in the simplified case,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.666
where you have, you
know, just pure movement

00:04:36.666 --> 00:04:38.758
in the X direction or pure
movement in the Y direction,

00:04:38.758 --> 00:04:40.179
but in reality, as we know,

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:42.290
vector fields can look
much more complicated,

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.958
and maybe you have something where

00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.626
you know, it's not just
in the X direction,

00:04:45.626 --> 00:04:47.451
and there's lots of things going on

00:04:47.451 --> 00:04:49.018
and you need to account for all of those,

00:04:49.018 --> 00:04:50.681
and evidently, just looking at the change

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:52.490
in the X component with respect to X,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.037
or the change in the Y
component of the output

00:04:54.037 --> 00:04:56.310
with respect to the Y
component of the input,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.970
gives you all the
information you need to know.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.576
And basically what's going on here is

00:05:01.576 --> 00:05:03.587
that any fluid flow
can just be broken down

00:05:03.587 --> 00:05:05.350
into the X and Y components where

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.119
you're just looking at each vector,

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:08.908
you know, whatever vector you have,

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.370
it could be broken down into

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.300
it's own X and Y components and if you

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.621
wanna think kind of concretely about

00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:15.918
the fluid flow idea, maybe you'd say that

00:05:15.918 --> 00:05:18.498
for your point, if you're
looking at a point in space,

00:05:18.498 --> 00:05:20.796
you picture a very small box around it,

00:05:20.796 --> 00:05:21.708
and the reason you only need to

00:05:21.708 --> 00:05:23.638
think about X components and Y components

00:05:23.638 --> 00:05:25.488
is that you're only really looking at,

00:05:25.488 --> 00:05:28.088
you know, what's going on
on the left and right side,

00:05:28.088 --> 00:05:29.408
and then you can kind of calculate

00:05:29.408 --> 00:05:31.928
what the divergence
according to fluid flowing

00:05:31.928 --> 00:05:33.289
in through those sides is,

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:34.977
and then you just look at kind of,

00:05:34.977 --> 00:05:37.517
fluid flowing through
the top or the bottom,

00:05:37.517 --> 00:05:39.507
and if you kinda shrink this box down,

00:05:39.507 --> 00:05:42.838
all you really care about is
those two different directions,

00:05:42.838 --> 00:05:44.809
and anything else, anything that's kind of

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:47.449
a diagonal into it, is
really just broken down

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:49.521
into what's the Y component there,

00:05:49.521 --> 00:05:51.537
what's the, you know,
how is it contributing to

00:05:51.537 --> 00:05:53.587
movement up through that
bottom part of the box,

00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:54.827
and then what's the X component,

00:05:54.827 --> 00:05:56.067
how's it contributing to movement

00:05:56.067 --> 00:05:57.830
through that side part of the box.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.176
But anyway, I mean the upshot here

00:05:59.176 --> 00:06:00.879
is just that the formula for divergence

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.878
only involves these two components.
