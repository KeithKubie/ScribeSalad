00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.000
 Quantum theory, the world of smaller particles, is actually the effect of mathematics, and 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.100
 I would say that the future is for quantum mathematics 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.900
 Mathematics is also done by mathematicians, we do it with the brain, how our brains were created? 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.150
 Well, millions of years of evolution. So I think our concepts 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.760
 Too much of things are affected to see who is around us 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.800
 So we talk about the space because we sort of move in space 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.629
 We are moving in time. We count because we see things. We throw stones 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.120
 We want to half the stone track and its speed 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.600
 Thus calculus, for example, is based on the idea of ​​speed or slope 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.589
 So I actually think that our mind is a very large kind of set of everyday experience 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.600
 So you may think that math is a kind of stop doing if we move to a new circle 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.220
 For example, very large, such as the universe, or very small, as a primary particle scientist. 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.289
 But the wonderful thing: this did not happen. So math was 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.019
 Very successful in conquering, and certainly I think, that material experience 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.780
 General relativity 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.759
 Einstein's theory is a good example 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.080
 He needs a concept of curved space. It turned out that Riemann and others 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.180
 In the nineteenth century, they had already thought about it. They thought, there are two dimensions, three dimensions 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.900
 Why do not there be a quantitative number of dimensions? 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.000
 The abstract thinking of athletes was a kind of advanced thinking in quantum theory 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.438
 As you know, even if you sit and meditate for a million years will not come with quantum laws 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.199
 Mechanics because they are very strange. Thus, nature naturally imposed on us 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:56.000
 It was like a very painful process. We had to leave many very cherished concepts 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.800
 For example, the fact that the world system is predictable. Quantum mechanics is just the way nature works 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.299
 You see it very clearly at the level of atoms and elementary particles 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.059
 If you took many atoms together, then in some sense many of the features of quantum mechanics 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:20.100
 Are of the drifting type. We do not notice that because we are manufacturers of such as 10 to 24 molecules usually 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.929
 There are many things that you have to give up on quantum mechanics. The first is that you can not figure out the answer to all the questions 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:34.069
 So, for example, usually, I would say, well, this is the pen, I know where it is, and if you drop it 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.298
 I know what speed is. It moves. Quantum mechanics says everything is okay 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.480
 You can know either position or speed, so nearly half of the questions are not answerable 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.319
 This is really weird, because how will I describe the pen then? 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.179
 But there is another thing, which is that even if you want to describe 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.389
 How things move, they never have a specific answer. So, like if you 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.309
 A classic object like a pen, now you can say "How do I go from A to B? 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.409
 Well there will be shorter roads. As you throw a stone you will go like this from A to B. 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.989
 I will know exactly how I went 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.508
 This is like the optimal path, I can calculate this, math about this. Now, if you are 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.328
 The particles of quantum mechanics, you are basically free to go in any possible 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.969
 The road, so you know, may really be very strange trails that go all in such a way 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.698
 And what physics will do, it will give a definite probability to all of these 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.819
 Possible scenarios. If for example I want to go from work to home 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.200
 I know very well what path I take 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.429
 But if you are an electron that moves for example, from one atom to another atom 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.590
 It's more like these curves, so everything is in terms of probability. 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.600
 Quantum probability is something, it's like, complex number, if you take squared abs, 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.700
 The possibilities become actual. 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.629
 So for example, one thing that is because of this funny kind of stuff, what can happen is 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.728
 Instead, you know, even if you're thinking where particles are located, 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:19.519
 Now it can be here, or can be here, maybe you say, well there is a certain possibility 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.589
 It's A, and the probability of it's B. 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.609
 But the particles of quantum mechanics can be half here and another half will be there, at the same time. 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.040
 So this is very strange. 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.380
 It's like to take a point, divide it into two parts dot placed here, and put one there 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.620
 Thus quantum mechanics bases are partially captured probability, 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:51.379
 But it has a kind of very strange phenomena built in it, and it ... you have a kind of deep drilling and foundation of things 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.900
 It happens, you know, all at the same time 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.600
 Makes quantum mechanics very difficult to absorb 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.400
 It has been said, you know, if you say you understand quantum mechanics that you are just a liar, because that is it 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.590
 This is something in our intuition we simply can not understand 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.270
 Physicists were thinking, well, we need some things, for example, to describe transformations in corn 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.250
 How to go from case to case 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.709
 Well, we need something, and then they discovered that it is called a matrix, and that it is actually known, of course, in mathematical literature. 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.900
 But to understand 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:30.830
 The concepts that came, such as Hilbert's places and wave functions, were mathematics that was partially developed at the time 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.909
 But I would say then that the physicists really ran with it 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.090
 At this point, I would say mathians are 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.880
 Try to catch up 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.110
 Understand, you know 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.900
 Not only language, but also the power of the concept. Because there is something incredible 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.149
 Nature in quantum theory is ideal for the mathematical mind 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.569
 Because mathematicians do not study one object 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:04.790
 They really are really thinking about the whole family. Category, all possible things. So, all the numbers at the same time, or everything is possible 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.780
 For geometric shapes. What quantum mechanics says is perfection, because I do not consider it one way 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.959
 I'm thinking of the space of all the tracks. In fact, I give you something else. I give you a way 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.679
 In fact, the probability of each path is possible 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.040
 So in some way, you can gather all over these different tracks. We call this amount over the course of history 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.590
 and he... 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.359
 Again, the concept is very funny, since we think of history as something, too 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.200
 Some things, some facts that happen. Quantum mechanics 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.149
 History is all possible scenarios at the same time. Thus there is a certain way to 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.749
 Consider many different things at the same time. And even one 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:59.400
 The coolest application to all this is, node theory. So if you have a node, like this 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:03.000
 Connected like this, so it's ... it's ... I just 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.070
 Draw here the projection, but there is a certain path in three dimensions, and, you know, 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.169
 The athletes want to distinguish. This one is knotted, and this one is not. So, if you knot 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:18.049
 Theory, you want to study the knot in the general. The space of each node is possible. Really 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.180
 Quantum theory comes to salvation 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:26.810
 It is a very effective way to describe this node. Young physicists will not be surprised anymore 

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:29.160
 For example Niels Bohr or 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.339
 Albert Einstein, who were really fighting this concept. I often think, you know, at some point there will be a generation of mathematicians 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:41.000
 This species grows, and grows with quantum theory, and they are likely to apply these kinds of rules in a very natural way. 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.600
 Brady: "They started stealing your things, are not they? 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.550
 exactly. So, the wonderful thing is that there are some very deep ones 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:52.300
 Mathematical problems; abstract mathematical problems, such a classification of each node 

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:59.200
 Or think of four or six dimensions of space, a mere fact of interested mathematics arguments 

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:06.710
 Now there is a set of these problems that have already been solved using quantum theory. I think he is like a good mathematician 

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:11.689
 It has a toolbox full of everything: sports engineering 

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.400
 Calculus, number theory, 

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.500
 As you know, the rules of modern physics should be there 

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:24.229
 It's just a very effective way to deal with some problems, and I actually ... think that many mathematicians are surprised that 

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.870
 The information was flowing in the other direction. Physicists were surprised, because they saw quantum 

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.229
 Mathematicians, so I say, took these ideas 

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.080
 Circulate them to higher levels 

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.200
 It's like having a great student and you know everything you know 

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.000
 And then the student takes much more, because it is again 

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.410
 This is the beauty of mathematics. It is, in a sense, inherent in reality, but then not. Difficult to meet 

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.990
 This mathematician is not ... 

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.020
 I don "t think so 

00:08:55.020 --> 00:09:00.650
 Plato; believes that, as you know, primaries are only there, and have nothing to do with the fact that there are 

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.319
 Three pens here. That number three is there 

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.469
 Thus, there is this kind of 

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.210
 Interesting type to 

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.210
 Oscillation between mathematics 

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.440
 Absorbs 

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.910
 Facts from reality 

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:21.739
 And then the kind of taking a journey of fantasy, going in directions that the physicist says, wait a moment did not 

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.900
 In fact we have the intention to go and do, to do this kind of crazy things 

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:30.500
 Brady: "Was this appearance of mathematics out of physics a difficult birth? 

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.523
 Something causing problems? 

00:09:32.523 --> 00:09:34.600
 Yup . Two-way, I think 

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.840
 What you know, physicists say that mathematics is very attractive 

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.399
 But it is like a black hole that can make you disappear, because you will be separated from reality. 

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:50.420
 Odysseus, to connect yourself to the mast of the ship is not enticed by the beauty of mathematics 

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.560
 Because he 

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:58.820
 Many of the great ideas in physics were very painful and unsophisticated and ugly 

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.670
 Initially. It took some time to appreciate 

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:08.300
 Quantum theory is a beautiful thing. This is the rivalry of the physics part. From the mathematics part, 

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:15.169
 I think this is, you know, physicists sometimes look at them as a kind of plumber, and they, you know, they make their hands dirty, 

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.170
 They deal with this messy thing that is actually called 

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:25.729
 It's beautiful, as a mathematician, you can go to this Platonic world where there is some perfection. So there too 

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.000
 I think a few mathematicians were not already 

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.509
 Impressed with the material ideas. They may say, well 

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:38.119
 As you know, it may be kind of ... this is probably ... one or two areas where it is appropriate, but not for my practical field, 

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.500
 Which is ancient. Then definitely 

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.970
 Who left the field 

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:49.399
 There were some material ideas that proved to be very powerful 

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:59.200
 I feel like it is like a wave, you think it will not hurt you until you hit, then suddenly become underwater 

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.060
 In physics we really have a crisis, and the crisis is that we have two 

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:07.849
 Great theories describing the world. 

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.620
 One is the canton 

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:16.429
 Theory: It's ideal for elementary particles. The other is relative, used to describe large structures in the universe 

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:23.149
 But the point is the clash of these two things, and they collide because these great physical laws. They include 

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:30.499
 Such as black holes, and perhaps most importantly, the Big Bang, where the rules of physics collapse. 

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:38.029
 So this is very noticeable that the theory that you have to describe actually may fail at the very core. And 

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:43.370
 We believe that, in a sense, the only solution is 

00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:50.869
 To achieve quantum mechanics in it. So somehow we have to meld these two images. It's not enough to do quantum mechanics 

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.459
 It's not enough to do mathematics geometry. We know that this happens, because the universe works, 

00:11:55.459 --> 00:12:00.018
 As you know, as we speak, the laws of nature are fully functioning 

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:05.360
 There is no collapse anywhere. That means we have to come out with something 

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.940
 Deeper than mathematics geometry 

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:10.339
 Now what? 

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.899
 This, I think, is a big secret. We have some ideas 

00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:19.399
 So, the idea may be that math geometry or something like that 

00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:27.709
 Thermodynamics, a theory that describes essentially the materials. So, if I think of this table, it shows me that it is very powerful 

00:12:27.709 --> 00:12:29.929
 But I know it is a large group of molecules 

00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:34.249
 I feel the air around me, and feel a certain temperature 

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:38.359
 But there is nothing like the temperature of these particles and only the up and down 

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:44.388
 So it can only be like this physical sheet, if we zoom in, zoom in, zoom in 

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:49.729
 I will definitely see molecules, atoms and elementary particles, and there is no paper anymore 

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:56.479
 Can it be if the zoom is in the same space, at what point I see pixels? 

00:12:57.059 --> 00:13:03.889
 See something else? As you know, we were probably thinking it was pure information, such as zeros of them. So, I find that absolutely 

00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:08.779
 Breathtaking. Because if you are able to come up with a piece of math 

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:16.879
 This is more fundamental than the space, from the geometry of mathematics, I think it will be 

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.210
 Revolution of all mathematics 

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.430
 just imagine 

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.879
 And so they are going ... 

00:13:51.879 --> 00:13:53.879
