00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.140
Think of all of the developments throughout history that led to the conveniences you enjoy today.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.600
If I had to pick the biggest game-changer in human technology, it would probably be the steam engine.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.920
During the industrial revolution, the steam
engine powered machines in farms and factories.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.580
And, although it may not seem so, those advances eventually led to the technologies that you’re using to watch me, right now.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.020
So, the steam engine was a pretty big deal.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.120
Developing a practical steam engine involved a lot of time and a lot smart people, and about a hundred years, and three main inventors.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:39.260
And it took a solid understanding of thermodynamic processes – and heat engines – to make this world-changing technology, a reality.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:51.160
[Theme Music]

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.399
Heat engines, like steam engines, turn thermal energy into mechanical work, and they do it in a repeating cycle.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.860
The process starts at a high operating temperature, which we label as T_H, and ends up at a lower operating temperature, T_L.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.360
In the process, the engine takes the input
heat that was used to raise the temperature,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.440
known as Q_H, and turns some of it into work, while also releasing some heat – Q_L – as exhaust.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.960
Then the engine’s temperature is raised once more, so it can start the cycle all over again.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.640
OK, now think back to the first law of thermodynamics, which says that the change in the thermal energy of a system is equal to heat and work.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.420
In the case of a heat engine, the change in thermal energy is zero, because it always returns to the temperature it started from.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.160
So, the engine’s input heat must be equal
to the work it does, plus the heat it releases.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.670
Now let’s see how this plays out in a steam
engine.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.950
There are a few different types of steam engine, but we’ll focus on the basic reciprocating type.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.220
As long as you have something to "heat" the steam, like coal or oil, the engine keeps working.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.840
That’s the input heat.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.370
The input heat is used to heat a volume of
water, which turns to steam.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.040
Then, an intake valve opens, allowing the
steam into the engine.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.960
The steam expands and moves a piston outward
– that’s the work done by the engine.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.470
Then the intake valve closes, and an exhaust
valve opens.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.870
The exhaust valve leads to a condenser, which
cools the steam back into water.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.620
The lower temperature also lowers the pressure, creating a partial vacuum that makes the piston move back into its original position.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.960
Then the water gets heated back into steam,
and the cycle starts over.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.880
As the engine runs, the motion of the piston can be translated into all kinds of different movement,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.280
which is how steam engines can do things like
move trains and boats, and run factory lines.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.739
But as the steam engine runs, it releases
exhaust heat.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.900
The more exhaust heat it produces, the less efficient the engine is, and the more energy you have to put in for the same amount of work.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.959
Obviously, it’s important for engines to
be as efficient as possible to save energy.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.159
And to design an efficient engine, engineers
have to be able to calculate its efficiency.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.100
Like we said earlier, an engine’s input heat is equal to the work it does, plus its exhaust heat.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.100
And the more work – and therefore, the less exhaust heat – you get out of the input heat, the more efficient your engine is.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.760
So, efficiency is equal to the work done by
an engine divided by its input heat.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.630
We can also put this just in terms of input
heat and exhaust heat – pretty easily, actually.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.810
We know that work is equal to input heat minus
exhaust heat.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.340
So efficiency is equal to input heat minus
exhaust heat, divided by the input heat.

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.209
Or, simplifying those terms: efficiency is
equal to 1 - exhaust heat / input heat.

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.671
If your engine produced no exhaust heat at all?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.530
We’d say that its efficiency was exactly 1.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.130
It would be perfectly efficient.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.620
But there’s no such thing as an engine that
produces no exhaust heat at all.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.220
It wouldn’t work, because the temperature needs to be lowered and then raised again for the engine to keep going.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.900
But we can imagine an ideal engine, where none of the exhaust energy is waste heat – where there’s no friction or anything like that.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:46.160
An ideal engine would also be reversible – meaning, you could run it backward, putting in work to transfer heat from something with a lower temperature to something with a higher temperature.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.740
This kind of hypothetical engine is called a Carnot engine, and we can use it to figure out the maximum possible efficiency of a real-life engine.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.420
Last time, we talked about the four types
of basic thermodynamic processes.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.860
The Carnot engine combines two of those types
into what’s known as the Carnot cycle.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.680
But in the Carnot cycle, those processes don’t transfer heat between areas with different temperatures.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:15.660
Because, if an engine involves heat transfer from an area with a higher temperature to an area with a lower temperature, then reversing the engine would involve transferring heat from lower to higher.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.220
Which would violate the second law of thermodynamics!

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.620
So, in the Carnot cycle, heat won’t flow between areas of different temperatures at all.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.700
Instead, the cycle goes through two adiabatic processes, where heat is held constant, and two isothermal processes, where heat is transferred.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.860
But the temperature is held constant, so the heat never flows between areas of different temperatures.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.960
Now, you might be wondering how heat gets transferred, if there’s no difference in temperature.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.580
Well, remember how we described isothermal
processes last time:

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.760
In those cases, there are only very tiny differences in temperature, and they’re immediately eliminated.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.420
So, practically speaking, there is no transfer
of heat between areas of different temperatures.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.020
And this means, the process can still be reversed.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.960
With all that in mind, here’s how a Carnot engine works – at least in theory, because again: Carnot engines are totally hypothetical.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.760
The first process in the cycle is isothermal.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.600
The temperature is constant, but heat is slowly
added.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.380
That makes the gas’s volume expand and its
pressure decrease – path a-b on this diagram.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.710
The second process is adiabatic.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.420
The temperature drops while the heat stays constant, which also makes the volume expand and the pressure decrease.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.300
That’s path b-c on the diagram.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.880
The third process is the opposite of the first
one, and it’s also isothermal.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:33.380
The gas is compressed while the temperature is held constant, so it releases heat and its pressure increases while its volume decreases.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.680
That’s path c-d.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.400
The last process is the opposite of the second: it’s adiabatic, so the gas is compressed but its heat doesn’t change.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.160
That makes the gas’s volume decrease and
its pressure increase, like in path d-a.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.480
Its temperature goes back up to the starting
point.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.260
The Carnot engine is the ideal engine, because it produces the most possible work from a given temperature difference.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.840
And because a Carnot engine is as efficient as possible, the high and low temperatures are proportional to the input and exhaust heat.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.289
Which is important, math-wise, because it
means that in the equation for efficiency,

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:10.720
you can replace Q_H and Q_L – the input and exhaust heat – with T_H and T_L – the higher and lower operating temperatures.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.620
Which can help if you don’t know an engine’s input and exhaust heats, but you know its operating temperatures.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.380
So! The ideal efficiency for an engine is equal
to: 1 - its low temperature / its high temperature.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.880
The colder that lower operating temperature is, the more efficient the ideal version of the engine is.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.200
So, say you need an engine to power a life-size
Mario Kart that you’re building for yourself.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.620
You find an engine online, and you’re thinking about buying it, but first you want to know how efficient it is.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.440
The manufacturer’s website says that for every second, the engine’s input heat is 10 kilojoules at 500 Kelvin.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.479
Its exhaust heat is 2 kilojoules at 300 Kelvin.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:51.900
The efficiency equation says that the engine’s efficiency is equal to: 1 - its exhaust heat / its input heat – in this case, 0.8.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.200
That would be a very efficient engine, so
you should be a little suspicious.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.860
I mean, is that kind of efficiency even possible?

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.370
You can find out, by checking the ideal efficiency
of the engine – the Carnot efficiency.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:11.980
The ideal efficiency is equal to: 1 - its lower operating temperature / its higher operating temperature, which in this case is equal to 0.4.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:19.020
It’s impossible for this engine to have an efficiency higher than 0.4, so the manufacturer’s website is...well, just lying.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.540
So you probably shouldn’t buy anything from them anyway.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:28.060
And, actually, you probably wouldn’t want an engine that was close to the efficiency of a Carnot engine, because Carnot engines are very slow.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.659
During those isothermal processes, the temperature
has to be kept constant while heat is transferred

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:36.079
– which only works if the heat is transferred
super slowly.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.080
So the engine has to be really slow.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.300
If you had a Carnot engine in your car, for example, it would take you a whole day to get out of your driveway.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.760
Real-life heat engines are useful, because they use the flow of heat from something warmer to something cooler to produce work.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.860
But what if you want heat to flow from something
cooler to something warmer?

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:58.940
That’s what things like air conditioners and refrigerators do, and they were originally developed using the principles scientists had learned from creating steam engines.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:06.300
These cooling machines are a lot like the opposite of heat engines, in the sense that they use work to make heat flow in the opposite direction that it would normally go.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.040
The refrigerator, for example, passes a cool
liquid through the inside of the fridge.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.060
The liquid absorbs heat – that’s Q_L – as
it evaporates.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.520
Then, the fridge uses a motor to do work on the now-warmer fluid, which has turned into a gas.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:24.620
It’s passed through coils on the outside of the refrigerator, where it releases the exhaust heat – Q_H – and cools to become a liquid again.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.979
Then the cycle starts over.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.020
For heat engines, efficiency is measured by the work produced for a given amount of input heat.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:39.240
And there’s a similar concept for refrigerators: the coefficient of performance, or COP, which is equal to the amount of heat removed from the lower-temperature zone divided by work.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.900
The more heat the fridge removes for a given amount of work, the higher the coefficient of performance.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:49.700
Like we did with the efficiency equation, we can rewrite the COP equation just in terms of Q_L and Q_H.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.660
The coefficient of performance is equal to
Q_L divided by Q_H minus Q_L.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:09:04.300
To find the coefficient of performance for an ideal refrigerator, we do the same thing we did with the ideal Carnot engine: replace Q_L with T_L and Q_H with T_H.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:13.480
So, for an ideal fridge, the coefficient of performance would be equal to: the lower operating temperature, divided by the higher operating temperature minus the lower operating temperature.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.640
And of course, a real-life refrigerator can’t have a higher coefficient of performance than an ideal refrigerator.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.940
Now, it may not be surprising that steam engines
and refrigerators are total opposites.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:30.639
But! Fridges and freezers and air conditioning are all game-changing inventions that were only made possible by our knowledge of steam engines.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.560
Today, you learned about how engines turn thermal energy into work and how to calculate their efficiency.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.410
We also described the Carnot engine.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.800
And finally, we talked about cooling machines,
like refrigerators.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.480
