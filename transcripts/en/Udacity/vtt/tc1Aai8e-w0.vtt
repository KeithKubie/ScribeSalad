00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.930
And to make the map more aesthetically pleasing,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.040
as well as slightly more readable, you can change the color to be more striking.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.940
In this case, setting the fill to be Udacity's orange, and

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.410
adding opacity so that we can see any overlapping circles.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.960
Your last change, is to simply make the stroke of the circles black.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.840
And to make it slightly thinner.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.210
Going back to our map, you can see now that the circles with some opacity,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.120
we can see countries in which the World Cup was held multiple times in,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.110
which might be overlapping.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.390
And while for our data set, the smaller circle always looks like it's on top.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.190
There might arise the issue of larger circles getting on,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.880
drawn on top of smaller circles, even with our opacity.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.680
So again, while for our specific data set,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.980
there doesn't look to be any of these larger circles drawn on top of

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.810
smaller circles hiding them, mostly for the reason we saw in our earlier plots.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.020
Simply, later World Cups had more attendance than earlier World Cups.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.910
In the interest of making our map more robust,

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.890
we want to make sure this will never happen, if we add new data.
