00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
- [Instructor] What we're
gonna do in this video

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:02.938
is think about multiplying, or strategies

00:00:02.938 --> 00:00:05.680
for multiplying numbers that are expressed

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.533
in terms of hundreds,
or thousands, or tens.

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.184
And so we see an example right over here.

00:00:11.184 --> 00:00:13.017
We have 800 times 400.

00:00:14.317 --> 00:00:17.192
Now like always, I encourage
you to pause this video

00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:20.928
and see if you could work
this out on your own.

00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:23.589
Now let's work this through together,

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.067
and I'm going to work it out in a way

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:27.501
that at least my head likes to tackle it.

00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:29.504
Once you get enough practice,
you might even be able

00:00:29.504 --> 00:00:32.192
to do these types of
multiplication problems

00:00:32.192 --> 00:00:35.419
without even needing to use paper.

00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:37.820
So the key realization
here is to say, well look,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.168
this is eight 100s.

00:00:40.168 --> 00:00:43.835
So that's the same thing
as eight times 100.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.896
And this over here is four 100s.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.133
So this is four times 100.

00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:57.925
And so it's eight times
100, times four times 100.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:00.805
And if you're multiplying a
bunch of numbers like this,

00:01:00.805 --> 00:01:02.146
you can switch the order in which

00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:03.841
you're doing the multiplication.

00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:07.258
So you can view this as eight times four.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.347
Eight times four, times 100 times 100.

00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:16.378
Times 100 times 100.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.632
Times 100.

00:01:21.608 --> 00:01:23.490
Now why is this easier?

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.921
Well what is eight times four going to be?

00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:31.821
Well eight times four, if we
know our times tables, is 32.

00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:34.758
And so it's going to be 32 times,

00:01:34.758 --> 00:01:38.081
what's 100 times 100 going to be?

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:40.733
Now there's multiple ways
that you can think about this,

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.220
and I want you to really think it through,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.937
but we'll soon see that
there's a fairly fast way

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:47.606
of making sure we got it right.

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:49.678
But one way to think about it is,

00:01:49.678 --> 00:01:51.553
well let me do it over here.

00:01:51.553 --> 00:01:54.136
10 times 100 is equal to 1,000.

00:01:56.367 --> 00:02:00.836
And so 100 times 100 is
going to be 10 times that,

00:02:00.836 --> 00:02:04.079
or it's going to be equal to 10,000.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.162
So this stuff right over
here is equal to 10,000.

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.128
Now you might notice
something interesting here.

00:02:15.128 --> 00:02:18.663
I have two zeroes, and
then another two zeroes.

00:02:18.663 --> 00:02:20.434
So I have a total of four zeroes.

00:02:20.434 --> 00:02:22.593
And then I have four zeroes here.

00:02:22.593 --> 00:02:25.792
Because every time you multiply by 10

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:27.232
you're gonna add another zero.

00:02:27.232 --> 00:02:29.403
So if you're multiplying by 100
you're gonna add two zeroes.

00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:30.587
If you're multiplying by 1,000,

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:32.872
you're gonna add three
zeroes, and you see that here.

00:02:32.872 --> 00:02:37.039
So you have 32 times 10,000,
which is going to be what?

00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:41.387
Well let's see.

00:02:41.387 --> 00:02:43.970
32 times 1,000 would be 32,000.

00:02:45.578 --> 00:02:48.045
But this is 32 times 10,000.

00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:50.378
So it's going to be 320,000.

00:02:52.747 --> 00:02:56.239
Now you might already notice
an interesting pattern here.

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.353
32 times one followed by four zeroes

00:02:59.353 --> 00:03:01.809
is 32 followed by four zeroes.

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:04.892
This is 32 10,000s, which is 320,000.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.756
Now another was you
could've thought about it

00:03:08.756 --> 00:03:11.756
is eight times four gives us our 32.

00:03:14.765 --> 00:03:19.398
And then we have two zeroes
there, two zeroes there

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:20.988
for a total of four zeroes,

00:03:20.988 --> 00:03:23.885
and we have our four
zeroes right over there.

00:03:23.885 --> 00:03:25.766
Now I don't want you
to just memorize that.

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:28.760
It works because this is eight 100s

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.000
times four 100s.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.154
Eight times four gives us the 32.

00:03:32.154 --> 00:03:34.187
And then the 100 times the 100s,

00:03:34.187 --> 00:03:36.868
that's where these four zeroes come from.

00:03:36.868 --> 00:03:38.951
Let's do another example.

00:03:40.018 --> 00:03:42.685
So let's do, let me delete this.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.527
And let us do, let me get my pen back.

00:03:49.242 --> 00:03:51.242
So let's do 30 times 70,

00:03:54.682 --> 00:03:56.436
or let's do 30 times 700.

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.976
Pause the video and see if
you can figure this out.

00:03:58.976 --> 00:04:00.473
So we can do it like we did before,

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:02.223
30 is three times 10.

00:04:03.374 --> 00:04:04.874
700, so times 700,

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:08.929
which is seven times 100.

00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:15.002
And so if you say three times
seven, is going to be 21

00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:22.088
times 10 times 100, is going to be 1,000.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.437
So what's 21 times 1,000?

00:04:27.437 --> 00:04:30.020
Well that's going to be 21,000.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.087
Now just like we saw before,
once you get a hang of it,

00:04:36.087 --> 00:04:38.758
and I always want you to
understand where it's coming from,

00:04:38.758 --> 00:04:41.091
three times seven is the 21,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.449
and then you're gonna multiply
that times 10 and then 100.

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.673
So you have one, two, three zeroes.

00:04:48.673 --> 00:04:50.590
One, two, three zeroes.

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:53.746
Let's do one more of these.

00:04:53.746 --> 00:04:57.913
So let's say we wanted to
multiply 2,000 times 8,000.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.021
Pause the video and see if you
can figure out what this is.

00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:04.884
Maybe in your head.

00:05:04.884 --> 00:05:06.436
Try to do this one in your head.

00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:08.449
Or on paper, don't feel bad
if you need to use paper.

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.685
That's always prudent.

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.508
Well you might get the hang of it now.

00:05:12.508 --> 00:05:14.284
You might be able to
do this quite quickly.

00:05:14.284 --> 00:05:17.407
You might be able to say
hey, two times eight,

00:05:17.407 --> 00:05:20.268
well that's going to be equal to 16.

00:05:20.268 --> 00:05:21.518
And then I have

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:26.066
three plus three zeroes,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.965
so that's gonna be six zeroes.

00:05:28.965 --> 00:05:32.042
One, two, three, four, five, six,

00:05:32.042 --> 00:05:34.671
which gives me 16 million.

00:05:34.671 --> 00:05:37.214
You would absolutely be correct.

00:05:37.214 --> 00:05:40.006
Now I want to reinforce what you're doing

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:42.680
when you're just counting
zeroes like that.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.788
What you're doing, you're just saying hey,

00:05:43.788 --> 00:05:47.288
this is the same thing as two times 1,000,

00:05:48.603 --> 00:05:50.603
times eight times 1,000.

00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:53.261
Eight times 1,000.

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:57.468
And then you're just changing
the order of multiplication.

00:05:57.468 --> 00:06:01.107
You're saying hey, let me
multiply the two and the eight.

00:06:01.107 --> 00:06:05.297
You multiply the two times
the eight, and you get 16.

00:06:05.297 --> 00:06:08.536
And then you multiply the
times 1,000 times 1,000.

00:06:08.536 --> 00:06:10.786
So times 1,000 times 1,000.

00:06:12.833 --> 00:06:16.488
And 1,000 1,000s, that's one million.

00:06:16.488 --> 00:06:18.876
This is one million right over here.

00:06:18.876 --> 00:06:20.326
And notice you see it there too.

00:06:20.326 --> 00:06:22.833
1,000 times 1,000, you have
three zeroes, three zeroes,

00:06:22.833 --> 00:06:23.712
you get six zeroes.

00:06:23.712 --> 00:06:25.807
1,000 1,000s is a million.

00:06:25.807 --> 00:06:28.557
16 times a million is 16 million.

00:06:30.148 --> 00:06:31.113
So hopefully that helps and makes you

00:06:31.113 --> 00:06:34.247
a little more comfortable
multiplying these numbers

00:06:34.247 --> 00:06:36.262
that are multiples of ten, hundred,

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:38.345
thousands, even millions.
