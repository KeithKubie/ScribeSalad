00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590
with the spot drill and you create a
 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.360
with the spot drill and you create a
small little starter hole and then you

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370
small little starter hole and then you
 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.620
small little starter hole and then you
come in with your actual drill and

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630
come in with your actual drill and
 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.300
come in with your actual drill and
complete the hole the reason for this is

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310
complete the hole the reason for this is
 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.370
complete the hole the reason for this is
it prevents walking without that hole

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380
it prevents walking without that hole
 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.879

it for the next cut and there it is the
 

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:18.020
it for the next cut and there it is the
final so if you can imagine when the

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:18.030
final so if you can imagine when the
 

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.260

little gap between the two parts and
 

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.730
little gap between the two parts and
that's where the cartilage tissue was

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:14.740
that's where the cartilage tissue was
 

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.200
that's where the cartilage tissue was
grown and again it was created with a

can kind of imagine a little hard to see
 

00:18:27.519 --> 00:18:29.789
can kind of imagine a little hard to see
but it would come in here and it would

00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:29.799
but it would come in here and it would
 

00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:33.509
but it would come in here and it would
cut out all these strange shapes coming
