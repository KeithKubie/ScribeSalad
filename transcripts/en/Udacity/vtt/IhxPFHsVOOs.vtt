The web is an extension of
our computing environment,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.740
because most of our daily tasks
involve interaction with the web.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.280
In this lesson,
we'll first reveal how the web works and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.618
discuss its major threat vectors.

00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:18.060
We will then discuss several attacks,
including Cross Site Scripting,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.570
Cross Site Request Forgery and
SQL Injection.
