00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.400
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course World History
and today we’re going to return to medieval times.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.660
Mr. Green? Mr. Green? Finally, we get to watch
jousting and eat with our hands and root for

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.760
the Blue Knight.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.230
Yeah, No, Me from the Past, for starters,
Medieval Times doesn't closely reflect Europe

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.590
in medieval times. And furthermore, we’re
not going to be talking about Europe in medieval

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.339
times, although we will be talking about kings
and courts and aristocratic intrigue, but

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.019
we're gonna be talking about all those things
in Japan.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.780
So discussions of Japanese history often focus
on the Tokugawa period because it's got ninja

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.360
and samurai, but much of the foundation of
Japanese culture dates to the Heian period

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.520
between 782 and 1167 CE.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.760
And when I say Japanese culture, I do mean
culture, because the achievements of the Heian

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.640
period were primarily artistic, especially
in literature. So for most of this episode,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.840
we'll be looking at cultural history as opposed
to like economic or political history.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.380
As a novelist, and also a consumer of culture,
I'm a big fan of cultural history. What I

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.450
love about it is that it embraces the human
imagination. I mean, you can't just make up

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.439
economic theories. Just kidding, you can.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.710
Anyway, for our purposes, Heian culture is
the high culture of the upper-upper-class

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.780
aristocracy, and obviously focusing on this
tiny sliver of the upper class leaves out

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.770
the experience of most Japanese people. But
we know a lot more about the elite than we

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.170
know about everyone else because it was the
elite who were doing all of the writing things

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.170
down and they were writing about the people
they found the most interesting - themselves.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.319
In fact one of the reasons we know a great
deal about the Heian aristocracy is because

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.619
of Japan's first great novel: The Tale of
the Genji, by Lady Murasaki Shikibu. Now the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.039
historian James Murdoch called the Heian aristocracy

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.880
"An ever-pullulating brood of greedy, needy,
frivolous dilletanti - as often as not foully

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.980
licentious, utterly effeminate, incapable
of any worthy achievement".

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.700
But when you boil all the unnecessarily fancy
words out of that quote, that sounds like

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.939
people I'm very interested in learning about.
In fact, I love some fallicentuousness.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.780
So one of the first things we learn from texts
about the Heian aristocracy is that the aristocracy

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.010
was dominated by a craze for things Chinese.
Now Chinese visitors to Japan thought the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.209
country was backwards and out of the way and
uncivilized.

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.269
But one of the reasons the Japanese seemed
backwards to Chinese visitors is that the

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.470
Japanese in the 10th century admired Tang
China, which had flourished a couple of hundred

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.640
years earlier. But there was also the fact
that the Japanese blended Chinese ideas, especially

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.209
Chinese Buddhism, with native traditions.

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.340
In fact one of the most interesting aspects
of Heian Japan was the overall attitude of

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.280
the aristocracy, which was characterized by
a love of color, and grandeur, and ceremony,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.299
and ritual, that was tinged with some Buddhist-inspired
ideas. You know, it's sort of like how everyone

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.970
in Canada wears powdered wigs and knee breeches
to look like 18th century England.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.129
And one of the central ideas in Buddhism is
that everything beautiful, and also everything

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.430
not beautiful, is fleeting. Like historian
Ivan Morris wrote that in the literature of

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.719
the time, there was a quote "feeling that
the familiar order of things will soon come

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.370
to an end." Which by the way is always an
appropriate feeling.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.200
So the center of aristocratic court life was
the capital, Heian Jyo, which during the Heian

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.349
golden age may have had a populations as high
as 100,000 people, making it much larger than

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.849
most European cities at the time. It may have
been a glorious capital but we don’t really

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.369
know because most of the city was destroyed
by earthquakes, or possibly fires, or possibly

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:28.640
wars, or just the desire for new construction.
We're not sure.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.200
We also know that the Heian aristocracy was
rigidly hierarchical, with society divided

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.430
into about 30 grades based on one's birth.
The top 4 grades were reserved for princes,

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.510
and the top 3, known as the Kugyō, received
all the most important privileges, including

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.920
governmental posts and revenues from special
rice land.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.760
These people in the highest ranks could send
their children to university, wear ceremonial

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.640
dress, they were given lighter punishments
when they committed crimes. Can you imagine

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.569
a world in which rich people systemically
receive lighter sentences for crimes committed

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.609
than poor people?

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.469
These rules were so detailed that they even
determined what type of fan you could hold.

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:07.560
The top 3 ranks got to hold 25-fold fans.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.459
But when The Tale of the Genji was written,
this rank system, like all those ranks, applied

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:18.090
to less than 1/10th of 1% of the total population,
so we’re really talking about the elites.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.109
As Ivan Morris put it:

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.590
"Members of the upper class are almost all
related to each other. They are totally uninterested

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.530
in everyone outside their charmed circle and
exceedingly sensitive in judging the precise

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.590
social level of each person who does belong.
In Murasaki's milieu, to determine a person's

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.009
milieu was no simple diversion, but a matter
of overriding importance."

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.520
Now that description reminds me a lot of my
high school experience.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.220
Aristocrats dominated the government, which
over time became more and more ceremonial

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.639
and ritualistic. In fact by the 10th century,
much government work was carried out at night

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.430
and consisted almost entirely of ceremonies.
The nice thing about doing boring ceremonial

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.500
work at night though: there was a lot of wine.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.360
So yeah, that doesn't make for like, excellent
government efficiency. Heian Japan's economy

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.550
was not much better than its governance. There
was very little trade and attempted land reform,

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.050
which was supposed to grant every citizen
a parcel of public domain land, totally failed.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.080
Meanwhile, aristocrats accumulated vast agricultural
land holdings, and by the 10th century court

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.120
nobles were largely supported by these tax-free
estates called manors. Now interestingly,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.330
the nobles didn't technically own the land
outright, as they did in much of Europe. Instead

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.800
they owned the rights to income from the land
and then those rights could be transferred

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.360
to their heirs, so it was similar to ownership,
but it wasn't quite ownership.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.820
Also different from Europe: upper-class Japanese
women could hold the rights to a manor, and

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.020
thus have a rather impressive degree of economic
power. And that matters a lot because women

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.270
played a key role in the flourishing of Heian
literary culture that makes this period of

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.819
history so interesting to study in the first
place.

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:53.819
Like over all this inefficient corrupt cronyism
of Japan's government and economy definitely

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:58.720
weakened this state. But it also provided
time and money for the aristocracy to make

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.060
beautiful and interesting things.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.550
Let's go to the Thought Bubble. Heian aristocrats
were expected to feel melancholy over the

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.980
transience of existence.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.580
"In Murasaki's time," according to Ivan Morris
"periodical protestations of melancholy and

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.580
gloom were essential for people who regarded
themselves as sensitive," and sensitivity

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.879
especially to art was the hallmark of aristocratic
breeding. The aristocratic gentleman is exemplified

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:26.960
by prince Genji himself: quote "With his gentle
nature, his sensitivity and his wide range

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.250
of artistic skills, who represented the ideal
of the age and who set the tone for the social

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.539
and cultural life of the good people"

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:39.680
Buddhism was very influential on the aristocrats
aesthetic ideal that beauty must be cultivated

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.240
because it is so impermanent. This quote from
the tale of Genji illustrates this focus on

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.220
impermanence: "'Like the waterfowl that play
there on the lake, I too am floating along

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.129
the surface of a transient world' I could
not help comparing them with myself. For they

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:58.830
too appeared to be enjoying themselves in
the most carefree fashion; yet their lives

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:59.940
must be full of sorrow."

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.310
Stan, are you sure that's from the tale of
Genji? I think I've seen that quote attributed

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.810
to me on Tumblr. But we don't only know about
the emotional state of the aristocracy, we

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:13.009
also know about their pastimes. We refer to
nobles as the leisure class for a reason after

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:16.940
all, they spent a lot of time playing games,
and engaging in contests.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.979
Poetry contests were popular, as were board
games, like Go, and much of their time was

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:23.229
taken up with ceremonies and rituals.

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:28.199
Here is an example from the court calendar:
"18th day: Bowman's Wager, the new year's

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:33.060
celebrations are concluded by an archery contest
which is held in his majesties presence between

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.520
officers of the inner and middle palace guards.
This is followed by a banquet during which

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.030
court dances are performed and prizes awarded
to the winning side. Members of the losing

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.439
side are forced to drink the cup of defeat."

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:47.349
Thanks, Thought Bubble. I'd like to make an
announcement here at Crash Course from now

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:52.300
on whenever we refer to anyone losing anything
we will say that they were forced to drink

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.500
from the cup of defeat.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:59.599
So you know other than pure Game of Thrones
style drama, this highly ritualized very insular

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:03.359
social order of the elites of the elites of
the elites isn't usually the kind of stuff

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.760
we'd study at Crash Course.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.360
But first, thinking about the lives of the
Heian aristocracy tells us something about

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.729
the lives of the rich and powerful generally.
Like obviously they had to increasingly separate

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:15.849
themselves from each other to feel more and
more wealthy and powerful.

00:08:15.849 --> 00:08:20.470
Which progressively led to them being more
and more separated from, you know, the vast,

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:25.669
vast majority of people living in Japan. But
also they produced and consumed cultural artifacts

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:30.590
that came to define the style of the age but
also have continued to shape culture.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:35.940
Heian aristocracy and the documents that describe
it tell us a lot about women, who as we've

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.669
seen are often left out of historical narratives.
The Heian period, at least culturally, was

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:44.930
dominated by women, particularly Murasaki
Shikibu and Sei Shōnagon.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:49.540
So in some ways at least, unlike almost everything
we've studied, our view of the period is dominated

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.160
by women's perspectives, although it is the
perspective of the most privileged women.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.320
And what we see is consistent with a lot of
upper-class mores: these women are obsessed

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.010
with their looks, and especially with their
clothes which were cumbersome and heavy. They

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.390
were expected to wear their hair very long,
preferably reaching to the ground. They had

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:11.560
to powder their faces and blacken their teeth
and they lived the circumscribed lives typical

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.779
of upper-class women throughout the world.

00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:17.290
Although there were some legal protections
that they enjoyed: like we talked about how

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.170
they could have income from property. Laws
also protected them from physical violence,

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.430
specifically prohibiting a husband from beating
his wife, which might not sound like that

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.470
big of a deal but compared to women's lives
in Europe, that was a big improvement.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.380
And upper-class women in Heian Japan were
all literate and educated, although their

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.730
education was limited to the types of cultural
skills that would make them attractive to

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:43.160
men: poetry, music, calligraphy, maybe some
literature. Disciplines like history and law

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.510
and philosophy were mostly off limits.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.519
And that brings me to something I want to
talk about: all of these privileges: from

00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:53.110
the heavy, cumbersome clothes that make it
difficult to move to the kinds of education

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:57.730
women could have or the kinds of limited legal
protections they could have, all of that is

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.339
evidence of a patriarchy.

00:09:59.339 --> 00:10:03.100
So we see through these women's stories the
way that they were able to express themselves

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.529
and their philosophies and the way that they
lived in the world. So women like Murasaki

00:10:07.529 --> 00:10:11.740
Shikibu lived constrained, cloistered lives,
but of course there were opportunities available

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:15.029
to them that weren't available to men. And
that's what's so exciting about being able

00:10:15.029 --> 00:10:19.560
to read their narratives. We just don't have
many equivalents to that in Europe at the time.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.580
That noted, these women, like their male counterparts,
spent most of their lives indoors, and communicated

00:10:24.589 --> 00:10:29.870
mostly by intermediaries or letters. Women
couldn't show themselves to men or make conversation

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:34.120
with them. But there was a great deal of interest
and intrigue around love and romance, not

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:39.420
least because Heian gentlemen were expected to be
polygamous and also to engage in extramarital affairs.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.400
But just because sexual relations were often
divorced from marriage and love affairs were

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.860
common doesn't mean that they lacked emotional
consequences. In the stories you read about

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:53.170
Heian Japan everybody is always worried that
they're going to like, fall out of favor with

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:59.019
their lover or their husband or their whatever.
It's so exciting! To read about, I mean, I'm

00:10:59.019 --> 00:11:01.359
sure if you're living inside of it it would
make you very anxious.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.280
Also when courtship and marriage had political
dimensions, as they did in the highest noble

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.200
ranks, women were often in danger of being
displaced by a more advantageous match.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.370
And we know from the stories that all of this
combined into pangs of jealousy and fear of

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.720
being abandoned and then pain when you actually
were abandoned. And those kinds of stories,

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.040
I'm sure I don't have to tell you, have a
kind of universality about them.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.660
The last thing I want to say here is that
power works differently when you're not in

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.520
power, right? Like if you're a student in
a high school classroom the teacher has the

00:11:29.529 --> 00:11:31.620
power, but you have some power.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:36.000
And the most interesting thing about the stories
from the Heian aristocracy is the ways that women

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.860
used the power that they did have to bring about
change in their own lives and in their communities.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.820
So by looking at history through the lens
of literature we get a very different perspective

00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:50.779
than if we were to focus on government documents,
or archaeology, or descriptions of war. This

00:11:50.779 --> 00:11:55.350
helps us to try to develop a sense of how
people at the time felt, although we're only

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.970
dealing with a very limited group of people,
obviously.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:02.550
The cultural achievements of the Heian Period,
described and exemplified by The Tale of Genji,

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:06.699
were considerable, especially when compared
to what Europeans were accomplishing at the

00:12:06.699 --> 00:12:10.359
time. And it's another reminder that we need
to be careful when we talk about the 9th and

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.680
10th centuries as the Dark Ages.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.500
It's also interesting that the Heian Period
in Japan wasn't particularly successful politically

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.699
or economically, but that it did lead to great
cultural achievements. And almost all of the

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:26.110
literary achievements were made by women,
which as Morris points out is "a rare, if

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.620
not unique, phenomenon in cultural history."

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.820
For Heian Japan the historical record was
written primarily by women. And while The

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.459
Tale of Genji doesn't discuss politics or
economics the way that we usually imagine

00:12:36.459 --> 00:12:41.220
them, and while it describes a world that
leaves out 99% of Japanese people during the

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.949
period, it has a lot to tell us about the
way that at least some people felt and lived,

00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:47.310
which is more than can be said for a lot of
history books.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.329
And that's a type of history that most of
us can relate to more than stuff with generals

00:12:51.329 --> 00:12:55.149
and kings in it. For instance when I look
at the history of my own life I find that

00:12:55.149 --> 00:13:01.289
generals and kings have played a very minor
role. Jealously on the other hand: not insignificant.

00:13:01.289 --> 00:13:03.340
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.699
Crash Course is filmed here in the Chad &amp; Stacey
Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis. Thank you

00:13:06.699 --> 00:13:10.079
for watching and as we say in my hometown:
don't forget to be awesome.
