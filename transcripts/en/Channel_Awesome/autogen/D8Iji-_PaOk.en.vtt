we get this out it's a sync pattern so
the thing we're talking about today is

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720
the thing we're talking about today is
 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.540
the thing we're talking about today is
about shoving the shield the idea of

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550
about shoving the shield the idea of
 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.190
about shoving the shield the idea of
taking a massive force and moving that

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200
taking a massive force and moving that
 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.320
taking a massive force and moving that
force away to create some distance he

one took a little bit of what we call
 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.880
one took a little bit of what we call
the bash or the smash what happens when

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890
the bash or the smash what happens when
 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.979
the bash or the smash what happens when
he swings the shield and how do we swing

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989
he swings the shield and how do we swing
 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.930
he swings the shield and how do we swing
that effectively finally look at what

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940
that effectively finally look at what
 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.949
that effectively finally look at what
happens when he hits you with the edge

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959
happens when he hits you with the edge
 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.680
happens when he hits you with the edge
of the shield which is nasty business

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690
of the shield which is nasty business
 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.990
of the shield which is nasty business
and then we're trying to take a look at

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000
and then we're trying to take a look at
 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.190
and then we're trying to take a look at
the old shield throw and see how that

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200
the old shield throw and see how that
 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.630
the old shield throw and see how that
goes soon Captain America uses the

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640
goes soon Captain America uses the
 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.340
goes soon Captain America uses the
shield shove it seems quite effortless

shield shove it seems quite effortless
 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.590
shield shove it seems quite effortless
the fact that matter is it wouldn't be

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600
the fact that matter is it wouldn't be

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.030
from the bashing video that we use our
whole body so we're gonna take our body

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040
whole body so we're gonna take our body
 

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.050

we're gonna think about swing it like a

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:25.090
we're gonna think about swing it like a
 

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:26.850
we're gonna think about swing it like a
baseball bat sideways whenever your way

back and unwind hard now the trick is

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:29.950
back and unwind hard now the trick is
 

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.040
back and unwind hard now the trick is
this we've remembered that there's gonna

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.050
this we've remembered that there's gonna
 

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.200
this we've remembered that there's gonna
be quite a bit of an Ursa on the outside

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:34.210
be quite a bit of an Ursa on the outside
 

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.300
be quite a bit of an Ursa on the outside
of this and we don't want to swing so

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:36.310
of this and we don't want to swing so
 

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.400
of this and we don't want to swing so
hard that we pop our own collarbone out

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:38.410
hard that we pop our own collarbone out
 

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.140
hard that we pop our own collarbone out
right or that we take our arm out of

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:40.150
right or that we take our arm out of
 

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.940
right or that we take our arm out of
socket okay or we just wrench our arm

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:41.950
socket okay or we just wrench our arm
 

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.040
socket okay or we just wrench our arm
around so it's here and then send it

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:44.050
around so it's here and then send it
 

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.140
around so it's here and then send it
like to be specific if I just completely

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:46.150
like to be specific if I just completely
 

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.420
like to be specific if I just completely
open I'm gonna go past my shoulder axis

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:48.430
open I'm gonna go past my shoulder axis
 

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.730
open I'm gonna go past my shoulder axis
and can torque my back okay that's not

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:50.740
and can torque my back okay that's not
 

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.800
and can torque my back okay that's not
fun no one likes that so here we go

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:52.810
fun no one likes that so here we go
 

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.680
fun no one likes that so here we go
cocked and send it to the camera boom

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:54.690
cocked and send it to the camera boom
 

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.690
cocked and send it to the camera boom
yeah so what we have is this edge making

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:57.700
yeah so what we have is this edge making
 

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.760
yeah so what we have is this edge making
a lot of impact and the question is can

00:09:59.760 --> 00:09:59.770
a lot of impact and the question is can
 

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.490
a lot of impact and the question is can
it really do that much damage only one

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:02.500
it really do that much damage only one
 

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.280
it really do that much damage only one
way to find out

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:05.290
 
 

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.080
 
so we're about to see if we can indeed

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.090
so we're about to see if we can indeed
 

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.560
so we're about to see if we can indeed
take the edge of this to a watermelon to

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:10.570
take the edge of this to a watermelon to
 

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.240
take the edge of this to a watermelon to
see what happens now remember let's just

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:12.250
see what happens now remember let's just
 

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.170
see what happens now remember let's just
talk a couple seconds about the

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:13.180
talk a couple seconds about the
 

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.630
talk a couple seconds about the
watermelon as a forensic topic as a

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640
watermelon as a forensic topic as a
 

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.050
watermelon as a forensic topic as a
problem can use the human skull is again

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:19.060
problem can use the human skull is again
 

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.240
problem can use the human skull is again

the brain has a brain tissue around it

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:23.020
the brain has a brain tissue around it
 

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.410

there the skull and it's thickest point

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:25.420
there the skull and it's thickest point
 

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.540
there the skull and it's thickest point
it's doing a centimeter thick right it's

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:27.550
it's doing a centimeter thick right it's
 

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.970
it's doing a centimeter thick right it's
not too thick the watermelon is about an

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:29.980
not too thick the watermelon is about an
 

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.410
not too thick the watermelon is about an
inch thick so there's a little

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:31.420
inch thick so there's a little
 

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.640
inch thick so there's a little
difference there but of course has a bit

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:32.650
difference there but of course has a bit
 

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.410
difference there but of course has a bit
of a give the one thing we're missing to

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:34.420
of a give the one thing we're missing to

make this proper would be skin in a

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:36.220
make this proper would be skin in a
 

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.500
make this proper would be skin in a
perfect world we cover this like in a

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:37.510
perfect world we cover this like in a
 

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.420
perfect world we cover this like in a
fruit roll-up that would allow for skin

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:39.430
fruit roll-up that would allow for skin
 

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.830

it's gonna have slippage and that's

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:40.840
it's gonna have slippage and that's
 

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.450
it's gonna have slippage and that's
gonna change your impact upon what

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:42.460
gonna change your impact upon what
 

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:42.870
gonna change your impact upon what
you're hitting

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880

that said it should just be a really

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:44.830
that said it should just be a really
 

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.050
that said it should just be a really
good time so we're gonna see what

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:46.060
good time so we're gonna see what
 

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.910
good time so we're gonna see what
happens take it away

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920
happens take it away

at all to think about if you really put

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720
at all to think about if you really put
 

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.300
at all to think about if you really put
some torque into it how much damage you

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:18.310
some torque into it how much damage you
 

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.120
some torque into it how much damage you
could do again this is a pretty decent

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.130
could do again this is a pretty decent
 

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.370

anyone else um so it leaves you

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:30.460
anyone else um so it leaves you

anyone else um so it leaves you
vulnerable to attack from all the guys

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:31.930
vulnerable to attack from all the guys

said it's pretty fun and it looks great

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:39.550
said it's pretty fun and it looks great
 

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.490
said it's pretty fun and it looks great
so let's take a look at whether or not

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:41.500
so let's take a look at whether or not
 

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.680
so let's take a look at whether or not
we can throw the shield at just at all

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:43.690
we can throw the shield at just at all
 

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.600
we can throw the shield at just at all
to start with the question is of course

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:45.610
to start with the question is of course
 

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.770
to start with the question is of course
we can accuracy entirely dependable run

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:49.780
we can accuracy entirely dependable run
 

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.300
we can accuracy entirely dependable run

with her my right but I'm targeting with
 

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.130
with her my right but I'm targeting with
my left hand so it's interesting to

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:28.140
my left hand so it's interesting to
 

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:28.970
my left hand so it's interesting to
think about him being right-handed

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:28.980
think about him being right-handed
 

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.250
think about him being right-handed
because we target on the left side which

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260
because we target on the left side which

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:35.190
this his target eyes and change to his
 

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.160
this his target eyes and change to his
left side so it's possible that he

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:37.170
left side so it's possible that he
 

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.260
left side so it's possible that he
actually might throw it here to target

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:39.270
actually might throw it here to target
 

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.390
