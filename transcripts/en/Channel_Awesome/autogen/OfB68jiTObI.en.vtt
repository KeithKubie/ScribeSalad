00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:28.369 align:start position:0%
things okay I guess I could do a few
 

00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:29.739 align:start position:0%
things okay I guess I could do a few
night<00:08:28.550><c> thing</c><00:08:28.699><c> but</c><00:08:28.849><c> it's</c><00:08:28.999><c> she</c><00:08:29.419><c> very</c>

00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:29.749 align:start position:0%
night thing but it's she very
 

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:33.189 align:start position:0%
night thing but it's she very
begrudgingly<00:08:30.679><c> does</c><00:08:31.519><c> all</c><00:08:31.789><c> this</c><00:08:31.999><c> so</c><00:08:32.899><c> it</c><00:08:32.990><c> kind</c><00:08:33.169><c> of</c>

00:08:33.189 --> 00:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
begrudgingly does all this so it kind of
 

00:08:33.199 --> 00:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
begrudgingly does all this so it kind of
makes<00:08:33.380><c> sense</c><00:08:33.409><c> that</c><00:08:33.680><c> she</c><00:08:33.800><c> would</c><00:08:33.949><c> be</c><00:08:34.159><c> like</c><00:08:34.639><c> that</c>

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:34.849 align:start position:0%
makes sense that she would be like that
 

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
