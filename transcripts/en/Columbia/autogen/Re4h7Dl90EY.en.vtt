00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:24.190
 
like I guess they're quite poor survive

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200
 
 

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:33.420
 
like

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:33.430
 
 

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:36.790
 
no I would say it's not at odds with it

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800
no I would say it's not at odds with it
 

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.830
no I would say it's not at odds with it
at all this study was designed to study

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:41.840
at all this study was designed to study
 

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:46.720
at all this study was designed to study
black women it we were not black men

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:46.730
black women it we were not black men
 

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.000
black women it we were not black men
were not a part of this study except as

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:49.010
were not a part of this study except as
 

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.370
were not a part of this study except as
they related to black women the

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:51.380
they related to black women the
 

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:54.220
they related to black women the
Sojourner syndrome does not suggest at

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:54.230
Sojourner syndrome does not suggest at
 

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.730
Sojourner syndrome does not suggest at
all that men are not involved in

00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:57.740
all that men are not involved in
 

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:00.609
all that men are not involved in
assisting with the survival of the black

00:38:00.609 --> 00:38:00.619
assisting with the survival of the black
 

00:38:00.619 --> 00:38:03.190
assisting with the survival of the black
community in fact all of the research we

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200
community in fact all of the research we
 

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.040
community in fact all of the research we
did really documents the participation

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:06.050
did really documents the participation
 

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:10.240
did really documents the participation
of men and kinship groups etc it is the

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:10.250
of men and kinship groups etc it is the
 

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.730
of men and kinship groups etc it is the
case however that with the prison

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:12.740
case however that with the prison
 

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.800
case however that with the prison
industrial complex this certainly fewer

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:14.810
industrial complex this certainly fewer
 

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:18.700
industrial complex this certainly fewer
men around that can participate in these

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:18.710
men around that can participate in these
 

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:23.109
men around that can participate in these
networks but our view was that the

00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119
networks but our view was that the
 

00:38:23.119 --> 00:38:26.650
networks but our view was that the
Sojourner complex was named such because

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:26.660
Sojourner complex was named such because
 

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.900
Sojourner complex was named such because
we were dealing with women but this in

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:28.910
we were dealing with women but this in
 

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:32.859
we were dealing with women but this in
no way suggests in it suggests in any

00:38:32.859 --> 00:38:32.869
no way suggests in it suggests in any
 

00:38:32.869 --> 00:38:36.790
no way suggests in it suggests in any
sense that men are not involved in these

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800
sense that men are not involved in these
 

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:46.910
sense that men are not involved in these
processes as well yes

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920
 
 

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.490
 
that in different words like a strong

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:50.500
that in different words like a strong
 

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.099
that in different words like a strong
black box

00:38:54.099 --> 00:38:54.109
 
 

00:38:54.109 --> 00:39:00.110
 
and I'm not just in time

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:00.120
 
 

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.900
 
that women in general are socialized to

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:02.910
that women in general are socialized to
 

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:05.840
that women in general are socialized to
the to fulfill certain gender ideal

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:05.850
the to fulfill certain gender ideal
 

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:08.360
the to fulfill certain gender ideal
just like play with baby dolls we're

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:08.370
just like play with baby dolls we're
 

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:10.310
just like play with baby dolls we're
already socialized to be mothers you

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320
already socialized to be mothers you
 

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.180
already socialized to be mothers you
know

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:11.190
know
 

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:17.780
know
a curious do you believe that that life

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:17.790
a curious do you believe that that life
 

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.380
a curious do you believe that that life
can end this

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:19.390
can end this
 

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:26.900
can end this
ocean rises and young age to

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:26.910
 
 

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:29.870
 
yeah I I think I hear what you're saying

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880
yeah I I think I hear what you're saying
 

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.370
yeah I I think I hear what you're saying
one of the things that the centers for

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:32.380
one of the things that the centers for
 

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.219
one of the things that the centers for
disease control was concerned with is

00:39:35.219 --> 00:39:35.229
disease control was concerned with is
 

00:39:35.229 --> 00:39:39.289
disease control was concerned with is
the fact that black women across class

00:39:39.289 --> 00:39:39.299
the fact that black women across class
 

00:39:39.299 --> 00:39:43.499
the fact that black women across class
had higher rates of infant mortality low

00:39:43.499 --> 00:39:43.509
had higher rates of infant mortality low
 

00:39:43.509 --> 00:39:45.690
had higher rates of infant mortality low
birth weight babies and infant mortality

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:45.700
birth weight babies and infant mortality
 

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.749
birth weight babies and infant mortality
than white women and so the question

00:39:48.749 --> 00:39:48.759
than white women and so the question
 

00:39:48.759 --> 00:39:50.969
than white women and so the question
they asked is if this occurs across

00:39:50.969 --> 00:39:50.979
they asked is if this occurs across
 

00:39:50.979 --> 00:39:55.079
they asked is if this occurs across
class and you say as an anthropologist

00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:55.089
class and you say as an anthropologist
 

00:39:55.089 --> 00:39:57.660
class and you say as an anthropologist
there's no such thing as race than what

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:57.670
there's no such thing as race than what
 

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.900
there's no such thing as race than what
is it so what we attempted to do was to

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:00.910
is it so what we attempted to do was to
 

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:03.989
is it so what we attempted to do was to
really demonstrate what are the issues

00:40:03.989 --> 00:40:03.999
really demonstrate what are the issues
 

00:40:03.999 --> 00:40:07.680
really demonstrate what are the issues
that affect black women across class and

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:07.690
that affect black women across class and
 

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:09.569
that affect black women across class and
they and certainly they affect them in

00:40:09.569 --> 00:40:09.579
they and certainly they affect them in
 

00:40:09.579 --> 00:40:11.209
they and certainly they affect them in
different ways in different

00:40:11.209 --> 00:40:11.219
different ways in different
 

00:40:11.219 --> 00:40:16.049
different ways in different
socio-economic strata having documented

00:40:16.049 --> 00:40:16.059
socio-economic strata having documented
 

00:40:16.059 --> 00:40:22.440
socio-economic strata having documented
all of that um the conclusion is not I

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:22.450
all of that um the conclusion is not I
 

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:24.839
all of that um the conclusion is not I
think that black women should not do

00:40:24.839 --> 00:40:24.849
think that black women should not do
 

00:40:24.849 --> 00:40:28.499
think that black women should not do
these things but I think it's important

00:40:28.499 --> 00:40:28.509
these things but I think it's important
 

00:40:28.509 --> 00:40:30.959
these things but I think it's important
that women be conscious of what they're

00:40:30.959 --> 00:40:30.969
that women be conscious of what they're
 

00:40:30.969 --> 00:40:33.630
that women be conscious of what they're
doing and so very often when I've spoken

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.640
doing and so very often when I've spoken
 

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.989
doing and so very often when I've spoken
to black women especially middle stratum

00:40:36.989 --> 00:40:36.999
to black women especially middle stratum
 

00:40:36.999 --> 00:40:39.059
to black women especially middle stratum
black women it resonates with them

00:40:39.059 --> 00:40:39.069
black women it resonates with them
 

00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:41.579
black women it resonates with them
because they are not conscious of the

00:40:41.579 --> 00:40:41.589
because they are not conscious of the
 

00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:43.380
because they are not conscious of the
fact for example that they're doing kin

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:43.390
fact for example that they're doing kin
 

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:45.329
fact for example that they're doing kin
work that they're holding together

00:40:45.329 --> 00:40:45.339
work that they're holding together
 

00:40:45.339 --> 00:40:47.910
work that they're holding together
networks that they're doing things on so

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920
networks that they're doing things on so
 

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.739
networks that they're doing things on so
many different levels because they just

00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:49.749
many different levels because they just
 

00:40:49.749 --> 00:40:51.779
many different levels because they just
do it automatically I think it's

00:40:51.779 --> 00:40:51.789
do it automatically I think it's
 

00:40:51.789 --> 00:40:55.670
do it automatically I think it's
important to be conscious of it and to

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680
important to be conscious of it and to
 

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.640
important to be conscious of it and to
work in such a way that deals with the

00:40:59.640 --> 00:40:59.650
work in such a way that deals with the
 

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.459
work in such a way that deals with the
causes of ill health as part of the

00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:02.469
causes of ill health as part of the
 

00:41:02.469 --> 00:41:04.469
causes of ill health as part of the
social structure rather than as

00:41:04.469 --> 00:41:04.479
social structure rather than as
 

00:41:04.479 --> 00:41:07.529
social structure rather than as
individual failings so when people see

00:41:07.529 --> 00:41:07.539
individual failings so when people see
 

00:41:07.539 --> 00:41:09.930
individual failings so when people see
well it's not me it's really a whole

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:09.940
well it's not me it's really a whole
 

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.670
well it's not me it's really a whole
structure of things out there and this

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680
structure of things out there and this
 

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.400
structure of things out there and this
is a common problem among black women I

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:14.410
is a common problem among black women I
 

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.459
is a common problem among black women I
think the the way in which people

00:41:16.459 --> 00:41:16.469
think the the way in which people
 

00:41:16.469 --> 00:41:19.200
think the the way in which people
address that then is very different

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:19.210
address that then is very different
 

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.809
address that then is very different
rather than address it individually you

00:41:21.809 --> 00:41:21.819
rather than address it individually you
 

00:41:21.819 --> 00:41:25.099
rather than address it individually you
may want to address it collectively I

00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:25.109
may want to address it collectively I
 

00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:27.780
may want to address it collectively I
think that's it okay

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:27.790
think that's it okay
 

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:30.720
think that's it okay
alright then dr. Mullins for a great

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:30.730
alright then dr. Mullins for a great
 

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:32.910
alright then dr. Mullins for a great
presentation
