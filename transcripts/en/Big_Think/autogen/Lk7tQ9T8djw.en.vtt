00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.719
 especialy by man who won the election 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.120
 and so alpha mailed time has been used 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.309
 over and over ns some very narrow sen 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.109
 such as be used in so and cochlea 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.660
 the innermost darkest 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.300
 well for that is what after two lee what that 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.699
 all families about and symbian bacon 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.070

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.160
 chimpanzee society b in bing and jump 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.190
 there is get to know the bath and cuff tab 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.720
 cuff the use the distinguished tab 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.030
 can be case through its icons' 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.590
 he can go through the bully's 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.900
 ones who fight and everybody and 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.320
 terrorizing stage offers him about the 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.420
 it and winds bankrupt and simon and the 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.390
 leaders despair 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.900
 the ones who mediate conflict make sense 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.520
 step conflict dr control in thief chips 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.220
 someone is the stress because they are just a 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.930
 fighter whatever diggle about the 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.360
 and guys and site you can see that 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.700
 small role as if I simply go to the poll 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.040
 village then has been destroyed by and 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.680
 earthquake or the president will go to a 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.750
 place that is heard by harry kane 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.220
 so the console there in sifrol is extremely 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.410
 important 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.590
 and the mediation role of or settling 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.320
 sites and keeping the unity on the group 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.870
 basically the unify there on the group is a 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.000
 very important role is and so is me 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.370
 a leader site the bully's usually and 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.560
 poorly in the world who haven't 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.830
 chimpanzees who blew it you can take 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.520
 game rates apply to the group and i 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.610
 think there or a last last few years 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.070
 as far as smooth and grahl family was one of 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.230
 them in the waal last it before 12 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.360
 yrs and and brass by who are they 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.820
 smeels some time can be in power for 12 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.610
 years is because the group's let the 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.620
 group like voice and so fat group 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.110
 hey snowy are between gates challenger 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.850
 is that they are challenger coming along the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.319
 challenges that all formal in this very 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.020
 good leader 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.850
 d the event can give him the keepin empower them 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.860
 will fail democratically mechanically 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.270
 right there and if it's a boy 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.490
 then the forcing do this or this 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.010
 challenger your supporter challenger and such 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.110
 that's why if such a chimpanzee society 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.290
 the alpha mail very often i it is me 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.970
 leader and is a June fire and think 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.420
 it's always very important if people 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:05.040
 we use the position of alpha mail to 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.280
 bing the stumps, the minister voted the bios 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.280
