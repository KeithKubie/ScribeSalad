00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:05.740
The Truth About Diamonds

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:16.890
An expensive meal at a fancy restaurant, a
declaration of romance, and a big, fat diamond

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.550
ring- this is a pretty standard formula for
an engagement proposal.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.899
After all, it has been ingrained in all of
us that a diamond ring equals love and the

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.140
bigger the diamond, the more love there must
be.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.320
Well, believe it or not, diamonds really aren’t
all that rare.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.239
In fact, the reason diamonds cost so much
is more due to savvy (and sometimes unethical)

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.969
business practices and incredibly successful
advertising campaigns than the actual inherent

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.530
value of the stone based on supply and demand,
something anyone who has actually tried to

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.410
sell a diamond quickly comes to realize.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.399
Here now is the story of how and why we all
fell in love with diamonds.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.210
The first known diamonds discovered by humans
happened about 700 or 800 BCE in India by

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.300
the Dravidian people (who are still found
today in southern India and Sri Lanka).

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.050
In fact, this is where we get the unit of
weight for diamonds, carats, from; they would

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.140
weigh the diamonds in relation to the seeds
of carob tree.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.240
Diamonds appear in ancient tales dating back
to at least 2500 years ago, including ones

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.259
involving Alexander the Great and Sinbad the
Sailor.

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.270
Pliny the Elder, in his 78 AD encyclopedia
Natural History, also spoke of diamonds.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.960
Eastern traders brought them to Europe, along
with silk, spices, and other exotic goods,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.770
and they were used as valuable trade items.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.530
But those ancient diamonds weren’t the stunning,
brilliantly cut stones we know today.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.159
They were dirty, rarely cut or polished correctly,
and were often quite dull.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.590
The dazzling stones we recognize from modern
times are put through labor-intensive cutting

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.799
and polishing (which is where much of the
real, albeit relatively small, value of all

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.340
but the largest of diamonds actually derives
from).

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.140
As Joan Dickinson’s book The Book of Diamonds
puts it, diamonds could lie around unnoticed

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.869
for decades in the ground of India before
a “knowledgeable eye (could) spot a diamond

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.009
in the rough.”

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.760
Even with diamonds being found in the jungles
of Brazil in the early 19th century, and including

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.180
India’s contribution, the entire world production
of gem diamonds was only a few pounds per

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.769
year at this point.

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.370
That all changed in 1869.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.530
Prior to 1869, South Africa’s main exports
were wool and sugar, nothing that was rare

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.830
or native exclusive to the region.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.400
There was really nothing there prior that
interested Europe.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.940
(Hence why “The Scramble for Africa,”
the nickname for the European takeover of

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.530
Africa, didn’t begin until 1881.)

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.530
So what changed?

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.690
In 1866, a young Boer (a word referring to
a South African farmer of Dutch or German

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.599
descent) found a 22 carat diamond (for comparison,
nearly half the size of the Hope Diamond)

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.400
in a stream bed near Vaal River in modern-day
South Africa.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.310
Three years later, an 83 carat diamond was
found by a shepherd boy near the Orange River

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.940
in South Africa.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.360
Nicknamed the “Star of South Africa,”
the diamond touched off a rush in South Africa

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.909
with the British leading the way.

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:11.140
Soon after, four mines were dry-dug and the
largest diamond deposit ever was found.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.840
The largest of these mines was called the
Kimberley Mine, or the “Big Hole.”

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.400
Diamonds came out of those mines by the ton.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.670
The value of land in the region, and subsequently
the rest of Africa due to the hope that there

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.510
were more diamonds to be found, shot up.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.190
A titanic struggle-turned-war for land began
between European powers, most notably Britain,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.860
and the Boer population who lived in the region.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.170
For four months between December 1880 and
March 1881, the First Anglo-Boer War raged.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.739
The British would end up winning, but at a
much higher cost of manpower than originally

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:45.739
thought.

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.569
408 British soldiers were killed, while only
41 Boers.

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.470
18 years later, the second Anglo-Boer war
would commence with even greater casualties.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.620
Meanwhile, the fighting and the sheer amount
of diamonds coming out of the South African

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.430
mines were making the British owners of the
mines quite nervous.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.060
The value of their product depended on scarcity
and demand.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.799
With too many diamonds and a market fearful
of the violence, the demand was dropping and

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.549
value of diamonds went down.

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.530
In the late 1880s, diamonds were essentially
a semiprecious stone (equivalent to today’s

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.460
turquoise or topaz) and many of the mines
were at-risk of closing.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.160
Enter British native Cecil Rhodes who got
his start renting water pumps to miners in

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.320
1869 at the beginning of the South African
diamond rush.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.640
From the money earned, he bought up claims
of land from smaller mining operations.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.000
When many small operations were closing and
selling land due to the over-saturation of

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.070
diamonds in the market, Rhodes was buying.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.120
Ignoring the more-established Kimberly Mine,
he made the purchase that would send him into

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120
history.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.919
The old De Beer mine was owned by two Boer
brothers, Johannes Nicolaas de Beer and Diederik

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:55.919
Arnoldus.

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.660
Rhodes bought it off them for, at the time,
a reasonable price.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.511
As Rhodes’ empire continued to grow, the
immensely wealthy Rothschild Family (or at

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:07.681
least, their bank) providing some financial
backing (it is unclear how Rhodes and the

00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:11.860
Rothschild knew each other), and as every
other South African mine leveled off, the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.410
De Beers did not.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:19.340
In 1888, as diamond prices continued to fall,
there were only a few mine owners left, including

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.310
Rhodes and his De Beers mine.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.509
The remaining mine owners decided that the
only way their industry would survive was,

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:31.400
instead of competing with one another, to
consolidate and form one giant mining company.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.320
The intention was to create a monopoly in
the industry, centering all the production,

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.250
mining, and lands in the hands of one corporation.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:46.020
And that corporation was De Beers Consolidated
Mines, Ltd headed up by Cecil Rhodes.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.669
From that point forward, the De Beers Company
was nearly the sole owner of every single

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.340
South African mine.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.300
Rhodes and De Beers created individual subsidiaries
and “trading companies,” to make it look

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.460
like these were different companies operating
independently.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.660
They were not and all were part of the parent
De Beers Company.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.440
Today, these would be called shell corporations
and would be illegal in most regions of the

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.440
world.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.770
Essentially, what De Beers was able to do
was to set one standard, or “fixed,” diamond

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.960
price, with minimal fluctuation between their
subsidiaries, and make it look like the market

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.960
set the price.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.789
Now, the actual supply and demand value didn’t
matter anymore because De Beers controlled

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.070
all of the supply.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.020
As a 1982 The Atlantic article put it, “De
Beers proved to be the most successful cartel

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.190
arrangement in the annals of modern commerce.”

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.310
Upon Cecil Rhodes’ death in 1902, De Beers
owned ninety percent of the world’s (not

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.020
just South Africa’s) diamond production,
but after years of ruthless business practices,

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.509
his company was about to be outsmarted.

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:50.440
The Premier mine (later called the Cullinan
mine, after the town it was located in) was

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.810
one of the only mines not owned by De Beers,
despite overtures from the company about buying

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.810
it.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.040
The owners didn’t want to contribute to
the De Beers monopoly, so instead they sold

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.509
to independent dealers, the Oppenheimer brothers.

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:09.669
In 1905, the largest rough diamond ever found
was in the Premier mine, weighing in at an

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:11.650
absurd 3,106 carats.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.650
Now, the Oppenheimer brothers, particularly
Ernest Oppenheimer, were in business.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:22.020
Ernest Oppenheimer knew that, while his own
Anglo American Corporation was doing well,

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:32.849
no one would be able to defeat De 
Beers at this time.

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:37.610
So, he took the expression “if you can’t
beat them, join them” seriously.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.150
Using his newfound wealth, he bought enough
shares of De Beers to land himself on the

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.340
board of the company.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:48.160
By 1926, he was the second largest shareholder
in the company, behind only Solly Joel.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.039
As it turned out, Joel and Oppenheimer were
friends and had already conceived a plan where

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:56.610
Oppenheimer would become chairman of the board.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.449
Oppenheimer did exactly this and renamed the
company the Diamond Corporation.

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:05.340
The Oppenheimers would hold control of the
company until 2011.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.050
In 1938, the diamond industry was again in
decline, thanks to the discovery of mines

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:15.229
in Australia, Siberia, and Western Africa
and the Great Depression reducing sales, which

00:08:15.229 --> 00:08:16.990
again saturated the market.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.660
So, Ernest sent his son, Harry, to New York
City to meet with the ad agency N.W.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.199
Ayer, which was the same agency that helped
their financial backer Morgan Bank.

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:30.919
Together, they realized that the United States
was a significantly under-tapped market for

00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:31.919
diamonds.

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:36.080
They just need to figure out a way to convince
Americans to buy their product.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.380
They did just that by using the happiest and,
perhaps, occasionally most irrational of human

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.700
emotions – love.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.290
Using newspapers, magazines, the new medium
of movies, and even a series of lectures at

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:53.270
high schools across the nation centered around
diamond engagement rings, they constructed

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:58.700
the illusion that diamonds equaled love, with
a bigger (and more expensive) diamond meaning

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.700
more love.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.850
“A Diamond is Forever” was shown in ads
depicting young lovers getting married or

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:04.990
on their honeymoon.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.280
(In truth, diamonds are easily shattered,
burnt and turned into carbon dioxide with

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.600
the help of an abundant supply of oxygen,
chipped, etc.)

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.830
These ads appeared everywhere, often using
big name movie actors to foster this connection.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:22.400
And it worked – by 1944, the sale of diamonds
had increased by 55 percent in the United

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.860
States from just a few years before and were
now inexorably tied to love and marriage,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.220
as well as being seen as a highly valuable
item that would last forever.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:37.530
This idea of diamonds being “forever”
and to be passed on from generation to generation

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.950
was a particularly important notion.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:44.360
You see, as more and more diamonds were held
by individuals, eventually there would be

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.390
so many out there that if people started trying
to sell them, the reality of the value would

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:54.320
be discovered and the price of cut diamonds
would also ultimately no longer be controllable

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.470
by De Beers, something not lost on the company.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:02.350
Thus, diamonds not only had to be forever
held by the individual, but the idea of buying

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:06.630
a used diamond to show affection had to be
firmly taboo.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.060
Harry Oppenheimer commented on all this in
1971:

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:15.070
A degree of control is necessary for the well-being
of the industry, not because production is

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:20.170
excessive or demand is falling, but simply
because wide fluctuations in price, which

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:25.570
have, rightly or wrongly, been accepted as
normal in the case of most raw materials,

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:31.720
would be destructive of public confidence
in the case of a pure luxury such as gem diamonds,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.960
of which large stocks are held in the form
of jewelry by the general public.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.050
In any event, thanks to a virtual monopoly
and perhaps the most effective ad blitz of

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:45.760
all time, diamonds were here to stay and,
again, De Beers could set its price, no matter

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.810
if supply was high or low.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.100
In fact, the higher the price, the more love
one was now demonstrating.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.900
De Beers repeated these types of campaigns
throughout the developed world with resounding

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:56.900
success.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:03.730
For instance, in Japan in 1967, diamond engagement
rings were given only 5% of the time.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.830
Within a decade, thanks to some savvy advertising,
more than half of all engagement rings in

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:13.140
Japan had diamonds on them, with that number
rising steadily ever since.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:18.140
Today, thanks to a series of very recent events,
including several lawsuits and something in

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:23.450
the way of a revolt by several diamond supplying
nations against De Beers, De Beers no longer

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:28.910
has a stranglehold on the diamond market,
but the idea that diamonds are the traditional

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:34.000
way to demonstrate true love and that one
should spend two months’ salary on a diamond

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.360
engagement ring (an idea embedded into popular
culture via an old diamond ad campaign, first

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.210
as one month’s salary, and later increased
to two with the slogan “How else could two-months’

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:48.830
salary last forever?”) has kept the diamond
industry remarkably profitable.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:53.270
After all, even for those who know all this
about diamonds, thanks to popular perception,

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:58.950
