For those of you who speak more
than one language, think about this:

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.480
are there ideas or concepts
that you know in one language,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.335
but that have no equivalent
in another language? Yes or no?

00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:14.090
And for those of you
who speak only one language,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.980
are there ideas and thoughts that you have
trouble putting into words? Yes or no?

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.820
Choose the answer,
to whichever question applies to you.
