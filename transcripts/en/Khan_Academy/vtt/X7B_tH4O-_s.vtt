00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.680
In this video, I want to focus
on a few more techniques for

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.210
factoring polynomials.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.130
And in particular, I want to
focus on quadratics that don't

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.310
have a 1 as the leading
coefficient.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.540
For example, if I wanted
to factor 4x squared

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.920
plus 25x minus 21.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.440
Everything we've factored so
far, or all of the quadratics

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.100
we've factored so far, had
either a 1 or negative 1 where

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.090
this 4 is sitting.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.880
All of a sudden now, we
have this 4 here.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.840
So what I'm going to teach you
is a technique called,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.020
factoring by grouping.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.130
And it's a little bit more
involved than what we've

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.100
learned before, but
it's a neat trick.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.210
To some degree, it'll become
obsolete once you learn the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.600
quadratic formula, because,
frankly, the quadratic formula

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.230
is a lot easier.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.550
But this is how it goes.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.770
I'll show you the technique.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.910
And then at the end of this
video, I'll actually show you

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.300
why it works.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.430
So what we need to do here,
is we need to think of two

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.120
numbers, a and b, where a
times b is equal 4 times

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.700
negative 21.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:12.530
So a times b is going to be
equal to 4 times negative 21,

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.280
which is equal to negative 84.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.490
And those same two numbers,
a plus b, need

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.480
to be equal to 25.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.930
Let me be very clear.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.300
This is the 25, so they need
to be equal to 25.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.970
This is where the 4 is.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.540
So we go, 4 times negative 21.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.270
That's a negative 21.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.680
So what two numbers are there
that would do this?

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.050
Well, we have to look at the
factors of negative 84.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.710
And once again, one
of these are going

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.550
to have to be positive.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.870
The other ones are going to have
to be negative, because

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.170
their product is negative.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.350
So let's think about
the different

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.420
factors that might work.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.465
4 and negative 21 look
tantalizing, but when you add

00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:01.970
them, you get negative 17.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.870
Or, if you had negative 4 and
21, you'd get positive 17.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.010
Doesn't work.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.220
Let's try some other
combinations.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.150
1 and 84, too far apart when
you take their difference.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.420
Because that's essentially what
you're going to do, if

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.500
one is negative and
one is positive.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.840
Too far apart.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.730
Let's see you could do 3--
I'm jumping the gun.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.370
2 and 42.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.620
Once again, too far apart.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.800
Negative 2 plus 42 is 40.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.650
2 plus negative 42 is negative
40-- too far apart.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:41.020
3 and-- Let's see, 3 goes into
84-- 3 goes into 8 2 times.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.860
2 times 3 is 6.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.200
8 minus 6 is 2.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.610
Bring down the 4.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.150
Goes exactly 8 times.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.120
So 3 and 28.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.370
This seems interesting.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.920
And remember, one of these
has to be negative.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.240
So if we have negative 3 plus
28, that is equal to 25.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.220
Now, we've found our
two numbers.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.200
But it's not going to be quite
as simple of an operation as

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.510
what we did when this was
a 1 or negative 1.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.330
What we're going to do now is
split up this term right here.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.800
We're going to split it up into
positive 28x minus 3x.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.590
We're just going to
split that term.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.890
That term is that term
right there.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.150
And of course, you have your
minus 21 there, and you have

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.350
your 4x squared over here.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.100
Now, you might say, how did you
pick the 28 to go here,

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.570
and the negative
3 to go there?

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.000
And it actually does matter.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.730
The way I thought about it is
3 or negative 3, and 21 or

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.590
negative 21 , they have
some common factors.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.460
In particular, they have
the factor 3 in common.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.780
And 28 and 4 have some
common factors.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.940
So I grouped the 28 on
the side of the 4.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.730
And you're going to see what
I mean in a second.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.450
If we, literally, group these
so that term becomes 4x

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.140
squared plus 28x.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:25.880
And then, this side, over
here in pink, it's plus

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.740
negative 3x minus 21.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.810
Once again, I picked these.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.300
I grouped the negative 3 with
the 21, or the negative 21,

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.320
because they're both
divisible by 3.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.790
And I grouped the 28 with the
4, because they're both

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.250
divisible by 4.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.800
And now, in each of these
groups, we factor as

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.550
much out as we can.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.050
So both of these terms
are divisible by 4x.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.740
So this orange term is equal
to 4x times x-- 4x squared

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:03.020
divided by 4x is just x-- plus
28x divided by 4x is just 7.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.020
Now, this second term.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.630
Remember, you factor
out everything that

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.030
you can factor out.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.160
Well, both of these terms are
divisible by 3 or negative 3.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.945
So let's factor out
a negative 3.

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:16.260
And this becomes x plus 7.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.690
And now, something might
pop out at you.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.350
We have x plus 7 times
4x plus, x plus 7

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.150
times negative 3.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.630
So we can factor out
an x plus 7.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.550
This might not be completely
obvious.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.900
You're probably not
used to factoring

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.490
out an entire binomial.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.350
But you could view this
could be like a.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.790
Or if you have 4xa minus 3a,
you would be able to

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.930
factor out an a.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.330
And I can just leave this
as a minus sign.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.950
Let me delete this
plus right here.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.850
Because it's just
minus 3, right?

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.970
Plus negative 3, same
thing as minus 3.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.640
So what can we do here?

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.270
We have an x plus 7, times 4x.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.040
We have an x plus 7,
times negative 3.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.110
Let's factor out the x plus 7.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:16.350
We get x plus 7, times
4x minus 3.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.790
Minus that 3 right there.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.110
And we've factored
our binomial.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.550
Sorry, we've factored our
quadratic by grouping.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.210
And we factored it into
two binomials.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.140
Let's do another example of
that, because it's a little

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.770
bit involved.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.290
But once you get the hang
of it's kind of fun.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:43.540
So let's say we want to factor
6x squared plus 7x plus 1.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.800
Same drill.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.940
We want to find a times b that
is equal to 1 times 6, which

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.110
is equal to 6.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.460
And we want to find an a plus
b needs to be equal to 7.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.520
This is a little bit more
straightforward.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.900
What are the-- well, the obvious
one is 1 and 6, right?

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.310
1 times 6 is 6.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.620
1 plus 6 is 7.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.150
So we have a is equal to 1.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.700
Or let me not even
assign them.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.650
The numbers here are 1 and 6.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.740
Now, we want to split this
into a 1x and a 6x.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.420
But we want to group it so it's
on the side of something

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.090
that it shares a factor with.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.880
So we're going to have a 6x
squar ed here, plus-- and so

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.520
I'm going to put the
6x first because 6

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.170
and 6 share a factor.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.580
And then, we're going to
have plus 1x, right?

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.650
6x plus 1x equals 7x .

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:40.830
That was the whole point.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.580
They had to add up to 7 .

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.000
And then we have the
final plus 1 there.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.320
Now, in each of these groups,
we can factor out

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.220
as much as we like.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.080
So in this first group,
let's factor out a 6x.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:58.020
So this first group becomes 6x
times-- 6x squar ed divided by

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.480
6x is just an x.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.380
6x divided by 6x is just a 1.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.730
And then, the second
group-- we're going

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.130
to have a plus here.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.870
But this second group, we just
literally have a x plus 1.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.500
Or we could even write a
1 times an x plus 1.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.440
You could imagine I just
factored out of 1 so to speak.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.790
Now, I have 6x times x plus
1, plus 1 times x plus 1.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.740
Well, I can factor
out the x plus 1.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:35.549
If I factor out an x plus 1,
that's equal to x plus 1 times

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.690
6x plus that 1.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:38.280
I'm just doing the

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.460
distributive property in reverse.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.230
So hopefully you didn't
find that too bad.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.430
And now, I'm going to actually
explain why this little

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.170
magical system actually works.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.530
Let me take an example.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.530
I'll do it in very
general terms.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:09:03.630
Let's say I had ax plus b,
times cx-- actually, I'm

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.300
afraid to use the a's and b's.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.760
I think that'll confuse
you, because I

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.930
use a's and b's here.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.240
They won't be the same thing.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.760
So let me use completely
different letters.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:24.000
Let's say I have fx plus g,
times hx plus, I'll use j

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.240
instead of i.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.450
You'll learn in the future
why don't like

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.710
using i as a variable.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.000
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.920
Well, it's going to be fx
times hx which is fhx.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.710
And then, fx times j.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.800
So plus fjx.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.240
And then, we're going
to have g times hx.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.010
So plus ghx.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.990
And then g times j.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.840
Plus gj.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:02.500
Or, if we add these two middle
terms, you have fh times x,

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:08.970
plus-- add these two terms--
fj plus gh x.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.170
Plus gj.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.540
Now, what did I do here?

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.550
Well, remember, in all of these
problems where you have

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.650
a non-1 or non-negative 1
coefficient here, we look for

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.560
two numbers that add up to this,
whose product is equal

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.480
to the product of
that times that.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:31.780
Well, here we have two numbers
that add up-- let's say that a

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.030
is equal to fj.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:37.750
That is a.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.930
And b is equal to gh.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.730
So a plus b is going to be
equal to that middle

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:44.980
coefficient.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.100
And then what is a times b? a
times b is going to be equal

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.260
to fj times gh.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.320
We could just reorder these
terms. We're just multiplying

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.430
a bunch of terms. So that could
be rewritten as f times

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:09.390
h times g times j.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.090
These are all the same things.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.620
Well, what is fh times gj?

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:19.150
This is equal to fh times gj.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.530
Well, this is equal to the first
coefficient times the

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.670
constant term.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.870
So a plus b will be equal to
the middle coefficient.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.930
And a times b will equal the
first coefficient times the

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:32.670
constant term.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.330
So that's why this whole
factoring by grouping even

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.180
works, or how we're able
to figure out what

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.200
a and b even are.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.210
Now, I'm going to close up
with something slightly

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.800
different, but just to make
sure that you have a

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.130
well-rounded education
in factoring things.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.050
What I want to do is to teach
you to factor things a little

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:52.940
bit more completely.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.160
And this is a little
bit of a add-on.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.660
I was going to make a
whole video on this.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.250
But I think, on some level,
it might be a

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.480
little obvious for you.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:07.190
So let's say we had-- let
me get a good one here.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:12.910
Let's say we had negative
x to the third, plus 17x

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:18.180
squared, minus 70x.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.130
Immediately, you say, gee, this
isn't even a quadratic.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.770
I don't know how to solve
something like this.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.580
It has an x to third power.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.150
And the first thing you should
realize is that every term

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.840
here is divisible by x.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.920
So let's factor out an x.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.260
Or even better, let's factor
out a negative x.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.320
So if you factor out a negative
x, this is equal to

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.730
negative x times-- negative
x to the third divided by

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.810
negative x is x squared.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:47.910
17x squared divided by negative
x is negative 17x.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:52.510
Negative 70x divided by negative
x is positive 70.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.060
The x's cancel out.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.050
And now, you have something
that might look

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.220
a little bit familiar.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.530
We have just a standard
quadratic where the leading

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.650
coefficient is a 1.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:08.290
We just have to find two numbers
whose product is 70,

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.000
and that add up to
negative 17.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.920
And the numbers that immediately
jumped into my

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.410
head are negative 10
and negative 7.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.520
You take their product,
you get 70.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.870
You add them up, you
get negative 17.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.920
So this part right here is
going to be x minus 10,

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.410
times x minus 7.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.540
And of course, you have that
leading negative x.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.330
The general idea here is just
see if there's anything you

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.320
can factor out.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.780
And that'll get it into a form
that you might recognize.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.950
Hopefully, you found
this helpful.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.145
I want to reiterate what I
showed you at the beginning of

00:13:41.145 --> 00:13:41.510
this video.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.960
I think it's a really cool
trick, so to speak, to be able

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.470
to factor things that have
a non-1 or non-negative 1

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.460
leading coefficient.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.720
But to some degree, you're going
to find out easier ways

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.370
to do this, especially
with the quadratic

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.620
formula, in not too long.
