1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,750
Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:07,380
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast said, Huh?

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,040
[inaudible]

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,000
just checking in on you.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,660
Just checking in on your fucking
red line in the goddamn levels.

6
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:19,710
Here you bring this down here. Ah, Jesus.

7
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:22,830
I got shit to do today,
so let's fucking get right to it.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,690
Yeah.

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,950
Do you see these goddamn things?
Fuck it by him.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,370
I found that youtube clip the other day
member on the fat kid. We'll review food.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,590
That was my favorite one. Fat Kid
reviews, girl scout cookies. He goes,

12
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:42,591
sees a girl scout mint chocolate
chip cookies and I fucking love them.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,400
Like me. Sits there and he ate some looks
up in the air and then he goes up some.

14
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,510
You see somebody selling these
goddamn things, fucking buy them.

15
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,910
It's one of the greatest
food reviews ever.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,140
I totally believed him and I want
to girl scout cookies. But anyways,

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,740
I'm not here to talk about this.
I'm not in it. Talk about that.

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,960
I'm here as a casual fucking
fan of the NBA. Meaning,

19
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:10,920
I've probably watched seven whole
games in the last seven fucking years.

20
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,080
And I watched the second half of
last night's Cleveland Cavaliers,

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,070
first the fucking Golden State Warriors,
um,

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,230
in a bar with the sound out.
Now here comes my analogy,

23
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,320
my favorite fucking moment
of last night and this thing,

24
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:32,430
I don't have a dog in the fight.

25
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,690
I'd love to see Lebron win a
championship for Cleveland. And, um,

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,310
I always like the golden state warriors
because they, they stunk, you know,

27
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,750
and their fans fucking hung in there.

28
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:46,320
And I liked their floor and all of that
shit in that old piece of Shit stadium

29
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:48,450
they play.
And I went to a game there.

30
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:50,730
I went to a game there
about fucking 10 years ago,

31
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,680
and there was like nobody there. And
they had these sickest fucking live band.

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,870
They're the old plane. Herbie Hancock.
What does that sound? Wild AOD or what?

33
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,990
Barrow do Ruby.

34
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,340
Wow.
Deep that did do that

35
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,190
fucking sickest shit ever, right? It
was way better than mine. I just did

36
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,450
the fuck was the name of that song?
I got that on my fucking phone somewhere.

37
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,470
Oh, Jesus. Uh, you know, and I'll
play it for you here in a second.

38
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:24,130
Maybe you guys understand what this one
is. Herbie Hancock. It wasn't watermelon,

39
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:25,420
man.
What the fuck was it called?

40
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,210
Headhunter her be head cock.

41
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,540
I'm going to hit pause while I look
this up so I don't torture you here.

42
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,330
All right, good. I got, they were playing.

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,900
They were playing Herbie
Hancock Chameleon. I met a
professional basketball game.

44
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:41,680
There's nobody there. There's fucking live
band is crushing this song right here.

45
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,570
Come on,
play it for fuck sakes.

46
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,260
Me. Just look around like, just fucking
game sucks. Listen to this band though.

47
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,760
The killing it.
Harvey Mason.

48
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,430
All right. Alright.

49
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,090
Black people all start moving around.

50
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,240
White people start getting uncomfortable
and the guitar player comes in.

51
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,400
Maybe it comes in in the next [inaudible]

52
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,373
very comfortable.

53
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,730
I felt like it was in a fucking
movie, so I was like, you know what?

54
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:29,960
I love this franchise. You know
what this is? This is if you shot,

55
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,700
this is what you should be
doing. And saying, listen man,

56
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:33,110
we're only going to
win eight games a year.

57
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,770
Let's fucking get a killer band to come
in there and people can leave to have a

58
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:41,720
good time. It was a fucking party and
they lost by like fucking 30. So anyways,

59
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,870
I got, I don't have a dog in this
fight and I watched this game.

60
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,543
MMM.

61
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,820
I watched this game with the fucking
sound on that was Herbie Hancock Chameleon

62
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,390
by the way,

63
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,350
before you try to shit Zammit point your
phone at your fucking dashboard while

64
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:59,550
you're driving down the street.
Killing a fucking mother is six. Um,

65
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,970
I have to tell you this over the last
couple of games that I've watched,

66
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,060
like the NBA has fucking changed so much
the way Steph curry just runs around

67
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:13,820
the court. Like it's his,
like the whole thing is his,

68
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:17,960
it's his fucking showcase when he was
sitting on the bench and that dude hits

69
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:20,980
the three pointer and he did
that little jazz hand thing.

70
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,220
Yeah.
Whatever

71
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,980
the fuck he was doing,
you know,

72
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,850
dribbles out the game and
then looks at the crowd, goes

73
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,060
[inaudible] fucking screaming.
I'm just looking at him. Okay,

74
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,090
now I know this guy could fucking
body slammed me. I'm just a comedian,

75
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,710
but I'm talking about NBA player,

76
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,220
Nba play at this fucking guy is,
he's built like an honor roll student.

77
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,420
All right?

78
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,590
And I know he can shoot the fucking lights
out from behind the three point line.

79
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,280
Fine. You know, you do the
best she can back there,

80
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,180
but you let that little mother fucker
just glide down the Goddamn Lane like

81
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,740
clear, clearer path to
today's NBA. Don't touch him.

82
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,230
Don't fucking touch him.
That guy needs to get his head taken off.

83
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Get one of those fucking giant white
dudes from fucking eastern Europe.

84
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:18,450
Some Transylvania guy. Get him
out there. He's got six files.

85
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,960
Just, you know, you know what
would happen? He'd do fucking
one. They'd be like, Ooh,

86
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,480
32 channel with e trade or
whatever the fuck they call it.

87
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,940
Was that a hard foul? Was he trying
to hurt his feelings with that foul?

88
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,170
Oh, let's go over and look at the
tape. What do you think was, was,

89
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,640
was his face snarl too much when
he did that? Uh, we can have that.

90
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,700
Get him out of the game.
You know,

91
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,370
it's still worth it to fucking do it
because I can see it back in the day.

92
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,470
You know the Rick,

93
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,990
my horns that John Sally's all
at all of these fucking guy,

94
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:54,390
John Sally passed away unfortunately.

95
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:59,270
But all of those fucking old school NBA
guys gotta be this fucking kid and just

96
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:02,120
be sitting there going like, yeah dad,
that that wouldn't happen. Rightfully

97
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,160
that guy would have got
his fucking head taken off.

98
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,970
Do you know if you watch highlights of
Jordan all you young millennial fucking

99
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,320
Yolo people out there. If you fucking
watch him, it's like he's skinny,

100
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:18,020
he's skinny,
and then all of a sudden he's filled out.

101
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,340
That was because the Pistons beat the
shit out of them. EPFL like fucking two,

102
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,740
three years in a row in the playoffs.
He finally had enough

103
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,770
guy had to go to the gym because the
NBA reps weren't protecting them.

104
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,880
They keep come down there.

105
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:35,630
They'd fucking do remember one time
fucking bill and beer, one of the,

106
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,553
it's always like,
I'll,

107
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,850
Sam is sin without skates out there who
hilariously in the 30 for 30 used to be

108
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:43,670
like, we used to like to try and
get in people's heads. It's like,

109
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,630
like he was playing this high level
fucking mind game. It's like, no dude,

110
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,020
you were just out there waiting for
people to leave their feet and you'd take

111
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:54,470
their fucking legs out.
How'd you come up with that?

112
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,410
It's your major in Calculus.
Um,

113
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,360
so I remember one time he was
hacking the Celtics so fucking bad.

114
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,980
Robert Parish finally couldn't take it.

115
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,950
And the players go on up the court and
he just fucking gave him two, four.

116
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,480
I'm smashes over their head.
He chopped them down like a fucking,

117
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,960
do you ever see like when a guy who does
not to chop down a tree chops down to

118
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,490
train,
it falls into his house?

119
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,510
That's the way he was hacking
away at Lam beer and land beer.

120
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,390
Just put both his hands
up like, oh, you know,

121
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,490
like George Michael when he was with
wham and he just fucking went down.

122
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,750
All right. He gave him to fucking ruin
your friends. Right. And he went down,

123
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,300
the refs didn't see it.
It was like wrestling.

124
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,510
And then when they back they went back
and looked at the tape. You're like, yeah,

125
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:41,480
well, you know, we should've called
the fall and there was no fines.

126
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,170
There was no objections, there
was no nothing. He just, you know,

127
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,820
live by the sword, die by the sword.
Um, there was so many of those.

128
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:51,920
I just was thinking another
one that I saw, they just,

129
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,980
it just nowadays you just
covered is out there just fucking

130
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,370
gliding around.
He's built like a muppet.

131
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,120
I just don't understand in this
day and age how that has happened.

132
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:05,750
And the only thing that I can come up
with is that the leagues is so fucking

133
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:10,751
guilty that not guilty greedy
is that they realize that,

134
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:15,440
you know, um, that offense
sells tickets to the casual fan.

135
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,300
You know what I mean? Like, let's
take the most boring game ever.

136
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,250
And I'm not talking about horseshoes.
I'm not talking about shuffleboard.

137
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,890
I'm not talking about darts.

138
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,850
I of course am talking about soccer.

139
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,560
Okay?

140
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,270
Which the entire world has embraced except
for us and when you really look at it,

141
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,170
that's probably why we're number one.
You know what I mean?

142
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,780
The rest of the world is too stupid to
realize how boring that fucking game is

143
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,990
despite the fact that it's so fucking
boring that even their fans have to have

144
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,230
campfires singalongs as they
wait for something to happen.

145
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,510
I want some added with Agn Hayes
all Righ, right? Just sitting there,

146
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,040
they're fucking scarves and shit.
This is the thing about,

147
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,050
Oh man, I'm going to get
some fucking emails in this.

148
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,690
This is the thing about fucking soccer,
right?

149
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,320
If they just let the forwards run
past the final line of defense,

150
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:22,620
like in any other competitive
fucking game where it's like, hey,

151
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:23,850
I'm faster than you.

152
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,810
I understand like offsides to a point,
but it's got to be a,

153
00:09:28,811 --> 00:09:33,510
just a line like in hockey and then
after that, if I'm faster than you,

154
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,560
if I can see the play developing
before you do, I get by you.

155
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:39,300
I don't have to fucking wait for you.

156
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,620
If they would just adjust that and you'd
start to have some fucking 10 to eight

157
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:47,080
games,
I'm telling you that game would blow up.

158
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,790
Okay.

159
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,810
Blow up here in the United States we
would sit down and fucking watch it.

160
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:54,540
You know why?
Because we don't understand the game,

161
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,820
you know what I mean?
If I was watching cricket right,

162
00:09:58,821 --> 00:10:00,410
I guess they score a lot
in that fucking thing.

163
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:02,240
That's a good one to just
sit around and booze with,

164
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:04,040
but any fucking game then I'm not into,

165
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,670
if somebody is crushing it and everybody's
flipping out, I'm going to be like,

166
00:10:07,671 --> 00:10:10,340
what's going on? I'm going to actually
going to sit there and watch it.

167
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:14,700
Like nobody, like when I walked
by, you know in soccer is on,

168
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,860
I don't even look at it,
but if I hit this guy go,

169
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,840
he's doing that. I stopped
and I watch, you know,

170
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,140
and I read all the fucking advertising's
all over there fucking uniforms.

171
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,160
I got to tell you,

172
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,250
the premier league has the worst fucking
uniforms I've ever seen in my life.

173
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:36,510
You can't figure out who to fuck anybody.
It doesn't say man United,

174
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,950
it doesn't say Liverpool.

175
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,070
It just says Exxon and fucking
Joey's fish and chips fucking banks.

176
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,300
I heard they're going to do
that in the NBA. But anyways,

177
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,130
I think that that's what
happened to the game. And I know,

178
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:51,600
I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

179
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,400
I'm too fucking busy to pay attention.

180
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,510
And at the end of the day I never
really excelled in sports anyway.

181
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:58,110
So who better to break down?

182
00:10:58,111 --> 00:11:02,920
What's wrong with the fucking NBA than
some stuttering fucking prick like me? Um,

183
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,440
I think you got an entire generation
of people that grew up playing Madden

184
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:11,550
football and all of this shit and
everybody was the globe trotters.

185
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,400
And now that just doing like the
real version of it. All right.

186
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,760
I love Steph Curry. He's the greatest
shoot I've ever seen in my life.

187
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,700
But watching him just glide down
the fucking lane is ridiculous,

188
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:24,810
which is why last night after
the fucking whistle blows,

189
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,400
he just decides like, Oh,
I'm just gonna fucking yell.

190
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:31,770
I'm going to take a little lay up here,
you know right next to Lebron James,

191
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:34,950
and I loved that Lebron blocked it and
looked at him like, fuck Outta here.

192
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,260
That's what they need to do.
All right,

193
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,520
you're not going to beat these fucking
guys play in their Goddamn game trying to

194
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,730
outshoot fucking three pointers or
whatever the fuck it is they're doing.

195
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,840
Granted, I watched it with the
sound down in the second half. Um,

196
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,200
they need to fucking, they got
it. They got you. I'm telling you,

197
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,930
they got to give him the right Dave for
it. That's what they got to do. Okay.

198
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,050
That's what you do. If the other team is
faster, the other team fucking you get,

199
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:07,000
you have to play physical. I'm not saying
play dirty Pittsburgh Penguin fans.

200
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,830
I'm not saying you hire a fucking knee
breaker and and the career of the best

201
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,660
player on the other team.
I'm not saying that.

202
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,930
All I'm saying is when the
guy comes down the leg,

203
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,130
your whole team should be
yelling, Clara path. You know,

204
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,940
when this guy looks like he's in
the fucking globe trotters. Um,

205
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,620
now, now that I'm done with
that, a little fucking Soliloquy,

206
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:34,480
most of that was based in what
happens is you get older, you know,

207
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:36,790
and you start realizing
your own mortality.

208
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,450
And there's a couple of panic
thoughts that you have is, you know,

209
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:44,800
the world is churches. Oh, I'm
gonna die and it's gonna keep going.

210
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,130
Part of it was that, that the game
has changed. You know what I mean?

211
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,990
I am kind of the old man going,

212
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:56,470
why can't they have short
shorts again and close lines.

213
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,630
It's amazing. Somebody balls didn't
come out like during that Rambus play.

214
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:04,510
It's unbelievable that his
junk didn't come out the side.

215
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,560
He fucking literally did. Like,
you know, like, uh, he did,

216
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,400
he was doing like a Thomas
flair in the air. And

217
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,450
Dude, I actually retweeted the
other day. It was in a game.

218
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:21,310
Jack [inaudible] elbows, Kareem Abdul
Jabbar in the fucking like right in,

219
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,320
right in the right inhale,

220
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,950
solar plexus used to say in wrestling
and cream had to like fucking just run it

221
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:31,630
off like fuck. So whatever happened
on the play where the sea, uh,

222
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:36,070
the sonics hit the shot or not, they're
going back up to court or whatever. No,

223
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:38,500
they didn't cause what's his face?
Sigma was still setting up.

224
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,930
Corinne walked back into the play and
just got a little in front of Jack Sigma

225
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,400
turned around and punched him right
in the face. It's sick my head,

226
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:52,780
that great hair, you know, that hair
that like moves around if he get hit,

227
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,280
you know,
he had whip lash hair,

228
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,110
the white version of it where
Thomas Hitman Hearns had
the black version when he

229
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:03,850
fought, uh, when he
fought. Um, Marvin Hagler,

230
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,030
you know, if a black guy
who's going to get punched in,

231
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:08,170
they hadn't a boxing match,

232
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:11,440
you want them to have a Jerry curl
because it just adds to it when all that

233
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:13,600
liquid just shoots off his fucking head.

234
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,700
And Jack Sigma had the white version
of it where he had basically a Beatles

235
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:20,830
haircut.
So it just enhances,

236
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,500
you really get to see like how much
you know, whiplash somebodies enduring.

237
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,460
Um, all right. There we go.
That's just the end of it. I, I,

238
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,100
you know what it is selfishly
I want to see seven games. Um,

239
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,240
and uh, I would like to see, all
right, one teams, a finessed team,

240
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:40,990
the other teams of physical team,
I don't want to say it, he 30 play,

241
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:42,730
but I don't see one team,
you know,

242
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:47,560
putting on their Tutus and trying to
out fucking spin the other team. Right.

243
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,470
Isn't that what I'm saying there and Nino,
sorry,

244
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:52,910
I'm trying to plow my
way through this podcast.

245
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:57,020
So they got to go a do a table read there.
You want to join the podcast?

246
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,760
You just coming in to say hello.

247
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,420
I just called Tuesday as a day.

248
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,390
Not Today.
I got one more day and I'm 30,

249
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,960
but tomorrow it's your birthday.
Oh yeah. Where are you taking me?

250
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,233
Chucky cheese.

251
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,650
I get to work to come here.
I do. I feel about it.

252
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,490
How do you feel about your birthday?
Um, this is a weird one. Why?

253
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,050
Because usually at my advanced age,

254
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,250
I start going like, Oh
God, and I was this number.

255
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,840
Now I'm that number, right? This one.
I, I don't, I've just sort of, uh,

256
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,580
you know, somewhere when I went
during my year of being 47,

257
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:48,350
I realized it's over
what's over my sex appeal.

258
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,390
My, uh, my dream of being one of people
magazine's 50 most beautiful people.

259
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,520
Uh, yeah, that one might
be a little batteries,

260
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:00,760
but his sex appeal I think
is getting strong. Oh, Jesus.

261
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,770
Everybody gets a ribbon nowadays.
Um,

262
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,560
so I just have settled into a,
I went and I got glasses the other day.

263
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:14,030
Yes, you did. Cleo. Get out of
there. That was a grape nuts.

264
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:17,300
Those are not for you.
Go Fat. She's getting,

265
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,980
she's not that fast. She's fat. You're
fat and you're not going to get a date.

266
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,150
No one's going to love. You
know, I've been so busy,

267
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,920
I've been able to work.
Grab a microphone to,

268
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,310
cause you're gonna drive
people nuts off off the thing.

269
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,260
Go get a court people not to drive.

270
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:38,450
You can drive me nuts cause a
microphone in the closet. Huh?

271
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,950
I feel like the narrow and knock and I'm
good fellas now keep going right down

272
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:47,540
there. Yeah, it was scaring me,

273
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,970
Karen. Um, no, this one
I'm, I'm just now like,

274
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,230
I'm Kinda like, all right,
I'm old now. It's all about,

275
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:59,990
and because I had psychiatric,
uh,

276
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,870
Erica,
um,

277
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,010
I realize now that all I give a shit is
that if I just can sit down and not have

278
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,850
pain, I'll be fine. And I want to thank
everybody that have given me all their,

279
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,130
their, you know, remedies and
all of that stuff. You know,

280
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:26,240
it's funny. It's, yeah,

281
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:31,220
it's funny as hell how they fucking
do it where it's done with love,

282
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:33,940
but in a Twitter way like,
hey fuck it.

283
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,620
Just if you have Sayada just do this,

284
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:40,230
get over and get on one of those foam
rollers and roll out your para us.

285
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,100
And it's like, I did that. I did
that. I've done all of that shit.

286
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,310
I actually went to the chiropractor
again yesterday and he said that the

287
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:49,950
swelling on my spine has
gone down tremendously.

288
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,070
I am now on the next level of healing.
Well now I don't have pain.

289
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,570
I just feel like, uh, it's a little
tingly sometimes my foot falls asleep.

290
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,430
I've been doing these stretches,
body mind at work got in this,

291
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:04,810
you know like do of those things
where you hang upside down. Yeah.

292
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,480
He got one that's actually
not legal in this country. Um,

293
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,960
but do they sell it in Canada,
Canada and you just basically, uh,

294
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,680
you're more hanging from like your
waist as opposed to your ankle.

295
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,910
Dad was talking about,

296
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:20,430
my dad was talking about the one
where you hang from your ankles. Yeah.

297
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,610
And what my chiropractor was
saying was that that one,

298
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,910
it puts stress on your joints cause
you got your whole body weight,

299
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:27,840
puts like your ankles,

300
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:31,050
your knees and your hips because your
whole body weight with this other one

301
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,050
loves that thing though.
Yeah. I don't know.

302
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,700
A lot of people love
it for whatever reason,

303
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:40,140
but I've been using the other one
and that one would be like, uh,

304
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,570
say like you were at the zoo and you're
at the gorilla and closure and you want

305
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:50,130
to bend over and look for the dime. You
just fucking lost. This is a very timely,

306
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,070
yeah, just imagine that
except you don't fall in,

307
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:58,170
I use the thing it'll fit adult
if an adult fell in there. Yeah.

308
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,290
What did they have shot at?
What?

309
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,160
The tranquilizer thinking that maybe
the adult could handle the fucking

310
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:03,480
thrashing that he was going to get.

311
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,550
I think that the adult would have had the
presence of mind to like slowly try to

312
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:12,480
back out of this situation as opposed
to a baby that's just kinda like sitting

313
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:12,660
there.

314
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,080
Can you give us an example of how you
would slowly back of a situation with the

315
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,490
gorilla? Alright. You Fall in
God, what would you say? Hey Man,

316
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:24,000
like easy, easy. Well, you know,

317
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:26,640
I'm terrified of primates.

318
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,640
Like they just freaked me out in general,

319
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,430
so I don't really know what I would
do because I just feel like, oh,

320
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,150
I know what I would do common like Dna
wise or something with a chimpanzee than

321
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:42,480
they do with a gorilla. Like
they, that freaks me out. I know,

322
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,480
I know exactly what I would
do. I don't like it. Actually,

323
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:49,440
I would curl up in the fetal position
and I would cover up my face so he

324
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:51,480
wouldn't rip it off and
I would just be like,

325
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,510
if I got to take some
gorilla fucking kidney shots,

326
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,740
I would much rather take the ASV comes
over and just fucking whales on me,

327
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,010
like from fucking ankle
to the side of my head.

328
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,470
I will take that before I will.

329
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,100
I will just stand there with my face
out waiting for you to rip it off.

330
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,120
Well I do they, yeah, I mean I feel
like that's probably the best way to go.

331
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:15,750
So they don't see you as like a threat
or something like you just sort of submit

332
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:19,140
to them or something? I don't know.
But then I don't want them to be like,

333
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,950
I'm sure this information is on the
Internet now. Like it's just so weird.

334
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,960
I don't know. They just,
they really freaked me out.

335
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,190
Remember when we went to Australia,

336
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,520
you know they're going to grab you by
your ankle and just drag you around like a

337
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:32,850
fucking, they did that little
kid. I haven't watched it.

338
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,300
Oh remember when we went to Australia
and I was telling you a video of it.

339
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,870
I don't want to watch that.
I did.

340
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,970
I did watch still one of the naked guy
that walked into the line and closure and

341
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:43,680
he's trying to kill himself.
Oh.

342
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,920
And the fucking is his neck is in
the guy in the fucking things naked.

343
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,320
I mean, I was talking about that on TV.
Oh my God. Yeah, it's a little, yeah,

344
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,630
it's like, go ahead, grab my neck,
but I still got a cup of my junk.

345
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,650
You still got to keep your boxes
on, right? No, but that's the thing.

346
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:02,960
The thing was just handled by his
neck and survive. Yeah. But cause I,

347
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,980
they must've just fed the fucking thing.
So it just had him around the neck.

348
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,210
It's in the guys,
literally,

349
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,240
he's got his arms around the things that
lions neck and then he's basically in

350
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:16,090
any wrapped his legs around his body.
He basically had it in the guard,

351
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,650
like a Jujitsu guard and the
fucking lion and around his throat,

352
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,070
but he wasn't shaking them or anything.
And everyone's like, you know, going,

353
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:27,070
Oh my God, Oh my God. And you
know, in whatever fucking language,

354
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,700
whatever country it was in their film and
the guy goes completely fucking naked.

355
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,130
And um,
yeah,

356
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:36,610
he obviously had like mental
issues because if you're
in sound mind and you kill

357
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:39,000
yourself, you just like jump
off something, right? Yeah.

358
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:43,620
You don't wander into a land on somebody's
know naked Volkswagen Passat. Wait,

359
00:21:43,621 --> 00:21:46,110
but I wanted to say when we
went to Australia that time,

360
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,220
were you with me when I was in that
monkey exhibit or whatever and it looked

361
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:52,560
like planet of the apes
and it was freaking me out.

362
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,340
And then we went into that other little
side room and there was a monkey behind

363
00:21:56,341 --> 00:21:59,610
the glass and everyone was looking at
it and taking pictures and he started

364
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:02,850
rocking back and forth and I was like,
that thing is about to freak out.

365
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,990
And then it threw itself up against the
glass and like screamed and yelled and

366
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:09,540
everyone was like all, then
the other chimp came in? Yes.

367
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,630
The campaign and like tried
to come and I did. Yeah,

368
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:17,160
we thought they were going to fight and
then they embraced each other and then

369
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:20,460
they like put their bags toward the
glass with one of them's arm around the

370
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:23,190
other. Like it's going to be okay. Like
we're going to get out of here some day.

371
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:28,380
Like it was so emotional and it
was so scary. I just, I can't,

372
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,850
I don't know. I can't deal with it. Like
that scene in the trailer for Tarzan,

373
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:37,500
the legend of Tarzan or the monkey comes
in and like see is the Tarzan in the

374
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:41,760
bassinet and then picks it up and
then leaves with it as just like,

375
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,560
I don't know. I don't
like that shit. Yeah,

376
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,720
I think it's really weird. I mean,
if that was in the wild, they would,

377
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:51,790
they would eat that baby and
they would actually leave it,

378
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,460
keep it alive as long as they could
because they enjoy the screaming cause it

379
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,020
fucking is that true that
they get off on it, man.

380
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,800
Two chimpanzees are fucking evil.
Gorilla is a chill.

381
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,300
Gorillas don't have anything to prove.
Champ champ. The short man's disease.

382
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,480
I feel like gorilla in our little more
chill and then he got those tweaks are

383
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:12,990
monkeys. Yeah, right.
The meth head ones. Yeah.

384
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,590
Those ones that throw their shit at you.

385
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,390
The chimpanzee was the one that like
threw itself up against the glass and was

386
00:23:18,391 --> 00:23:19,770
like really loud and screaming.

387
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,720
The other gorillas seem a
little bit more peaceful.

388
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:23,100
Those are the ones that are handsome.

389
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,300
Like you saw that one gorilla
that everyone was freaking
out about in the zoo in

390
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:30,000
Japan because everyone
thought it was like a good,

391
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,090
it's actually a very good looking
gorilla, but yeah, that was weird.

392
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,400
It a weird here. It was really
weird. You will never find

393
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,650
another gorilla like me.
I, yeah, like sexy gorilla.

394
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:47,000
That's why they freak me out there.
Just so human like that is just,

395
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:52,001
it's unsettling to me and I don't like
when they make gorillas have agendas like

396
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:57,791
that commercial where the little girl is
deaf and she's doing sign language with

397
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:02,650
the other gorilla. It's like all
very surette orangutan. What? Tam?

398
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,050
My hope that that's the ones that,
look if I was a fucking chimp,

399
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:09,110
that's what I would look like.
The ones with all the stringy hair,

400
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,180
orange ones look like old men

401
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,940
but they're like sign language in each
other and it's like, oh that's sweet.

402
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:19,940
Like they're communicating through sign
language and then all of a sudden that

403
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:22,070
orangutan is like,
oh,

404
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:26,810
but like the way you live is destroying
my life. And it's like wait a minute.

405
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:31,190
And it was like for about palm oil or
peanut oil and it was like don't get the

406
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:34,180
monkey eyeball. Everything just
shocking. Cause now did you see,

407
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,650
I told you this morning I didn't see that.
I get it,

408
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:39,440
but don't bring the animals into it.
And deaf children,

409
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:44,210
like I just felt like that was his fucking
monkeys with their agendas. I didn't,

410
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:48,170
um, I didn't see the clip, but
I just, I just read about it.

411
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,350
Some reporter as Bernie Sanders,
the fact that he's staying in the race,

412
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:54,800
they asked him if he was
being sexist by staying in it.

413
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,220
Like he couldn't handle
lion two way Hallman.

414
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,740
Why is that sexist for him to
stay in there? A lot of us,

415
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,650
the reporter wants Hillary Clinton.
They want him out. They want him out.

416
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,330
They want Trump out. Even Republicans
like where the money's at. They,

417
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:12,680
they are gonna except Hilary
Clinton before Trump and before, um,

418
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,960
uh,
Bernie Sanders.

419
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:19,850
And what I love about Trump and Bernie
Sanders was it showed that enough

420
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,970
Americans are sick of this
standard Republican Democrat.

421
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,410
Like Hillary Clinton is the
standard fucking Democrat.

422
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:28,970
She's got the same money in our pockets.

423
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,200
The Republican [inaudible] general
Republican candidate would have had any of

424
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:37,470
those other fucking guys that was running
basically. Um, and it's, you know,

425
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:37,821
it's just,

426
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:40,400
that means just the 1% is going to get
more fucking rich and they're going to

427
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:42,560
push down the middle class,
the same fucking bullshit.

428
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,540
They're going to stay the course.

429
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:48,020
They don't want somebody that's
off to the side. I got to, uh,

430
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:53,180
I just had a scary thought. What
was that Trump president? No,

431
00:25:53,181 --> 00:25:54,440
I was thinking about,

432
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,920
I don't know that around its
residents know that orangutan thing.

433
00:25:57,921 --> 00:26:02,921
And I just literally got a picture of an
orangutan like in the way I said Tang,

434
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:07,760
like the drink my whole life, isn't
it? Orangutan? No, it's a ring. A Tan.

435
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:13,130
It is. Nobody's said. We don't think
that's true. Well, oh wait, is it

436
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:19,490
rang a Tan. I just, it was making me think
of planet of the apes where it's like,

437
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,380
oh yeah. Yep. And I got met.
Everybody made fun of what's his face,

438
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:29,060
just fell and potato with the knee.
I always did potato Po. Tay told,

439
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:33,740
I think I used to smell,
I mean spell tomato with an e at the end.

440
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,660
Cause the toe. Yeah. It's like
does it toe. So we're both done.

441
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:43,870
Well that's why we found
each other. That's right.

442
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,440
Cause there was no one to be on
the day going like, oh my God,

443
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:51,300
this person's an idiot. We were both
gone like, wow, this person gets me.

444
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,210
I'm excited for your birthday tomorrow.

445
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,720
You'll never find Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.
Yeah you are.

446
00:26:57,721 --> 00:26:59,610
You're very resigned this year.

447
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:04,350
I've noticed even now talking about it
as much because I'm in the writer's room.

448
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:05,790
I know what's going to happen.
My birthday.

449
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,160
I'm going to fucking go to the writer's
room and stare at a computer all day.

450
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,320
Yeah.

451
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,320
What if this person says this and then
called back to that story til still

452
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:20,580
track. But they'll probably
give you a cake at the office.

453
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,770
No, cause there's somebody
whose birthday was yesterday.

454
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,230
That was the oh yeah.
You guys have somebody's first day.

455
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:32,940
Today's the ninth in mind is
Friday. Yeah. If they get a cake,

456
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,690
if they get me a cake,
it's because they all want cake.

457
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,810
Um, no. I know what I
wanna do for my birthday.

458
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,600
What do you want to do for
your birthday? Um, tell me.

459
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,270
Well,
you know,

460
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,690
in a perfect world my back would be fine
and I'd take you up in the helicopter

461
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,830
with an instructor. Of course, you
know. Oh, that'll be fun. Yeah.

462
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:00,620
And we'd fly over the ocean and I'd
be singing where no more nurture our

463
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,510
[inaudible]. I would do
that. My name is John Dacre.

464
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,460
I name is John Dacre.
That's my favorite fucking thing ever.

465
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:17,160
I just doubled more than
any question in the world.

466
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,880
[inaudible] Mori,

467
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,810
what's the first religious
song you sing? So, oh, um,

468
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,700
[inaudible] I like when he's feeling
good. He goes, when he entered his skull,

469
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,180
oh

470
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,230
hey.
Had a fucking meltdown.

471
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,680
She was on TV and he just got in his
fucking head and I don't think he'd ever

472
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:50,100
been in his head in his life.

473
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,060
I bet he's a really cerebral guy and he
couldn't understand that for the first

474
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:58,470
time ever. His head, his brain was failing
him. He was really looking around like,

475
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,270
I'm just as confused.
Spot this as you are.

476
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,700
Then he choked and I feel like
in church or wherever it is,

477
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:07,890
because the woman playing the piano,
she is like,

478
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,720
I guess she gives lessons in that town.
And I,

479
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,580
I'm sure that insurance,
he kills it.

480
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:18,520
But then he's in that public access
studio. I don't think it kills a camera.

481
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,800
I think he can change his legs.
He just,

482
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:27,450
he can carry a tune and they bury them
in with like 40 people around them.

483
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,930
Right, right, right. He's
probably still weird.

484
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,370
What kind of car are you think he drives?

485
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:38,390
It's something very old and something
like tragically unhip Brown,

486
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,250
Brown. He drives a
brown, a brown interior.

487
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,860
Like it's this brown on Brown.
Yeah.

488
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,200
It's like an old Pontiac
Bonneville [inaudible]

489
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,320
then old Napoli.

490
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,240
Oldsmobiles [inaudible]
my name is John Dacre.

491
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,870
My name is John Dacre.
Let them fuck.

492
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,980
There's so much. You guys have
to see this. No, no. I already,

493
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:10,360
I already talked to him.
I do love it.

494
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,890
We got a table read, so I got to go over
my lines here today. They're Nino. Um,

495
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,810
Bebo. Let me a, I gotta do a little,
some reeds here. All right. Helix.

496
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,340
Helicase I don't know. Uh, your
helix, probably helix. Helix.

497
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,813
Your unique.

498
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:31,110
You don't walk like anyone else talk like
anyone else or sleep like anyone else.

499
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:37,030
So why is your mattress one size fits all?

500
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,930
I don't know cause we're all
basically the same height. You know,

501
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,400
unless you're like an NBA freak because
a truly customized mattress will cost

502
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:49,540
you five to 10 10,000 bucks until now.
Now

503
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:56,190
my name is John Dacre. Go to
Hu calyx, sleep.com answered.

504
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,590
He looks sleep.com I keep
thinking of the band for a answer,

505
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:04,570
a few simple questions and they'll run
a three d biochemical model of your body

506
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:09,990
through the proprietary algorithms
they've developed with the help of the

507
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,970
world's leading ergonomics
and biomechanics.

508
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,040
It's like just to troll me biomechanics
experts as a mistake. You know why?

509
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,510
Because my brain is already going.
All right,

510
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:22,990
so they take a three d image of your
body and then that's on the Internet

511
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:25,810
somewhere, right? It's
a custom mattress. Yeah.

512
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:28,720
But any information goes on the Internet.
People can hack in.

513
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,890
So someone hacks in and see what that,

514
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,830
they take that five 11 now and then they
make some blow up doll of your body and

515
00:31:35,831 --> 00:31:39,370
then someone's fucking a rubber version
of you will here in the Pacific with the

516
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,960
bill birthdays. All again. Yeah. This is,

517
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:47,050
I have a theory about the internet.
I don't give a fuck what it is.

518
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:49,900
Somebody's jerking off to
it. I don't care. Yeah.

519
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,090
There's somebody that
gets excited about a,

520
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:56,620
a kid getting dragged around by his ankle,
by a fucking gorilla.

521
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,800
I used to say that about
the goodwill to like,

522
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:02,740
you didn't like it because you
just assume that everyone just,

523
00:32:02,741 --> 00:32:06,120
just on that thing,
like all the clothes and all that,

524
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,900
like really cool vintage stuff.
You're like,

525
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:10,450
I don't want something that
somebody just on. And I'm like,

526
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:13,930
why do you automatically go
to somebody just on something?

527
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,190
Cause if people are animals,

528
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,400
cause people show go out to
public events in their bare feet.

529
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,800
That's why you want this sweatpants.

530
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,750
You want somebody old couch,
everything's been fucked on or it's just,

531
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:29,200
that's gross animals. All right,
let's continue with the advertising

532
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,800
helix. Yeah, I doubt the band was
called Helix also, by the way. Yes,

533
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:40,490
they were. Oh, are you sure? Like
you've heard of like a double helix,

534
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,700
like that's not what they're talking
about. Oh No, it wasn't that deep. Oh,

535
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:49,030
give me your door. Oh, she, okay.

536
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,090
And what'd you're gonna do?
Rock. They don't remember.

537
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,290
There's deep lyrics back in the 80s.
Helux Helix,

538
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,930
Helix customers report a 30%
improvement in overall sleep quality.

539
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:03,440
I should really do this with my site.
And for couples,

540
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:08,390
they customize each side of the mattress.
Ooh, wow. We get along so much better.

541
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:09,860
Um,

542
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,270
your mattress arrives at your door in
about one week and shipping is 100% free.

543
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,250
That's why everyone from
Gq magazine to Forbes,

544
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,860
they're all talking about helix sleep.

545
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:24,020

they'll pick it up for free,

546
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,330
gross and give you 100% refund.
No questions asked.

547
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,250
I want to try to say interest. You're
ruining it for, hey, what is that state?

548
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:38,570

You sons of bitches.

616
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,090
Hey,
what's going on?

617
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:51,091
It's still the Monday
morning podcast and uh,

618
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,740
same in Raleigh, Durham airport,
which I don't know if it's,

619
00:38:56,741 --> 00:38:59,890
I think they actually have the balls
to call us an international airport.

620
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,630
I'm not sure. I don't think
it's international cause
the lines went that long.

621
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:10,270
Uh, yeah. That's one of the dumbest
things I've ever fucking said.

622
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,870
Let gets her lash and the
lines went that long. Really?

623
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,090
He didn't see anybody on
a fucking Jeannie rug.

624
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,720
So you don't think that flies
anywhere else? You idiot. All right.

625
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:24,070
I'm not in a good mood. Why
Bill? Why aren't you in a
good mood? I'll tell you why.

626
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:27,790
Because, uh, your cousin
in Raleigh, North Carolina,

627
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,150
there's no fucking connected,
no direct flights to Los Angeles.

628
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,010
So for some fucking reason I asked,
Oh God,

629
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,680
the lady with the voice
[inaudible] hang on a second.

630
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:43,750
Every five seconds. Yes. Okay. All right.

631
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,500
Okay. Correct. Phone message. What? You
don't have a cell phone with friends?

632
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,470
We have that number, right? Unbelievable.

633
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,050
Pick up a courtesy phone.

634
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,210
That's so fucking stupid.
Everybody has cell phones.

635
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:05,860
Why would you use that archaic
form in an airport? Okay.

636
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:09,620
Whatever. Uh, anyways. Yeah.
So I'm in Raleigh at, uh,

637
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,060
I want to get to La for some fucking
reason. I have to fly to Cleveland first.

638
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,880
And uh, it's annoying enough when
you have a connecting flight,

639
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:19,421
but you know,

640
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:24,340
why can't it be in a city that's at least
going in the direction that I want to

641
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:27,690
go? I'm going to go fucking
West. I want better.

642
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,650
They're making me fly north a
little bit west. But you know,

643
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,080
at the end of the day, it's fucking north
going north of the Mason Dixon line,

644
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,420
you know, Mason Dixon Line
just to keep, uh, yeah.

645
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,140
What does that leave the ladies
fucking so fucking loud over there.

646
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,550
Why is it, you know, in
society, why can't I just,

647
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,830
why can't you just lean over to her right
now and just be like, hey, Hey lady. Hey.

648
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,250
Yeah you do.
Could you shut the fuck up please?

649
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:02,430
Or at the very least get you talk a
lot quieter because no one gives a fuck

650
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,970
about whatever the fuck it is
that you're yelling about it much.

651
00:41:06,971 --> 00:41:11,230
You stupid fucking board meeting.
You know what I mean?

652
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,030
Who the fuck are you talking
to? It's fucking, I guess
it's 10 25 in the morning.

653
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:22,230
You know what's annoying me as she's
talking really loud and her eyebrows or

654
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,220
it's full fucking mast. Uh, Jesus.

655
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:32,380
Is there anybody even listened
to these announcements? How?

656
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:35,630
Look at this person coming,
buddy. She's got the, uh,

657
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:39,470
the p diddy syndrome or
the Shaquille O'neal Syndrome.

658
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,010
You know those, you know those
people. Uh, okay. As on a Cosby shirt.

659
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,720
You know those people who fucking,

660
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,830
their mouths are open even
when they're not talking.

661
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,190
Can I call that P diddy syndrome?
Is that what you call a bill? Yeah,

662
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:57,590
that is what I call it.
All right.

663
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,190
I have a flask of time on
Rpm that I'm going to be,

664
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,750
I'm going to be taking, but I can't take
it because I have a connecting flight,

665
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,590
so I'm going to stay awake till
I get to Cleveland. By the way,

666
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:14,210
my flight to Cleveland is delayed,
you know, they said because of wind,

667
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,240
you know what I mean? Really rough wind,
which I don't really understand. You know,

668
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,760
it's like, isn't that how the
fucking plane gets off the ground?

669
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:28,850
You wait for Augusta wind and your drive
into it. You know? I mean, granted,

670
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:30,710
I never took a physics class.
I was getting you.

671
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:32,720
I don't even know how to fucking
plane gets off the ground,

672
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,680
which is one of the reasons why I
have such a fear of flying pick of,

673
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:37,880
I actually understood it.

674
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,970
If anybody listening to this could
actually explain in layman's terms how a

675
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:45,800
fucking 10 ton piece of metal

676
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:52,450
with a bunch of people and various forms
of physical condition condition can get

677
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:56,810
off the goddamn ground, actually
get out, gets off the ground.

678
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,000
I just don't understand how
it stays off the ground.

679
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:03,960
Like I can get off the ground, I
can take a running leap, you know,

680
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,740
and for good 0.8 seconds,
I am actually airborne,

681
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:11,540
but I quickly come crashing down to
the ground and roll my fucking ankle.

682
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,870
You know, it's kind of like a boat to
how the fuck does a boat that sank.

683
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,500
You know what I mean?
Dave,

684
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,020
he just displaced the weight
across the water and spill.

685
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,590
I don't, I don't, you know,

686
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,350
then a bunch of people get on
and then it still doesn't sink.

687
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:31,580
It just goes down into the water
a little bit more. All right.

688
00:43:31,581 --> 00:43:35,330
I think we've established that Jesus
Christ will on this guy is dressed,

689
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:40,400
he's got some guy he looks
like he should be yodeling.

690
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:47,190
He has on khaki shorts that about five
inches above his knee from sort of brown,

691
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:52,450
low cut suede hiking shoes
with ankle below the ankle.

692
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:58,010
Black socks. He just needs like, I
think, what do you call it? A shaft.

693
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,260
One of those sticks with the,
with the curl on it.

694
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,440
Jesus Christ.

695
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:08,270
He's probably going to a whore house
and this looks like he has some sort of

696
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:13,160
twisted fetish. I wonder what's in
that briefcase. He's drinking coffee,

697
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,640
but he's trying to appear
normal. Um, anyways,

698
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:20,690
if you're a new to this page, uh,
this is the Monday morning podcast.

699
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:24,260
I do one of these every single week.
I hype upcoming gigs.

700
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:29,470
I rant about both ships and people send
me questions and I tried to answer to

701
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:34,710
the best of my ability.
And uh,

702
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,800
yeah,
that's about it.

703
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,410
And I gotta admit my computer is tucked
away in my bag and I don't know what the

704
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:47,580
fuck the questions off for the second,
second week in a row.

705
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:52,050
You know what it is? I have one of the,
I have one of those g four Max. I met my,

706
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:56,910
uh, laptop was about four years old
and uh, actually have legs on it,

707
00:44:56,911 --> 00:45:01,380
like an old TV and a in an
antenna fucking older, right.

708
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:05,290
And the battery Evidentaly
is defective. So, uh,

709
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:10,170
when I turned it on, it loses battery
power about nine seconds. Actually.

710
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,160
We'll say I have 75% battery
power and then it says, um, um,

711
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:18,150
two seconds. I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about. All right,

712
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,780
let's just get to the shit I
have coming up in my career.

713
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:25,690
I had stand up on the guys' choice awards,
uh,

714
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:28,770
for Spike TV and that is going to be a,

715
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:35,210
it's going to be airing on June
22nd Sunday night on Spike TV.

716
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,870
Uh, it's actually a pretty big award
show. I was very amazed at the, a

717
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:46,200
level of a celebrity that was there.
It's like Harrison Ford.

718
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,210
Cameron is Jeremy Pivot, you know
what I mean? Spike TV, no offense.

719
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:56,211
But I thought it was going to be like
Lee majors and Micky Dolenz and me,

720
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,670
you know, that's what I thought I was
going to be. And then I showed up.

721
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:04,470
I was like, Holy Shit. You know that Steve
Carell's? Yes, it is. Isn't that amazing?

722
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:09,060
And uh, I was not sitting
seated at his table. I was uh,

723
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,950
I was seated at a table.
I don't know what the fuck one guy was,

724
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:18,810
a reality show director. And the rest of
them were a seat filling horse. I think.

725
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,050
Um, at least that's what it said
on there. Uh, the name tag. Um,

726
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:30,120
so anyways, all right, let's get
to the podcast questions that, uh,

727
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:33,930
that I can remember. Uh,
buck with the announcement.

728
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:36,040
Can you maintain she please

729
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,700
fucking airports they make you hate.
I mean,

730
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:47,400
Goddamn flight is delayed.
I'm actually looking, uh,

731
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,740
first horrific thought I had at a day.

732
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,610
I have the USA Today paper
in front of me. And, uh,

733
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:59,000
one of the pictures they have as of,
uh,

734
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:03,870
this guy looks like he's in the bowling
Joey. I can describe them all right?

735
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:09,750
He's got a checkered shirt on with
a t shirt underneath it. And, uh,

736
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,780
he's about up to his man tits and water
hanging onto a rubber raft that has

737
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:16,890
some,
a coastguard looking guy in it.

738
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,520
He's basically too fat to
get in the fucking boat. Um,

739
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:26,660
and he's walking along and it said Midwest
storm turns deadly and says a seven

740
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:33,290
reported dead at the tornadoes and heavy
rain pound states in the heartland.

741
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,940
So I'm like, wow, that's, you know,

742
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:42,420
at least I'm not fucking up to
my man tits and a rain water,

743
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,570
you know, it's probably eels and
fucking water moccasins and shit.

744
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:52,770
But then there's a part of me because
there's so many goddamn people is a kind

745
00:47:52,981 --> 00:47:56,080
of happy, you know, wash away a few,

746
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,740
like the traffic go down a little bit.
There's not a fucking terrible thought,

747
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,210
but I actually,
I actually think that shit

748
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,130
underneath that it says a
FDA's tomato warnings grow.

749
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,900
This is all the happy
news I've looked at today.

750
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:13,920
Outbreak of Salmonella from raw tomatoes
spreads to 16 states with up to 150

751
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,760
people reported ill.
You know,

752
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:21,430
now a lot of people would look
at that like that's a bad thing.

753
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,930
But I look at it like,
look,

754
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:28,770
those 150 people fucking die from eating
tomatoes or at the very least get some

755
00:48:31,061 --> 00:48:35,860
horrific cases of diarrhea where
they're not going to get into a car. Uh,

756
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:39,790
you know, the roads would be a
little bit clearer. You know,

757
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,060
somebody, I guess, uh, this
is the only happy news.

758
00:48:43,061 --> 00:48:47,830
They don't have one fucking happy thing
on the front page. What do we got here?

759
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:54,270
US gas average $4 and rising and then
they have a cartoon picture of a hand

760
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:58,360
squeezing a house with money
falling out of the bottom.

761
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,670
You know what the funny thing is is if
they didn't even bring this shit up,

762
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,990
I wouldn't even know it was happening.

763
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,500
Who would know that housing
houses were fucking, uh,

764
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:14,020
the values dropping? How would you even
know that if they didn't bring it up?

765
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,000
Why don't they just stopped talking about
it and we're all walking around like

766
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:22,840
happy idiots will continue to spend
our money in malls and there won't be a

767
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:26,620
recession.
You know what,

768
00:49:26,621 --> 00:49:28,600
that might be the second
dumbest thing I've ever said.

769
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:34,150
You know something I really resent the
way fucking pilots got to dress like they

770
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:37,060
were on the love boat. You
know what I mean? What is this?

771
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:39,130
What is an awful fucking uniform?
Now?

772
00:49:39,131 --> 00:49:41,230
Of course he's going to sit next
to me so I can't make fun of them.

773
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:44,470
You know what I mean? I
hate like the, the, the,

774
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:48,010
the shoulder pads with the stripes
on them, you know what I mean?

775
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:54,550
If they just came back from
battle as opposed to a round
trip to fucking Seattle,

776
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:00,520
you know what I mean? I don't
know. As a shops at target,

777
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:05,950
it's going to go shiny golf shirts
on and those Seinfeld white sneakers,

778
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:11,680
you know what? There isn't one well
dressed person in Raleigh, Durham airport.

779
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:16,480
I keep thinking everybody has on a Cosby
show, but it's the same fucking guy.

780
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:20,800
He just keeps pacing back and forth.
So every time, you know, I look up,

781
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:23,140
he's on my right and then I
look, looked down, I looked up,

782
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:28,160
he's on my left and I think it's a
different guy ladies. Definitely a mother.

783
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,780
You here with the little
personal size pizza,

784
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,720
mothering hips swinging to and fro
guys a psycho.

785
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,580
Look at him,
get a backpack.

786
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:45,240
Probably tried to hike the Appalachian
trail. Get fucking Ricketts.

787
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,780
Umm. All right. So, uh, yeah,

788
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:55,760
the fuck was I talking about?
My girlfriend wants to see Kung Fu panda.

789
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,680
That's what I have to look forward to when
I get back to la. She wants to see it.

790
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:03,290
God damn cartoon about
some fucking martial arts.

791
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:08,480
Why would a fucking pants, I need to
learn Kung Fu. You know what I mean?

792
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:15,520
Why would I need how to throw kicks when
everybody knows that a bear naturally

793
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,250
just has that like you.

794
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:21,860
Have you ever seen like a watch
discovery channel and show up?

795
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:26,950
They're killing like a, uh, I don't
know. Fucking Yak, whatever. What,

796
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,840
what the fuck did they
kill an elk or deer?

797
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,220
They don't come up and grab it by
the throat. All right. All messy.

798
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,330
Like all those other creditors, they have
the bears come up. They have like that,

799
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:42,530
that fucking, how do you describe
it? Got fucking bionic bitch slap.

800
00:51:42,531 --> 00:51:46,970
You know what I mean? Just
Bam. Just breaks their neck.

801
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:49,520
So right there,
that's the grizzly bear fruit.

802
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:53,420
The equivalent of the one inch punch.
Will you stop yelling?

803
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:59,330
I think she kind of heard me on that.
She's literally looking at me screaming.

804
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:04,100
Can you hear a voice?
She one of those fucking women.

805
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,470
I hate women who are like 40 years
old and they talk like they ate

806
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,760
probably like guys killer wise. So
while they just get sick of their voice,

807
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:21,050
this guy, what a stupid fucking thing to
say. You know what? This is the bills.

808
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:23,870
A more on podcast today.
I'm just in a bad fucking mood.

809
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:29,200
Fucking plane was supposed to take off
at 10 1510 45 I got some 40 year old lady

810
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:35,690
with a kid's voice screaming and then I
got the the pie. Oh fuck my plane's here.

811
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,100
That, you know, it's funny,

812
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:44,450
the plane that I'm flying from
Raleigh Durham International Airport,

813
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:47,650
Esquire is uh,

814
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,920
actually looks like the kind of plane
that Tom Cruise flies crying himself.

815
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,300
You know, I was getting excited when I
see those, cause I imagine that, you know,

816
00:52:56,301 --> 00:53:00,770
I'm a fucking rock star and I'm getting
on it by myself as opposed to the fact

817
00:53:00,771 --> 00:53:05,240
that I'm getting onto it with 40 other
people. This is how fucked up Raleigh,

818
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:07,960
North Carolina is as far as a,
uh,

819
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,670
airport goes the plane.

820
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:15,560
I actually flew down here from New
York City and I flew down here on a, a,

821
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:17,990
a plane that had propellers.
I'm not even lying to you,

822
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:22,760
but it was a new plane and I was
like, wow, they still going with this.

823
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,410
You know what I mean?
And it was one of those deals,

824
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:30,530
there was so few people on the flight
that I was sitting in like feet five a and

825
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:35,440
they go, sorry, excuse
me, excuse me there.

826
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:41,190
And I'm like, bitch, fucking bitch. What?
Excuse me, bitch. And she's like, sir,

827
00:53:41,191 --> 00:53:43,350
I don't need to listen. Okay. I didn't
say that. That's what I was thinking.

828
00:53:43,351 --> 00:53:47,250
I just said, I said, uh, I said yes,

829
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,550
but the underlying, the way
I said it was like, what?

830
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,100
And she's like,

831
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,820
I need you to move to the back of the
plane so we can redistribute the weight.

832
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:00,750
You know what I mean?
And it's like, really?

833
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:04,920
You're basically telling me if I
don't go to the back of this plane,

834
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,390
that it's gonna like what fucking tip
over when we go, when we go to take off.

835
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:14,400
I think that makes me feel as a
customer, you know what I mean?

836
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:19,980
But you know, they don't give
a shit fucking hilarious.

837
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,780
She makes me move back, but she
sits up front, you know what I mean?

838
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,010
And when that stupid little fold
down stewardess chair, it's like,

839
00:54:29,011 --> 00:54:33,660
why don't you sit in the
back? I'm a customer. Okay,

840
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,010
I want to stay here. And this lady
dressed like my fourth grade teacher.

841
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:40,080
Wow.

842
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:45,080
Black on black suit with Bruce Lee
Kung Fu shoes and a shiny pink blouse

843
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,950
underneath it. I don't know if she's
dressed like my fourth grade teacher.

844
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,310
When Nancy Reagan one or the other hand.
She did.

845
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:01,860
He's dressed like a
first lady. Uh, fuck me.

846
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:06,660
All right. Wow. Ooh, let's
get with these fucking, oh,

847
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,090
you guys in the planes.
That's why he's shirts so bright.

848
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,720
So I assured so Brighton,
his mustache is so short.

849
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:17,750
That girl does not trim her Bush.
You can just tell. Just tell.

850
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:20,280
She's going all natural.
I don't know what it is about her.

851
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:25,110
That lady there has an above ground
swimming pool and her hug. Yeah,

852
00:55:25,111 --> 00:55:27,970
look at that shoulder tattoo.
I fucking nailed it. I know it.

853
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:32,370
Above ground swimming pool
made stuffed crust pizza

854
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:37,590
guy there was good at basketball
because he's in shape.

855
00:55:37,591 --> 00:55:39,480
He's black and he has
dreadlocks right there,

856
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,240
which means he's like the sixth man.
You haven't noticed that.

857
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,440
The black dudes with the dreadlocks, they
like rebound guy. You know what I mean?

858
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:50,580
There's never been a Michael Jordan
style player with dreadlocks.

859
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:55,260
You got dreadlocks and you
play in the NBA. You, uh,

860
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:59,050
you get like fucking 12
rebounds a game and uh,

861
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,900
you can knock out 12 old ladies with
your fucking elbow. I don't know what.

862
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,990
All right. I ran out of
references there. Wow.

863
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,450
Pre Pant Khakis of pretense.
There you go. You're married.

864
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:15,870
There's no reason to give a fuck anymore.
Why would you dress like that?

865
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:20,040
Look at this black guy. Hey. Go. Huh? He's
still going with the extra baggy shit.

866
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,100
Wow. That look was like
10 ago. Remember that one?

867
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:29,360
Fuck guys would go to footlocker and
they would find those a quadruple fucking

868
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,080
XLT shirts even though
they were five foot six.

869
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:36,660
I always thought they look
like a, you know, like at the,

870
00:56:36,661 --> 00:56:39,070
a bang of broad over
there in the next morning.

871
00:56:39,071 --> 00:56:43,400
Now she gets up and put some
money, a tee shirts. Um,

872
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:47,590
all right. I'm just making fun of
people. Not because I'm like, well,

873
00:56:47,591 --> 00:56:48,570
I am kind of a concept,

874
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:51,760
but I'm just making fun of me because I
don't have my podcast questions in front

875
00:56:51,761 --> 00:56:52,690
of me. So, uh,

876
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,400
why don't we hide some upcoming gigs
and lady looks like Robert Plant from

877
00:56:57,401 --> 00:57:01,840
behind. Oh, it's the same fucking lady.
She's got all kinds of lists going on.

878
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,900
What happened to Robert
Plant? Man, Jesus Christ,

879
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:11,440
that kind of a great write up to age 46
and all of a sudden now he looks like he

880
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:14,670
should be in like a children's
book. Like, like one of those, uh,

881
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,590
like a troll. I don't know. What about
a fairy tale? That's what it looks like.

882
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:25,270
Robert Plant looks like. He looks like
he's in a fairytale. You know what I mean?

883
00:57:25,271 --> 00:57:25,991
Is this is,

884
00:57:25,991 --> 00:57:30,280
this is a cruel thing about life
is even if you stay in shape,

885
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:34,660
life is still going to make you
look awful because for some reason,

886
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,880
even if you stay at your high
school, wait, you fucking
head never stops growing.

887
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:45,880
So if you don't get a little out of shape,
if you look fucking ridiculous,

888
00:57:45,881 --> 00:57:50,170
you look like a,
I just lost my train of thought.

889
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:54,930
The finest stuff taking this
time on a PM. No, you're not.

890
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:57,660
You look like if you've
seen that fucking guy. Uh,

891
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,570
he's like 45 years old and he shredded,

892
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:07,140
I might've talked about this last
week again with the Mike Epps had um,

893
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,130
you know, the guy late, late at night,
he does all the physical fitness shit.

894
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,520
He's like 46 year old
years old and he shredded,

895
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:20,850
but for some reason he still looks weird
and it's his head because his head,

896
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,620
I know it's not the head,

897
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:26,530
it's your fucking knows it's
your ears or something like that.

898
00:58:26,531 --> 00:58:29,470
Something about your head.
It just keeps getting bigger.

899
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:33,910
Like classic example is Ted Kennedy.
Okay.

900
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,620
Ted Kennedy has been in the news lately,

901
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,400
has got a fucking brain
tumor or something. Right.

902
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:43,480
If you will get that guy's
head in the sixties Brandon,

903
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:47,200
all those Kennedy's had big heads.
You know what I mean?

904
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:50,140
It's one of the reasons why two of
them got, got, got assassinated.

905
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:53,430
It's like there was no way to miss.

906
00:58:57,890 --> 00:59:01,210
That's just fucking me. It really is.
But I got to tell you something, man.

907
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,590
I saw Ted Kennedy,

908
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:07,710
I shook his hand one time and his head
is as big as the seat that I'm sitting

909
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:12,070
and he has been the biggest fucking
head I've ever like. It wasn't, it was,

910
00:59:12,071 --> 00:59:16,570
I believe I was just staring at it.
I couldn't fuck and I got a big hit,

911
00:59:16,571 --> 00:59:21,470
but this guy's fucking hap
was pretty huge. And uh,

912
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:24,820
you probably want to, how did
I meet him? I actually, uh,

913
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,860
I fucking shook his hand and Bill
Clinton's hand, the long fucking story.

914
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,080
Just remind me,
I'll tell it to you next week.

915
00:59:33,081 --> 00:59:37,940
Let's stay on track you with how big his
fucking head is. I just kept looking.

916
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:42,790
I just could not believe the size of like,
I just want it to like,

917
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:48,140
ah, I wish there was a way to just like
hold his head just to see how much it

918
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:52,250
weighed. You know, I, I'm not even joking.

919
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,160
I bet his head ways, like, like 27 pounds,

920
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:01,460
27 fucking pounds. When you think about
that, you know who out there lift weights,

921
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,300
you know that when you're doing your
warmup set and he grabbed like, yeah,

922
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:09,320
well let's, let's go with 35
to 35 pound plates. You know,

923
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:12,560
plan you can do with one hand.
You know what they should have.

924
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:17,060
They should have like part of
the strong man competition.

925
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:18,980
Instead of those little
kettle balls there,

926
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:23,981
they should have like little Kennedy
hats and each one of them gets a,

927
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:28,490
it's a stupid idea, you know, that's
why I don't have a fucking show on TV.

928
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:33,800
All right, let, let's, let's get to
skip the hype in the upcoming gigs. Um,

929
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,060
first of all, I just was in Raleigh, North
Carolina at a good night's comedy club.

930
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:42,890
I want to thank everybody who came out
to the shows. I had a great time and, uh,

931
01:00:42,891 --> 01:00:47,891
I got drunk every night down at the bar
downstairs and I watch myself x go up

932
01:00:48,591 --> 01:00:52,340
two games to none and a,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

933
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:56,570
I didn't know watch one selfie game
all year. I fucking hate pro hoop

934
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:02,000
fro who is the worst. Like,
it's just too goddamn long.

935
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,140
You Watch college basketball,
it's exciting. The crowd's
into it and it's over.

936
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:10,760
It seems like it's over in an hour
pro hoop with,

937
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:14,990
with the fucking files and the timeouts.
And I mean that final five minutes,

938
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:20,120
final five minutes, it takes like
45 minutes to play to the point.

939
01:01:20,121 --> 01:01:21,530
You don't even give a shit anymore.

940
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,060
But I'm a little test to Phil
Jackson for bitching about the files.

941
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:30,710
You know what I mean? Fucking baby. I
can tell you right now, if you gamble,

942
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:32,240
would definitely bet on the Lakers.

943
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:37,070
Definitely done on the Lakers on game
three because they are going to call 9,000

944
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:42,670
files on the fucking Celtics because
Phil Jackson's a fucking baby.

945
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:47,850
You know what I mean? Give
me a goddamn break. Well,

946
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:50,810
what about that guy in the Lakers
who stop dribbling at half court,

947
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:54,690
ran the west rest of the way and dunk
the ball and they didn't call traveling.

948
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:57,680
What about that? Okay, you're getting
calls too. I don't want to hear it.

949
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:04,280
Um, and also that two, three,
two playoff system is bullshit.

950
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:06,501
You know what I mean?

951
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:09,920
You give home court advantage to the
fucking visitor through game five.

952
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,530
They keep saying the Celtics
have home court. They don't.

953
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:16,720
The next three games are in la. We get
to spend a fucking weak out there, man.

954
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:21,450
Have you maintain chain please with the
person who wears their current next to

955
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:26,280
the deal jail please report to the
fucking front office. All right.

956
01:02:26,281 --> 01:02:30,020
I'm starting to talk way too
loud with Tourette's. Um,

957
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:36,600
I dunno man. I thought the Lakers were
going to beat us and like six games.

958
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:38,820
I thought they were going to crush us.
I'm really impressed.

959
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,480
Ray Allen keeps hitting his shots.
Uh,

960
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:46,230
we're just going to have to weather the
storm. I think Colby is going to get 30,

961
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:48,540
40 every game and if we can just somehow

962
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:53,340
weather that storm, uh, I dunno.

963
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:57,890
I still think it's going
seven games and uh, I dunno,

964
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,960
it's gun. It's going to be
great. It's going to be great.

965
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:05,370
I just don't watch ESPN anymore.
Fucking jackets. So overhype everything.

966
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,440
Look at this lady,
Jesus Christ.

967
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:10,910
She's never committed a crime
in their life and gay. My taxis,

968
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:14,900
I go to church every week. I
have a little tote bag like, hey,

969
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,390
and I packed the exact
perfect amount of clothes.

970
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:24,480
I don't swallow. I'm a man. I'm
getting crude on these podcasts.

971
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:28,860
I got to stop with this. Okay. All
right, well that was a good 25 minutes.

972
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:29,820
There you go. Visit, visit.

973
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:34,070
Good damn near half hour of us silliness
to get your week started off right. Oh,

974
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,550
Paul, you guys have a, uh,

975
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:42,000
have a great week and uh,
you know something, you know,

976
01:03:42,001 --> 01:03:44,160
just, just be happy. You don't
travel for a living. And Andy,

977
01:03:44,161 --> 01:03:45,270
if you travel for a living,

978
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:50,400
you know my condolences because
this shit is ridiculous. Um,

979
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:54,540
but anyways, upcoming gigs,
uh, like I said, Spike TV,

980
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:57,290
the guy's choice awards,
uh, June 20 seconds.

981
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:01,320
First Time I ever did award show and uh,
I killed on it.

982
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:05,460
Hopefully a,
it will come across that way on TV.

983
01:04:05,461 --> 01:04:07,890
You never know what
happens in post production,

984
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:11,100
but I was really excited to do that.
And uh,

985
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:16,110
I'm going to be at the
punchline in Atlanta on Jesus
Christ as testimony memory.

986
01:04:16,111 --> 01:04:20,210
I think it's June 19th through the 21st.
The date should be right there. Uh,

987
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:20,971
what else do I got?

988
01:04:20,971 --> 01:04:25,350
I got Pittsburgh coming up and uh,

989
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,430
fuck what else do I have the
Improv in Miami in August.

990
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:33,090
That's all I can really remember for
the summer because I'm getting old.

991
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:38,360
Speaking of which my 40th birthday is
tomorrow and uh oh well the love of right

992
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,870
with the person who let the fat slug.

993
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:47,880
We have a bag of button down near the,
the conquests.

994
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,710
Oh is this me? This is me. Okay.

995
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:57,870
The board and my slight thanks for hanging
out with me is I waited for my, uh,

996
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:01,800
my trip back to La via Cleveland

997
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:07,890
flying to fucking Cleveland.
I just wish, uh, I dunno.

998
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,950
I wish I wasn't going to Cleveland.
All right, that's it. Um,

999
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,830
please keep the podcast questions coming.
I'm going to do,

1000
01:05:13,831 --> 01:05:17,170
I'm going to answer like 9 million podcast
questions next week cause I do have

1001
01:05:17,171 --> 01:05:21,010
all of them in my fucking,
my old ass left.

1002
01:05:21,011 --> 01:05:25,870
My laptop is made out of wood. Thank you.
That's how fucking old it is. All right,

1003
01:05:25,871 --> 01:05:28,960
I'm getting on the plane. I'm
going to take some more. No,

1004
01:05:28,961 --> 01:05:32,180
I can't take Tylenol pm cause I'll sleep
through my fucking connecting flights

1005
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:36,820
and I'm going to take it after I get
a, after I get on the, uh, like, oh,

1006
01:05:36,821 --> 01:05:38,050
you want to get something
fucking hilarious?

1007
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:41,830
I called my dad yesterday and I wished
him a happy father's day. And he's like,

1008
01:05:41,831 --> 01:05:44,950
son, I love you to death, but it's
next Sunday. He had dumped, fuck.

1009
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,960
So and then he wished me a happy birthday
for tomorrow. And I was like, yeah,

1010
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:54,370
well my birthday's on Tuesday. That's
where I get it. You're all dumb. Fuck.

1011
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:58,450
And that's our relationship and
that acute family little story.

1012
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,960
All right, I'm gonna leave access
me and 90 other people here,

1013
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:06,640
so I'm going to get on this
fucking 40 saying okay. All right.

1014
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:09,070
That's it. Thanks for listening. Uh,

1015
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:13,120
please keep the questions coming and
please somebody explain to me how a boat

1016
01:06:13,121 --> 01:06:14,120
floats and how plants.

1017
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,513
All right.
Thank you.

1018
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:00,810
[inaudible] tell you this story.
I'm flying solo show,

1019
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,290
um,
and always working with Nick Kroll.

1020
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,700
You're guaranteed you're going to
laugh your ass off. I'll fucking deck.

1021
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,390
Can I kiss? The kids asked and I
fucking love him. I think he's,

1022
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:15,130
I think he's a fucking
genius. So anyways, um,

1023
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:20,140
I go, I go to the airport
and I'm taking the red eye,

1024
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:24,190
taking this 10 55 flight, nine fucking
stop. Cause that's how I do it.

1025
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,193
All right.

1026
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:28,220
I'm on a good plane.

1027
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:31,940
Why would I want to get off it and switch
and roll the dice and get on another

1028
01:07:31,941 --> 01:07:35,310
one? You know, let's
just fucking get there.

1029
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:40,730
When, when I drive up to San Francisco,
I don't pull over and fucking, uh,

1030
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:44,410
Burbank and then get hit new, another
cup. We get it bill. All right.

1031
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,180
Yeah.

1032
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:49,480
So I get on the fucking
plane, right? I use my miles,

1033
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,180
bumped myself up like a fancy
person, you know, maybe,

1034
01:07:52,181 --> 01:07:54,070
maybe I invented that cheesecake factory.

1035
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:56,680
People are thinking and then they
see how I'm dressed and I go, oh no,

1036
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:59,950
he didn't vent the cheesecake factory.
Um,

1037
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,600
and I go to go to sit down on my
seat and I go to set my bag down.

1038
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:06,990
I was going to set it
down right in front of me.

1039
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,400
And the nice fellow sit next to me,
he goes,

1040
01:08:08,401 --> 01:08:09,690
why don't you stick it in
the middle of this room?

1041
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:11,670
And he moved his bag out of
the way. I'm like, all right,

1042
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:13,200
this guy's a solid dude or whatever.

1043
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:18,300
And then all of a sudden the waitress by
a stewardess, whatever, she comes by, um,

1044
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:21,050
flight attendant, whatever the
fuck you supposed to call him,

1045
01:08:21,051 --> 01:08:25,310
she comes up and she's, uh, can I get
you [inaudible] to Drake? And I was like,

1046
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:29,540
yeah, can I get out? Let me get a
water please. Ice or no ice. What?

1047
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:31,100
However you make it.

1048
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,350
Stop acting like it's a fucking
Martini. It's war, right?

1049
01:08:35,351 --> 01:08:39,100
Just give me a water
with ice. Thank you. Um,

1050
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:45,730
and the, the guy next to me, he orders
the doers. Neat. No Irish, no nothing.

1051
01:08:45,731 --> 01:08:50,380
Just put it in there. So they bring our
drinks. All right. And I'm really thirsty.

1052
01:08:50,381 --> 01:08:54,130
So I start sucking mind down and
he just throws his back. Like,

1053
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:59,020
it's nothing like fucking John Wayne
right before he's going to turn around and

1054
01:08:59,021 --> 01:09:02,980
beat up three guys, three
mustachioed guys in the 1930s. Right?

1055
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:08,530
So, um, I'm just sitting
there and everybody's getting
on the flight, you know,

1056
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:11,840
when I'm looking around at the passengers,
you know,

1057
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:15,160
fucking doing whatever I'm doing and
all of a sudden the guy next to me,

1058
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:20,380
Mr Doers, goes to me, uh, he goes, excuse
me? He goes, are you afraid to fly?

1059
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:25,800
And I looked at him, I was like,
what? He goes, are you afraid to fly?

1060
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:32,270
And I go, no, no, I'm
not. And he goes, he goes,

1061
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:35,220
all right, but you know, it's,
he goes, it's okay. You know,

1062
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:37,620
if it's okay to tell me
if you're afraid to fly,

1063
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:39,343
okay.

1064
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:44,560
And it's immediately getting weird. And
I'm like, no, I'm not afraid to fly.

1065
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,860
And, and I'm thinking in my
head, wait, is he afraid to fly?

1066
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,920
And that's why he's drinking
the way he just drank.

1067
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:54,550
And now he's hoping that I'm going
to be afraid to fly. So he, you know,

1068
01:09:54,970 --> 01:09:59,850
he just wants to open up. That's what
I'm thinking. And I'm like, yeah,

1069
01:09:59,851 --> 01:10:04,700
no, I'm not afraid to fly. And
he won't leave it alone. He goes,

1070
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:08,030
all right, cause you know,
you're, you're, you're fidgeting,

1071
01:10:08,031 --> 01:10:10,100
you're looking around at other passengers.

1072
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:16,030
And I'm sitting there looking at it like,
is this guy fucking serious? And I go,

1073
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:19,930
no. I go, I'm not afraid to fly.
So now I'm like, fuck this guy.

1074
01:10:19,931 --> 01:10:23,230
I'm not talking scaffold rest of flight.
This guy's weird, man. It's like 30,

1075
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:28,210
just get painted pictures like
32 year old. Why are in shape?

1076
01:10:28,211 --> 01:10:29,800
But like, why are we white? Dude,

1077
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:34,730
he's got a skully cap on
with fucking glasses. Um,

1078
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:39,340
you know,
and uh,

1079
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,190
he goes,
uh,

1080
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:45,550
like there's like a minute of silence
and people still getting on the plane.

1081
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:48,280
And then he goes, hey, sorry
about that. So we, we just,

1082
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:52,510
we just got off on the wrong foot. He's
like, my name's so and so. He goes,

1083
01:10:52,511 --> 01:10:57,230
what's your name? And then I'm thinking
in my head like, what's my name?

1084
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,310
My name's frank.

1085
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,150
I wanted to give them like a f by just
some reason I just wanted it's bill.

1086
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,460
And he goes, oh, hey, bill.
And he goes, nice to meet you.

1087
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:09,080
So we shake hands and I'm just looking at,
I don't have any poker face.

1088
01:11:09,081 --> 01:11:11,240
I'm looking at the guy like,
what the fuck is your problem?

1089
01:11:11,241 --> 01:11:14,220
I'm not even trying to,
not my trying to be pleasant.

1090
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:18,480
I'm already done with this guy. So then
the guy goes, oh hey bill. He goes,

1091
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:21,090
why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?
Right?

1092
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:24,960
Like he's fucking interrogating me and I,
I'm like,

1093
01:11:24,961 --> 01:11:29,130
is this guy fucking serious? And I
start doing the math in my head going,

1094
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,070
when is this guy like an air marshal? It's
something. And I'm like, no, he's not.

1095
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:35,400
He's fucking slamming bows over here.
Fuck this guy.

1096
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:41,520
So I just go, I go, look, I don't, I
don't have to answer your questions.

1097
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:48,930
Let's sit. And I just looked
straight forward. He goes, okay,

1098
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,590
now I'm concerned. Okay, I am concerned.

1099
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:57,150
And I'm looking at him like concerned
about what he goes, you're fidgeting your,

1100
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:00,300
you, you, you have issues with other
passengers and blah blah, blah, blah.

1101
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,510
He sucks Peyton like, like this. Like
he's been, I don't know what the fuck,

1102
01:12:03,511 --> 01:12:08,250
like psychologically breaking me down.
All right, so now at this, by this point,

1103
01:12:08,251 --> 01:12:13,251
they've closed the fucking the door to
the fields collage and we're starting to

1104
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:18,850
taxi.
And I just finally looked at the guy,

1105
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:23,950
uh, ag and I go, I go, you know,

1106
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:25,390
I came up with the FY one point.

1107
01:12:25,391 --> 01:12:29,200
I literally stick my hand out cause he
kept saying I was nervous and I stick my

1108
01:12:29,201 --> 01:12:32,580
hand right in front of his
face and I hold it level. Oh,

1109
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:36,400
that's what I did the first time. Yeah. I
hold it level. I'll go, I'm not nervous.

1110
01:12:36,401 --> 01:12:39,940
And he goes, well, anybody can do that.
And that's when I was like, fuck this guy.

1111
01:12:39,941 --> 01:12:42,580
I'm not talking to the guy. Sorry.
Fuck this story up there. And then he,

1112
01:12:42,581 --> 01:12:46,960
then he came back, got my name, now he's
going, why are you going to Indianapolis?

1113
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:51,160
And I find looking at him, I say,
listen pal, I'm drinking waters.

1114
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:56,110
You're drinking doers. Okay, there's
no issue over here. And then he goes,

1115
01:12:56,111 --> 01:12:59,050
it wasn't doers. What she gave me
wasn't doers really. What was it?

1116
01:12:59,051 --> 01:13:02,980
Some sort of spy juice,
you fucking jerk off this point.

1117
01:13:02,981 --> 01:13:07,810
I want to punch him right through his
fucking stupid wirey glasses, right?

1118
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:11,530
So he's going like,

1119
01:13:11,531 --> 01:13:14,170
you look around hostels and I said
something that just ticked him off.

1120
01:13:14,171 --> 01:13:16,540
I was just, yeah, that dude. I go, I don't
have to answer your questions. All right,

1121
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:20,680
leave me alone. And then he
goes, uh, he goes to, he goes,
he starts going like, okay,

1122
01:13:20,681 --> 01:13:24,430
now I am really concerned right now. He
goes, why are you going to Indianapolis?

1123
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:26,050
And I just looked at him,
you know, when I start doing,

1124
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:28,300
I start doing like this Ryan Gosling,

1125
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:32,830
you know that little smirk that fucking
Mona Lisa smile he has is he smirks his

1126
01:13:32,831 --> 01:13:36,610
way through all this fucking movies.
I do go. I go full on Ryan Gosling.

1127
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,750
Now I'm not talking to this guy and I
just keep looking at him and I gave him

1128
01:13:40,751 --> 01:13:44,620
that little half of smirk and I just
shake my head. That's my game now.

1129
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:46,600
That's,
this is Mike.

1130
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:49,930
It's like if you're going to be a Dick
Right now with your fucking delusional

1131
01:13:49,931 --> 01:13:52,270
authority, right? That
you're going to like,

1132
01:13:52,271 --> 01:13:56,650
we're in fucking Guantanamo
and you're gonna waterboard
me, Huh? There's no water,

1133
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,840
there's no board.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1134
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:02,230
Here's my smart and I'm just going to
shake my head at you like you're a fucking

1135
01:14:02,231 --> 01:14:05,950
pathetic human being. This is what I'm
doing, right? And this is the funny thing.

1136
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:09,010
I'm such a Dick. All they have to
say to the guys, I'm a comedian,

1137
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:12,580
I'm going to do a sold out show there
and that would make them back off,

1138
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:16,390
but I'm a dick. I'm like, fuck this
guy. I want to see what this is going.

1139
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:20,140
So now he's all fucking amped
up and he starts droppingF ,

1140
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,680
you know she's saying the f word. He
sitting there going funeral. He goes,

1141
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:26,560
if you don't fucking answer my question
right fucking now I'm going to hit that

1142
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:29,470
call button was sitting there,
taxi and down a fucking getting in line.

1143
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:32,890
I'm going to fucking hit this fucking
button if you blah blah, blah, blah, blah.

1144
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:37,150
And I'm just fucking Mona Lisa smile
going to shake in my head like you are a

1145
01:14:37,151 --> 01:14:41,590
fucking retard, right? So now he
sees saying the f word so much.

1146
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:45,700
The lady who's sitting in
front of me diagonally in
front, right in front of him,

1147
01:14:45,701 --> 01:14:49,690
turns around and looks at us, and
now my heart's racing. I'm like,

1148
01:14:49,691 --> 01:14:52,270
where's this going?
This is going to be great.

1149
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:54,150
I am a hundred percent fucking innocent.

1150
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:58,330
This guy's drunk and I think he's
going to hit that button. Oh,

1151
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:01,600
I got a feeling he's going to hit that
button. What's going to happen? Right?

1152
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:05,230
I want to see what the pilot looks like.
Let's see what the fuck this is going.

1153
01:15:05,231 --> 01:15:07,630
Right? So he goes, if you
don't fuck you, he starts,

1154
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:09,540
he starts bringing his heading
up to the button going,

1155
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,980
I'm going to hit that button.
You don't think I'll fucking do it.

1156
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,800
I'll hit that button and I'm sitting there
smirking and I'm thinking in my head,

1157
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:17,290
go ahead and hit the fucking button.
Let's see what happens.

1158
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,180
Let's see what happens. Right? So finally,

1159
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:22,270
now he wants to hit the button
and he can't fucking find it,

1160
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,900
and it's an in defense of him. I couldn't
find it either. I was looking up there,

1161
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:28,390
I half wanted to hit it myself.
Then he finally,

1162
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:33,040
he finally finds it and he hits it right?
And now I'm just like,

1163
01:15:33,041 --> 01:15:37,240
Holy Shit, what's going to happen? And
he's sitting there going, yeah, Huh,

1164
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:39,850
you want to fucking play this game?
How you want to fucking play this game?

1165
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,440
And I'm surprised.

1166
01:15:41,441 --> 01:15:45,430
I mean it took like fucking like 30
seconds before a flight attendant,

1167
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:49,600
the one who gave him the booze,
whichever gently wasn't boozed comes over.

1168
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:53,290
And at this point we're like doing
that shit where we're behind the plane,

1169
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,700
we're almost ready to take off,

1170
01:15:54,701 --> 01:15:56,420
like we're pulling up and
then stop and pull it up.

1171
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:59,680
Then stopping as planes are
taking off. So she goes, yeah,

1172
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:01,480
what's the problem over
here? And he goes, ah,

1173
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,540
I'm not comfortable to fly with
this guy. This guy, he's fidgeting,

1174
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,000
he's looking around at other fucking
people, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1175
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:08,050
He's doing all this thing right.

1176
01:16:08,051 --> 01:16:11,320
And then the stewardess looks at me and
I'm just sitting there and fucking my

1177
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:12,880
little smart,
just shaking my head.

1178
01:16:12,881 --> 01:16:15,340
And I just looking at this
dude just shaking my head like,

1179
01:16:15,341 --> 01:16:18,670
this guy's out of his fucking mind.
I don't say a word.

1180
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,900
And this guy goes on and on and on about
his fucking psycho babble about how I'm

1181
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,910
the security risk.
So she goes to,

1182
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:31,450
so she goes, okay. Um,
any other passengers?

1183
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:35,650
Have you noticed anything? She talked
to everybody first class at this,

1184
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,510
is anybody notice anything
odd about this guy?

1185
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,890
And The lady who was sitting right in
front of the dude diagonally from me turns

1186
01:16:47,891 --> 01:16:50,980
around, she goes, yeah, I've been
listening to this guy brewery, right?

1187
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,750
Berating this other passenger.

1188
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:57,550
She's on my side and I haven't
said a fucking word. This is great.

1189
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:59,650
And I'm just sitting there smirking.

1190
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,710
Then they'll let the students look to
me and I shrugged my shoulders like,

1191
01:17:02,711 --> 01:17:05,500
I don't know what to tell
you. So finally she said, sir,

1192
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:09,260
did you have anything to add
to this? And I just said, look,

1193
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:14,210
I'm just a guy trying to go to
Indianapolis. This guy over here.

1194
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:17,360
He started slamming his doors. I kind
of felt like a rat when I said that.

1195
01:17:17,361 --> 01:17:20,510
I go slamming his doors. Next thing you
know, he's dropping the F bomb to me.

1196
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:24,200
Then I'm thinking, oh fuck.
I just said bomb. Right?

1197
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,180
Fortunately nothing happened.

1198
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,890
So now another fucking the male stewardess
comes over right now. He's going like,

1199
01:17:30,891 --> 01:17:31,724
what's going on?

1200
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:35,780
And the captain of the fucking now at
this point we pulled over in the plane has

1201
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:36,614
stopped.

1202
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:41,630
Do you want a 50 people trying to get
to Indianapolis and jerk off over here?

1203
01:17:41,631 --> 01:17:46,490
Can't hold his fucking alcohol. Who
just watched a person of interest every,

1204
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:50,810
every, I guess evidently I have no
fucking idea. Now the plane is stopped,

1205
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:52,790
is fucking jerk off,

1206
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:57,230
has stopped the plane
interrogating a Goddamn comedian.

1207
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,280
Like I'm in the fucking Taliban and
like he works for the CIA, right?

1208
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:02,830
So now we're just sitting

1209
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:10,620
in the captain is up front in the plane
like saying to the stewards is going

1210
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:15,020
basically relaying, do I really
have to fucking come back there?

1211
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,380
This is the last flight of the night.
Is there really a God damn problem.

1212
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:22,730
And that was the vibe when they finally
said to the dose, sit next to me,

1213
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:24,770
are you going to be okay to fly with him?

1214
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:30,040
And at that point it appeased his fucking
ego that he was somehow in control.

1215
01:18:30,951 --> 01:18:35,030
And he goes like, you know what? Okay,
it's fine. It's fine. It'll be fine.

1216
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:36,283
It'll be fine.

1217
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:37,450
Yeah.

1218
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:38,560
So they go,
okay.

1219
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:43,840
So now the plane's going again and now
we're now we fucking come around and he's

1220
01:18:43,841 --> 01:18:45,700
sitting there fucking,
he's in my ear.

1221
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:49,720
And at this point I am lab like to fucking
laugh. You hear me doing the podcast?

1222
01:18:49,721 --> 01:18:53,770
That's what I'm doing. And
he's sitting there going, I,
he goes, you don't, I'm glad.

1223
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,040
I'm glad you, I hope you fucking do.
I hope you fucking try something.

1224
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:58,860
I'll be fucking try
something one up there.

1225
01:18:58,861 --> 01:19:02,740
I really hope you fucking try something.
And I'm just fucking like God.

1226
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:06,040
Boston laughing, shaking me like, what
are you going to fucking do to me?

1227
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:09,940
What are you going to do to me?
How are you gonna Punch me in the face?

1228
01:19:09,941 --> 01:19:14,290
You fucking wirey jackass,
but your fucking glasses on,

1229
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:16,960
you know,
that's a federal offense.

1230
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:20,140
You're going to go to jail if you do
that or something. I Dunno what, right.

1231
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,950
So I'm just sitting there fucking
laughing at the guy going, I actually,

1232
01:19:23,951 --> 01:19:28,360
at one point I put my fucking little
eye pillow thing on. Do you know,

1233
01:19:28,361 --> 01:19:31,870
like I'm going to sleep. Oh, I
had that out too in the store.

1234
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:35,200
This was talking to me. I was like
putting it on is this total mind fuck.

1235
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:38,230
Like I don't know what this guy is.
I'm just trying to go to Indianapolis.

1236
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:41,770
I'm going to sleep. And um, so I got,

1237
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:46,060
I got my fucking eye thing on, right
as he's sitting there threatening me.

1238
01:19:46,061 --> 01:19:48,430
Just I was going with total passive
aggressive. It's like, dude,

1239
01:19:48,431 --> 01:19:52,720
I'm so not concerned with
you. I'm literally putting
a blindfold on. All right,

1240
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:58,770
so this fucking guy, like
he starts going, he goes,

1241
01:19:58,771 --> 01:20:01,440
yeah. He goes, you think
you're fucking one this dude,
he fucking won this. He goes,

1242
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:03,780
Mike, you know my dad is my
dad. He started saying his dads,

1243
01:20:03,781 --> 01:20:07,500
some major CEO in Indianapolis.
Doesn't sound like a fucking made story.

1244
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:09,600
I swear to God, this is
all true. He Goes, Mike,

1245
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:14,550
my dad is a major CEO in Indianapolis
and I'll have you fucking arrested.

1246
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:16,020
And The lady turns around again,

1247
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:18,690
I'll have you fucking arrested
the second we get on the ground,

1248
01:20:18,691 --> 01:20:22,940
I'm thinking like, for what?
For what? Sitting here,

1249
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:26,990
you fucking loser. Learn how
to hold your alcohol. Right.

1250
01:20:26,991 --> 01:20:30,890
And he starts describing the view that
I'm going to have when I go to jail,

1251
01:20:30,891 --> 01:20:34,040
like some fucking law and order episode.
Oh you're gonna love it.

1252
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:37,010
You'd be able to see Lucas oil
field and bad, the bad blah blah.

1253
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:41,180
And I'm just sitting here cracking up
laughing and then there's this pause,

1254
01:20:41,181 --> 01:20:45,950
right? And I'm thinking finally he finally
shut the fuck up. It's like a three,

1255
01:20:45,951 --> 01:20:49,040
four minute pause. He finally just gave
up because I wasn't giving them anything.

1256
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:52,730
I was just laughing and shaking my head.
I was being a dick to them.

1257
01:20:52,731 --> 01:20:54,200
I was cause I was enjoying it.

1258
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:57,140
And then there was like a three minute
pause and then all of a sudden he just

1259
01:20:57,141 --> 01:21:00,980
goes,
why are you going to Indianapolis Bill.

1260
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:04,363
Yeah.

1261
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,550
So we're like 20 minutes into the flight
and am I going to be honest, he's,

1262
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,050
my adrenaline was so
going during all of that

1263
01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:17,590
because I knew I didn't do anything wrong,

1264
01:21:17,591 --> 01:21:20,920
but I thought we were literally going
to go back and there was going to be

1265
01:21:20,921 --> 01:21:23,170
fucking cops there. And
they'd be like, if, if, if,

1266
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:28,650
if the fucking stewardess or the pilot
asked me who I am and where I'm going,

1267
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:34,270
I'm going to tell them I respect your
authority. You're just some, Gee, I don't,

1268
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:38,650
you don't have any fucking authority.
I don't have to answer your questions.

1269
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,110
It was pro was one of the most

1270
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:46,030
fun experiences I've ever
had with another human being.

1271
01:21:46,031 --> 01:21:49,540
Like when somebody thinks that they
have power and you know, they don't,

1272
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:55,260
and all they can do is try just keep
bluffing and raising their voice and start

1273
01:21:55,751 --> 01:21:58,300
cursing at you.
And if you just start laughing at them,

1274
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:03,070
the look on their face
is fucking priceless. So

1275
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:08,160
the last thing he said, he said, why are
you going to Indianapolis Bill? Right.

1276
01:22:08,161 --> 01:22:12,270
And I fucking started howling,
just fucking holding my stomach,

1277
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:13,260
shaking my head

1278
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,730
and with my fucking eye
pillow thing on right.

1279
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:22,220
And I know I'm going to get a ton of
shit that I wear one of those eye,

1280
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:23,610
they're fucking underrated.

1281
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,940
Get the one at Brookstone where it's
literally a pillow. I'm telling you,

1282
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:30,300
you can fall asleep 12 noon
facing the sun. It's awesome.

1283
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:35,160
So anyways, like after he,
he asked me what, what,

1284
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:37,900
you know where you're going bill?
You're like, there was like a 10 minute,

1285
01:22:37,901 --> 01:22:42,700
like probably 10 minutes had gone by and
I can't fucking sleep because it's so

1286
01:22:42,701 --> 01:22:46,000
fun. And to me I can't wait to tell
the story to every comic. I know.

1287
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:50,470
I can't wait to try it on stage to
see if it's funny or whatever. Uh,

1288
01:22:50,471 --> 01:22:53,890
so finally I just like got fuck it.
Maybe I'll just get on my computer and I

1289
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,120
bring up my eye pillow and I like,

1290
01:22:58,121 --> 01:23:01,270
I got to look at the guy cause I know
he's fucking staring at me waiting for me

1291
01:23:01,271 --> 01:23:04,030
to do something right.
So I lifted up,

1292
01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:09,330
I get my Mona Lisa smile going and I look
over at the guy and dude he is fucking

1293
01:23:09,581 --> 01:23:10,414
passed out.

1294
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:15,990
He looked like he got shot.

1295
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:21,300
He was sitting there like his head was
just hanging straight down and anytime

1296
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:23,130
the plane move like his head was Amy,

1297
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:28,131
he little at you got knocked out and
for the rest of the fucking flight all

1298
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:33,360
fucking uh oh. What's Matt
Damon's character? Jack Ryan.

1299
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:38,250
Hold fucking Jack Ryan over here is just,
you know the sky marshal,

1300
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:41,790
the fucking bows bag and God
knows what else he was on.

1301
01:23:41,791 --> 01:23:46,470
He was just completely out passed out
for the rest of the fucking flight.

1302
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:51,090
And this is why I'm want to Dick. I am.
I was having so much fun with this guy.

1303
01:23:51,091 --> 01:23:52,590
I start,
I can't sleep.

1304
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:58,550
So I start slamming waters because I
want to have to get up and take a piss.

1305
01:23:58,831 --> 01:24:02,370
Just to see if this guy's going to
freak out because this security risk is

1306
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,470
getting up. And there's,
the joke was on me,

1307
01:24:04,471 --> 01:24:08,520
he never regained consciousness and
then I really had to take a Piss,

1308
01:24:08,521 --> 01:24:10,110
but I'm such a stubborn fuck.

1309
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:13,980
I was holding it because I wanted to
make sure he was awake when I got up,

1310
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:17,520
cause that was going to give him a little
smirk and then I was going to get out

1311
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:22,340
to sea at the call button
again. Um, but he didn't,

1312
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:27,060
he didn't wake up till we
hit the ground. And um, yeah.

1313
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,890
And it's funny. Then he woke up
and it was like four hours later,

1314
01:24:29,891 --> 01:24:32,890
so now he'd kind of slept off,
whatever the fuck this guy was on.

1315
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:37,900
And I'm sitting there SmartQ and wait for
the guy who start talking and he won't

1316
01:24:37,901 --> 01:24:39,800
look at me and I,

1317
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:43,210
and I think at that point
he kind of fucking realizes
that maybe he got a little

1318
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:46,180
, uh, a little extra little too patriotic.

1319
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,470
So we stop.

1320
01:24:50,350 --> 01:24:52,450
We stopped at the gate and
everything and we're going to get up.

1321
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:53,770
So I grabbed my shit.

1322
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:57,730
I get up and I'm just kinda looking
at him and he won't look at me.

1323
01:24:57,850 --> 01:24:59,920
And then the lady who was
sitting in front of me,

1324
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:03,400
I had this big smile on her face.
She goes, how are you? She goes,

1325
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:06,070
how are you doing? I don't
want good. I go, there I go.
That was an interesting one.

1326
01:25:06,071 --> 01:25:07,180
And I said it really loud.

1327
01:25:07,181 --> 01:25:11,180
So the guy heard and
didn't say anything and to,

1328
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:13,180
this is what he did to try to save face.

1329
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,230
His pillow was kind of stuck behind this
kind of stuck behind his shoulder and

1330
01:25:17,231 --> 01:25:20,560
like a weird place.
So he was frustrated with it.

1331
01:25:20,561 --> 01:25:24,220
So he ripped it out from behind him
and kind of threw it down on the floor.

1332
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:25,293
Went like,

1333
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:30,870
tried to do some caveman grunt to try
to still have some sort of, yeah. Uh,

1334
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:36,820
I don't know what, so, so that was
my flight to Indianapolis people.

1335
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:42,430
Um, you don't want how, how far into the
fucking podcast are we? That was a long,

1336
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:43,870
that was a long fucking story.

1337
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:27,893
[inaudible] [inaudible]
