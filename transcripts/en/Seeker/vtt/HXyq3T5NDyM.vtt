00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.230
It’s translucent, sterile, amber-colored
and generated by your kidneys.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.530
Yep we’re talking about your urine and I’m
here to tell you that you’re flushing secrets

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.469
about your health straight down the drain.

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.469
We can learn SO much about you, with just
a cup of pee.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.730
When you think of a urine test, you probably
think about drug and pregnancy tests.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.060
Pregnancy tests measure human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG) that is a hormone ONLY produced while

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.060
you’re pregnant.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.019
And common drug tests look for the presence
of multiple drugs in a panel deemed the “SAMHSA-5.”

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.160
But those are just two testing methods, and
there are over 3000 different compounds in

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.160
your urine.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.160
Three thousand!

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.320
Think of all the things you could learn!

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.950
Currently we’ve know that pee is a pretty
good gauge of what’s going on in your urinary

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.480
system on a basic level.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.320
I’m sure you’ve peed in a cup or two over
the years when you go to the doctor.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.500
And it’s not just to prove you don’t have
stage fright.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.810
Pee is 95% water, and metabolites, but the
rest could be things like glucose, ketone

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.100
bodies, nitrates, proteins, and hormones just
to name a few.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.090
However, we’re not really supposed to find
these compounds in your pee.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.320
High glucose could mean diabetes, proteins
could be chronic kidney disease, and any nitrites

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.730
are likely a urinary tract infection!

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.040
But doctors are also scanning your pee for
a few other key things: volume, color, odor.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:23.240
Volume could tell them how hydrated (or not
hydrated) you are, color can indicate if someone’s

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.160
kidneys are functioning properly, and cloudy
urine can mean a UTI.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.070
And a very strong odor could mean a serious
infection.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.210
Now that might seem like a lot already, but
remember we’re working with 3000 compounds

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.210
here!

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.080
Scientists don’t want to let this waste
go to… well, waste and they’re working

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.299
on detecting gastrointestinal cancers.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.610
And the metabolites in our pee could help
us do that

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.730
Metabolites are the chemical by-products that
our cells make during metabolism, since cells

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.650
come from different locations in the body
and are affected by energy and nutrient intake,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.250
their metabolites a can tell us a lot of our
environmental interactions The scientists

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.830
basically used these as biomarkers for any
disease or cancers in our GI tract And boom

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.830
it worked.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.849
GI cancers altered the metabolic signatures
and it’s all reflected in our pee for us

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:13.849
to see!

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.180
More research is needed, but this could be
a game changer for straying away from costly

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.139
and invasive cancer screenings and starting
preventative care All you gotta do is, ya

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:23.489
know, pee in that cup.

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.049
So, pee can’t tell us direct answers but
the information pee gives hints at what the

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.079
bigger picture is inside of us.

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.739
We’ve come a long way from just flushing
our good information-rich urine to really

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.620
understanding how we can utilize this gross
resource to something beneficial for all.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.109
Hey guys thanks for watching and don’t forget
to subscribe.

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.420
We may be finding cancer, but porcupines are
finding a whole other way to use their pee,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.299
check out Wild Sex cover it here.

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.310
Fun Fact: The average human generates up to
2 liters of urine every day!

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.560
Meaning over a lifetime you could fill a small
backyard swimming pool.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.239
Kinda gross.

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:58.659
Thanks for watching.
