00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:06.890
TREFFYN KORESHOFF:
Hello, Hello, hello.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.350
Welcome to I/O day two.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.850
My name is Treffyn Koreshoff.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.926
I'm a UX researcher
here at Google,

00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:14.300
and that means
that I get to talk

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.412
to end users about how they use
different cool things online.

00:00:18.412 --> 00:00:20.120
But before I can talk
to people about how

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.310
they use the great things
that you're building,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.830
I often have to take them
through some sort of a sign-in

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.690
or account creation moment.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.880
And that's what this talk
today is really about;

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.370
it's about making those
sign-in and account creation

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.880
moments a little less painful
and a bit more magical.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.920
So if you use a
username and password

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.170
as part of your sign-in
or account creation

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.270
moment in what you're
building, then you

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.974
are in the best possible place
you could be at I/O right now.

00:00:44.974 --> 00:00:47.390
No matter whether you work
more on the product development

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.250
side of things, in
which case we've

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.920
got some great UX to show
you which will help increase

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.790
conversion for valuable users--

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.466
gets a smiley.

00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.090
Whether you're on
the development side,

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.400
where we've got some cool code
snippets and libraries that

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.920
will help make Google Identity
integration to what you're

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.720
building extremely simple.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.880
Or whether you, like
hopefully we all

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.890
do, care about the
security and privacy

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.746
of what you're building, we'll
take you behind the scenes

00:01:13.746 --> 00:01:15.120
and show you some
of the security

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.500
that goes into Google Identity
and what data is shared.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.341
Even if you have no
registration flow at all,

00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:24.090
I'd actually encourage
you to stick around

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.381
because we think that you'll
see some cool things today

00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:29.160
that you may want to
add to your site anyway.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.960
So I'm just here
for an introduction,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.560
and as part of that, I'd like
to share with you the top four

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.650
things that annoy me about
sign-in and account creation

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.132
moments.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.590
Now not to give
the punchline away,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.080
but these are all four
things that Google Identity

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.960
can help you with.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.620
So to start off, friction.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.530
Let's imagine that
your user has just

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.720
got a new phone, new
device, and they're

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.442
signing back into everything.

00:01:52.442 --> 00:01:54.150
At this point they're
probably thinking--

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.525
and you may have had this
experience-- probably thinking,

00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:58.370
what was that username
and password again?

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.630
Well they wouldn't be alone.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.820
Hawaii's governor has
certainly had this issue.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.520
Perhaps some sign-ins are more
consequential than others,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.260
but you know, he can sympathize.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.229
So to get around the remembering
your username and password,

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.600
maybe you decide to add this
Sign-in with Google button

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.900
or something similar to help
your users not have to remember

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.650
their username and password.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.590
Well this is great,
but what happens

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.980
if we can get rid of this whole
sign-in screen altogether?

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.960
It might look a little
something like this.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.390
Your user arrives on
your site or your app

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.270
for the first time, new
phone, and they're just signed

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.730
immediately straight back in.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.230
I know it can be a bit hard to
see down at the bottom there,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.670
so here it is a bit bigger.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.820
People arrive on your site
and they're just automatically

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.350
signed straight back in.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.860
Let's just skip the whole
sign-in screen altogether.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.960
But of course, this
isn't just about sign-in,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.380
it's also about
account creation.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.860
And account creation has
huge drop off sometimes.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.000
And this can be for
a variety of reasons,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.750
but even for a short, short
sign-up form like this one,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.687
we see drop off of 40% or more.

00:03:01.687 --> 00:03:03.520
Now you might be hoping
that your users have

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.690
some sort of password autofill,
and that's great if they do,

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.045
but even if they do,
you're still taking them

00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:11.920
out of the flow, out of
what they were doing,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.380
to a separate sign-up page.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.850
Not ideal.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.300
So what happens if we could
take this whole sign-up process

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.270
and move it into one click,
and they're into the site.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.110
So again, here I'm showing
it to you on the first page,

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.780
the first time somebody opens
your app, but the magic of this

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.540
is that you can take this
and place it wherever it

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.380
makes most sense in your flow.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.330
It doesn't have to
be at the beginning

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.704
when they first
arrive, it can be

00:03:36.704 --> 00:03:40.290
wherever they have most
intent to create an account.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.920
So it is one-tap,
contextual account creation

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.590
where it makes
most sense for you.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.320
The second thing--
well actually,

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.020
just briefly an example from
somebody who has integrated

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.360
this-- it was Redfin--

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.580
who had an 80% increase
in the number of new users

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.690
once they introduced this
one-tap, seamless contextual

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.570
account creation.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.434
Now the second thing that
annoys me is security.

00:04:06.434 --> 00:04:08.100
If you look at the
passwords that people

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.190
use online these days,
not only are they weak,

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.750
they're often
re-used and they're

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.150
susceptible to phishing.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.640
Now we're going to deep dive
into the security behind this

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.056
like I mentioned,
so I'm not going

00:04:19.056 --> 00:04:20.230
to go into it too much here.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.560
Suffice to say that Google
Identity can help with this,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.450
and it's the same--

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.949
again, not give
away the punchline--

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.500
but it's the same security
that we use for Google accounts

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.912
on Google.com.

00:04:30.912 --> 00:04:33.370
The third thing that can annoy
me about sign-in and account

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.086
creation is quality.

00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:36.460
You spend a lot
of time and money

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.560
getting people to
your site or app,

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.900
and maybe they convert, maybe
they change into a user,

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.840
but how many of your
accounts look like this?

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.530
Maybe this is an
extreme example,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.100
but even if a real person
with a real email address

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.710
comes to your site, they
may not be as engaged

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.940
as you'd like them to be.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.460
And we hear time and
time again from people

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.610
who's used Google Identity
that Google users are not

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.770
only more engaged
on their platform,

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.135
but they create less spam.

00:05:04.135 --> 00:05:06.260
So at this point, you might
be thinking, OK, great,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.950
this sounds great.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.810
I can see some UX
improvements I'd

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.910
like to maybe see a
point for in my site,

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.730
it comes with great security,
and you're telling me

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.260
it helps keep the quality
of the accounts high.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.670
I'm building a cool thing,
I don't have time for this.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.694
To which I would say
that we have worked

00:05:21.694 --> 00:05:23.610
really hard to get
everything you've just seen

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.874
and more available to you
in just a few lines of code.

00:05:26.874 --> 00:05:28.290
Again, we'll take
you through that

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.580
in the second half of this.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.730
So just a really quick recap.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.530
Sign-in and account
creation moments

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.690
can be some of the most
valuable for your account,

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.470
for your sites, but they're
often the most frictionful.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.990
Why don't we replace that
with one-tap account creation

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.240
and automatic sign-in?

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.610
Security is in the
news a lot lately.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.046
Feel free to use Google's.

00:05:50.046 --> 00:05:51.420
You spend a lot
of time and money

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.140
getting people to your site,
so give yourself an advantage

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.020
and get engaged, active users.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.210
And lastly, do away with
all of the maintenance

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.570
for these screens for just
one or a few lines of code

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.709
that you implement once.

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:08.250
So these are just
a few of the things

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.874
that Google Identity
can help you with.

00:06:09.874 --> 00:06:11.833
That's all I'm going to
talk you through today.

00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:13.415
But I'd like to
invite three people up

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:16.020
on stage who are going to talk
you through how you can get

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.020
this yourself, some
other examples of places

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.000
that this has worked,
and also how it works.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.895
I'd like to invite Luke,
Naveen, and Steven up on stage.

00:06:25.895 --> 00:06:32.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.780
NAVEEN AGARWAL:
Thank you, Treffyn.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.600
My name is Naveen
Agarwal, I'm the end lead

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.420
at Google's Federated
Identity Team.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.600
And I have been in this space
from the beginning when you

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.490
couldn't use all this magic.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.290
And here is Luke, who is
a new product manager.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.890
And Steven, who has been in
this space for a long time.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.990
So Luke, you were telling
me that you're not

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.014
convinced about all this magic.

00:06:57.014 --> 00:06:58.680
LUKE CAMERY: Yeah,
that's right, Naveen.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.229
Hi, I'm Luke.

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:01.270
I'm new here and I'm still
figuring all this out.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.290
So one of the things I'm
really curious when I first

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.050
heard about this whole
Federated Identity thing

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.150
was what the user
experience is like.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.210
How does this magic really work?

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.960
NAVEEN AGARWAL: So I think
let's start from the basics.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.430
Lots of people say, what's
this magic within there?

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.880
You actually use all these
identity providers every day.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.700
If you have any ID
card in your pocket,

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.030
that means you use
an identity provider.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.010
A driver's license, your
employee ID, or a passport.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.400
And what happens is they carry
some information about you,

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.440
and you go to a
place where they want

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.780
to verify some information,
what do you do?

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.780
You take out the ID
card which they accept.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.390
You show it to them
and they verify

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.950
that it has the
right attributes,

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.340
it's the right ID card, you
haven't tampered with it,

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.390
and then they let you in.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.510
And what happens in the
online world nowadays,

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.370
the state is pretty different.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.090
You go to a brand
new site, they say,

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.520
hey, we need to create
a new ID card for you,

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.690
and then we are going
to verify who you are.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.200
And look at what it would
look like in the real world.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.230
So you go to a bar
they, say wait,

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.070
you need to create a new ID
card before we let you in.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.300
What would it look like?

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.700
You'd be carrying
a stack of IDs card

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.120
on a daily basis,
probably thousands,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.420
and the burden on
each and every shop

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.670
would be that they
have to set up

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.330
a system to create ID cards
for everybody who walks in.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.539
If they forgot the ID
card, it's a huge cost.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.030
But that's what
everybody does right now

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.030
online when they create their
own authentication system.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.136
They say, no, you sign up for
my site and remember a password.

00:08:45.136 --> 00:08:47.010
And that's essentially
carrying a separate ID

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.580
card for each of the sites.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.020
And if you just replaced it with
a very basic identity provider,

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.730
you get a token from Google,
and then they just accept it.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.810
And it's that simple.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.470
And the experience is
fairly straightforward.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.880
You go to a site, you see
one of the identity providers

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.630
they accept.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.690
In this case, if you click
on Log in with Google,

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.940
you go to your
identity provider,

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.030
they generate a card
for the ID you want,

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.670
and essentially send it
back through the magic which

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.470
we will talk more about.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.390
And you are in.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:29.610
And it's much more convenient
for the user and for everybody.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.780
And what happens inside the
ID card, many people wonder.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.030
We have created what
we call an ID token,

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.850
and it's very similar to
your ID card which you carry.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.070
It has some
information about you

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.080
and some cryptographic
information for them

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.540
to verify that it is authentic.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.500
And essentially, this is the
ID card which the identity

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.980
provider generates.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.150
In essence, it makes
it so much easier

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.090
if you're using the
identity which you already

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.250
have in the digital world.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.860
Does that help?

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.039
LUKE CAMERY: Thanks, Naveen.

00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:03.580
That gives me a
really good overview,

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.890
but I'm still
really curious what

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.470
it's like for our users
going through this.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.840
I know when I come to
the sign-in screen,

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.120
there's all these
buttons and I'm not sure

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.700
which one to click,
or what happens

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.520
if I clicked one last time and
I try and click a different one,

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.370
or if I already have a
password on the account.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.476
I'll probably, like
most people, just end up

00:10:23.476 --> 00:10:24.850
hitting Forgot
Password and going

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.141
through the email reset flow,
because that way I really

00:10:27.141 --> 00:10:29.552
know that I'm getting back
into the right account.

00:10:29.552 --> 00:10:31.510
Steven, I know you spend
a lot of time thinking

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.060
about what our user
experience should look like.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.195
Is there a better way than this?

00:10:36.195 --> 00:10:38.320
STEVEN SONEFF: Well, you're
completely right, Luke,

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.290
that this user
experience confusion

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.520
is one of the top reasons why
sites, apps, and end users

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.790
are still using username
and passwords today.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.470
And we've thought
a lot about this.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.720
I'm really excited to
talk about the innovations

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.160
we're making in this space.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.750
We're thinking about
new ways to get

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.290
users signed in and signed up.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.810
What I'd like to focus
on today is an experience

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.060
we call a one-tap
account creation.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.810
Now this is a new way for end
users of Google's Identity

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.254
systems to share their
basic information

00:11:10.254 --> 00:11:11.670
with a site or an
app that they're

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.870
using with a single click.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.030
This can be shown
inline on the page

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.510
without the user even having to
navigate to a full login screen

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.580
or find the Google
Sign-in button.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.820
Once the user has
tapped, this information

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.130
is conveyed to the site or
the app that they're using,

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.120
and they're able to log
into an existing account

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.469
or help create a new one.

00:11:34.469 --> 00:11:36.510
To really illustrate this,
what we're going to do

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.270
is switch over to a demo and
show you this in real life.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.500
OK.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.450
So what I've got
here is a version

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.570
of Chrome running in the
mobile emulation mode.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.910
So you can see we're
emulating an iPhone device.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.140
So this works across all
platforms, including iOS.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.890
And I have a user
signed in here.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.650
Her name is Elisa.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.320
Now imagine that Elisa
is preparing for a trip

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.150
and wants to visit
that site that she

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.610
heard about called Hipmunk.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.160
So Hipmunk has this really
cool user interface.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.520
And imagine as she loads
up the Hipmunk site,

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.730
she'd like to identify herself
to keep track of the travel

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.770
that she's planning
across devices.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.630
Now that UI that I
just mentioned shows up

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.650
at the bottom here.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.440
Elisa is able to say that
it's OK for this site

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.890
to know who she is without
having to go and find the login

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:30.040
screen, figure out
sign-in, sign-up,

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.170
or determine which
button she needs to press

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.550
or which one she
pressed last time.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.230
So let's try it out.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.890
With one click, we see that
Elisa's account is active here

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.390
on Hipmunk.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.449
And this is a live site.

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:46.240
You can actually go
and try it out yourself

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.954
on your phone to
see how it works.

00:12:47.954 --> 00:12:49.120
Let's go back to the slides.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.310
Now how does this perform?

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.440
Well Hipmunk has
actually come back to us

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.720
and told us that
this has dramatically

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.360
increased the rate at which
users are creating accounts

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.240
with their service, and in
turn unlocking this opportunity

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.520
to personalize their
experience across devices.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.790
But it's not just here
on the mobile web.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.210
We've had this opportunity
to streamline and assist

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.830
in account creation on
Android for some time.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.630
So if you've been to
our talks in the past,

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.200
you might have seen some of the
stats and numbers like this.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.470
By incorporating a one-tap
identity experience,

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.830
creating an account with
just a single gesture,

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.240
apps like Hotel
Tonight have been

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.420
able to improve their book out
and conversion rates by things

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.796
like 20% to 30%.

00:13:33.796 --> 00:13:35.670
That's pretty phenomenal
for just a simple UX

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:40.627
change, an improvement
to the user's experience.

00:13:40.627 --> 00:13:42.460
We appreciate, of course,
that it's not just

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.170
about acquiring
these new users who

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.520
might be visiting
for the first time;

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.667
you have a lot of
existing users.

00:13:48.667 --> 00:13:51.250
And it would be really a shame
if all those existing users had

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.460
to identify themselves again
and again across devices.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.430
After all, today people
are using multiple phones,

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.100
they're using tablets, and
their desktop computer.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.900
And so what we offer
here is the ability

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.360
for people who have
used a site or an app

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.730
before coming back
to that same service

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.820
across platforms to be
signed in without having

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.960
to find the login screen.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.330
So let's take a look at an
example of how that works.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.871
We'll switch back
to the demo device.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.340
Now to simulate a new
device, what I'm going to do

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.370
is actually switch over
to an incognito tab.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.680
Now you'll notice that
in this incognito tab,

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.390
we're in the full
desktop version.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.600
So imagine this is Elisa coming
back on her desktop machine

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.280
where she'd like
to perhaps complete

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.220
a booking that she was searching
for from mobile earlier.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.060
As you can see, we have a
link to the Hipmunk site,

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.640
and what I'd like to do
here is draw your attention

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.260
to the top right.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.420
That as imagine Elisa comes
back on the desktop site,

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.620
you'll see that her information
is being retrieved by the web

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.550
property and used to sign her
in without having to navigate

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.580
or even remember to go
through a login flow.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.550
At this point, you can see that
things like her previous search

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:06.340
history are immediately
available right across devices.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.660
So it's really this opportunity
to have people come back

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.750
to your site, not have to
repopulate their shopping cart

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.059
or redo all of their searches.

00:15:14.059 --> 00:15:15.600
They can continue
where they left off

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.884
with a shopping cart ready.

00:15:17.884 --> 00:15:19.300
So let's switch
back to the slides

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.550
and see how this one performs.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.060
So for Hipmunk, it's also
been equally impressive.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.680
The proportion of
users who are using

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.260
their site in a signed in state
and getting that personalized

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.520
experience has gone way up.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.270
We have other numbers from
folks like Ali Express

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.670
really even saying that
their conversion rates go up

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.084
for these users who are
signed in automatically.

00:15:40.084 --> 00:15:41.750
And to call out one
more stat that we've

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.700
seen from Android
over the years,

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.340
we've had big apps
like Netflix using

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.490
an automatic sign-in experience
with data saved in their Google

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.160
account, whether that's the
Google account itself or things

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.560
like saved passwords,
and as a result

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.590
seeing a dramatic reduction
in the support and inquiry

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.370
volumes.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.830
So of course, people who
are signed in automatically

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.510
don't have to call
up a help desk

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.850
to ask for information
about their subscription

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.994
or get back into their
account if they get stuck.

00:16:08.994 --> 00:16:10.660
So if you put all
these pieces together,

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.780
I think we really are opening
the door for a much better user

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.170
experience across
the web and apps.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.750
There's this one-tap
sharing of identity

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.780
that streamlines the
experience to say who you are.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.060
There's an automatic sign-in
for people who are coming back

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.080
and want to stay signed in.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.510
You don't even have to go
to the login screen anymore.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.070
And finally, it's
the opportunity

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.050
to unlock this personalized
experience that

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.500
continues across devices.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.090
I'll add one more
thing here, that is

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.030
that we still have the
traditional button-based flows.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.530
That's the baseline
that you'll have

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.180
to implement across
all platforms

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.450
to handle edge cases like when
the user is not signed in.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.670
But really, the hope is
that these technologies

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.610
can optimize and improve
the common cases for users

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.230
who are visiting
your site or app so

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.639
that they never even have to
see the login screen at all.

00:16:58.639 --> 00:17:00.180
And hopefully that
will address a lot

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.980
of those problems and questions
that you brought up, Luke.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.146
LUKE CAMERY: Thanks, Steven.

00:17:04.146 --> 00:17:07.170
That honestly looks
like a far better future

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.839
than what I was seeing on
that complicated button-based

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:10.740
screen.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.900
But the same time, I
think a lot of people

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.990
still have questions when it
comes to using an identity

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.510
provider about data sharing.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.530
When you traditionally go in
through an identity provider,

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.710
you have this consent moment
where it's unclear, you know,

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.329
will your friends get spam?

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:30.060
Will they be able to send
emails to your contacts?

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.060
It's kind of scary
and confusing.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:36.930
You know, when I sign up
with an email and a password,

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.090
I know that the site
only knows my email.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:41.724
Isn't that a lot safer?

00:17:41.724 --> 00:17:44.140
STEVEN SONEFF: Yeah, that's
an important topic these days,

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.120
Luke.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.700
And so let's go back to that
one-tap UI that we saw earlier.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.560
The thing I'd like
to emphasize here

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.870
is that it's a very limited
set of information that's

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:54.490
being shared with
the site or the app

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.390
that the user is
interacting with.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:00.160
It's only exactly what's shown;
their name, their picture,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.530
and their verified
email address.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.300
Now this is the same
essentially as if

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.000
the user typed in this
information manually,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.480
but it doesn't have any of the
problems of typos or mistakes,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.580
and it didn't require
the work of the user

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.410
having to manually
verify that they

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:17.020
own an email address by
opening up their mail app

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.730
and clicking on a link.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.850
The developer knows that their
actual account, especially

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.580
in the case of Gmail addresses,
is active on this device

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.290
and they own it.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:27.910
So what we've done
here is really

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.180
thought about separating out
the basic information that's

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.060
shared to say who you
are in a login flow

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.770
from requests for
additional data

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.050
as we saw from the
social sign in days

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.851
that Luke just pointed out.

00:18:40.851 --> 00:18:42.350
We do appreciate,
though, that there

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.180
are a lot of apps and
services out there

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.450
that do need and depend
on this additional data.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.090
So for example, you can
imagine an experience

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.270
where after you've booked a
flight or some travel plans,

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.334
you need to synchronize
this with your calendar.

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:56.750
And it would be
great if you could

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:00.020
have this on an ongoing basis
so you didn't have to manually

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.950
keep your calendar up to date.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.960
In an example like
this, a developer

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.510
can still ask for
that type of access,

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:11.620
but it comes at a point where
the user best understands why

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.750
and how this data will be used.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.880
So it can be asked
for contextually,

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.220
just like you've seen
on Android and iOS

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.100
where things like access
for contacts or photos

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.890
can be presented at the right
time, when people understand

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.270
why they're needed.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.740
And when you do go through
the experience as an end user,

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.470
you can see that
we're doing a lot here

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.980
to make it really clear who
you're interacting with,

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.350
what data will be
shared, and how

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.920
you might see the terms and
conditions the data will

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:44.289
be used under, or even revoke
or control access in the future.

00:19:44.289 --> 00:19:45.830
If you put all these
pieces together,

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.070
I think we're really trying
to improve the ecosystem here.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:52.010
For a long time, we've
had an app review process,

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.970
and we're expanding that to
verify who these apps are,

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.079
what data they're
using, and making sure

00:19:58.079 --> 00:20:00.620
that we have contact information
and the ability to shut them

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.450
down if things go wrong.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:05.300
We'll be expanding that to
things like our one-tap sign-up

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.330
to ensure that these powerful
APIs and services are only

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:13.870
used by the developers
who have good intentions.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.030
The last big
concern and question

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:20.290
that comes up in this category
about data is users' control.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:23.590
Both as a developer and
as an end user, people

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.890
wonder, if I use these
Google Identity technologies,

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.380
am I becoming
dependent on Google?

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.840
Can the data that I provide
to these services only

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.670
be accessed by using Google
services, Google Identity APIs?

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.530
The answer here is no.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.260
This information is
conveyed to the developer.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.530
It's, as I described
earlier, a shortcut helping

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.780
to process this information
over to developer

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.700
and bootstrap the experience.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.190
But at the end of the day,
you're still in control

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.930
as an end user and a developer.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.690
You can offer other
mechanisms to log in.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.120
As we've discussed, you have
the user's email address.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.730
You can send them an
email with a recovery link

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.500
or another way to log in.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.960
You could even accept
other identity providers,

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.450
perhaps having things
like a phone number where

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.790
you can send a
recovery SMS, or even

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:12.370
accept an entirely different
identity provider to log

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:13.980
into those existing accounts.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.300
They're still users in
the developer's database

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.470
and under their control.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.170
So I hope that if you put all
of these pieces together, Luke,

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.169
you'll have a better
understanding of what we're

00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:26.820
doing to make it streamlined
and clear to the user

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.350
that when they share only
identity information,

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.860
it's just that limited
piece of information that's

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.790
being conveyed.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.820
On top of that, when
additional data is requested,

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.470
it's done in a process
where things are vetted,

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.880
it's clearer, and the
user has better control.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.050
And finally, users can still
log in at the end of the day

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.190
with other mechanisms.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:52.780
There's no need for them
to be dependent on Google.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.614
I hope that addresses
some of your concerns.

00:21:54.614 --> 00:21:55.780
LUKE CAMERY: Thanks, Steven.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.070
I love how transparent it is.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.560
It's this what you see is
what you get model that

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.690
makes it really clear to
me what I'm giving over

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:02.830
to the third party.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.550
But I think something that
goes hand-in-hand with privacy

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:07.880
is security.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.290
There's this protocol
going back and forth

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.860
between the site and Google, and
when I sign up for an account,

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.050
I can create a
really big password

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:18.610
that will really protect me.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.070
I mean, I know your team
spends a lot of time

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.090
thinking about security.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.896
Can you explain why this
is safer than my password?

00:22:25.896 --> 00:22:28.300
NAVEEN AGARWAL: Yeah,
security is my favorite topic.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.640
Actually this question
we get asked quite often.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.700
Is this less secure?

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:36.100
Is it going to make my
account system less secure?

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.010
In order to understand,
just think about every site

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.170
has a forgot password flow.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.630
What happens when a user
clicks on Forgot Password?

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:47.500
You send an email, the user then
goes, signs into their email

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.210
account, and then find the
email, click on the link,

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.580
and they get back
into your account.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.270
Now if you do click Sign-in with
Google button, what happens?

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.700
You'll still go back, sign
into your Google account.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.840
Google generates a
cryptographic token,

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.920
says, yes, this user
owns this email address.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.730
And then you accept that and
you get back into the account.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.120
The difference is-- they are
pretty equal from a security

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.810
perspective.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:17.500
I would argue there are some
flaws in the Forgot Password

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.630
case where somebody
could have forwarded

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.180
that email to somebody
else and people

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.860
can get back into the account.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.920
In this Sign-in Google,
you know that they actually

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.480
own that email address.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.540
But this is just the
security equivalence,

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:35.200
but there is much more
to the account security.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.510
How many engineers on
your site are working

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:39.980
on securing the account system?

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.620
Think about that part.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:45.460
On the Google side,
we actually have

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.380
hundreds of engineers
working on just

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.420
protecting Google accounts.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:53.770
And for every login attempt,
we go through a risk-based

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.900
analysis based on
many of the signals--

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.720
traditional signals, IP
addresses, location--

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.571
but a lot of them
which you don't see.

00:24:00.571 --> 00:24:02.070
Trying to understand
whether there's

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:06.070
a bot who is trying to sign in
based on the cursor movement,

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.186
and so on.

00:24:07.186 --> 00:24:08.560
And based on that,
we figured out

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.420
whether the risk of that
attempt, is it low or high.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.130
And if it's basically
a risky attempt,

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:19.510
we would ask that user to verify
through secondary channels.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:26.140
And in cases where the use got
hijacked, they got phished,

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:29.280
we tried to reach out to
the user in different ways.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.010
Even if the hacker had the
right password to that account

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.280
and we think the risk is
high, we will not generally

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:41.050
let the user or the hacker
in, and keep the bad guys out.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:46.510
In those cases, we are
protecting a lot of accounts

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:49.390
and we are spending a lot of
time and energy on doing it.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.760
But that's just right now.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.160
The bigger part is
continued investment.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.980
We were the first one to
launch two-factor auth

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.580
for the consumer side, and
that is still phishable

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.660
even though you
have SMS recovery.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:07.230
And we recently launched what
we call Advanced Protection,

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:10.740
if you go search for it, which
is based on a security key

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.030
if your account needs much
higher level of protection

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.420
that's non-phishable.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:19.680
Because you cannot give away a
code to the third party site.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.650
We are also working
with internet standards

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:26.250
and other companies to
protect your other accounts

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:27.840
on other sites.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.320
And in the future, we
want to share some data

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.030
about the account
so you can actually

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:37.860
use it to make better security
decisions during purchases

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.070
and so on.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.870
And the last is as new
services become available,

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:46.140
like Assistant, we
are making it easier

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.230
for people to sign in
using their Google account.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.840
So by using that,
you're actually

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.800
making Google Identity-- the
security of Google Identity

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.160
is closer to what you will get
in the security of your account

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.160
system.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.970
So sophisticated security,
we are doing a lot

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:04.620
to prevent hijacking.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.500
And then again, the
new advanced feature.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.510
Does that make you
feel better, Luke?

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:10.926
LUKE CAMERY: That
definitely makes

00:26:10.926 --> 00:26:12.510
me feel a lot safer
as a user, that I

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.670
can rely on all
of these security

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:15.930
measures Google is working on.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.700
But what about for
the developers?

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.030
You know, there's all these
spam and robo accounts

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.460
out there, a lot of
fraudulent actors trying

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.090
to take advantage of services.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.360
How do I know that taking
Sign-in with Google

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.220
doesn't create just another
route for spammers to get in?

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.220
NAVEEN AGARWAL: That's
actually a good question.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.930
And this is
something most people

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.130
don't think about when they
create their account system.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.050
What happens is, if I
am actually a hacker,

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:42.840
I can create my mail
server and create probably

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.560
millions of hacking accounts
on your site very easily.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.290
Google actually
does a lot of work

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.170
to prevent creating
mass accounts.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.170
And what happens
is if you just use

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.330
Google Identity
on your site, you

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.880
are going to get a
lot of those benefits.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.480
We were talking to one of
the large banks just recently

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.760
and I asked him to separate
out their accounts based

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.980
on the Gmail addresses
and non-Gmail address,

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.730
and they were surprised.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:12.600
They saw eight times
less fraudulent activity

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.040
based on the Gmail addresses
than the non-Gmail addresses.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.470
And it's because
all of the security

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.860
we are adding on the Gmail
accounts, which is less spammy

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.250
and then not letting those
accounts get hijacked.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.280
And not just
keeping them secure,

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:33.200
we find that these users you
are acquiring through the Google

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.690
Sign-in are generally real
users and they are more engaged.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.650
So we talked about Redfin having
an 80% increase in sign up.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:45.150
More than that, we saw
more than 40% of the users

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:48.060
came back five times
in the next few weeks.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.550
And that is much,
much better stats

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:54.240
than you can find within
your own database.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.440
So you're not just
using Google identity

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.350
to keep the bad guys out,
but you're also acquiring

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.610
much, much better users.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:05.100
And most of the users who
have an Android phone,

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.220
they have a Google account.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.400
So does that make things better?

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.110
LUKE CAMERY:
Honestly, that sounds

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.020
really great as sort of
a side benefit of using

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.654
Google Identity.

00:28:16.654 --> 00:28:18.570
But everything that you
guys have talked about

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.440
is so complex, there's all
these security features,

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.190
there's all that slick UI
on different properties.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:26.307
You know, how complicated.

00:28:26.307 --> 00:28:28.640
It must be really difficult
for everyone in the audience

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.890
to build this into their site.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.330
I know you work on this, Steven.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:32.577
Do you know?

00:28:32.577 --> 00:28:33.410
STEVEN SONEFF: Yeah.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.576
So over the years, I've
talked to literally hundreds

00:28:35.576 --> 00:28:38.001
of different developers
about integrations like this

00:28:38.001 --> 00:28:40.250
and when it comes down to
it, there's two major pieces

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:41.580
to be aware of.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.310
There's the
front-end work to add

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.220
UI, to your app, or your
site, or whatever else you're

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.350
building, maybe an action.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.510
And then there's some
work on the server side

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.180
to take that information
from the app or the site,

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.850
look up the user, and provide
that information to the user

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.110
to personalize their experience.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.990
So let's dive a
little bit into this.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.060
On the front-end side
of things, you end up

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.080
having to show the user either
a traditional Google Sign-in

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.210
button, or as we've
discussed today,

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.550
try to optimize that
with some of the one-tap

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.470
or automatic sign-in UI.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.840
The first time, the user
will give their consent

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.590
to share this information.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.920
And at that point, Google is
able to provide you, the app

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.980
developer, a token
representing this user,

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.230
the digital passport that
we've been talking about.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:27.771
Afterwards there's
the back-end work,

00:29:27.771 --> 00:29:30.130
and we'll dive into
that in a second.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.239
So to illustrate how this
front-end work works,

00:29:33.239 --> 00:29:34.780
let's actually switch
over to a demo.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:38.590
OK.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:41.620
So I'm back on my machine
here and what I'll do

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.320
is I'll take that code that we
just saw in the previous slide.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.950
And this is the API
calls that you're

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:51.850
going to need to incorporate to
add a one-tap UI to your site

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:52.760
or app.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.050
So let's suppose you already
have a Google Sign-in button

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.720
and you really want to optimize
this experience by turning it

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.890
into the one-click UI.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.440
So what we're
going to do here is

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.780
we're going to take this
little snippet of code

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.430
and actually show it
running on a real site.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.370
So there's a few
parameters to this API

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.620
call asking to show
the Google accounts

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.450
and requesting a token.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.720
As a developer, I mentioned that
there is a registration process

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.354
that you have to go through
to get access to these APIs.

00:30:21.354 --> 00:30:23.520
And what I'm doing here is
showing the configuration

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.060
for a real site.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.330
This is actually
one from B&amp;H Video--

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.217
they might even be
here at I/O today--

00:30:29.217 --> 00:30:31.050
and we certainly talked
to them in the past.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.490
They have their traditional
Google Sign-in button,

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.940
but they haven't
included the one-tap UI.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.970
So I'll show them how easy it
is to add the one-tap experience

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:41.630
to their existing site.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:44.650
Now B&amp;H Photo Video has
this really cool store

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.150
in New York where they have all
kinds of electronic gadgets.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:49.502
They even gave me a tour of
the last time I was there.

00:30:49.502 --> 00:30:50.960
And if you can't
make it in person,

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.231
you can definitely check
out their app or their site.

00:30:53.231 --> 00:30:54.605
And wouldn't it
be so much better

00:30:54.605 --> 00:30:58.400
an experience if, visiting
for the very first time

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.800
or coming back
across devices, when

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.190
you try to see the
information in your cart,

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:06.080
instead of seeing this
little tumbleweed go

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.210
through the empty cart
because it doesn't know who

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:11.930
I am, there was an easy way
for the user to get signed in,

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.330
signed up, or perhaps,
as you see further

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:16.640
down the page, subscribed
for a newsletter.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.070
This really feels like
the perfect opportunity

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:23.240
to show that one-tap UI that
we've been talking about today.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.690
So to demo how easy this
is, what we're going to do

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:27.610
is load a script
onto the page that

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.500
makes this library available.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.390
At this point, I'm
just going to paste

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:35.980
in the code from the
slide and run it here.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:40.630
Now you see that inline on the
page, this UI has appeared.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:44.110
As you, the developer, the key
thing for you to think about

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:47.800
is where and when to show
this information to the user.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.590
What's the right time to
ask somebody to sign up?

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.540
As you see, it's
really easy to add.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.620
The key thing to think about
is showing it at the right time

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.190
so that people want to click.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:01.670
Now what I'll do here, again
I have Elisa's account active,

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:02.962
I'll click in through.

00:32:02.962 --> 00:32:04.670
And you'll see that
the promise resolves.

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:07.260
I get some information
back about who she is,

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.860
and it includes this thing
we've been talking about today,

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.610
the identity token.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.520
Now it's a big long
string here, and that's

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.770
because it's Base64 encoded.

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:18.099
So what we're going to do
is go back to the slides

00:32:18.099 --> 00:32:19.640
and talk a little
bit more about what

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.400
you do with this information
and how B&amp;H could actually

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.130
take this and sign the
user into, perhaps,

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:27.142
their existing account.

00:32:27.142 --> 00:32:29.600
Before we get there, let's just
finish up a few points here

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.470
on the front-end side of things.

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:34.630
So as I discussed, you need to
register and create a client

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.990
ID for your application.

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:39.530
So agree to things like
the terms of service.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:42.140
And then, not only
do you need to show

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.000
the UI at the right
point, you probably

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.150
want to check if those existing
users already have an account.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:51.350
So perhaps before you even show
the one-tap UI on page load,

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:53.690
you probably want to
call a corresponding API

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.220
to sign in existing users.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.952
That's the retrieve method here.

00:32:58.952 --> 00:33:01.160
Now we've talked a little
bit about this in the past,

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.770
that these similar APIs
are available for Android,

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:05.540
and since we're a bit
short on time today

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.040
I'm just going to
skip over it here.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.350
But go to
developers.google.com/identity

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:13.410
to see how to do similar things
in your native apps on Android.

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:16.660
One-tap email selection,
including phone numbers,

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.780
and automatic sign-in.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:19.344
All right.

00:33:19.344 --> 00:33:21.260
So what do we need to
do with this information

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.010
once we've got it?

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.650
We have this token
representing the user.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:28.010
Well we need to send it up to
the app developer's server,

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:30.050
validate the information
in the token,

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.550
and then apply some
business logic.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.830
So things like determining
whether this is an existing

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.080
user, or helping a user
create a new account.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.660
So for that, let's take a
closer look at the token.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.750
Now I took the token
here and decoded it

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.180
so you can see the contents.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.630
It's a JSON web token.

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.150
So a JSON dictionary that
contains some information

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:51.380
about the user.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.930
You'll notice that same
configuration, the audience

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.900
parameter here, is inline
and the token saying who

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:57.734
this was issued for.

00:33:57.734 --> 00:34:00.274
And that's the thing you have
to check to make sure that this

00:34:00.274 --> 00:34:01.677
isn't a stolen piece of data.

00:34:01.677 --> 00:34:03.260
Just like a passport
in the real life,

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.676
you have to make
sure that someone

00:34:04.676 --> 00:34:08.110
hasn't taken this and used
it where they shouldn't have.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.900
There's other information
here about when this token was

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.760
issued so you can make
sure it's still valid

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.350
and make sure that it
hasn't been replayed.

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:17.710
There's the user data
that we described.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:19.630
And finally, there's
some information

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.870
about who issued this token and
how it's been cryptographically

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:25.120
signed so that you can
check the signature

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.800
and ensure that it
came from Google

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.125
and hasn't been tampered with.

00:34:29.125 --> 00:34:30.500
Now as you can
imagine, it starts

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.179
to get a little bit
complicated about knowing

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:33.980
all these details,
and so what I'll show

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.750
you next are
libraries that you can

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:38.690
use to do all of the
checks and validation

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:41.659
without having to know the
internals of these tokens

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:43.982
or how they work.

00:34:43.982 --> 00:34:46.190
So the first thing we need
to do is send the token up

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.774
to the server.

00:34:46.774 --> 00:34:48.273
The important thing
to call out here

00:34:48.273 --> 00:34:50.322
is to make sure to do this
over a secure channel.

00:34:50.322 --> 00:34:52.280
This is a user's credential
that will give them

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.420
access to their data,
so need to use HTTPS.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.640
Once it's on the
server, as I described,

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.070
we'd really strongly
recommend using a library

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:02.630
to validate this token.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:05.150
It is a standard JSON
web token, so you

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:08.720
could use any library that
allows you to validate

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.030
such tokens, but we'd
recommend that you actually

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.310
use an identity-specific
one that checks

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.260
the identity-specific claims.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.230
We'll have some libraries from
Google specifically designed

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.820
for these Google
tokens coming soon

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.780
on
developers/google.com/identity.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.550
So once the token's
been validated,

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.140
just like the
passport in real life,

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.570
you can use the information
that's available there.

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:31.400
And as I described,
the key things

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.970
are checking whether this
user has an existing account.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:38.750
So maybe you'll take the email
address or the Google user ID,

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:41.240
look up that user and see
if there's a matching one.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.970
As we've described, you know
that in the case of Gmail

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:47.210
users, their email address is
actually active on this device

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:47.806
or browser--

00:35:47.806 --> 00:35:50.180
they could reset their password
if they had a traditional

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.470
password-based account--

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:54.230
and you should let them
into that existing account.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.390
That's the first step.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:58.900
Now once you've checked
for existing users,

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.200
the key thing to do is
help on board new users.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.790
Now you know who
these users are,

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:06.220
you have their identity
information, their name,

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.930
their photo, and
their email address,

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:10.141
so you can really
bootstrap the experience.

00:36:10.141 --> 00:36:12.140
But depending on the
nature of your application,

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.020
you might need to ask
for additional data--

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.660
so things like their
location, or their age--

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.645
or maybe have them agree
to terms of service.

00:36:18.645 --> 00:36:20.020
And that's stuff
that you'll have

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.450
to do in the front
end of the app,

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.230
so you have to send
some response back

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:26.440
to finish the account
creation process.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.970
At the end of the
day, the hope is

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:30.220
that you can build an
experience like this, as Treffyn

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.240
showed at the beginning.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.390
Coming to an app, either
selecting with one tap

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:37.540
or automatically signing
into an existing account,

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.760
with that token behind
the scenes replacing

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.350
manual authentication and a
traditional sign-in screen.

00:36:44.744 --> 00:36:46.410
The takeaway here is
that you can really

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.300
focus on building your service.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.600
Adding this front-end pieces
of UI have been simplified.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.520
You apply the
back-end logic that's

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.980
intended for your
application, and you

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.020
can use libraries to
make this a lot easier.

00:37:00.644 --> 00:37:02.060
Before we move on,
I'll add a plug

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.770
for one more
important tool here,

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:05.330
and that is Firebase Auth.

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:07.376
So if you're building for
the Firebase platform,

00:37:07.376 --> 00:37:08.750
you're a new
developer, or you're

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:11.630
able to migrate in, we
have a complete auth system

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:12.800
that you can use.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.300
So instead of taking
these libraries

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.820
and adding them to your
existing auth system,

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.140
we can make it a lot
easier by using Firebase.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:20.690
OK.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.340
So Luke, any last questions
we can help you with?

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.130
LUKE CAMERY: Yeah.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:26.610
That seems great that you
can outsource all the work

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:29.550
to Google by using those
libraries, and as a developer,

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:30.620
I'm totally convinced.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.600
But at the end of the day, we're
trying to help out companies.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.370
How does this make
financial sense

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.584
to integrate into your site?

00:37:37.584 --> 00:37:39.250
STEVEN SONEFF: That's
one that we always

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:42.250
have to address is that, as
developers, you come to places

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:45.430
like Google I/O and you're
probably really convinced

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.964
that there's opportunities
for your auth system.

00:37:47.964 --> 00:37:49.130
Things could be done better.

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:50.650
But we also have
to convince people

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:52.780
who are decision
makers and business

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:57.230
stakeholders about identity
being worth investing in.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:59.590
So we have great stories
from folks like HomeAway

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:03.550
here, who have really leveraged
the Google identity platform

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:06.310
to better know who
their users are,

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:09.001
to be able to personalize
experiences across devices

00:38:09.001 --> 00:38:10.750
and get the right
content in front of them

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:13.390
whenever they come back
to their site or app.

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:16.450
And on top of that, it really
introduces this opportunity

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:19.180
that once users found that
right piece of content,

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.760
they can transact
and engage with it.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.215
So that's things like smoothing
out the checkout flow.

00:38:24.215 --> 00:38:25.840
I mentioned some of
the numbers earlier

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.390
about the improvement
in the conversion rates

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:30.460
if you can make
checkout easier, but we

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.070
had this interesting stat
recently from Pet Loves

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:36.220
just saying, as a big shopping
site in South America,

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.820
that far more of their users are
ending up at the checkout page

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:40.660
already signed in.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.440
They never even needed
to see the login page.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.260
So you get the best of both;
the streamlined experience

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.850
of a guest checkout,
but knowing who

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.760
that user is, and the
opportunity to reengage them

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.280
as they come back to your
service in the future.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.530
So things like sending
the user emails

00:38:56.530 --> 00:39:00.880
if they've opted into that
about upcoming sales, deals,

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.742
price changes, or
maybe a reminder

00:39:02.742 --> 00:39:04.450
to buy flowers for
your mom this weekend.

00:39:06.564 --> 00:39:08.230
So if you put all
these pieces together,

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:11.560
you get this smooth,
personalized experience

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.850
where you know your user,
you can improve checkout

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:17.210
and conversion
rates, and you can

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.340
keep users engaged and secure.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.860
After all, in a world where
they don't even have passwords,

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.600
they won't be
phished, or you won't

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.740
have problems with those
weak and reused passwords.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.620
So leave it to Luke to wrap up
today and tell you a little bit

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.150
about what we covered.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:33.710
LUKE CAMERY: Thank you guys
for explaining all this to me.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:35.084
I feel like I
learned a lot here.

00:39:35.084 --> 00:39:36.771
It's a really seamless
user experience

00:39:36.771 --> 00:39:38.270
where you can just
skip the sign-in,

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:41.074
don't even have to think about
it; transparent data sharing,

00:39:41.074 --> 00:39:42.740
you know exactly what
you're giving away

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.500
and what you're keeping private;
and you get all these security

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.880
benefits on the side.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.730
And for developers, you get all
these account quality benefits.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:52.330
So Steven, where
do I go to start?

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:53.830
STEVEN SONEFF: Well
the place to go,

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.330
we've mentioned a
few times today is

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:57.537
developers.google.com/identity.

00:39:57.537 --> 00:39:59.620
That's where you'll find
the documentation for all

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.350
of the APIs that
we've described,

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.790
and case studies and examples
with many of the partners

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:05.799
that we've referenced.

00:40:05.799 --> 00:40:08.340
And since you're here at I/O,
there's a couple of other talks

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.470
that you'd probably like
to visit and check out.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:12.630
We have some coming up
tomorrow around building

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.490
and personalizing an
action, leveraging

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:18.094
the same ideas and the same
underlying Google Identity;

00:40:18.094 --> 00:40:20.760
as well as a deep dive into this
experience on the web that I've

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.349
been talking about today.

00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:24.390
So if you've got time,
definitely check those out

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:27.960
tomorrow and we'd love to
continue the conversation.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:31.424
So we monitor the Stack
Overflow tag Google-Identity.

00:40:31.424 --> 00:40:33.090
Make sure to leave
your questions there,

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.350
that's the best
place to put them out

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:35.670
in front of the community.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:38.370
And our contact information
is up here on the slides.

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:39.440
You can send us an email.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.010
I'm sso@google.com.

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.670
We would love to hear from you.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.810
And we'll be in the web sandbox
after this, or around the stage

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:47.940
if you've got questions
that you'd like to ask us.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.741
That's tent G over on that side.

00:40:50.741 --> 00:40:52.740
So thank you very much
for your attention today.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:55.110
We'd love to hear
from you and be

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:57.360
able to show your site
or your app up here

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.040
next year at I/O
about how you've

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.340
made identity a more secure and
easy experience for your users.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.770
Thank you.

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:08.160
