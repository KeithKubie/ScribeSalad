[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.821
SPEAKER: Please join me
in welcoming Patrisse Khan

00:00:07.821 --> 00:00:08.321
Cullors.

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:11.688
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.820
PATRISSE CULLORS:
Hi, Google Seattle.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.630
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.796
PATRISSE CULLORS: Thank you.

00:00:19.796 --> 00:00:20.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.320
I like lively audiences,
so please feel free to mhm,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.410
and ashay, and amen.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.480
This is the introduction to
the book "We Are Stardust."

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.200
Days after the
election of 2016, Asha

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.260
sent me a link to talk about
afrophysicist Neil deGrasse

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.550
Tyson.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.420
We have to have hope, she says
to me across 3,000 miles--

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.090
she in Brooklyn,
me in Los Angeles.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.490
We listen together as
deGrasse Tyson explains

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.250
that the very atoms and
molecules in our bodies

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.150
are traceable to the crucibles
in the centers of stars

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.250
that, once upon a time,
exploded into gas clouds.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.730
And those gas clouds
formed other stars.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.880
And those stars possess
the divine right mix

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.310
of properties needed to
create not only planets,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.350
including our own--

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.820
but also people,
including us-- me and her.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.490
He is saying that not only
are we in the universe,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.080
but that the universe is in us.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.360
He is saying that
we, human beings,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.340
are literally made
out of stardust.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.692
And I know when I hear
deGrasse Tyson say this

00:01:26.692 --> 00:01:27.900
that he is telling the truth.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.310
Because I have seen it
since I was a child--

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.080
the magic, the stardust
we are, and the lives

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.730
of people I come from.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.680
I watched it in the
labor of my mother,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.560
a Jehovah's Witness, and a woman
who worked two and sometimes

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.160
three jobs at a time.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.150
Keeping other people's children,
working in the reception desk

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.300
at Jim's, telemarketing--
doing anything and everything

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.690
for 16 hours a day, the whole
of my childhood in the Van Nuys

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.490
barrio where we lived.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.410
My mother, cocoa
brown and smooth,

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.270
disowned by her family
for the children

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.050
she had as a very young
and unmarried woman.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.510
My mother never gave up, despite
never making a living wage.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.380
I saw it in the thin brown
face of my father, a boy out

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.729
of Cajun Country.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.919
A wounded healer whose
addictions were born

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.140
of a world that did not
love him and told him

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.930
so not once, but constantly.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.000
My father, who
always came back, who

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.620
never stopped trying to be a
better version of himself--

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.510
there were no mirrors for.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.140
And I knew it, because
I am the 13th generation

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.320
progeny of a people who survived
the hulls of slave ships--

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.150
survived the chains,
the whips, the months

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.220
laying in their
own shit and piss.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.660
The human being's
legislator that

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.200
is not human beings who watch
their names, their languages,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.900
their goddesses and gods,
the Ark of their dances

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.670
and beats of their songs,
the majesty of their dreams,

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.850
their families snatched
up and stolen--

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.290
disassembled and discarded--
and despite this,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.970
built language and honored God
and created movement and upheld

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.140
love.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.780
What could they be but
stardust, these people who

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.100
refused to die?

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.680
Who refused to accept the
idea that their lives did not

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.290
matter, that their children's
lives did not matter.

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.912
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.640
SPEAKER: Well, first, let me
just start by thanking you.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.860
For me in particular,
I will start

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.470
with a personal
note of that that's

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.495
very meaningful-- as a
career woman of color,

00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:22.120
as an immigrant, as
I mentioned to you.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.360
This, for me, is a big honor.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.693
So I appreciate that, thank you.

00:03:24.693 --> 00:03:25.980
PATRISSE CULLORS: Thank you.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.300
SPEAKER: I actually want to
talk a little bit about--

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.830
you start this story by history,
talking about your family,

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.090
in particular-- and your
mom, and your brother,

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.510
and your father.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.050
And you focus a lot on this idea
of collective responsibility

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.049
versus personal responsibility.

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.590
So I'd actually ask you to talk
a little bit more about that.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.290
Why do you believe
that this focus

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.570
that we have on
personal responsibility

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.130
can be so detrimental,
particularly

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.610
to black individuals?

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.610
And what is there
to gain from moving

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.300
to this idea of call activity?

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.550
PATRISSE CULLORS:
It's a great question,

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.090
because I was
literally just talking

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.480
to a reporter about this
when I got off the plane.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.540
Which is-- for many of us, who
grew up in poor neighborhoods,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.930
who grew up in poverty--

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.210
the experience we had
was it was our fault.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.940
We were blamed for our families
being unable to feed us.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.550
We are blamed for our
families addictions.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.560
We were blamed for the state
coming after our family.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.670
We were blamed for
so many things that

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.670
had everything to do with
a system that was literally

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.680
created to harm and
decimate communities.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.420
And so the question
becomes, who is accountable?

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.970
Is it the people who
are most at the margins?

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.660
The people who have experienced
some of the most suffering?

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.432
Or is it the system--

00:04:46.432 --> 00:04:48.390
is it local government,
is it state government,

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.730
is it federal government?

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.230
And as we live under this
current administration,

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.210
how do we hold it accountable?

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.130
How do we hold local government
accountable to actually produce

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.830
laws that will
support human beings,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.110
produce policies that
will support human beings,

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.140
And how do we challenge the
idea that a young mother, who

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.950
had a child at 16, deserves
to be kicked out of her home?

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.370
Deserves to not receive
the type of support

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.010
and aid just because she
had children out of wedlock,

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.440
or just because she had
a child at a young age.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.330
I mean, these are the
kinds of questions

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.040
that we need to ask ourselves.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.120
And I think what happens,
because we live in a culture--

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.640
and America, in
particular-- that

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.370
really values personal
respond to responsibility,

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.770
really values the idea
of pulling yourself up

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.020
by your bootstraps.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.200
Well, that only actually
works for certain people.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.600
And the pulling up
by your bootstraps

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.420
is designed for certain people,
and not designed for others.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.020
And when we can have an honest
conversation about the design,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.560
then we can have an honest
conversation about what

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.030
it should look like--

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.740
how it should look differently.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.070
And so not only am I
challenging the idea

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.280
of personal
responsibility, which

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.190
I think is different than
asking people to be accountable.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.970
I want to, like,
differentiate those terms.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.530
Someone being responsible
for their own poverty--

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.480
no.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.790
But someone being
accountable, being

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.770
accountable to their
family, right-- my mother

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.790
was accountable to us, because
she worked 16 hours a day.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.310
But she wasn't responsible
for her poverty.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.522
I think we have to be able
to differentiate that.

00:06:35.522 --> 00:06:36.980
And the last thing
I'll say on this

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.090
is it will take all of us--

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.070
it has to be all of us--

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.070
to change the system,
to change this place.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.400
To collectively come
together and make a decision.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.920
As many of us say in
Black Lives Matter-- when

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.664
black people get
free, everybody else

00:06:53.664 --> 00:06:54.830
gets a little bit more free.

00:06:57.137 --> 00:06:58.970
SPEAKER: On the Black
Lives Matter movement,

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.030
in particular-- the
shooting of Trayvon Martin

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.230
and the acquittal of his shooter
is clearly an important moment

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.910
in that movement.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.410
Can you speak a
little bit as to why

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:15.440
that moment resonated with
you so powerfully when it did?

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.364
PATRISSE CULLORS: Yes.

00:07:16.364 --> 00:07:17.780
And what you're
going to notice is

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.896
I'm always going to kind
of take a few steps back.

00:07:20.896 --> 00:07:22.520
Because a moment is
a moment, but there

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.920
are things that lead
up to the moment

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.840
that actually makes
that moment the moment.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.962
So for me, it was--

00:07:31.962 --> 00:07:33.045
I come from a generation--

00:07:33.045 --> 00:07:34.280
I was born in '83--

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.320
and so I come from a generation
that witnessed Reagan,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.880
witnessed the Bush's,
witnessed the Clinton's.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.760
And in those presidencies,
what we got to see

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.010
was a ratcheting up
of the war on drugs,

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.150
a ratcheting up of
mass incarceration,

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.166
and ratcheting up
mass criminalization

00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:01.290
of very particular
communities-- black communities,

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.930
in particular.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.230
And as I grow up--

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.250
and as many of us grow up in
this particular era and age

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.540
group--

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.600
we are sort of the
sacrificed ones.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.630
We're the children
who are being impacted

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.220
by deindustrialization.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.930
We're the children
who are being impacted

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.610
by the militarized policing.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.350
And so once we get
to Trayvon Martin,

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.150
so many things have happened--

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.330
'92, Rodney King.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.975
Oscar Grant has happened.

00:08:30.975 --> 00:08:33.350
And then Trayvon, although
not killed by law enforcement,

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.350
he's killed by a vigilante who
was empowered by a state that

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.220
empowers law enforcement.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:42.919
And so I didn't think
that George Zimmerman

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.609
was going to get off.

00:08:45.609 --> 00:08:47.150
I was like, he killed
Trayvon Martin.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.850
We all knew that, jury knew it.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.600
I didn't think he was
going to get murder,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.840
but I definitely didn't think
he was going to get to go home.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.660
And when he did on
July 13th of 2013,

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.010
I was very clear that
that wasn't going

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.380
to be the period to the story--

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.600
that we had to do more.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.580
That I had to do
more, personally.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.950
And as I heard Sybrina Fulton--

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:15.020
Trayvon Martin's mother--
specifically speak out through

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:20.180
tears, through grief, and call
on the people of this country

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.050
to show up for her child,
to show up for her--

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.810
I just felt like it was
incredibly important.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:31.610
And so I was on social
media, like many of us are,

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.330
angry and upset and
trying to figure out

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.400
how to understand
what was happening.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.470
And I came across a good
friend's Facebook post--

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.180
Alicia Garza-- and she
wrote Black Lives Matter,

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.150
and then I put a hashtag on it.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.280
And Alicia was like,
what's a hashtag?

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.130
And I was like, it's this
thing that can go viral.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.300
But I'm also a
trained organizer,

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.770
so I wasn't just interested
in an online campaign.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.990
I was interested in how
we translated Black Lives

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.810
Matter to the ground
and how it really

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.110
could be a grassroots movement
that can bubble up, change

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.990
the world, change the country.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.550
And on July 15th, when
we solidified Black Lives

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.790
Matter as a political project,
I wrote on social media again.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.650
I said, hey, Alicia
and I have started

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.780
this project called
Black Lives Matter,

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.460
and we hope that it will impact
more than we can ever imagine.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.960
SPEAKER: One of the things you
talk about a lot in your book

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.760
is taking that hashtag--

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.600
you say that, I think,
hashtag to movement.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.690
So essentially, creating power
under this umbrella of Black

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:31.640
Lives Matter.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.980
What has that journey been like?

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.354
What are some of the lessons
you've learned-- challenges,

00:10:35.354 --> 00:10:35.879
victories?

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:37.670
PATRISSE CULLORS: Well,
we have to remember

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.980
that Black Lives Matter
really started organically.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.770
It started online,
this organic moment.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:47.510
It was very quickly galvanized
into a political project.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.339
Really, that first
year was nurturing it.

00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:52.130
Having people talk
about Black Lives Matter

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.750
in their organizations--
at their offices--

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.541
having a lot of, like,
conference calls.

00:10:57.541 --> 00:10:59.540
How do we use this, taking
it out to the streets

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.230
during protests.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.850
But I would say that the
height of BLM, or where

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:09.560
it becomes worldwide, is after
the non-indictment of Darren

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.650
Wilson.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:17.030
And after Mike Brown's
killer is not indicted,

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.330
that is the first time it
goes viral on social media.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.827
And I remember being
like, we have to do more.

00:11:23.827 --> 00:11:25.910
We have to figure out
what's the next step, what's

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.290
the next angle.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.820
And 600 of us went and did
a Black Lives Matter freedom

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.370
ride, and we drove
into St. Louis.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.380
And before we drove
in we called folks--

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.760
you know, folks let us
know we could come in.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.990
We're not just showing up
to people's neighborhoods.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:47.390
And on that three day journey--

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.417
because it was only three days--

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:50.750
there's two commitments we made.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.020
The first commitment was to show
up for the people of St. Louis,

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.450
to let them know
that we're not going

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.600
to allow for Ferguson PD--

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.680
and every other municipality
law enforcement municipality--

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.690
to treat this community
this way without us

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.970
watching, witnessing, and
going back and telling

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.080
our communities.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.450
But the second
thing that we said

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.310
that we wanted to
make sure we did

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.890
is go back home and organize.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.502
And build what we
would then build,

00:12:17.502 --> 00:12:19.460
which is the Black Lives
Matter Global Network.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.300
Which is an organization of
40 chapters around the globe--

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.477
here in the US, in Canada,
and the United Kingdom.

00:12:26.477 --> 00:12:29.060
SPEAKER: One of the things that
you discuss on the Black Lives

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.250
Matter, in particular,
is this idea

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:35.840
of creating a hashtag
that people would embrace.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.440
And the word black ends up being
sort of a big point of salience

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.460
when it comes to it.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.010
And I think more recently
in the tech community,

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.856
we've had one diversity leader
say that if you have 12--

00:12:47.856 --> 00:12:49.730
I think it's white,
blue-eyed men in a room--

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.740
it's a diverse room, because
people have different ideas.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.197
So I want to speak a little
bit about intersectionality,

00:12:55.197 --> 00:12:56.780
which is such a big
part of your book.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.420
But also, how do we have
a genuine conversation

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:04.100
about intersectionality without
it becoming an all lives matter

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:04.649
conversation?

00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:07.190
Like, how do we actually bring
that in a way that is genuine?

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.189
PATRISSE CULLORS: Right.

00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:10.490
How do you have a
conversation and practice

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.761
about intersectionality,
without whitewashing it?

00:13:12.761 --> 00:13:13.260
SPEAKER: Yes

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.220
PATRISSE CULLORS: Yes,
because that can happen.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:21.710
And what is important is
we understand where words

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.602
come from, and that words--

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:26.060
what's been really interesting
about this administration is

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.450
they basically made words--

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:30.225
what's the word?

00:13:30.225 --> 00:13:31.100
SPEAKER: Meaningless.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.470
PATRISSE CULLORS: Meaningless.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.670
You could say, I
hate all N-words.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.150
And then the next breath you
could say, I'm not a racist.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.170
That doesn't even
make sense, right?

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.750
But it becomes an argument.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.460
Not just in media,
but it also becomes

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.150
an argument in people's
relationships and friendships.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.120
And-- oh, that guy said I
could say this and still not

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.050
be a racist,

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.760
And I think the word
intersectionality really

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.840
comes from a woman
named Kimberle Crenshaw.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.260
And she created
it because she was

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.420
trying to challenge
the conversation,

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.060
specifically in the
black community--

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.980
that the only people
who have the right

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.390
to talk about black folks'
freedom is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.730
And she was really trying
to challenge the idea

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:21.560
that if we are going to fight
on behalf of black people,

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.340
we have to fight on behalf of
black girls and women, as well.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.820
And that there is a very
specific type of experience

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.450
that black women have
in relationship to race.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:36.290
And that patriarchy
is a part of racism

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.180
when it comes to black women.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.400
And that if we don't have
those conversations--

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.140
but more importantly, if we
don't practice differently,

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.380
we're going to just end
up in the very same cycle

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.660
that we've been in and
not gaining the things

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.190
that we really want to gain.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:54.800
So it's important, I think, if
you value the lives of people--

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.570
this is a conversation
about what we value.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:02.240
If we value that certain
people's lives need to be

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.870
prioritized, because we've
seen them be deprioritized--

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:10.040
if we value that all human
beings deserve to be treated

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.820
well--

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.100
with dignity and
with care, then we're

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.790
going to be able to have more
nuanced conversations about not

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:20.540
just Black Lives Matter, but Me
Too, Women's March, Time's Up--

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.280
I mean, the Immigrant
Rights movement--

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.030
all these movements are in
relationship to one another.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.620
And I think it's important--

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.440
sometimes we get caught up
in the rhetoric of politics,

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.270
and I like to reel it back a
bit and remind people of values.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.930
What are our values?

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:42.140
And that is often the place
where it opens up something new

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.630
for people to have a different
type of conversation--

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.880
about these things
that often can feel

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.350
very challenging to talk about.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.409
SPEAKER: On the issue of
black women, in particular--

00:15:53.409 --> 00:15:55.700
with the election of Trump--
and it's one of the things

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.033
you mentioned in your book
is that you felt particularly

00:15:58.033 --> 00:16:01.910
powerless because 96% of black
women didn't vote for Trump.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.910
And with the Jones election--
this idea that black women

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:08.577
essentially, like, saved
the state of Alabama--

00:16:08.577 --> 00:16:11.286
(WHISPERING)
whatever that means.

00:16:11.286 --> 00:16:14.620
Like, do you think that
this is a pivotal moment

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.819
of looking at black women as
a part of electoral power?

00:16:18.819 --> 00:16:21.110
Or, do you think that there's
sort of just as a passing

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.560
concern now, since we had these
consecutive elections where

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.900
the numbers were so stark?

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.330
PATRISSE CULLORS: I
think, in a lot of ways,

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.490
black women
historically have always

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.380
been at the helm of movements.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.410
We've always been at
the sort of intersection

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:41.460
of both trying to save our
families and save the world.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.670
And what we're seeing--

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.730
and what we saw with the
election of '45 and with

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:52.460
the election of getting
Roy Moore not into office--

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.230
is black women
galvanizing our power

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.760
and being strategic about it.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.120
You know, I think there was
a big fight because people

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.040
were like, well, why
did you go for Jones?

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.770
And folks had to counter
that and say, actually,

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.119
this was strategic.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.462
You know, this is the other
person that was running,

00:17:08.462 --> 00:17:10.170
and we needed to make
sure we didn't have

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.369
this other person in charge.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:15.579
So this idea I think,
often, that happens

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.339
is that black people
just sort of, like,

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:20.150
naturally do these things,
or we don't have a plan.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.770
Or there's no strategy,
or it's all organic.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.609
Sometimes those things are true.

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.510
But oftentimes, people
have a strategy--

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.220
like Rosa Parks.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.730
It's very upsetting that people
think that Rosa Parks just

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.754
sat down on a chair.

00:17:34.754 --> 00:17:36.920
And then some white guy
came over, and she was like,

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.211
I'm not going to get up today--

00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:39.930
it's not how it happened, y'all.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.690
There was a strategy behind
it, and she was a strategist.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.630
I mean, she was one of our
most brilliant strategists.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.490
And we don't hear
that very often.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.230
We don't get that story.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:55.860
We get this very ageist,
weird, like, feminizing story

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:02.280
of how she just happened to be
too old and tired to get up.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.580
Rather then they sat in rooms,
trying to figure out how

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.800
were they going to
boycott this system--

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.260
that literally got almost
all the black population

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.810
to work and to school.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.840
How do you convince
black people to not

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.980
get on a bus that can jeopardize
their jobs and their schooling?

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.180
And that moment with
Rosa Parks not getting up

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.040
is just the moment.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.200
But there was all
these other moments

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.340
before that got us there.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.040
And so I think that's important.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:37.470
Because part of what the book
is trying to do is also really

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.300
let people know that
there is a strategy.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.770
And so much of the time
that Black Lives Matter

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:47.280
has been developing, there
has been all this criticism--

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.500
what do you all really
want, what are your goals?

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.800
And this book is trying to
lay the record straight.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.650
SPEAKER: So I want to make
sure that we have a lot of time

00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.860
for questions from the floor.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.150
So I have one last question I
want to make sure to ask you,

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:04.130
and then we'll open up.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.171
So if you want to start
lining at the microphone,

00:19:06.171 --> 00:19:08.320
we'll do that.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.650
A question-- one
of the things that

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.730
is a theme that you draw
for the entirety of the book

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.820
is this idea of your
community, and you're always

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.790
pulling people.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.130
And I think one of the things
that you said that I thought

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.546
was very powerful is that "they
wouldn't let me be erased,

00:19:22.546 --> 00:19:25.140
I will never let
them be erased."

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.640
Can you speak a
little bit as to why

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.070
black community, in particular,
is so important to you?

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.050
Like, what is it
about your community

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:35.200
that you feel is
necessary in, sort of,

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.332
the world we're living in today?

00:19:37.332 --> 00:19:38.290
PATRISSE CULLORS: Yeah.

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.300
I mean, I think this
is a simple answer.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.220
Which is, I grew up around
some of the most brilliant

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.670
and talented and
powerful people--

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.660
my siblings, my parents.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.010
And yet, they received
very, very little support

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.750
for their gifts, their talents.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.750
And that is solely based off of
race and racism and classism.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:04.710
And so to witness
that, I also ended up--

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.180
and I talk about
this in the book--

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.320
I end up being sort of plucked
from my elementary school

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.550
and labeled as gifted.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.890
And so I go to a
totally separate system

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:18.870
than my siblings do,
which happens to make

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.984
me see how other people live.

00:20:20.984 --> 00:20:23.400
Because you don't know how
other people live unless you go

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.630
see it.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.400
And in that
experience, you know,

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.670
going from my own neighborhood--
which was a small suburb,

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.060
outside of the inner city of
Los Angeles that was mostly poor

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.027
working class, surrounded
by white suburb--

00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:38.860
and that's where I ended
up going to school.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:44.220
I got to see, firsthand,
just how classism plays out,

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.700
just how racism plays out.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:51.870
And that just based off of your
socio and economic background,

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:56.980
or your race-- that
your entire life changes

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.320
and what's predicted for you.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.900
And so, you know, I always
say my mother would be, like,

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.839
the most amazing therapist.

00:21:02.839 --> 00:21:04.380
She's, like, the
person who I learned

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:09.060
how to have important and
courageous conversations from.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.600
And yet, she was
relegated to menial jobs

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.440
because she never got a middle
school diploma, high school

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.340
diploma.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.440
And so there's these things--

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.360
these barriers-- that exist
for poor folks that are solely

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.060
because people don't have money.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.290
And I think for the community I
grew up in-- black communities

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.120
in particular--

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.030
there's this longing
that I have to be

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.940
fully seen and fully
realized, because I

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.450
know what gifts we have.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.160
AUDIENCE: So how do
you deal with trying

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.580
to put forward the ideas
of Black Lives Matter

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.970
and deal with the fact that
people-- rightly or wrongly--

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.826
get very antagonized
and go-- well, all lives

00:21:53.826 --> 00:21:56.147
matter, or blue lives matter?

00:21:56.147 --> 00:21:57.980
Like, as the opposite
of Black Lives Matter.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.260
PATRISSE CULLORS: Right.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.370
In a lot of different ways--

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.530
depends on the audience,
depends on the person.

00:22:07.946 --> 00:22:13.780
You know, some days I choose not
to even answer those questions,

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.850
just for my own sanity.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:18.970
Because the reality is-- and for
folks who are in the room who

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:22.010
are sort of on the fence around
all lives matter versus Black

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.140
Lives Matter--

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.300
all lives do matter.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.120
That's actually not
the argument right now.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.920
And Black Lives Matter is really
just Black Lives Matter, too.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.800
And so Black Lives Matter
is not about exclusion,

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.480
it's about focusing.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.740
And doesn't a community,
who has spent 500 years

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.660
in this country, get to decide
how we focus our energy?

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.750
And aren't we allowed
to ask people-- allies--

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.910
to join us in this fight?

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.980
And I think what I try to do in
those conversations is really

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.660
challenge people--

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.330
sometimes gently,
sometimes not so gently--

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.330
about what kind of world
do you want to live in?

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.340
Do you want to live
in a world where

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.967
the state is allowed to execute
people and get away with it?

00:23:09.967 --> 00:23:11.800
Do you want to live in
a world where someone

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.220
can get stopped for a broken
taillight, end up in jail,

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.010
and then not survive it?

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:20.500
Do you want to live in a world
where people, only because they

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.170
don't have physical
papers, are allowed

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.720
to be ripped from their
families and deported back

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.820
to their so-called countries?

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.200
What kind of world do
we want to live in?

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.470
That's what Black Lives
Matter is asking us.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.560
It's asking us to think about
the world we want to live in.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.560
And OK, if you want
to live in a world

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.490
where terrible things
happen to human beings, then

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.890
maybe I shouldn't be
talking to you about this.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:48.950
AUDIENCE: So my question
is-- aside from your work--

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:52.520
what's one piece of literature
or art or entertainment

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.950
that right now, in this
moment that we're in,

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.985
really gives you
hope for the future?

00:23:56.985 --> 00:24:00.410
PATRISSE CULLORS: Oh,
that's a good one.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:05.120
Well, I really love
Octavia Butler--

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.114
other people in the audience?

00:24:07.114 --> 00:24:08.060
AUDIENCE: Whoop!

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.393
PATRISSE CULLORS: OK, thank you.

00:24:09.393 --> 00:24:10.059
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:10.059 --> 00:24:10.642
Appreciate it!

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.710
Although it's kind of
sinister-- sometimes morbid--

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:22.060
she opens up a portal
around how to have

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:26.790
really hard conversations
about race and class and gender

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:29.530
in some of the most beautiful
and courageous and innovative

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.340
ways.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.250
And more pop culture--

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:36.490
I definitely think the
work that Issa Rae is doing

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.820
and Lena Waithe is
doing, in particular,

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.465
is very exciting and powerful
and fresh and innovative.

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:49.810
Yeah, that's what I got for you.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.450
AUDIENCE: So thank
you again for coming.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.360
I understand that you were
awarded a Peace Prize.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.650
PATRISSE CULLORS: I was.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.194
AUDIENCE: Can you talk
a little bit about that?

00:24:58.194 --> 00:24:59.694
PATRISSE CULLORS:
The irony of that!

00:24:59.694 --> 00:25:00.664
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:00.664 --> 00:25:03.250
AUDIENCE: So congratulations,
if people here don't know.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.600
PATRISSE CULLORS: Thanks.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.225
AUDIENCE: And can
you talk a little bit

00:25:06.225 --> 00:25:10.270
about what you've seen in how
the movement has been received

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.124
outside the US,
versus inside the US?

00:25:12.124 --> 00:25:13.540
PATRISSE CULLORS:
Yeah, you always

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.206
like something better
when it's outside.

00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:20.350
The Black Lives
Matter Global Network

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:24.910
received the Sydney
Peace Prize last year--

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:25.990
very amazing.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.780
I had no idea what it
was before I received it.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.480
And when we received it, I
looked it up and I was like,

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.490
oh, this is a very big deal.

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:38.560
And folks like Naomi
Klein have received it.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.430
Desmond Tutu has received it,
Noam Chomsky has received it.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:44.380
And I think we were
literally the youngest

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.050
people who ever received
the Sydney Peace Prize.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:53.870
And we were not only welcomed
by the country of Australia,

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:56.890
we were welcomed by black
folks in Australia--

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.880
aboriginal population,
first nations people.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.350
And also, really
welcomed by the media.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:06.250
I mean, it was a very,
very different experience

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:09.310
than that type of
experience we've had here

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:10.720
starting Black Lives Matter.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.760
And I think it also
challenged this idea

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.810
of us being a terrorist
group or organization.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.670
Because someone wrote about it.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.280
They're like, Black Lives
Matter just won a Peace Prize,

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.625
you could stop calling them
a terrorist organization.

00:26:21.625 --> 00:26:22.792
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.050
But it's been very powerful to--

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.490
the folks of Australia
were looking to us

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:37.300
around how they deal with race
and racism in their country.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:43.030
And how to really have
a new type of movement

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.640
that's hopefully going
to bubble up there.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:49.770
And it was more than inspiring,
more than I could ever

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.400
have imagined.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.710
And I'm very grateful
that our network was

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.682
honored with the Peace Prize.

00:26:56.682 --> 00:26:58.390
SPEAKER: But I actually
want to follow up

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.970
on the term terrorist,
because it's a term that

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.860
is very important in your book.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:03.460
PATRISSE CULLORS:
It's the title.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.240
SPEAKER: Exactly-- that's
how you know it's important.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.740
Can you speak a
little bit as to why

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.990
that word has so much power?

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:13.054
PATRISSE CULLORS:
Well, raise your hand

00:27:13.054 --> 00:27:14.470
if you or people
in your community

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:17.010
have ever been
called a terrorist?

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.670
Raise your hand high.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:23.710
Now, look around-- right.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.940
So the first time
Black Lives Matter

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.530
is called a terrorist
organization,

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.450
there's two things
that come up for me.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:38.350
The first one is devastation.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:41.647
Because, simply, I'm with
these folks every single day.

00:27:41.647 --> 00:27:42.980
I know exactly what we're doing.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.230
I know what type of
sacrifice we're giving.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:51.915
The other is a sense
of serious fear.

00:27:51.915 --> 00:27:53.290
Because the moment
the government

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.180
starts calling
people terrorists,

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.250
that means there's going
to be a war on the people.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.404
And so I think what's
important in this book,

00:28:01.404 --> 00:28:03.070
and the conversation
I'm trying to have,

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:07.340
is what do we mean
when we mean terrorist,

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.130
and who ends up being
labeled as such?

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:13.630
And what we've seen, especially
for black people in this

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:16.990
country, is whenever we decide
that we're going to fight

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:22.600
for our freedom-- that we're
going to fight for our dignity,

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.480
we're going to fight
for our humanity--

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.700
that there's a label
that is slapped on us,

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.620
or our community, to
undermine our efforts,

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.890
but also to criminalize
our efforts.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.980
And so what we've
seen-- and I'll just

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.040
ask another question of the
audience-- how many of you

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:45.200
have heard of the Black
Identity Extremists label?

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.000
Yeah.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:46.990
Who made that up?

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:48.220
AUDIENCE: Jeff Sessions.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.450
PATRISSE CULLORS: What?

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:50.800
AUDIENCE: I thought
it was Jeff Sessions?

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.990
PATRISSE CULLORS: Yeah, FBI.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.281
It was probably Jeff Sessions--

00:28:53.281 --> 00:28:54.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.036
--with the FBI.

00:28:57.036 --> 00:28:59.950
He's definitely
defending that identity.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:05.980
An identity that was literally
crafted and created by the FBI.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:11.300
And many of us saw
it in a leaked report

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.350
that came out in August 2017.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:19.930
And the report, literally, is
claiming that black activists

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:25.420
have a new identity, in which
we are more violent towards law

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.610
enforcement.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:31.150
And for many of us that
have studied movements,

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:34.870
or have elders in the movement--
like Angela Davis, Ericka

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:37.504
Huggins.

00:29:37.504 --> 00:29:39.670
In our conversations with
them, they are like, yeah,

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:42.253
this is the beginning of what
it looks like to be criminalized

00:29:42.253 --> 00:29:44.650
by the state for your activism.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.370
Similar to what COINTELPRO did.

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:48.340
And so the terrorist
conversation

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:52.960
is interrogating this idea that
black activists-- people who

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.210
are literally trying to fight
for American democracy--

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.260
are terrorists.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:00.250
And yet, the people who are
trying to change and reform

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:03.400
are terrorizing our communities.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:09.940
And how much we have to be
challenging those terms,

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.450
challenging that language,
and showing up differently,

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:14.650
I think, in this moment.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:18.040
What is different
from 30, 40 years ago

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.080
is there were no
elected officials trying

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.270
to fight for the Panther Party.

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:25.667
Now, given what we
know about COINTELPRO--

00:30:25.667 --> 00:30:28.000
given that we know that they
assassinated people, ripped

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.400
families apart, and ripped
a really powerful movement

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.440
apart--

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.120
there are elected
officials, specifically

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.540
the Congressional Black Caucus,
that is standing up to the FBI

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.640
around this term.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.890
And Congresswoman Karen Bass
has been leading the crusade

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:42.785
around that.

00:30:42.785 --> 00:30:44.505
SPEAKER: There are a
couple of questions.

00:30:44.505 --> 00:30:45.880
AUDIENCE: You
talked a little bit

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:50.970
about the virality of the
Black Lives Matter hashtag.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:54.340
And so, I guess,
I'm interested in--

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:59.440
so, like, in recent times Trump
has kind of taken over news.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.810
And, like, you hear a
lot about white supremacy

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:04.810
and you hear a lot about these
other things that kind of suck

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:06.830
up all of the media attention.

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:09.310
And I'm wondering,
like, to what extent

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:12.400
do you think it's important
for Black Lives Matter

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.170
to have that viral aspect?

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:19.683
And, like, what's the future
of the Black Lives Matter

00:31:19.683 --> 00:31:22.280
movement in an environment
where it becomes

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.550
more difficult to have a voice?

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.930
PATRISSE CULLORS: That's
great, it's a great question.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:30.490
Well, what I will say is
sometimes in movements,

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.560
you need to be a
little bit more quiet.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.830
Being out there all the
time makes you vulnerable,

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.320
and it's made us vulnerable.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.640
And sometimes, that's
not always for the best.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:47.410
So going viral is not
the goal, necessarily--

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.700
it has a great outcome.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:54.680
I think the better question is
how do we sustain ourselves?

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.890
And especially as we are
building out a global network,

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.950
how do we create an
infrastructure, an institution

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:05.877
power, that can challenge
the current power structure?

00:32:05.877 --> 00:32:07.960
That's what we're most
interested in this moment--

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.440
we're interested
in the long haul.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:15.340
And I think we're
on to something,

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:20.840
and I think we are developing
a new type of experiment that

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.290
is centering black
folks, in particular.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:25.910
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.430
Thank you for speaking to
us, today, you are amazing.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:29.880
PATRISSE CULLORS: Oh, thank you.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:33.680
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask you
a question about how you think

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:39.430
capitalism and large capitalist
entities, such as Google,

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:42.050
may affect Black Lives Matter--

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:46.310
either positively or negatively?

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:49.360
PATRISSE CULLORS:
Such a good question.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:49.860
Hmm.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:56.060
Well, what I will say is living
in this current infrastructure

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.640
that we live in-- that is, a
capitalist infrastructure--

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.980
is not sustainable for anybody.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:04.010
And as the rich literally get
richer and the poor literally

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.370
get poorer, we have to
have a long term solution.

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:09.620
Not only how we're going
to save human beings,

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.570
but how we're going
to save the planet.

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:16.910
And we, unfortunately,
have an administration

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:19.100
that doesn't believe
in climate change.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.920
It, like, drives me nuts, y'all.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.980
Like, we're literally
burning up in some places.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:32.840
And other places are drowning,
because the Earth's equilibrium

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.750
is so off.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:40.460
And so I think the long
term conversation is,

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.660
is capitalism a
sustainable model?

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.570
And many of us know it's not.

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:45.990
So what does that mean?

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.260
And that I don't
have an answer to,

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.280
but I have a lot
of questions about.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.740
And I think our movement,
often, is trying to figure that

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.610
out and have questions about.

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:59.130
I think, you know, Google is
such an interesting place,

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.190
right?

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:02.970
It's worldwide.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:04.205
It's a huge corporation.

00:34:04.205 --> 00:34:07.160
It also will bring one of the
co-founders of Black Lives

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.230
Matter to talk to its employees.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:12.679
It's, like, such an
interesting contradiction.

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:17.020
And my hope is that--

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:21.000
I'm not going to be able to
change Google, necessarily.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.420
But I think the hope,
in this certain moment,

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.290
is to change the hearts and
minds of people who work here.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:29.210
And how we make
decisions about how

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:32.409
we relate to the planet
and other human beings.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:33.630
AUDIENCE: That was beautiful.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.452
Thank you.

00:34:34.452 --> 00:34:35.929
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:37.960
SPEAKER: Let me-- oh,
there's a question.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.350
No?

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.150
Please, go ahead.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:45.062
I have already spoken way
more than anyone wants.

00:34:45.062 --> 00:34:46.520
AUDIENCE: So I had
a different take

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.950
on-- so you mentioned about
the strategic goals of making

00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:52.529
a sustainable movement
for long term.

00:34:52.529 --> 00:34:54.320
Specifically around
some of the things that

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.839
sparked the movement, right--

00:34:55.839 --> 00:34:59.320
police brutalities,
unjust violence--

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.150
do you or does the movement
have charterdom goals--

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:04.620
either through activism or
legislative changes through

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.600
time--

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.580
planned on some of
the more egregious

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:12.614
policing tactics, the ridiculous
use of force type of mandates?

00:35:12.614 --> 00:35:14.155
Are there specific
codes around that?

00:35:14.155 --> 00:35:15.529
PATRISSE CULLORS:
Yeah, actually.

00:35:15.529 --> 00:35:17.060
I was just on a
phone call about it,

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:20.160
before I got here,
talking to our lawyers.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:25.250
It's a great question because
someone asked me-- well,

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:27.640
"Time Magazine" asked me
the other day and said,

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.040
will there ever be
a Me Too of racism?

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:30.979
And I was like, well--

00:35:30.979 --> 00:35:32.270
it's called Black Lives Matter.

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.360
But what I think
is interesting--

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.370
I think what he was trying
to ask, actually, was--

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:44.840
Me Too has been successful
at literally knocking down

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.030
some of the biggest power
players in Hollywood.

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:49.010
I mean, people that
we never thought

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:53.330
would be sort of taken out, you
know, taken out of Hollywood--

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:54.496
have been.

00:35:54.496 --> 00:35:56.120
Whether or not they
have huge pensions,

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.380
if they could still
live their lives--

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:58.560
it's a whole other question.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.530
But symbolically,
what that has shown

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:03.590
us is that sexual assault
and violence is not going

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:07.190
to be taken lightly anymore.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:09.140
And he was trying
to ask-- well, how

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:13.617
come we haven't had the same
impact on law enforcement?

00:36:13.617 --> 00:36:15.200
And what I did is I
said, well, that's

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.090
not Black Lives
Matter fault. We've

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:20.630
done everything we can to hold
law enforcement accountable.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.300
But rather, we have
to have a larger

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.000
conversation about
the people who

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.010
keep law enforcement in power--

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:32.630
elected officials, county
board of supervisors,

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:34.970
state governors, the laws.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:41.360
I mean, in the US, I think
there's over 22 Peace Officer

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.470
Bill of Rights, right?

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:46.730
Which literally are a
document that gives rights

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:50.150
to peace officers that
pretty much excludes them

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.100
from being held
accountable for their acts.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.410
California and Seattle
have some of the worst

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.450
Police Officer Bill of Rights.

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.760
And so much of what
we're trying to do

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.060
is go state by state,
city by city, county

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:05.850
by county changing those laws.

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:08.600
The first experiment is
going to be California.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.620
Because we have some of
the most egregious laws,

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.328
but also because we
have some of the most

00:37:12.328 --> 00:37:14.660
progressive legislators.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.182
So can we get enough
legislators to say we

00:37:18.182 --> 00:37:19.640
can't allow this
to happen anymore.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.549
Can we get enough district
attorneys to say--

00:37:21.549 --> 00:37:23.090
because it's in a
district attorney's

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:25.340
right to prosecute an officer.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.550
But they, more
often, err on not.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.830
So the work, I think,
is in the next phase--

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.470
specifically around law
enforcement violence

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:34.970
is trying to change laws.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:37.370
I think that we've hit a road.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:40.370
We have to take things
to the ballot box

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:43.679
and galvanize our movement
to push new laws forward.

00:37:43.679 --> 00:37:45.220
AUDIENCE: And just
a quick follow up.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.178
PATRISSE CULLORS: Yeah.

00:37:46.178 --> 00:37:47.750
AUDIENCE: Do you
have a specific view

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:49.100
on the use of body cameras?

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:52.400
PATRISSE CULLORS: I do, I do.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.940
We have cell phones--

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.560
so that's one.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.430
Body cameras are millions
and millions of dollars.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:03.282
And oftentimes, that
accountability--

00:38:03.282 --> 00:38:04.990
I'm going to flip it--
the responsibility

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:08.250
is on the officer to
turn on the body camera.

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:11.287
So how many times have we
seen law enforcement not

00:38:11.287 --> 00:38:12.370
turn on their body camera?

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:13.737
AUDIENCE: But, seriously.

00:38:13.737 --> 00:38:15.320
PATRISSE CULLORS:
Almost all the time.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:19.730
And so I think it's
an interesting demand.

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:22.162
But if we make body
cameras as the solution

00:38:22.162 --> 00:38:23.620
to ending law
enforcement violence,

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.220
then we've lost a long time ago.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.010
AUDIENCE: The term
terrorism has erupted,

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.550
because there has been
some incidents in time

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:32.940
that some protests--

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.880
where there, you know,
there may be violence

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.610
that has occurred, right?

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:41.580
Do you ever come to a point
where your organization just

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:45.000
comes out and flat out, you
know, denounce something?

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.861
And say, you know, this is not
something that we condoned--

00:38:47.861 --> 00:38:49.800
sometimes you
cannot be, you know,

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.000
responsible for everybody
who is at the protest.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.570
But is there, in the same way,
where you ally with some people

00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:59.580
for the same cause,
and you know,

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:02.123
under the name of [INAUDIBLE]----
yo, do I hate that word--

00:39:02.123 --> 00:39:06.330
but do you do both?

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:08.760
Is there a time where
you throw the power

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.119
of the network behind
a cause and you

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:13.285
follow through with it--
that may not be necessarily

00:39:13.285 --> 00:39:15.695
under the broad umbrella
of Black Lives Matter?

00:39:15.695 --> 00:39:17.070
And is there a
time where you see

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.000
some things, either a protest or
even inside your own movement,

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.670
where you go out there and
you just denounce it, gladly?

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:23.930
PATRISSE CULLORS: I mean, yes.

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:27.140
I think the Dallas shooting
we denounced immediately.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:31.050
Michael Johnson and I talked
about that in the book.

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:37.530
But you know, there's never
been a shooting from someone

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:41.240
who's said that they did it on
behalf of Black Lives Matter--

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.820
it's always been attributed
to Black Lives Matter.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:48.890
And our movement from
jump has been nonviolent.

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:51.500
I mean, that's just been clear.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.440
In fact, we've been
calling for law enforcement

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.640
to stop killing us, right?

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.260
And I think the
conversation about violence

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.540
versus nonviolence
is a really important

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.100
political conversation.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.700
And frankly, we're in a
different time period.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:13.730
You know, the Panthers went on
Sacramento steps and had guns.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:17.930
And we would never do that
because we see the result--

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:20.790
a black person doesn't
need a gun to get killed.

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:26.360
So I think for us, the most
effective and safe strategy

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.176
is a nonviolent strategy,
in this particular moment.

00:40:29.176 --> 00:40:31.300
AUDIENCE: Can I just ask
a quick follow up to this?

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.216
PATRISSE CULLORS: Mhm.

00:40:32.216 --> 00:40:35.500
AUDIENCE: So in social media,
usually whatever the hashtag

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.430
is, and the virality
of things, you know,

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:39.980
over the power of
the narrative--

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:42.271
so if tomorrow something was
going on with the movement

00:40:42.271 --> 00:40:43.390
and I wanted to check--

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:45.647
OK, what's the official
word from your network?

00:40:45.647 --> 00:40:47.050
Where would I go?

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:50.090
PATRISSE CULLORS: Oh,
that's a good question.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:52.460
You mean, like on what
social media pages?

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.920
AUDIENCE: Right-- pages, or
just online, or websites.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.628
PATRISSE CULLORS: So
BlackLivesMatter.com

00:40:56.628 --> 00:40:58.100
is our website.

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.220
On Facebook, we're verified.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:06.040
Do not use any other Facebook
profile, because there's tons--

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.790
and they're not verified,
and some of them

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:10.280
will steal your money.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.470
And on Twitter, we are
Black Lives Matter,

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.450
but we're @Blklivesmatter.

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:15.860
And same on Instagram.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.350
And the most
updated, like, stand

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.450
that we have on something
is usually going

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.256
to be on our Twitter account.

00:41:22.256 --> 00:41:23.630
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for speaking.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:24.754
PATRISSE CULLORS: Oh, yeah.

00:41:24.754 --> 00:41:27.825
AUDIENCE: I had a question about
intersectionality and the labor

00:41:27.825 --> 00:41:29.180
movement-- like--

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.680
PATRISSE CULLORS:
Where do they lie?

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.555
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:33.620
I mean, I don't think
police unions should

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:35.692
be able to bargain
whether or not they

00:41:35.692 --> 00:41:37.018
respect people's human rights.

00:41:37.018 --> 00:41:37.460
PATRISSE CULLORS: Yes.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.344
[CHUCKLE]

00:41:38.344 --> 00:41:40.180
AUDIENCE: Can the
labor movement still

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.162
be an ally to
Black Lives Matter?

00:41:42.162 --> 00:41:44.120
PATRISSE CULLORS: This
is such a good question.

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.910
And these are, you know--

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:50.810
I've sat with a lot of
Labor folks around this.

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:55.340
So much so that we've
really challenged

00:41:55.340 --> 00:42:01.040
Labor to have law enforcement
as part of their union.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.870
I think, honestly,
in a lot of places,

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:09.200
law enforcement is
the strongest union--

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:14.210
they have the most lawyers,
they have the most money,

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:17.700
and they have a lot of power.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.640
So when we talk to
presidents and we've

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.330
talked to union
organizers, they're

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:24.980
a pain in the butt in unions.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.810
They are, because
they're the first ones

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:29.600
to stop any sort of
democratic process,

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.240
or challenge any sort
of progressive statement

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.080
the union wants to put out.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:39.500
But until union
leadership stands up

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.360
to law enforcement
unions, we're going

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.730
to continue in the same cycle.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:48.757
And I think, you know,
I spoke to one of--

00:42:48.757 --> 00:42:53.460
I don't remember which Black
Panther member said this

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.010
to us-- but they
said that we are

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:59.040
the first effective movement
to actually challenge

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.480
law enforcement,
to actually curb

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.270
the community and
the culture that

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:08.730
believes law enforcement first.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:12.360
And that to me is just the
beginning of really trying

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.150
to change the seats of power.

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:17.070
But right now, law
enforcement still

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:19.015
has all the bargaining chips.

00:43:19.015 --> 00:43:20.640
AUDIENCE: An earlier
question asked you

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.250
what in art gives you hope.

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:27.909
What in politics-- and I
think we all hope for 2020--

00:43:27.909 --> 00:43:30.700
but what else could
you hope in politics?

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.240
And I'm an engineer, I'm not
going to be a global activist.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.560
What can I do?

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.960
PATRISSE CULLORS: Great,
that's a great question.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.834
OK, two things.

00:43:38.834 --> 00:43:41.250
One, I'm going to start with
your last question-- what can

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:41.750
you do.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:43.770
Everybody has their lane.

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:50.040
I think that you don't have
to go out into the streets

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:57.450
to be active, to be aware, to
challenge awful things that

00:43:57.450 --> 00:43:59.100
happen to people.

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:05.040
You can have conversations, you
can be a part of book clubs,

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.960
you could be a
part of dialogues.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.340
I think even coming into this
room is an act of solidarity,

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.480
and a show of good faith.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.350
We also come from families--
how we're raising our children,

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:20.250
how we're talking to our wives,
our husbands, ours sisters,

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:21.990
our brothers.

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:24.540
You know, when I usually
get the question around how

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.740
can white people help--

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.200
the first thing I say is go
talk to your family members.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.120
Have those hard and
challenging conversations

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.920
that we often say--

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.530
oh, I'm just going to
ignore that-- right?

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:39.210
I think how we're living our
lives is just as important as

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:43.070
if you're out in the streets
being politically active.

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:45.020
What was your first question?

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.800
AUDIENCE: What, in
politics, gives you hope?

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.970
PATRISSE CULLORS:
Political hope-- right.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:57.570
I'm excited about
how many people that

00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:59.070
are running for
office-- that are

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:01.740
folks of color, women of color.

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.860
I'm excited about
the conversations

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.710
that are happening
around political power.

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:10.592
I'm excited about how engaged--

00:45:10.592 --> 00:45:12.550
I mean, I've been in this
work for a long time.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:14.258
And my mother never
talks about politics.

00:45:14.258 --> 00:45:17.500
And she'll, like, call
me and curse out Trump.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.610
And I'm like, oh, you're
feeling engaged in this moment.

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:23.964
Even if it's against
a person, there's

00:45:23.964 --> 00:45:25.380
something about
this moment that's

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.760
making people want to do more
than they've ever done before.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:34.500
And on the one hand, it's
devastating to witness

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.740
so many executive
orders totally just

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.650
rip through our constitution.

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:42.420
And on the other hand, it's
brilliant to see so many people

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:45.156
saying no, I'm not
going to stand for this.

00:45:45.156 --> 00:45:46.130
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:47.114
PATRISSE CULLORS: Yeah.

00:45:47.114 --> 00:45:48.680
SPEAKER: I want to make sure--

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.630
wait, no microphone.

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:51.920
There you go.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:56.350
I want to make sure we leave
some time for signing--

00:45:56.350 --> 00:46:00.090
and not just because
people are like, no--

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:01.675
I have more questions.

00:46:01.675 --> 00:46:03.800
I want to make sure we
leave some time for signing.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.310
And for people to
actually get the book.

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:07.414
So again, thank you.

00:46:07.414 --> 00:46:08.580
PATRISSE CULLORS: Thank you.

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:09.670
SPEAKER: We really appreciate
you taking the time.

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:10.130
PATRISSE CULLORS:
Thank you all so much.

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:11.713
SPEAKER: Thank you
all for everything.

00:46:11.713 --> 00:46:12.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:18.580
PATRISSE CULLORS: Thank
you, I really appreciate it.
