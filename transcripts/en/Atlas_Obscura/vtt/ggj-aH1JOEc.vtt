00:00:13.658 --> 00:00:18.087
I ka 'ōlelo no ke ola,
i ka 'ōlelo nō ka make.

00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:21.513
- In the language is life,
in the language is death.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.090
I am Puakea Nogelmeier.
I've been a professor

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.663
of Hawaiian language at the
university for 35 years.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.610
And through our work with
the Hawaiian Language

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.260
Newspaper Archive,
we're bringing new light

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.247
to Hawai'i's past by
digitizing, translating

00:00:38.247 --> 00:00:42.270
and training people to
access over a century's worth

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.513
of untapped historical knowledge.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.740
Hawaiians have never
really had easy access

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.823
to the insight of their
own people of the past.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.630
A Hawaiian society was an oral society

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.930
for a millennia, and then
with the coming of Westerners,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.810
there was a real interest
in written language.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.870
Within a generation, you have

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.430
almost universal literacy in Hawaiian.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.020
Compare that to America, which
probably had 50% literacy

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.220
at the time, they are
running a very progressive

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.283
little kingdom that is
respected around the world.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.340
1834, the first newspaper happens.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.620
By the 1860s there's three,
four, and five papers at a time.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.110
And by the 1870s, there's 10 newspapers

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.830
in a population that's
only about 70,000 people.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.730
That's a huge output!

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.850
By 1860, the kingdom
recognizes that change

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.310
is happening so fast,
population is declining so fast,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.217
and there's letters in the paper saying,

00:01:47.217 --> 00:01:49.117
"Those of you who are knowledgeable,

00:01:49.117 --> 00:01:51.837
in almost any field, please write it down

00:01:51.837 --> 00:01:54.127
and put it here, it'll be safe.

00:01:54.127 --> 00:01:57.510
Generations from now, we will need this."

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.660
And it was so true, so they're able

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.860
to start writing down what had kept

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.100
a society alive and
well, on such a limited

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.660
resource base as an
island, over centuries.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.780
This is how farming works,
this is how fishing works.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.790
For Hawaiians as a
whole, this is a history

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.350
that simply wasn't available
for the last four generations.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.700
From the 1970s, we have what's called

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.530
a Hawaiian renaissance.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.300
The renewal of interest
in cultural practices

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.360
is what built the language community

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.840
that opened up this historical
cache of newspapers.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.370
125,000 pages of newspapers
had been published.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.430
We know only about 75,000 of those pages

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.490
have been found in local archives,

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.340
but all of the pages in hand

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.713
have been digitized and are accessible.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.031
Forty years later, we get 25,000
people who speak Hawaiian,

00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:53.053
and the other million don't.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.860
We still have to make
this material accessible

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.270
to an audience that
hasn't yet gotten there.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.570
This body of knowledge is
not just for Hawaiians.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.590
This is a global resource.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.020
So the idea of sustainability
is documented there.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.110
Being able to see that is critical

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.020
for us today. We don't
have to make things up-

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.937
we actually have an
experience base to look at.
