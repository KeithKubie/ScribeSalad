00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Some of the revenue model questions:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What is it my customers are paying for?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What's the value? What is it when they look at my company and my products?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
By the way, what capacity do they have to pay? They might love it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In fact, everybody who looks at a Ferrari or a Tesla model S

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
might say, yes, I'd love to pay for that, but—you know what?—my wife won't let me

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or I just don't have the money.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That is, is the total available market of potential users your needs for revenue?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You might have built a product so expensive

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that the customer segment you've targeted just can't afford it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Then how will you package your product?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
By package I don't mean what kind of pretty box is it in.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Another mistake startups make, particularly engineering-driven startups,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
is putting every possible feature into the first product,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
not thinking that perhaps—well, wait a minute.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Maybe we could decompose the product—that is, take it apart—

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and offer these as add-ons or as ancillary products

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
or separate products, etc.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
How you package your products should not just be an engineering functionality decision.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It should be a value-based decision.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
As we said, the same with pricing.

00:01:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
How will you price? What kind of tactics will you use?
