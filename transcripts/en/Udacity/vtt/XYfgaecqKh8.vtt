00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.380
One of the fundamental features of
a prototype is that it acts vaguely like

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.330
the final app when it's interacted
with but is much simpler to make.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.220
This means that when
we build a prototype,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.900
we need to think about
interaction points.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.666
An interaction point is anywhere that
a user might might press, scroll, or

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.640
type in order to interact with your app.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.590
By identifying
the interaction points for

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.190
your app, you will identify where you
need to link screens together and

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.870
what work you need to do
to build a prototype.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.540
For a low fidelity prototype,

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.070
we only need to deal with interaction
points that will move the user between

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.540
the screens, not interaction points
that will allow them to input content.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.399
For example, let's take a look at
our calendar and to do list app.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.100
This app had a floating action button,
or FAB, which we can expect users to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.600
touch and on the screen that opens,
it has a number of other options.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.670
We can expect users to try to interact
with each of them in the final app but

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.610
since they don't add another screen,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.300
we don't need to deal with that
functionality here just yet.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.930
On our menu screen,
each item leads to a new screen.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.380
Fewer menu items means fewer screens to
build but also a reduced functionality.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.860
Finding a balance there is vital,
we don't want to remove an core

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.720
functionality in order to have fewer
interaction points but you can probably

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.447
go without a terms and condition
option in your lo-fi prototype.
