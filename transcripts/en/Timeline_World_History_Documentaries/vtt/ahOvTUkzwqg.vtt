00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.000
In January 1559 Elizabeth the first was crowned Queen of England.

00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:20.800
She was the last of the great Tudor dynasty.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.000
A bright star who dazzled both a nation and the world.

00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:32.995
The achievement of most stars fades quickly.

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:38.600
But Elizabeth's has lasted nearly four centuries, and it's easy to see why.

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:42.400
She reigned for forty-five tremulous years.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.900
Her ships defeated The Spanish Armada and sailed around the globe.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.800
In her time Shakespeare wrote plays and Spencer wrote poems.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.200
English noblemen and foreign Princes wooed her.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.000
But she the Virgin Queen made love to that loyalist of audiences, the English people.

00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:07.675
Elizabeth was one of the daughter of King Henry the eighth.

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:10.755
But the right of women to succeed to the throne

00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:14.800
was still in doubt and her path there would be perilous.

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:21.400
Her father would kill her mother and she will be disinherited.

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:27.700
Her sister would imprison her in the tower and threaten her with execution.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:32.400
Men would love her for her royal status and not for herself.

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:37.300
She will be sexually abused by her own step-father.

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:41.055
Most monarchs are handed their crowns on a plate.

00:01:41.255 --> 00:01:44.585
Elizabeth got hers by cunning and courage.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.915
Elizabeth's sex was a dissapointment to Henry.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.980
Astrologists had assured him that the baby to be born

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.100
in September 1533 would be a boy.

00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:05.105
He already had one daughter,

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:10.300
the seventeen year old Mary. What he wanted was a son, an heir.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:17.865
But although Elizabeth was a girl, the magnificent christening planned for the longed for Prince

00:02:17.865 --> 00:02:25.300
went ahead. Every detail had been seen to down to the brazier to warn the water in the font.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:29.800
She was even proclaimed Princess, the title of the heir to the throne.

00:02:30.705 --> 00:02:38.800
PRIEST: "Elizabeth *prays in another language* Amen"

00:02:40.395 --> 00:02:42.365
*CRYING* According to the French Ambassador

00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:46.500
the whole occasion was so perfect that nothing was lacking.

00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:51.900
Actually, things were far from perfect at Elizabeth's baptism.

00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:55.800
Because Elizabeth was the child of a second marriage,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.400
and Henry's second marriage like many second marriages today

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.255
aroused very strong feelings.

00:03:02.605 --> 00:03:08.200
For instance the Imperial Ambassador refused point blank to attend the baptism.

00:03:08.715 --> 00:03:13.900
He even refused to recognize Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth's mother as Henry's wife.

00:03:14.245 --> 00:03:18.800
Instead he sneeringly referred to her as, The Whore.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.800
And as for little Elizabeth she was, The Bastard.

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:30.200
Even one of the officiating clergy when he was asked, had been baptized in hot water or cold?

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.800
Replied... Hot, but not hot enough.

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:41.700
Henry divorced his first wife Catherine of Aragon because she had not given him a son.

00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:47.000
But now her replacement Anne Boleyn was having her own gynecological problems.

00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:52.300
After two miscarriages she finally had a baby boy, but it was stillborn.

00:03:53.285 --> 00:03:57.000
Anne had failed in her principal duty as royal breeding machine.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Meanwhile Henry had fallen in love with another woman, Jane Seymour.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.000
For Anne the end came with terrifying swiftness.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.200
She was accused of multiple adultery with four of the gentlemen of the King's chamber

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.600
and of incest with her own brother.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.400
All of the accused were found guilty, and Anne herself was executed here on Tower Green

00:04:21.105 --> 00:04:24.235
on the nineteenth of May 1536.

00:04:24.705 --> 00:04:29.600
Henry showed a single gesture of mercy toward the woman he once loved so much.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.800
And her head was removed with a single stroke, with a sword, rather than being hacked off with the ax.

00:04:50.655 --> 00:04:56.500
Elizabeth was only three when her mother was executed as a traitor and a whore.

00:04:57.015 --> 00:05:00.105
For many children this would have been a life long trauma.

00:05:00.705 --> 00:05:04.000
But Elizabeth seems to have airbrushed her mother from her memory.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.000
It was to be Henry, who filled her world.

00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:25.900
Anne Boleyn's fall marked a major step down in world for the young Elizabeth.

00:05:26.585 --> 00:05:29.755
Her parents marriage was declared null and void.

00:05:29.975 --> 00:05:34.200
She was now illegitimate and unable to inherit the throne.

00:05:34.675 --> 00:05:44.200
So instead of the right high and might Princess. The lady Elizabeth,  inheritrix of the crown of England .

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.400
She became the Lady Elizabeth, the King's second bastard daughter.

00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:57.800
Elizabeth's sudden loss of status thew the little court where she had been brought up into confusion.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.000
Even her Governess, Lady Bryan didn't know what to do

00:06:02.005 --> 00:06:06.300
and wrote to the King's minister Thomas Cromwell for guidance.

00:06:06.915 --> 00:06:09.005
How should the little girl be treated?

00:06:09.545 --> 00:06:12.615
By the way, could she please have some more clothes?

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.060
She's outgrown absolutely everything she had.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.600
But above all, where should she eat?

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.795
Was she old enough to eat here, in the great hall?

00:06:21.795 --> 00:06:25.600
Served on the dais, or should she continue to eat in her chamber

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.600
where it would be easier to keep her away from the rich foods that are so bad for her teeth and her digestion?

00:06:35.515 --> 00:06:41.200
Whatever her status, no one could forget that Elizabeth was Anne Boleyn's daughter.

00:06:41.335 --> 00:06:45.400
And it was in order to marry Anne that Henry had broken away from Rome

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.200
and made himself head of The Church in England.

00:06:50.545 --> 00:06:54.600
It was a revolution and one of it's  victims was the monasteries.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.905
They were amongst the greatest English land owners.

00:06:59.105 --> 00:07:02.035
Their assets were seized and their buildings dismantled.

00:07:03.095 --> 00:07:05.200
One of them was Glastonbury Abbey,

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.200
then the largest church in England.

00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:18.200
When I look out from my church across the other side of the road from these ruins

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.835
I'm filled with a feeling or a sense of sadness, a sense of loss,

00:07:23.255 --> 00:07:24.900
sense of disbelief to a degree

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.200
that such destruction could have taken place in a country that

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.225
was supposedly very religions and  Catholic.

00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:38.100
This Abbey here was a place of pilgrimage.

00:07:38.895 --> 00:07:43.600
The Abbey contained a statue of a lady, that Catholics would call Saint Mary.

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:49.000
And people would have come from far and wide to pay their respects to, to say their prayers,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.500
to make their offerings and ask for various helps.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.800
Within the space of nine years from the reformation

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.885
dissolution of the monasteries ,

00:07:57.885 --> 00:08:02.500
this went from being one of the most grandest Catholic churches in this country

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.400
to pretty well what we see around it today.

00:08:05.405 --> 00:08:07.585
Hardly one stone on top of another.

00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:12.700
The damage to the Catholic church wasn't just physical

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.065
it was spiritual too.

00:08:15.065 --> 00:08:18.600
Out of these ruins would grow a new Protestant faith.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:24.000
Henry's religious revolution would divide his county and his family.

00:08:25.735 --> 00:08:29.700
Henry had now embarked on his third marriage, to Jayne Seymour.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.900
In just over a year she gave him the son that he craved

00:08:33.935 --> 00:08:37.800
Edward, legitimate, and a boy was now undoubted heir.

00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:44.605
*Christening taking place in the background in another language*

00:08:44.605 --> 00:08:49.000
Elizabeth was his half sister, was no more than a minor royal.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:55.600
She had once been Princess herself. Now she was an attendant at her baby brothers christening.

00:09:02.025 --> 00:09:04.845
She also lost her governess to Edward.

00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:08.700
As Lady Bryan was transferred to look after the young Prince.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.195
Her replacement was Kat Ashley,

00:09:11.215 --> 00:09:15.800
a well educated and devout woman who became very close to Elizabeth.

00:09:21.055 --> 00:09:24.475
Her father on the other hand scarcely saw her.

00:09:24.565 --> 00:09:30.100
For royal children like Elizabeth were brought up in the country away from the royal court.

00:09:30.435 --> 00:09:33.505
There Henry communicated with here by messenger.

00:09:37.905 --> 00:09:43.800
In December 1539 he sent Sir Thomas Wriothesley to convey his Christmas greetings.

00:09:45.845 --> 00:09:50.000
She gave humble thanks, inquiring again of his majesty's welfare

00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:54.500
and that with as great a gravity as she had been forty years old.

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:06.400
Children in the 16th Century has to join the starched and corseted adult world as quickly as possible.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.885
They're expected to look like their parents and to behave like them.

00:10:11.205 --> 00:10:14.615
Even slight misnomers were severely punished.

00:10:16.395 --> 00:10:21.300
One royal tutor advised, never have the rod off a boy's back.

00:10:21.525 --> 00:10:25.800
And the daughter especially should be handled without cherishing.

00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:31.400
But Elizabeth was lucky her tutors belonged to the new school

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.800
which thought that kindness was a better teacher than the cane.

00:10:35.335 --> 00:10:38.900
But then the young Princess was a model pupil.

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:46.800
And she studied languages from the age of four. She became fluent in French, Italian, Latin and Greek.

00:10:47.665 --> 00:11:04.500
*Young Elizabeth can be heard speaking in other languages*

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.005
But it was how she learned languages that mattered as well.

00:11:08.905 --> 00:11:12.400
She was taught by the method of double translation.

00:11:12.995 --> 00:11:19.000
This means that the little girl had to translate a passage from Latin into English,

00:11:19.015 --> 00:11:24.900
and then back again into Latin, getting it absolutely right word for word.

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:29.800
Now for most children this kind of this kind of thing would have been an absolute torment.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.600
but Elizabeth seems to have reveled in it.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:38.700
She must have had the mind of a computer programmer, or an expert solver of crossword puzzles

00:11:39.235 --> 00:11:43.300
because she continued to do translations for the whole of the rest of her life.

00:11:44.045 --> 00:11:46.755
She did them for fun, for relaxation,

00:11:47.045 --> 00:11:50.165
but she also did them as a kind of mental discipline

00:11:50.245 --> 00:11:52.000
to keep her emotions under control.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.500
Just as nowadays people might practice yoga or medication.

00:11:57.905 --> 00:12:02.200
Elizabeth was the kind of daughter of whom any father would be proud.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:09.095
And this painting shows Henry's confidence in her. It commemorates his decision in  1944

00:12:09.095 --> 00:12:12.405
to reinstated both his daughters in the succession.

00:12:12.915 --> 00:12:16.155
No woman had ever sat on the English throne before.

00:12:16.155 --> 00:12:22.500
Now if Edward died without an heir, first Mary and the Elizabeth would become Queen.

00:12:23.775 --> 00:12:26.665
Henry then sailed to France to fight a war,

00:12:26.665 --> 00:12:31.000
leaving his wife Catherine Parr as regent in charge of the Kingdom.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.975
Elizabeth now witnessed first hand

00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:38.600
an intelligent, well educated woman could rule effectively.

00:12:39.635 --> 00:12:44.300
At about this time Elizabeth acquired a new tutor, Roger Ash.

00:12:44.855 --> 00:12:47.435
He worked with the brightest minds in Cambridge

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:50.385
but he found Elizabeth more than their equal.

00:12:51.185 --> 00:12:54.165
The Lady Elizabeth shines like a star.

00:12:54.475 --> 00:12:58.000
The constitution of her mind is exempt from female weakness,

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.715
no apprehension can be quicker than hers.

00:13:02.575 --> 00:13:08.200
She demonstrated her abilities in an extraordinary New Years gift for her father.

00:13:10.705 --> 00:13:14.000
It'a work of pro's but it shows the twelve year old girl

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.400
to have been in her way just as much of a child prodigy as the young Mozart.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.105
It's bound in red cloth of gold

00:13:24.105 --> 00:13:28.200
heavily embroidered with Henry's initials top and bottom.

00:13:30.095 --> 00:13:32.925
and while you can actually see it more clearly on the back

00:13:32.925 --> 00:13:34.625
in the middle a cypher

00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:42.500
that's the interlaced initials for Henry and Katherine spelled with a K, Katherine Parr

00:13:43.485 --> 00:13:45.915
The cover is the work of a professional embroiderer

00:13:46.335 --> 00:13:50.300
but inside it's all Elizabeth's own work.

00:13:51.435 --> 00:13:52.435
And what work!

00:13:53.955 --> 00:13:56.375
Page after page of perfect beautify rhythmic Italic

00:13:56.975 --> 00:14:00.000
beautify rhythmic Italic handwriting.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.325
It shows just how far she'd come on in a year.

00:14:04.105 --> 00:14:07.075
Her new years present of the year before to her step mother

00:14:07.075 --> 00:14:10.800
is filled with mistakes, corrections, second thoughts.

00:14:10.985 --> 00:14:13.000
But here, nothing.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.455
First the Latin, then the French, then the Italian

00:14:18.005 --> 00:14:21.425
not a mistake, not a mistranslation, not a blot,

00:14:21.545 --> 00:14:23.600
just perfection.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.800
But it's the introductory letter that takes us into Elizabeth's own mind.

00:14:29.585 --> 00:14:31.415
She addresses her father

00:14:32.225 --> 00:14:35.505
a very striking phrase, matchless

00:14:35.505 --> 00:14:38.205
and most kind father.

00:14:38.785 --> 00:14:43.000
She even has her own views on the importance of the state of Kingship.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.765
The state of Kingship

00:14:44.765 --> 00:14:50.000
which philosophers say is equivalent to that of a god upon earth.

00:14:51.115 --> 00:14:54.305
In love with her father, perhaps

00:14:54.305 --> 00:14:57.365
even more in love with the idea of the monarchy.

00:15:00.995 --> 00:15:07.100
Elizabeth had never been more secure in her role status she basked in Henry's attention.

00:15:10.805 --> 00:15:14.265
In 1546 she had this portrait painted for him.

00:15:14.415 --> 00:15:17.695
And shows her as she wished to be seen by her father.

00:15:17.695 --> 00:15:21.400
So she is studious, one finger marking a page in a book.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.400
She's pious, the book open on the lecturn beside her is certainly the Bible.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.000
She is the virtuous renaissance Princess.

00:15:35.105 --> 00:15:37.665
But this tranquility could not last.

00:15:37.815 --> 00:15:40.900
Henry her father was dying.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.515
At thirteen Elizabeth was about to lose

00:15:46.515 --> 00:15:49.145
the giant of a father whom she revered.

00:15:50.025 --> 00:15:53.900
Next decade would be the most threatening period of her life.

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:59.175
Christmas 1546 was a gloomy one at court.

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:03.600
For a long time the King had suffered from an old jousting injury to his leg

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
which had turned into a chronic ulcer.

00:16:06.585 --> 00:16:09.885
Puss would build up causing the leg to swell.

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:11.900
The pain was intense.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.195
On the 30th of December Henry complete his will

00:16:16.075 --> 00:16:17.815
and then the decent was swift.

00:16:20.535 --> 00:16:23.000
As Henry laid dying in his bed chamber

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.465
outside in the long gallery Edward Seymour

00:16:26.465 --> 00:16:30.800
Prince Edwards Uncle was pacing up and down with his advisers

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.100
they were plotting the takeover of power in the new reign

00:16:34.545 --> 00:16:37.505
Towards two o'clock in the morning Heny died

00:16:37.505 --> 00:16:41.600
clutching the hands of Archbishop Cranmer, Elizabeth's godfather.

00:16:42.155 --> 00:16:45.175
To make sure there was a smooth transfer of power

00:16:45.175 --> 00:16:49.000
Henry's death was kept secret for three full days.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:56.400
Finally all was ready and Seymour brought together Edward now Edward the Sixth and his favorite sister Elizabeth

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.445
and told them that their father was dead.

00:17:00.215 --> 00:17:04.500
One account describes how the two children threw themselves into each others arms

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.000
weeping uncontrollably.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.575
Little King Edward the sixth had stepped into his fathers shoes

00:17:12.575 --> 00:17:15.585
but they were several sizes too big for him.

00:17:15.665 --> 00:17:18.445
He was just nine years old

00:17:18.445 --> 00:17:21.855
and to begin with her was the pawn of his powerful royal councils,

00:17:23.505 --> 00:17:25.245
and so was Elizabeth

00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:27.345
her father's will had left her rich

00:17:27.345 --> 00:17:29.200
and her place in the line of the succession

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.000
made her a temping target.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.665
One man in particular, Thomas Seymour had his eyes on her.

00:17:42.475 --> 00:17:48.100
They Seymour brothers as Uncle's to the young King were the most powerful family in the land.

00:17:48.595 --> 00:17:53.200
Thomas the younger brother was bitterly jealous of his elder brother Edward

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.000
because Edward had made himself Duke of Somerset and Lord protect.

00:17:59.565 --> 00:18:02.345
Edward built Berry Pomeroy Castle in Devon

00:18:02.735 --> 00:18:05.685
still owned by his decedent John Seymour.

00:18:10.045 --> 00:18:15.500
Thomas I think was a wonderfully flamboyant an colorful character

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:17.725
like his brother he was very ambitious

00:18:18.925 --> 00:18:22.900
and he took the most of the opportunities that were presented to him.

00:18:23.565 --> 00:18:26.885
He was headstrong, I think he probably didn't think a great deal about

00:18:27.405 --> 00:18:30.365
uhm, what was going to happen as a result of his actions.

00:18:30.395 --> 00:18:34.300
But he was undoubtedly out of favor himself

00:18:34.545 --> 00:18:37.915
and make the most of his opportunities in his life, which he did.

00:18:39.055 --> 00:18:41.405
Thomas plotted his advancement to power

00:18:41.405 --> 00:18:44.775
from his base Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.515
His first idea was to marry one of Henry the eighth's daughters

00:18:50.515 --> 00:18:53.475
either Mary or Elizabeth would have done.

00:18:53.475 --> 00:19:00.800
The counsel vetoed that idea so Seymour went for the next best thing and proposed to Henry's widow, Catherine Parr.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.325
Catherine had already been passionately in love with him even before she married Henry

00:19:05.325 --> 00:19:07.895
so she accepted him like a shot.

00:19:08.275 --> 00:19:10.265
Elizabeth was living with Catherine

00:19:10.465 --> 00:19:13.885
so this meant that Seymour wasn't only her stepfather

00:19:13.885 --> 00:19:16.155
he was also her guardian,

00:19:16.465 --> 00:19:20.800
it was a position of trust which he abused, shockingly.

00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:31.500
At first Catherine Parr's involvement made Seymour's game seem innocent enough.

00:19:31.895 --> 00:19:35.075
Elizabeth found Seymour an intriguing playmate.

00:19:35.895 --> 00:19:39.400
He was forty and she was just fourteen.

00:19:58.435 --> 00:20:01.305
But Seymour saw a relationship with Elizabeth

00:20:01.305 --> 00:20:03.865
as a means of drawing closer to the throne.

00:20:04.395 --> 00:20:06.485
His game grew darker.

00:20:23.035 --> 00:20:25.935
Catherine Parr was deceived by these antics

00:20:26.545 --> 00:20:28.885
but Kat Ashley was worried.

00:20:29.105 --> 00:20:34.000
He romped with her in the garden and cut her gown into a hundred pieces.

00:20:55.665 --> 00:20:59.400
Seymour now got hold of the key to Elizabeth's bedroom.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.900
He would come into her room partly dressed early in the morning,

00:21:03.955 --> 00:21:07.900
sometimes he would tickle her and slap her buttocks.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.800
THOMAS SEYMOUR: "Good Morning, my lady."

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.845
Elizabeth was confused by Seymour's behavior

00:21:46.915 --> 00:21:48.800
and by her reaction to it.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.465
Seymour was a handsome sexually charged man

00:21:52.465 --> 00:21:54.805
and she was flattered by his attentions

00:21:54.805 --> 00:21:57.000
but she was also scared by them.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.600
So sometimes she'd behave it was all a game and play hide and seek behind the curtains of the bed.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:08.000
On other occasions though Elizabeth would react as her maidenly modesty had been outraged

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.700
She'd get up early and make sure that she was dressed

00:22:10.775 --> 00:22:13.155
as to avoid Seymour's attentions.

00:22:13.855 --> 00:22:19.300
On the other hand Kat Ashley, Elizabeth's governess knew exactly what was going on.

00:22:19.665 --> 00:22:25.500
But when she reproved Seymour for risking Elizabeth's reputation he brazened it out.

00:22:25.515 --> 00:22:28.435
He had no intention of stopping his behavior he said

00:22:28.435 --> 00:22:31.015
because he meant no harm by it.

00:22:33.365 --> 00:22:35.625
But when Catherine Parr became pregnant

00:22:35.745 --> 00:22:37.955
Seymour's flirtation with Elizabeth

00:22:38.095 --> 00:22:39.385
grew more serious.

00:22:54.195 --> 00:22:57.435
At first Catherine could not believe what was happening.

00:22:58.175 --> 00:23:00.985
Finally she was left in no doubt.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:03.900
CATHERINE PARR: "My Lord?"

00:23:05.245 --> 00:23:06.245
ELIZABETH: "Your grace."

00:23:07.415 --> 00:23:11.200
Following a painful interview during which Elizabeth hardly spoke

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.100
her step mother sent her away.

00:23:17.595 --> 00:23:20.355
It was the last time Elizabeth saw Catherine.

00:23:20.715 --> 00:23:23.000
When she moved to Sudeley to have the baby

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.715
Elizabeth wrote her to wishing her luck.

00:23:28.555 --> 00:23:31.795
But Catherine died shortly after the birth of her child.

00:23:31.975 --> 00:23:34.795
And she was buried here at Sudeley.

00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:44.400
In her final delirium all her fears and jealousies about Seymour's behavior had revived.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.400
With very good reason because Seymour soon renewed his suit to marry Elizabeth.

00:23:49.785 --> 00:23:53.600
And this time he had the powerful backing of Kat Ashley

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.800
Elizabeth herself too was enthusiastic

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.800
but she had the good sense to say firmly

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.100
that she wouldn't consider the marriage without the backing of the counsel.

00:24:03.435 --> 00:24:06.375
Seymour for his part hotheaded and impetuous as usual

00:24:06.375 --> 00:24:09.265
was too impatient to wait.

00:24:10.425 --> 00:24:12.845
Thomas was becoming more and more

00:24:12.845 --> 00:24:14.255
keen to

00:24:14.825 --> 00:24:17.605
attain some personal power

00:24:17.845 --> 00:24:20.415
and to further his career and

00:24:20.415 --> 00:24:23.165
one way of doing this was to

00:24:23.165 --> 00:24:25.255
get Edward, the King, the young King

00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:26.985
completely on his side.

00:24:27.745 --> 00:24:30.775
And I think he decided that he was going to

00:24:31.405 --> 00:24:33.065
actually abduct the King.

00:24:33.905 --> 00:24:39.800
And as he lived in the neighboring apartment it was very easy for him to

00:24:39.835 --> 00:24:43.125
have conversations and meeting with the young King.

00:24:43.725 --> 00:24:44.725
And

00:24:45.405 --> 00:24:48.265
how it happened I don't think it's really clear but

00:24:48.705 --> 00:24:51.795
we do know that he was found in the King's apartment

00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:53.625
with a sword in his hand.

00:24:54.855 --> 00:24:57.585
The spaniel, one of the many spaniels  I think that

00:24:57.585 --> 00:25:00.615
the young King had, uhm started to bark

00:25:00.615 --> 00:25:02.905
and I suppose in desperation

00:25:02.915 --> 00:25:04.965
Thomas ran it through with his sword.

00:25:05.285 --> 00:25:08.395
And there was a great kerfuffle and noise and uh

00:25:08.395 --> 00:25:11.285
people burst in and Thomas was arrested.

00:25:12.015 --> 00:25:14.165
Seymour was charged with treason.

00:25:14.515 --> 00:25:17.705
His relationship with Elizabeth made her a suspect too.

00:25:18.385 --> 00:25:21.385
A team of interrogators descended on Hatfield

00:25:21.385 --> 00:25:23.495
to discover whether she'd been plotting with him.

00:25:25.555 --> 00:25:26.905
Her closest confidant

00:25:27.415 --> 00:25:30.725
Kat Ashley was arrested and taken to the tower.

00:25:31.055 --> 00:25:35.700
Under threat of torture she described the scandalous events of the previous summer.

00:25:36.095 --> 00:25:40.600
Her evidence was now used word for word against Elizabeth.

00:25:41.845 --> 00:25:44.315
MALE READING ACCUSATIONS: "Another time at Hanworth he romped with

00:25:44.315 --> 00:25:45.635
her in the garden.

00:25:47.455 --> 00:25:48.455
Romped...

00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:51.835
and cut her gown

00:25:52.505 --> 00:25:55.655
bringing black cloth to a hundred pieces.

00:25:56.625 --> 00:25:59.185
And when I came and cheered Lady Elizabeth

00:26:00.385 --> 00:26:03.435
she assured me she could not strive with all

00:26:03.485 --> 00:26:05.215
for the Queen held her

00:26:05.655 --> 00:26:08.765
while the Lord Admiral cut the dress.

00:26:10.215 --> 00:26:11.455
The Queen...

00:26:13.425 --> 00:26:16.275
Suspecting the often access of the Admiral

00:26:16.275 --> 00:26:18.025
to the Lady Elizabeth

00:26:20.125 --> 00:26:22.925
came suddenly upon them where they were all alone.

00:26:26.245 --> 00:26:29.125
He having her in his arms."

00:26:31.705 --> 00:26:35.900
Despite the evidence Elizabeth refused to admit any wrongdoing.

00:26:36.345 --> 00:26:39.600
Then a rumor began that she was pregnant by Seymour.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.325
She complained bitterly to Somerset.

00:26:42.905 --> 00:26:44.615
ELIZABETH: "Master Tyrwhitt and others

00:26:44.615 --> 00:26:47.895
have told me that go with rumors abroad that I am in the tower

00:26:47.895 --> 00:26:50.485
and with child by my Lord Admiral.

00:26:50.625 --> 00:26:52.845
These are shameful slanders.

00:26:52.985 --> 00:26:55.735
I shall most haughtily desire your Lordship that

00:26:55.735 --> 00:26:57.575
I may come to the court.

00:26:57.585 --> 00:27:00.225
that I may show myself as I am."

00:27:05.805 --> 00:27:10.500
Tyrwhitt told Somerset he was sure she was guilty but he could prove nothing.

00:27:11.205 --> 00:27:13.865
Elizabeth had survived the crisis.

00:27:19.595 --> 00:27:21.800
But Seymour's guilt was clear.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.800
In March 1549 Somerset signed his brothers death warrant and Seymour was beheaded on tower hill.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:38.100
Elizabeth's brush with Thomas Seymour marked a turning point in her young life.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:44.200
It was a brutal initiation into the world of adult politics and adult sexuality.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.775
She'd learned the hard way

00:27:46.115 --> 00:27:49.145
that a sexual relationship, even a close friendship

00:27:49.365 --> 00:27:52.200
might mean danger, perhaps death.

00:27:52.595 --> 00:27:55.275
She knew now that when a man approached her

00:27:55.275 --> 00:27:58.375
he got his eyes on the throne as much as on her.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.125
From this point onwards she trusted almost nobody.

00:28:04.055 --> 00:28:07.900
She kept her own counsel and she concealed her true thoughts.

00:28:08.565 --> 00:28:11.295
It was her defense against a hostile world.

00:28:24.015 --> 00:28:28.200
Elizabeth was left alone in the peaceful solitude of Hatfield.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.800
Here she continued her studies,

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.155
she also indulged a passion for writing and hunting.

00:28:39.065 --> 00:28:42.245
The clean air and exercise were a welcome antidote

00:28:42.245 --> 00:28:46.200
to the headaches and sickness that had plagued her during the investigation

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.000
and would reoccur throughout her life during moments of stress.

00:29:05.495 --> 00:29:09.200
At about this time Elizabeth's French tutor, John Balmain

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.355
gave her as a present his translation

00:29:11.355 --> 00:29:16.400
of Saint Basil's epistol the Great Gregory on the virtues of the single life.

00:29:17.345 --> 00:29:19.985
The saints argument was that marriage distracted the soul

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.535
from the worship of God.

00:29:22.535 --> 00:29:25.485
Bearing in mind her recent experiences with Thomas Seymour

00:29:25.485 --> 00:29:27.305
Elizabeth was well aware

00:29:27.725 --> 00:29:30.965
of the practical political advantages of celibacy too.

00:29:31.345 --> 00:29:34.000
It was the same with the rest of the saints arguments

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.005
about the need for temperance and sobriety of dress.

00:29:37.325 --> 00:29:42.600
Elizabeth created a sensation at court by tuning up with her hair straight,

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.600
her face unmade up, and virtually no jewelry.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.600
She was rehabilitating herself after the disaster of the Seymour affair

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.105
by playing the quaker maid.

00:29:55.675 --> 00:29:58.005
There was more to it than just image

00:29:58.005 --> 00:30:02.300
Elizabeth was caught up in the new Protestant mood in England.

00:30:02.555 --> 00:30:05.125
The crosses and candles of the Catholic faith

00:30:05.125 --> 00:30:07.475
were being stripped from alters everywhere.

00:30:07.935 --> 00:30:10.335
New faith had the enthusiastic backing

00:30:10.775 --> 00:30:13.975
of Elizabeth's brother, the young King Edward.

00:30:14.745 --> 00:30:20.200
But by 1553 the young King was dying of tuberculosis

00:30:20.355 --> 00:30:23.195
He was desperate to stop the religious reforms

00:30:23.195 --> 00:30:26.095
being undone by his Catholic sister Mary

00:30:26.095 --> 00:30:29.585
who would succeed under the terms of their father's will.

00:30:29.785 --> 00:30:34.000
So he excluded her from the succession because she was a bastard.

00:30:34.745 --> 00:30:38.085
But if Mary was a bastard, so too was Elizabeth.

00:30:38.395 --> 00:30:42.300
Instead Edwards chose a Protestant cousin to succeed him

00:30:42.715 --> 00:30:45.535
the fifteen year old Lady Jane Grey.

00:30:46.975 --> 00:30:54.300
Anxiously, Elizabeth waited with her armed followers at Hatfield to see what would happen next.

00:30:56.875 --> 00:31:00.600
In July 1553 Edward died

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.200
Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed Queen

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.315
and Elizabeth and Mary were denounced as bastards.

00:31:07.375 --> 00:31:10.035
But Mary was Henry's elder daughter

00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:13.295
and in the eyes of the people she was rightful Queen.

00:31:15.925 --> 00:31:19.600
She was supported by many of England's leading families.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:26.800
So Henry Bedingfeld a substantial lawful land owner was one of the first to rally to Mary's banner.

00:31:26.805 --> 00:31:29.345
His descendant still lived at Oxborough Hall.

00:31:29.575 --> 00:31:33.500
So Henry at Oxborough gathered together

00:31:33.985 --> 00:31:35.985
one hundred and sixty men

00:31:36.335 --> 00:31:39.235
armed as they say cap-à-pie

00:31:39.235 --> 00:31:42.285
that is to say with a certain amount of armor,  leather jerkins,

00:31:42.285 --> 00:31:46.100
swords certainly, and I'm sure a few horses.

00:31:49.005 --> 00:31:53.800
His role is then to take this small group of people

00:31:53.835 --> 00:31:56.635
to first of all Kenninghall where other

00:31:56.735 --> 00:32:00.200
units such as his were joining up  to make an army.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.200
And then from there to Framlingham where the army swelled,

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.055
uh and they marched from there

00:32:08.475 --> 00:32:10.805
to London with Queen Mary.

00:32:11.015 --> 00:32:13.445
Princess Elizabeth joined them on route.

00:32:13.555 --> 00:32:16.405
And as custom dictated at the gates

00:32:16.405 --> 00:32:19.065
of the City of London they left the army behind.

00:32:19.395 --> 00:32:23.400
And uh Elizabeth and Mary rode into the City of London

00:32:23.685 --> 00:32:27.115
to wild rejoicing and cheers from the crowd.

00:32:28.355 --> 00:32:33.000
In the face of this overwhelming support for Mary the opposition collapsed.

00:32:33.355 --> 00:32:36.755
Lady Jane Grey was later beheaded at the tower.

00:32:38.575 --> 00:32:41.705
On July the nineteenth 1553

00:32:41.705 --> 00:32:44.095
Mary was proclaimed Queen.

00:32:44.405 --> 00:32:49.000
Her vision was to lead England back to the true Catholic faith.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.800
Elizabeth's Protestantism marked her  out as a potential enemy.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
For the first two months of Mary's reign Elizabeth contrived to avoid going to mass.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.800
Finally Mary issued an ultimatum,

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.600
Elizabeth was to attend mass on the eighth of September the day of the nativity of the Blessed Virgin.

00:33:09.145 --> 00:33:14.000
Cornered at last Elizabeth sough a personal interview with Mary at Richmond.

00:33:14.795 --> 00:33:17.400
She threw herself on her knees before the Queen

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.600
tears steaming down her face,

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:26.000
She explained that she'd never been taught the old faith and please could she have priests instruct her.

00:33:26.435 --> 00:33:29.145
Oh yes, and she would go to mass.

00:33:29.835 --> 00:33:33.800
But on the morning she developed a diplomatic chill

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.135
and rather spoiled the solemnity of the occasion

00:33:36.135 --> 00:33:40.000
by complaining loudly of a bad stomach ache.

00:33:40.465 --> 00:33:43.715
Neither Mary or anyone else was deceived

00:33:44.315 --> 00:33:49.000
Well Mary and Elizabeth had quite different attitudes to their respective religions

00:33:49.635 --> 00:33:52.300
Mary of the old religion

00:33:52.325 --> 00:33:54.655
would have had a slightly uhm

00:33:54.655 --> 00:33:59.200
mechanistic expression of her religion not that she wasn't devout, and spiritual and prayerful

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.800
I'm sure she was all those things.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.300
But her religion involved doing things

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.695
Pilgrimages, saying the rosary, going places, making signs of the cross, and so on.

00:34:08.695 --> 00:34:13.600
For Elizabeth those things didn't take, didn't feature at all, in her faith.

00:34:14.055 --> 00:34:16.955
People of a new religion would have been much more

00:34:16.955 --> 00:34:19.985
Bible based and would have interpreted the Bible

00:34:19.985 --> 00:34:22.200
in the light of their own reason and understanding

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:27.000
rather than relying on an authority from Rome telling them what the Bible actually meant.

00:34:28.745 --> 00:34:32.500
Mary now tried to guarantee the Catholic future of England

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.800
by marrying King Philip of Spain.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:39.800
But Mary's passionate love for a foreign Prince was deeply unpopular.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.200
and Philips envoys were pelted with snowballs.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.975
Mary brushed aside the protests.

00:34:48.565 --> 00:34:52.600
Elizabeth now became a figure head for Mary's opponents.

00:34:52.635 --> 00:34:58.600
Early in 1554 she received a letter from a gentleman called Sir Thomas Wyatt.

00:35:04.125 --> 00:35:08.800
He told her that intended to rebel to prevent the Spanish marriage.

00:35:21.535 --> 00:35:24.000
Elizabeth didn't reply in writing

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.200
instead she told Wyatt's messenger with careful ambiguity,

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.600
that she would do as God directed her.

00:35:34.695 --> 00:35:39.600
Within days Wyatt had raised an army of seven thousand men in the south east

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.400
and marched on London

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.900
as Wyatt's army drew closer to the Capitol

00:35:43.945 --> 00:35:45.795
there was panic in Mary's court.

00:35:46.295 --> 00:35:51.400
Mary ordered Elizabeth to come White Hall where she could be kept under control.

00:35:52.695 --> 00:35:55.175
But Elizabeth claimed she was ill.

00:35:55.985 --> 00:35:58.000
Mary's Doctor's confirmed the illness

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.445
but said never the less that she was well enough to travel.

00:36:02.495 --> 00:36:05.005
It took her eleven days

00:36:05.005 --> 00:36:07.275
to cover the twenty three miles to London.

00:36:07.805 --> 00:36:11.600
By the time she arrived Wyatt's rebellion had collapsed,

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.000
he had over estimated support for his cause.

00:36:15.985 --> 00:36:20.200
Wyatt was beheaded and quartered  on Tower Hill.

00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:26.800
But first Elizabeth was detained and interrogated at White Hall.

00:36:26.835 --> 00:36:29.975
Then it was decided to send her to the tower.

00:36:30.285 --> 00:36:33.315
The night before the journey Elizabeth wrote to Mary.

00:36:33.315 --> 00:36:35.435
She was writing for her life.

00:36:38.945 --> 00:36:44.500
ELIZABETH: " I most humbly beseech Your Majesty that I be not condemned without without answer and due proof.

00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:46.800
Which it seems that I now am.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.125
But without cause proved I am commanded to go to the tower.

00:36:51.545 --> 00:36:56.000
Place more wanted for a false traitor than a true subject."

00:36:57.215 --> 00:36:59.655
This is the letter that Elizabeth writes

00:36:59.655 --> 00:37:01.845
this most desperate moment of her life.

00:37:02.525 --> 00:37:05.575
She begins with a fine firm clear hand.

00:37:06.045 --> 00:37:09.505
But gradually as the pressure of circumstances gets to her,

00:37:09.765 --> 00:37:15.300
remember she though that she only days, perhaps hours before she was executed.

00:37:15.635 --> 00:37:18.565
The handwriting becomes loser and more irregular,

00:37:18.565 --> 00:37:21.355
she makes mistakes and then she corrects them.

00:37:21.685 --> 00:37:24.755
But finally she's run out of things to say

00:37:25.045 --> 00:37:27.200
and time to say them in, and still

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.625
she's only a quarter the way down the second page.

00:37:31.565 --> 00:37:34.000
Then as a primitive security device

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.000
to stop anyone forging her handwriting and making incriminating additions to the letter

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.200
she draws long diagonal strokes that almost fill up the page.

00:37:44.715 --> 00:37:48.000
They leave just space on the very bottom for a post script.

00:37:48.185 --> 00:37:52.100
I humbly crave but only one word with yourself.

00:37:52.255 --> 00:37:53.925
Summarizes the entire letter.

00:37:54.455 --> 00:37:57.405
And then at the right she signs off

00:37:58.085 --> 00:38:00.635
Your highness's most faithful subject

00:38:01.025 --> 00:38:04.525
from the beginning and shall be till my end.

00:38:06.625 --> 00:38:08.785
Elizabeth's letter was a long one.

00:38:09.535 --> 00:38:12.595
Deliberately so, because by the time she had finished

00:38:12.595 --> 00:38:18.000
the tide was too high for a boat to be able to make the journey safely to the tower.

00:38:18.665 --> 00:38:21.825
She bought herself a few precious hours,

00:38:22.455 --> 00:38:23.725
but to no avail.

00:38:24.295 --> 00:38:26.125
Mary didn't even deign to reply.

00:38:28.255 --> 00:38:29.675
Early the next morning

00:38:29.715 --> 00:38:32.875
Elizabeth was road up the river to the tower.

00:38:36.935 --> 00:38:39.815
The rain was falling in a stead drizzle.

00:38:40.515 --> 00:38:45.800
Elizabeth knew that most of those that made this  voyage would never make another.

00:38:56.875 --> 00:38:58.125
When Elizabeth landed

00:38:58.495 --> 00:39:00.000
the river was very high

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.400
and the steps were very slippery.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.215
She found it difficult to keep her feet.

00:39:05.275 --> 00:39:08.495
She found it even more difficult to control her terror.

00:39:10.525 --> 00:39:12.115
I never thought to come here

00:39:12.525 --> 00:39:13.525
a prisoner.

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:17.465
I beseech you all my friends and fellows.

00:39:17.465 --> 00:39:21.000
Bear witness that I come here no traitor

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.700
but as true a subject to the Queen's majesty as any now alive.

00:39:26.825 --> 00:39:29.665
At the top of the steps stood the soldiers,

00:39:29.905 --> 00:39:31.275
they were there to guard her.

00:39:32.045 --> 00:39:34.855
Instead they fell on their knees crying

00:39:34.855 --> 00:39:36.775
God save your grace.

00:39:55.105 --> 00:39:59.600
This is the room in the bell tower where Elizabeth is supposed to have been imprisoned.

00:40:00.435 --> 00:40:02.985
The eight weeks of her captivity in the tower

00:40:02.985 --> 00:40:05.905
were the darkest days of her entire life.

00:40:06.265 --> 00:40:10.400
As so often happens at moments of psychological crisis she fell ill.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.400
She thought constantly of death

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:18.400
after all she was only a few yards from the spot where her mother had been executed.

00:40:19.415 --> 00:40:22.285
She prayed to be delivered from the same fate.

00:40:22.815 --> 00:40:24.600
Two months dragged by

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.605
still there was no word from Mary.

00:40:27.975 --> 00:40:31.175
Elizabeth could only expect the worst.

00:40:32.155 --> 00:40:35.400
On the morning of the nineteenth of May 1554

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.600
Sir Henry Bedingfield Mary's staunch supporter

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.505
arrived at the tower with a hundred men.

00:40:48.065 --> 00:40:51.175
Elizabeth believe that she was about to die.

00:40:51.355 --> 00:40:54.395
And from Mary's point of view she deserved to.

00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:58.245
Mary knew that she had been involved in the Wyatt plot.

00:40:58.445 --> 00:41:01.200
But Elizabeth had cleverly covered her tracks.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:06.155
Without positive proof Mary couldn't risk executing

00:41:06.155 --> 00:41:07.600
the heir to the throne.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.875
Bedingfield took Elizabeth too Woodstock Palace neat Oxford.

00:41:13.075 --> 00:41:16.365
The relationship that Elizabeth has with Sir Henry was

00:41:16.365 --> 00:41:20.500
from Sir Henry's point of view a very professional one.

00:41:21.005 --> 00:41:24.335
And from her point of view I should think thoroughly frustrating.

00:41:24.595 --> 00:41:27.955
Because he was there with a bunch of keys.

00:41:27.955 --> 00:41:32.300
He kept her locked in garden gates were locked

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:36.900
of she wanted to go for a walk, there was, somebody had to accompany her  an armed guard.

00:41:37.405 --> 00:41:41.200
She couldn't receive anything in case there were messages were involved,

00:41:41.575 --> 00:41:42.635
and

00:41:42.975 --> 00:41:45.015
she in fact called him

00:41:45.455 --> 00:41:46.695
my jailer.

00:41:50.015 --> 00:41:52.475
Elizabeth was locked up for almost a year

00:41:52.475 --> 00:41:54.935
before Mary summoned her to court.

00:41:54.935 --> 00:41:57.915
The Queen believed that she was pregnant and she wanted

00:41:57.915 --> 00:42:00.985
Elizabeth to play a walk on part of the Christening.

00:42:01.535 --> 00:42:04.455
But it was a phantom pregnancy and

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:08.400
as his wife sickened Philips attitude to Elizabeth changed.

00:42:09.365 --> 00:42:12.645
He thought that he could use her to keep control of England

00:42:12.645 --> 00:42:14.855
by marrying her to a friend.

00:42:20.605 --> 00:42:23.395
In the Autumn of 1555

00:42:23.395 --> 00:42:26.395
Elizabeth got Mary's permission to leave court

00:42:26.395 --> 00:42:29.100
and to come here to the peace and security

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.525
of her country estate at Hatfield.

00:42:31.835 --> 00:42:34.000
She wanted to escape the court

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.955
with it's poisonous atmosphere of intrigue and surveillance.

00:42:37.955 --> 00:42:40.705
But she also wished to put a metaphorical distance

00:42:40.705 --> 00:42:43.695
between herself and the actions of Mary's government.

00:42:43.895 --> 00:42:48.300
Because that summer the burning of Protestants had really got underway.

00:42:57.065 --> 00:42:59.635
More than three hundred people

00:42:59.635 --> 00:43:02.485
met this horrible death during Mary's reign.

00:43:03.395 --> 00:43:04.605
A few were lucky,

00:43:04.985 --> 00:43:10.500
kind executioners would tie bags of gunpowder to their legs to finish them off quickly.

00:43:12.475 --> 00:43:14.795
Most roasted alive.

00:43:17.525 --> 00:43:20.835
Every death created a martyr for the Protestant cause,

00:43:21.285 --> 00:43:24.435
Making England Catholic wasn't going to be easy.

00:43:29.655 --> 00:43:31.600
Sensing that her time was near

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.145
Elizabeth fiercely resisted Philips plans to marry her off

00:43:35.145 --> 00:43:38.505
to a Catholic Prince, the Duke of Savoy

00:43:38.545 --> 00:43:40.915
She would be no ones puppet

00:43:50.385 --> 00:43:53.235
Mary was dying but still she resisted

00:43:53.235 --> 00:43:55.745
naming Elizabeth as her successor.

00:43:56.275 --> 00:43:59.255
Ten days before her death she finally relented

00:43:59.405 --> 00:44:01.145
under pressure from her counsel .

00:44:04.175 --> 00:44:07.265
It as the seventeenth of November 1558.

00:44:07.435 --> 00:44:10.365
Towards noon messengers arrived at Hatfield

00:44:10.365 --> 00:44:13.655
to inform Elizabeth that her sister Mary was dead

00:44:13.795 --> 00:44:16.085
and that she was now Queen.

00:44:16.785 --> 00:44:22.500
The story goes that they found her walking in the park underneath a great Oak tree.

00:44:23.405 --> 00:44:26.725
As they fell on their knees before her she too knelt

00:44:26.725 --> 00:44:29.755
uttering the words of 118 Psalms:

00:44:30.055 --> 00:44:32.955
a Domino factum est istud et hoc

00:44:32.955 --> 00:44:34.915
mirabile in oculis nostris

00:44:35.615 --> 00:44:40.300
This is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes.

00:44:47.695 --> 00:44:50.875
The Spanish ambassador de Feria told Elizabeth

00:44:50.875 --> 00:44:55.000
she owed her throne not to The Lord, but to King Philip.

00:44:55.155 --> 00:44:56.915
Elizabeth would have none of it.

00:44:57.905 --> 00:45:00.345
She is a very vain and clever woman.

00:45:00.715 --> 00:45:03.035
She puts great stall by all the

00:45:03.035 --> 00:45:05.345
people who put her in her present position and she will

00:45:05.345 --> 00:45:08.485
not acknowledge that your Majesty or the nobility of the realm

00:45:08.485 --> 00:45:09.725
had any part in it.

00:45:10.185 --> 00:45:13.500
She is determined to be governed by no one.

00:45:17.115 --> 00:45:20.065
On Wednesday the twenty third of November

00:45:20.065 --> 00:45:22.700
Elizabeth rode through these great gates of the

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:26.375
Charter House in London to take possession of her Capitol.

00:45:26.955 --> 00:45:29.995
Her journey from Hatfield had tuned into a

00:45:29.995 --> 00:45:31.300
triumphal progress

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:36.800
She was accompanied by a great train of a thousand Lord's, Ladies and Gentlemen.

00:45:37.295 --> 00:45:40.900
And vast cheering crowds greeted her arrival.

00:45:44.225 --> 00:45:47.900
Elizabeth consulted the astrologer Doctor John Dee

00:45:48.185 --> 00:45:51.800
Before choosing Sunday the fifteenth of January 1559

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:53.400
for her coronation.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.000
The Queen walked along lengths of blue cloth from Westminster Hall

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.085
to the entrance to Westminster Abby.

00:46:02.865 --> 00:46:05.200
The crowds behind her fell on the cloth

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.655
cutting off pieces as souvenirs.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.100
Today Elizabeth would play the part

00:46:15.125 --> 00:46:17.200
that she had understudied so long,

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.200
and in what a setting.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.200
Her Christening at Greenwich had been high theater,

00:46:23.205 --> 00:46:26.000
but her Coronation in Westminster Abby

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.025
would be a performance on the grandest scale.

00:46:37.555 --> 00:46:40.400
First Elizabeth was acclaimed by the people

00:46:40.645 --> 00:46:41.785
and swore the oath.

00:46:42.535 --> 00:46:47.500
Next her outer robes were removed and she knelt solemnly for the anointing.

00:46:47.895 --> 00:46:50.100
Bishop Oglethorpe anointed her in the

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:53.655
seven traditional places, on the shoulder blades, on the breasts,

00:46:53.655 --> 00:46:56.335
on the palms of the hand, finally

00:46:56.335 --> 00:46:57.335
on the crown of the head.

00:46:58.245 --> 00:46:59.465
Then she was enthroned,

00:47:12.665 --> 00:47:16.500
Successively three different crowns were put on her head

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.005
and on her forefinger, a ring as a symbol

00:47:21.005 --> 00:47:25.000
of the mystical marriage between Elizabeth and her kingdom.

00:47:32.895 --> 00:47:36.900
Tradition, mystery, and symbolism had made

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:40.165
her Queen of England as fully and completely

00:47:40.245 --> 00:47:43.500
as any of her predecessors had been King.

00:48:05.375 --> 00:48:07.665
Elizabeth at last wore the crown.

00:48:08.765 --> 00:48:10.445
Now came the difficult bit.

00:48:10.665 --> 00:48:13.585
She'd to show that she could grasp the reality

00:48:13.585 --> 00:48:17.075
of power and govern a divided country.

00:48:17.185 --> 00:48:19.835
And to do that she'd to disprove

00:48:19.835 --> 00:48:21.600
two wide spread assumptions

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:25.395
that no monarch could ever match the achievement of her father

00:48:25.975 --> 00:48:29.405
and that no woman could ever make an effective ruler.
