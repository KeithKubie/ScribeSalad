00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.160
So how do choose which
market segmentation to use?

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.230
You want to look for buyers that
are filling strong pin points, and

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.220
also have money, a sense of urgency and

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.800
a good fit with the features of your
current version of your product.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.980
We can go with your
graphics segmentation and

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.038
choose our own city to start with.

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:19.610
This will allow us to map out
all the local competitors and

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.800
easily research potential
clients at the dog parks.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.704
On the other hand we could focus
on behavioral segmentation and

00:00:25.704 --> 00:00:29.050
target people with dogs
who vacations frequently.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.190
Focus, focus, focus.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.520
It will help you to
develop a clear messaging.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.430
And will make it easier to decide
what product features to build next.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.990
You can focus on building the best
product for this segment's needs.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.310
Don't compromise on 80%
satisfaction of few segments.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.480
Make one specific segment very,
very heavy with your product.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.610
Let's ask Geoffrey Moore for

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.520
his advice on choosing the most
valuable market segment to begin with.
