Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And the Internet is a big place.

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:09.650
So, let's take a safari through the World
Wide Web and find some cool things to Do Online

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.550
Now Guys.
Size it up with iruler.net.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.630
This website detects your monitor size and
resolution and renders an accurate ruler right

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.330
there on your screen.
If you'd rather brake the rules, freak people

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.850
out by sending them totally normal links made shady.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.310
You see, instead of shortening links, like
most people like to do, this website makes

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:39.610
URLs look worse.
"5z8.info/hookers_how2printmoney"?

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.220
Seems legit.
Lovemonkeysw gave us a site where you can

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.559
build a fake Google result page.
So, for instance, I could have it search for

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.600
"Anne Hathaway's Secret Crush," and generate
a pic where Google responds "Do you mean Michael

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.410
Stevens."
Act even more strategically in Ice Breaker.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.780
Plan ahead and cut carefully as you let chunks
of ice loose, not too big, mind you, for your

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.740
friend to break apart.
Exit Path is a beautiful game where you have

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.850
to deftly manage the arrow keys to quickly
escape.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.250
The more seamless your flow, the more power
up speed you build.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.340
Bullettoface49 impressed me with Realm of
the Mad God.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.340
An incredible mmo I've only barely started
to play, but the game is rich and easy to

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.460
learn.
If you're looking for the easiest to learn,

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.420
CandaceK007's got what you want.
You can level up in this hilariously simplified

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.979
RPG, the famous Super Press Space to Win action
RPG.

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.209
Seriously, the space bar is the only key you
need to use for every action in the game.

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:48.789
Still too complicated?
Well, evo2341 suggests mouse clicking competition.

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.099
Click start and then in 10 seconds click your
mouse as many times as you can.

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:58.310
I tried a few times and I got up to 79,
but I'm sure you guys can do better.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.770
But let's be serious.
Here's lulzMattR and Don't Shoot the Puppy.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.600
Click start and then literally do nothing.
Any action you take, any move your mouse makes,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.360
kills the puppy.
It's basically a game you win by leaving the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.630
Internet.
If you'd prefer using your own hand as a gun,

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.770
try out Toon Crisis 2,
a great blend of live action and animation.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.180
By carefully manipulating the focus and more,
tilt shift photography makes real life scenes

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.880
look like miniatures, like toys.
And now, thanks to ONKC123 you can add a tilt-shift

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.300
effect to any photo after you took the picture.
It works best with images that have distant

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.910
backgrounds, like these from the last IMG!
of the artist who drew pictures in the desert

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.780
by driving over dirt.
Remember the HTwins' Scale of the Universe?

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.890
Well, their new version is super enhanced.
More items, more info and even more mind-blowingness.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.840
For instance, the entire Minecraft universe
is nearly the size of gas giant Neptune.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.170
Negative Implode lets you upload your own
images and have an optical illusion effect

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.870
added that makes them seem to forever move
towards you.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.260
Not trippy enough?
Make like adityaK96 and use your mouse to

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.260
fly through Barry Martin's Hopalong Orbits
Visualizer right inside your browser.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.319
Jellotime.com
Dialectizer translates your favorite websites

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.990
into different dialects.
For instance, I can change the Vsauce channel

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.650
page to Redneck and all of a sudden, "What
is Cool?" becomes "Whut in tarnation is Right

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.210
fine?"
Oregon Trail was the first computer game I

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.319
remember playing, but it never had enough zombies.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.790
Enter SwolfSteins' recommendation, Organ Trail.
You must choose a career in supplies and head

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.540
to safety, except instead of the wild west,
your opponent is wild brain-eating undead.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.140
Now, if you wanna settle a dispute, use Googlefight.com.
This site lets you enter two different words

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.350
and tells you which one is the winner based
on how many Google search results they each

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.550
have.
Follow @tweetsauce on Twitter, like geniuses

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.459
everywhere, to recommend sites like NUKEMAP.
A map that lets you simulate historical nuclear

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.339
detonations and view the extent of their damage
depending on where you place them.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.640
It's like being an evil mad scientist, so
really before pressing detonate you might

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.480
want to press The Drama Button.com first.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.700
So there you go.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.980
Some more things to do online now guys.
If you've ever missed a previous episode,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.720
and there are a lot of them now, don't worry,
there's a playlist for that.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.320
Check them out.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.160
And as always,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.380
thanks for watching.
