00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.760
Do you ever feel uncertain about the path you're on? Because you're not where you want to be or maybe you're sitting there

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.880
Second-guessing your own potential and feel as though you're not smart original or talented enough

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.909
This is going to sound strange, but you're doing it right. These experiences are normal

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.280
It's only when you stop questioning and become complacent about where you are that stops you from dreaming boldly

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.919
Here's seven strange signs. You will be successful

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.109
1. You know what you want even though you don't know how to get to it yet

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.800
Have you ever been so sure of something that you're constantly bursting with energy?

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.710
perhaps you knew you always wanted to be a dancer ever since you were given your first pair of ballet flats or

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.559
Maybe staring up at the night sky as a lost lonely

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.500
Teenager made you curious about what is beyond the empty void of adulthood that motivated you to become an astronaut

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.919
You can be absolutely sure about what you want. But you may not know how to necessarily obtain your dreams yet. And that's okay

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.199
You're starting somewhere, and that's what counts

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.219
2. You're easily bored and love challenges

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:13.329
We often identify traits like novelty seeking that can lead to behaviors such as gambling drug abuse and ADHD

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.940
But according to Dr Robert Cloninger

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.760
A psychiatrist who develop personality tests for measuring this trait, novelty seeking is what keeps people happy healthy and creative

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.299
Cloninger States to succeed you want to be able to regulate your impulses while also having the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.900
Imagination to see what the future would be like if you tried something new when you're easily bored. It doesn't necessarily mean you're unmotivated

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.349
Instead you have the potential to grow when you seek new experiences that allow you to make the most out of your creativity

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.919
3.  you don't maintain a work-life balance

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.070
Instead you just focus on life. What does it mean to just focus on life? As humans,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.739
We try to systematically organize by categorizing different aspects of our lives. So they don't spiral out of control

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.279
But instead of working on neatly giving everything a place to belong

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.938
It's easy to get fixed on the small details that we forget about the bigger picture

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.289
Being successful means going with the flow and doing what you feel is best for your mental health your friends family and coworkers

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.089
Although a certain degree of discipline and getting into a rhythm that works for you are important

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.390
It's also essential to make the most of every day

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.889
Being successful also doesn't necessarily translate to 40-hour work weeks

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.360
It's all a matter of finding purpose and meaning in what you do on a daily basis

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.059
4. You practice empathy look out for your teammates and celebrate the happiness of others

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.720
Although it's exciting to be motivated in what you do, successful people don't just stitch and forget about the people around them

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.229
Success never happens alone. It's always a collaborative effort

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.590
If you have great people skills, often look out for your teammates and empathize with others then you're already on a great path

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.939
Society often paints the workplace to be a dog-eat-dog world, but competition doesn't hold meaning when people can't learn from one another

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.979
It's important to refrain from adapting self-absorbed habits and learn to reach out as much as possible

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.029
Be supportive of each other's dreams and help each other to achieve them

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.749
5. You practice humility again and again

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.839
You don't focus on your achievements or constantly want to prove yourself to others by finding opportunities to be in the spotlight

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.260
Instead, you just want to get better not for an audience

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.899
But for yourself when you work on improving your skills behind the scenes your work journey becomes much more authentic

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.390
Because your progress is only for you to see.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.800
It's not about the A you earned on a test that's pinned to the classroom board or the amount of likes you receive on social media

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.000
You care about progress because you genuinely want to get better, not to perform better

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.640
6. You're not motivated by money as a reward, but rather see it as a resource

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.000
You don't care about making the big bucks

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.350
Just to be able to afford extravagant possessions such as fancy cars or attend special functions like cocktail parties

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.310
in fact

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.440
you see it as almost a slap in the face that

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.119
Success can supposedly be measured by something that can be spent just as easily as it is earned

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.010
Yes. Earning money is necessary for survival, but you don't allow it to be everything

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.330
instead you focus more on earning money to give back to your community of

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.660
Supporters and your team members hard work and to buy resources or Ford experiences that help sustain and grow your business

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.239
projects and passion

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.560
7. You don't believe in dream jobs instead you believe in hard work

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.760
Persistence is key

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.399
People often say there's no such thing as fairytale love. The same goes for success

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.819
Rather than daydream about the possibilities of what your ideal career entails you go out and actively work towards building it

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.059
Overnight success is a myth. In order to reach your goals

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.039
You understand that sacrifice hard work and failures are all essential components of the journey

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.679
In fact, that's what makes it all the more worthwhile

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.679
If success was easily handed to you without a single day of sweat or tears, it would be hard to find meaning in it

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.609
But you also realize that success isn't everything. In fact, it's just a moment. When you realize that it's a humbling experience

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.519
Because you understand that success doesn't amount to much without the respect and love you have for yourself and others

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.299
