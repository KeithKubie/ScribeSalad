it's quite a special prime it was

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330
it's quite a special prime it was
 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.269
it's quite a special prime it was
actually discovered fairly recently was

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279
actually discovered fairly recently was
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.620
actually discovered fairly recently was
discovered on October the 31st 2016 it

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630
discovered on October the 31st 2016 it
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.470
discovered on October the 31st 2016 it
was discovered on Halloween 2016 but all

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
was discovered on Halloween 2016 but all
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.950
was discovered on Halloween 2016 but all
the other primes are Mersenne primes all

primes that are one less than a power of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809
primes that are one less than a power of
 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.750
primes that are one less than a power of
two and there's a reason for that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760
two and there's a reason for that
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.660
two and there's a reason for that
because computationally it's quite easy

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
because computationally it's quite easy
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.900
because computationally it's quite easy
to check if they are primes or not right

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910
to check if they are primes or not right
 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.819

there is a there is a test for that

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829
there is a there is a test for that
 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.610
there is a there is a test for that
which you can run quite quickly number

seven there is slightly different
there's a couple of reasons why it's

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969
there's a couple of reasons why it's
 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.150
there's a couple of reasons why it's
special and one of the reasons is that

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
special and one of the reasons is that
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.139
special and one of the reasons is that
it takes us one step closer to solving a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149
it takes us one step closer to solving a
 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.349
it takes us one step closer to solving a
fifty-year-old conjecture so let's take

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
fifty-year-old conjecture so let's take
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.500
fifty-year-old conjecture so let's take
a look at this prime so this number it's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510
a look at this prime so this number it's
 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.780
a look at this prime so this number it's
called up rough trying so tough Prime's

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
called up rough trying so tough Prime's
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.480
called up rough trying so tough Prime's
have this form where it's okay that's

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
have this form where it's okay that's
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.850
have this form where it's okay that's
some number multiplied by a power of two

some number multiplied by a power of two
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.609
some number multiplied by a power of two
plus one let's see if we can find a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
plus one let's see if we can find a
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.710
plus one let's see if we can find a
troth Prime one gonna do as take her a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
troth Prime one gonna do as take her a
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.740
troth Prime one gonna do as take her a
value I'm gonna say K is nineteen all

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
value I'm gonna say K is nineteen all
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.499
value I'm gonna say K is nineteen all
right let's take K as 19 and then we're

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
right let's take K as 19 and then we're
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.170
right let's take K as 19 and then we're
gonna multiply it by powers of two add

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
gonna multiply it by powers of two add
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.660
gonna multiply it by powers of two add
one and let's see we get a prime well

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670
one and let's see we get a prime well
 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.960
one and let's see we get a prime well
let's do the first power of two 19 times

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970
let's do the first power of two 19 times
 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.390
let's do the first power of two 19 times
238 plus 1 that equals 39 but that's not

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
238 plus 1 that equals 39 but that's not
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.700
238 plus 1 that equals 39 but that's not
a prime it's 3 times 13 that's no good

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
a prime it's 3 times 13 that's no good
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.710
a prime it's 3 times 13 that's no good
let's check for another let's try 19

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720
let's check for another let's try 19
 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.530
let's check for another let's try 19
again but let's do 2 squared so 19 s 2

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540
again but let's do 2 squared so 19 s 2
 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.200
again but let's do 2 squared so 19 s 2
times 4 well 19 times 2 is 38 so we can

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
times 4 well 19 times 2 is 38 so we can
 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.469
times 4 well 19 times 2 is 38 so we can
double that again at 76 plus 1 that's 77

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479
double that again at 76 plus 1 that's 77
 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.719
double that again at 76 plus 1 that's 77
that's definitely not a prime that's 7

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
that's definitely not a prime that's 7
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.609
that's definitely not a prime that's 7
times 11 and let's keep going this

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
times 11 and let's keep going this
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.670
times 11 and let's keep going this
evening a fine pot let's do 19 times 2

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
evening a fine pot let's do 19 times 2
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.350
evening a fine pot let's do 19 times 2
to power 3 that is 153 153 is that prime

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360
to power 3 that is 153 153 is that prime
 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.690
to power 3 that is 153 153 is that prime
that's maybe not so obvious both know

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700
that's maybe not so obvious both know
 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.889
that's maybe not so obvious both know
that isn't fine

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
that isn't fine
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.249
that isn't fine
19 times 2 to the power 4 ok look into

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259
19 times 2 to the power 4 ok look into
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.980
19 times 2 to the power 4 ok look into
keep looking I I think that is plus 1 of

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
keep looking I I think that is plus 1 of
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.740
keep looking I I think that is plus 1 of
course that is 305 that's definitely not

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
course that is 305 that's definitely not
 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.690
course that is 305 that's definitely not
a prime okay another failure let's keep

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
a prime okay another failure let's keep
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.170
a prime okay another failure let's keep
looking for a prime let's do the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180
looking for a prime let's do the
 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.559
looking for a prime let's do the
20 19 times two to the five plus one

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569
20 19 times two to the five plus one
 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.690
20 19 times two to the five plus one
I've got vas been 609 no that's

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700
I've got vas been 609 no that's
 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.559
I've got vas been 609 no that's
divisible by three it's gonna fit

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569
divisible by three it's gonna fit
 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.630
divisible by three it's gonna fit
actually we've got it we've got it look

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640
actually we've got it we've got it look
 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.140
actually we've got it we've got it look
at this one

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150
at this one
 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.920
at this one
19 times 2 to the power 6 1217 try that

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930
19 times 2 to the power 6 1217 try that
 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.349
19 times 2 to the power 6 1217 try that
is a prime finally we found 4 took a

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359
is a prime finally we found 4 took a
 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:38.880
is a prime finally we found 4 took a
while yeah it took a while but

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890
while yeah it took a while but
 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.699
while yeah it took a while but
eventually we found a prime in the 1960s

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709
eventually we found a prime in the 1960s
 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.399
eventually we found a prime in the 1960s
mathematician sierpinski said that if

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409
mathematician sierpinski said that if
 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.550
mathematician sierpinski said that if
you take something of this form it's K

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560
you take something of this form it's K
 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.979
you take something of this form it's K
times 2 to power n plus 1 and you keep

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989
times 2 to power n plus 1 and you keep
 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.750
times 2 to power n plus 1 and you keep
running for it there are numbers that

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760
running for it there are numbers that
 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.819
running for it there are numbers that
will never hit a prime so you'll keep

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829
will never hit a prime so you'll keep
 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.309
will never hit a prime so you'll keep
going forever and you'll never get it

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319
going forever and you'll never get it
 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.149
going forever and you'll never get it
probably in fact he said there were

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159
probably in fact he said there were
 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.490
probably in fact he said there were
infinitely many of them there's loads of

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500
infinitely many of them there's loads of
 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.890
infinitely many of them there's loads of
them out there the natural question is

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900
them out there the natural question is
 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.550
them out there the natural question is
what's the smallest one ah well we don't

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560
what's the smallest one ah well we don't
 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.530
what's the smallest one ah well we don't
quite know so they think it might be

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540
quite know so they think it might be
 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.699
quite know so they think it might be
this number 78550 7 as okay yeah that's

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709
this number 78550 7 as okay yeah that's
 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.619
this number 78550 7 as okay yeah that's
this case so I'm saying if we multiply

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629
this case so I'm saying if we multiply
 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.920
this case so I'm saying if we multiply
that by 2 to the N and then we add 1 and

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930
that by 2 to the N and then we add 1 and
 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.180
that by 2 to the N and then we add 1 and
we run through that process we'll never

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190
we run through that process we'll never
 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.890
we run through that process we'll never
hit a prime it's never going to happen

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900
hit a prime it's never going to happen
 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.689
hit a prime it's never going to happen
in fact I know that's never going to

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699
in fact I know that's never going to
 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.970
in fact I know that's never going to
happen so a mathematician called John

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980
happen so a mathematician called John
 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.670
happen so a mathematician called John
Selfridge showed that that's never gonna

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680
Selfridge showed that that's never gonna
 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.409
Selfridge showed that that's never gonna
happen he showed that this number

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419
happen he showed that this number
 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.879
happen he showed that this number
whatever it is

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889
whatever it is
 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.729
whatever it is
we'll always be divisible by one of

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739
we'll always be divisible by one of
 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:43.890
we'll always be divisible by one of
these 3 5 7 13 1937 or 73 so he said

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900
these 3 5 7 13 1937 or 73 so he said
 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.300
these 3 5 7 13 1937 or 73 so he said
he's always gonna be divisible by one of

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310
he's always gonna be divisible by one of
 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.710
he's always gonna be divisible by one of
those so it's never going to be a prime

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720
those so it's never going to be a prime
 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.259
those so it's never going to be a prime
that definitely is a co Pinsky number

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269
that definitely is a co Pinsky number
 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.210
that definitely is a co Pinsky number
okay this is a number that will never

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220
okay this is a number that will never
 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.339
okay this is a number that will never
hit a prime great but is it the smallest

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349
hit a prime great but is it the smallest
 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.670
hit a prime great but is it the smallest
one that we don't know now there's quite

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680
one that we don't know now there's quite
 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.439
one that we don't know now there's quite
a few candidates for this will in fact

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:58.449
a few candidates for this will in fact
 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:00.420
a few candidates for this will in fact
we're gonna have to check all the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430
we're gonna have to check all the
 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.770
we're gonna have to check all the
numbers smaller than 78550 7 well you

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780
numbers smaller than 78550 7 well you
 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.990
numbers smaller than 78550 7 well you
can do that and most of those were

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000
can do that and most of those were
 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.180
can do that and most of those were
eliminated until the roundabout

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190
eliminated until the roundabout
 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.849
eliminated until the roundabout
beginning of the 21st century there were

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859
beginning of the 21st century there were
 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.149
beginning of the 21st century there were
17 left 17 that hadn't been eliminated

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159
17 left 17 that hadn't been eliminated
 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.830
17 left 17 that hadn't been eliminated
so there might be numbers that are

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840
so there might be numbers that are
 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.640
so there might be numbers that are
smaller than 78550 7 and you could do

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650
smaller than 78550 7 and you could do
 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.860
smaller than 78550 7 and you could do
this and you'll never hit a prime so

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870
this and you'll never hit a prime so
 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.620
this and you'll never hit a prime so
there were 17 candidates left but thanks

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630
there were 17 candidates left but thanks
 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.520
there were 17 candidates left but thanks
to and

and computation that meant we could

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870
and computation that meant we could
 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.890
and computation that meant we could
start eliminating these candidates now

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900
start eliminating these candidates now
 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.020
start eliminating these candidates now
we started to eliminate them until there

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030
we started to eliminate them until there
 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.400
we started to eliminate them until there
were six left these are the six that

thousand six hundred and seven so there
 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.930

were these six candidates left but

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940
were these six candidates left but
 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.610
were these six candidates left but
things started to slow down and I'm

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620
things started to slow down and I'm
 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.850
things started to slow down and I'm
afraid there was a gap of nine years

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860
afraid there was a gap of nine years
 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.210
afraid there was a gap of nine years
before we were able to eliminate one of

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.550

really large prime not so much found
 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.920
really large prime not so much found
because they were searching for large

because they were searching for large
 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.480
because they were searching for large
primes but because they were trying to

three so you can do this yourself using

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790
three so you can do this yourself using
 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.469

our list so we have these candidates and
 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.280
our list so we have these candidates and
then you find a prime that kills it off

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290
then you find a prime that kills it off
 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.159
then you find a prime that kills it off
as a candidate so those Prime's are huge

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169
as a candidate so those Prime's are huge
 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.950
as a candidate so those Prime's are huge
this one that was found recently is over
