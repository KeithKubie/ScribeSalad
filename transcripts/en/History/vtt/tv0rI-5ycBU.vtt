00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.140
[crowd yelling]

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:16.200
[chanting]

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.160
NARRATOR: Members of the
Youth International Party,

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.088
they call themselves,
converged on Chicago.

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:25.158
They said they were there
to protest the war, poverty,

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.660
racism and other social ills.

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.629
Some of them were
also determined

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:32.165
to provoke a
confrontation to draw

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:35.701
attention from the
convention to the streets.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.538
Mayor Richard Daley vowed
to keep it peaceful,

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:41.507
even if it took force
to keep the peace.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.446
He was backed by 12,000 police,
5,000 National Guardsmen,

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.816
7,500 regular army troops.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:53.319
[crowd yelling]

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.850
Hundreds of marchers and dozens
of policemen were injured.

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:27.453
Restraint was absent
on both sides.

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:31.824
This was later
called a police riot.

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:34.360
During that frightful
week, the demonstrators

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:37.330
repeatedly tried to march on
the site of the convention,

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.464
the stockyards.

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:41.367
Repeatedly, they
were forced back.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.371
But even inside the convention
hall the virus of violence

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:46.739
was pervasive.

Dan Rather and Walter
Cronkite for CBS News.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.777
Take your hands off of me.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.447
Unless you intend to arrest
me, don't push me, please.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.782
[clapping]

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.554
[horn blows]
