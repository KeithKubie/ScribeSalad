00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You could perhaps argue some of these--you might have some difference of opinion here,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but I wouldn't say that the bug was in the actual software under test because 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the actual software did what it was supposed to do according to specification correctly. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And was there a bug in the acceptability test--well in that the acceptability test didn't check this

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
then yes but if you're going to use that as a metric, then you could argue that all bugs are bugs

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in acceptability test because they didn't catch all of the bugs which is of course infeasible.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I would say this is a bug in the specification because this was a miscommunication

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
between the engineers at NASA and Lockheed Martin.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And both of their ideas were correct but they didn't communicate those ideas properly.   

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It was assumed on each of their ends.  

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So if they had put that information explicitly in this specification then we wouldn't really have

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
had the issues and the Mars Climate Orbiter wouldn't have had at least that bug

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
may be something else would cropped up or maybe not. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I also wouldn't say that there is a bug in the underlying OS, compiler, libraries, or hardware.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
At least this bug isn't an example of that. At least we don't have any evidence of that.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
There might have been other bugs again but this one I would say is definitely a bug

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in the specification--so let's check one more example and then move on.
