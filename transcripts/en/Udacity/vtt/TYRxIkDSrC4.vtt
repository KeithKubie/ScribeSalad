00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.520
A theorem is a statement in math
that has been proven always correct.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.080
The Pythagorean Theorem states
that in a right triangle

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.840
a squared plus b squared
equals c squared.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.900
Where a and b are the lengths of
the legs of the right triangle.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.880
The legs are the two sides that
make up the 90 degree angle.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.330
And c is the hypotenuse, the hypotenuse
is the longest side of a right triangle.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.210
It's also always opposite
the right angle.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.500
So given that a squared plus b
squared equals c squared and

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.518
c is the hypotenuse,
what is the length of

00:00:36.518 --> 00:00:40.930
the hypotenuse when a is equal
to three and b is equal to four?

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.367
Enter your answer here.

00:00:43.367 --> 00:00:45.249
