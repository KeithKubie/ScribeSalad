00:00:06.926 --> 00:00:08.402
As far as we know,

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:12.472
Medieval England was never invaded
by ice zombies,

00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:14.729
or terrorized by dragons,

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:19.345
but it was shaken by a power struggle
between two noble families

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:21.110
spanning generations

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.904
and involving a massive 
cast of characters

00:00:23.904 --> 00:00:28.018
with complex motives 
and shifting loyalties.

00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:29.754
If that sounds familiar,

00:00:29.754 --> 00:00:33.959
it's because the historical conflicts
known as the Wars of the Roses

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:39.908
served as the basis for much 
of the drama in Game of Thrones.

00:00:39.908 --> 00:00:47.097
The real-life seeds of war were sewn 
by the death of King Edward III in 1377.

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:50.890
Edward's oldest son 
had died before his father,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.879
but his ten-year-old son, Richard II,

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.179
succeeded to the throne 
ahead of Edward's three surviving sons.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.603
This skipping of an entire generation

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:06.396
left lingering claims to the throne
among their various offspring,

00:01:06.396 --> 00:01:10.926
particularly the Lancasters,
descended from Edward's third son,

00:01:10.926 --> 00:01:14.366
and the Yorks, descended 
from his fourth son.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.195
The name of the ensuing wars

00:01:16.195 --> 00:01:19.501
comes from the symbols 
associated with the two families,

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:24.128
the white rose of York
and the red rose of Lancaster.

00:01:24.128 --> 00:01:26.239
The Lancasters first gained the throne

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:32.340
when Richard II was deposed 
by his cousin Henry IV in 1399.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.496
Despite sporadic unrest,

00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:38.476
their reign remained secure until 1422,

00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:41.429
when Henry V's death 
in a military campaign

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.227
left an infant Henry VI as king.

00:01:45.227 --> 00:01:47.785
Weak-willed and dominated by advisors,

00:01:47.785 --> 00:01:53.350
Henry was eventually convinced to marry
Margaret of Anjou to gain French support.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.424
Margaret was beautiful, ambitious,

00:01:56.424 --> 00:02:00.350
and ruthless in persecuting 
any threat to her power,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.723
and she distrusted 
Richard of York, most of all.

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:07.056
York had been the King's close advisor
and loyal General,

00:02:07.056 --> 00:02:10.103
but was increasingly 
sidelined by the Queen,

00:02:10.103 --> 00:02:15.048
who promoted her favorite supporters,
like the Earls of Suffolk and Somerset.

00:02:15.048 --> 00:02:18.852
York's criticism of their inept handling
of the war against France

00:02:18.852 --> 00:02:23.975
led to his exclusion from court
and transfer to Ireland.

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:26.297
Meanwhile, mounting military failures,

00:02:26.297 --> 00:02:29.436
and corrupt rule by Margaret 
and her allies

00:02:29.436 --> 00:02:31.875
caused widespread discontent,

00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:33.748
and in the midst of this chaos,

00:02:33.748 --> 00:02:39.749
Richard of York returned with an army
to arrest Somerset and reform the court.

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.475
Initially unsuccessful, 
he soon got his chance

00:02:42.475 --> 00:02:45.407
when he was appointed 
Protector of the Realm

00:02:45.407 --> 00:02:48.135
after Henry suffered a mental breakdown.

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:50.428
However, less than a year later,

00:02:50.428 --> 00:02:52.056
Henry suddendly recovered

00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:55.651
and the Queen convinced him 
to reverse York's reforms.

00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:58.896
York fled and raised an army once more.

00:02:58.896 --> 00:03:01.497
Though he was unable 
to directly seize the throne,

00:03:01.497 --> 00:03:04.243
he managed to be reinstated as Protector

00:03:04.243 --> 00:03:09.726
and have himself and his heirs designated
to succeed Henry.

00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:11.329
But instead of a crown,

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.755
York's head acquired a pike

00:03:13.755 --> 00:03:17.805
after he was killed in battle
with the Queen's loyalists.

00:03:17.805 --> 00:03:22.716
His young son took up the claim
and was crowned Edward IV.

00:03:22.716 --> 00:03:26.353
Edward enjoyed great military success
against the Lancasters.

00:03:26.353 --> 00:03:27.987
Henry was captured,

00:03:27.987 --> 00:03:30.232
while Margaret fled into exile

00:03:30.232 --> 00:03:34.112
with their reportedly cruel son, 
Edward of Westminster.

00:03:34.112 --> 00:03:37.587
But the newly crowned King
made a tragic political mistake

00:03:37.587 --> 00:03:41.570
by backing out of his arranged marriage
with a French Princess

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.066
to secretly marry the widow
of a minor Noble.

00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:48.947
This alienated his most powerful ally,
the Earl of Warwick.

00:03:48.947 --> 00:03:52.043
Warwick allied with the Lancasters,

00:03:52.043 --> 00:03:55.835
turned Edward's jealous 
younger brother, George, against him,

00:03:55.835 --> 00:04:00.324
and even briefly managed 
to restore Henry as King,

00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:01.890
but it didn't last.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.631
Edward recaptured the throne,

00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:06.369
the Lancaster Prince was killed in battle,

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:11.122
and Henry himself died 
in captivity not long after.

00:04:11.122 --> 00:04:13.839
The rest of Edward IV's reign 
was peaceful,

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:18.078
but upon his death in 1483, 
the bloodshed resumed.

00:04:18.078 --> 00:04:20.971
Though his twelve-year-old son
was due to succeed him,

00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:25.634
Edward's younger brother Richard III
declared his nephews illegitimate

00:04:25.634 --> 00:04:28.545
due to their father's secret marriage.

00:04:28.545 --> 00:04:32.848
He assumed the regency himself
and threw the boys in prison.

00:04:32.848 --> 00:04:35.325
Though no one knows what ultimately
became of them,

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:38.065
after a while, the Princes disappeared

00:04:38.065 --> 00:04:40.816
and Richard's power seemed secure.

00:04:40.816 --> 00:04:43.523
But his downfall would come
only two years later

00:04:43.523 --> 00:04:47.768
from across the narrow sea
of the English Channel.

00:04:47.768 --> 00:04:51.878
Henry Tudor was a direct descendant
of the first Duke of Lancaster,

00:04:51.878 --> 00:04:56.010
raised in exile after his father's 
death in a previous rebellion.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.157
With Richard III's power grab
causing a split in the York faction,

00:05:00.157 --> 00:05:03.559
Henry won support for his royal claim.

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:07.702
Raising an army in France,
he crossed the Channel in 1485

00:05:07.702 --> 00:05:10.679
and quickly defeated Richard's forces.

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:15.303
And by marrying Elizabeth of York,
elder sister of the disappeared Princes,

00:05:15.303 --> 00:05:20.021
the newly crowned Henry VII
joined the two roses,

00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:23.908
finally ending nearly a century of war.

00:05:23.908 --> 00:05:28.220
We often think of historical wars
as decisive conflicts

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.979
with clearly defined winners and losers.

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.318
But the Wars of the Roses,
like the fiction they inspired,

00:05:34.318 --> 00:05:37.147
show us that victories
can be uncertain,

00:05:37.147 --> 00:05:39.323
alliances unstable,

00:05:39.323 --> 00:05:43.851
and even the power of Kings
as fleeting as the seasons.
