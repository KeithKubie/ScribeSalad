00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:03.016
(techno sound)

00:00:05.608 --> 00:00:09.774
(light instrumental music)

00:00:09.774 --> 00:00:12.630
- [Announcer] We are the paradoxical aid.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.130
Bipedal, naked, large brained.

00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:21.871
Long the master of fire,
tools and language.

00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:25.288
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.177 --> 00:00:29.482
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:31.565
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.813 --> 00:00:34.313
We grow up slowly.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.739
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.822
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:42.426
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:45.176
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.698 --> 00:00:50.423
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.423 --> 00:00:54.590
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.498 --> 00:00:57.919
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.919 --> 00:01:01.002
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:26.024
(light instrumental music)

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:31.566
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:01:46.587 --> 00:01:49.051
- Okay, well it's a great honor to be here

00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:52.507
and I thank the organizers
Nick and Ajit for inviting me

00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:55.319
and also all of you for coming.

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.123
So I would like to start
by showing you a video clip

00:01:58.123 --> 00:02:00.806
of something that we filmed last summer

00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:03.751
in Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique.

00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:06.855
So Gorongosa's an amazing
biodiversity hotspot

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:09.317
and we have here what looks like a fairly,

00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:11.033
kind of peaceful scene.

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:13.154
So we have a troupe of
baboons resting and feeding.

00:02:13.154 --> 00:02:15.874
We've got some warthogs walking around.

00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:18.070
We've got some waterbuck
grazing and so on.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.470
So it's all quite idyllic.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.978
But, of course, nature's rarely idyllic

00:02:22.978 --> 00:02:25.452
and if you look more closely
you can see that this guy

00:02:25.452 --> 00:02:29.871
here in the middle is
quite busy doing something.

00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:33.958
And then if we zoom in,
which we will in a second,

00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.694
we'll see that he has hunted

00:02:35.694 --> 00:02:39.666
and he's now eating a
young antelope, a reedbuck.

00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:42.040
But, unlike a lion with a killer bite,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.957
this baboon is eating the
antelope while it's still alive.

00:02:44.957 --> 00:02:47.768
Which you could argue is
not particularly sensible

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:50.476
given that it means that
the antelope still has

00:02:50.476 --> 00:02:52.905
a chance to escape, which
as you'll see in a second,

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:56.905
it's still very much
trying to do at this point.

00:02:59.051 --> 00:03:02.316
So for us, I think this really is quite a

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:04.782
sort of gruesome scene,
but at the same time,

00:03:04.782 --> 00:03:07.152
it does raise some very
interesting questions that we can

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:10.358
ask about what might be going
on in that baboon's head.

00:03:10.358 --> 00:03:11.762
And some of those questions
actually hark back

00:03:11.762 --> 00:03:14.203
to what Nick was talking
about in his introduction.

00:03:14.203 --> 00:03:16.216
So for example, does this baboon know

00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:18.184
that the antelope is still alive?

00:03:18.184 --> 00:03:20.176
Does the baboon know that
the fact that the antelope

00:03:20.176 --> 00:03:22.947
is moving is a sign that it's still alive?

00:03:22.947 --> 00:03:25.775
Does the baboon know that
it can kill the antelope?

00:03:25.775 --> 00:03:28.611
And does it know what it needs
to do to kill the antelope?

00:03:28.611 --> 00:03:30.514
And that once it has killed it,

00:03:30.514 --> 00:03:32.964
the antelope will remain dead?

00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:35.674
Does the baboon know that
it itself will die one day

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:37.749
and so will all other baboons

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:39.875
and will other antelopes and so on?

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:43.569
And then finally, you might
have noticed in that video,

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.008
the antelope's mother
standing to one side.

00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:48.639
So another question could be, I think,

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.842
will the antelope's mother
grieve for her calf?

00:03:51.842 --> 00:03:54.348
So I can't promise to
be able to answer most

00:03:54.348 --> 00:03:56.623
or even any of these questions,

00:03:56.623 --> 00:03:59.025
but what I will try to do in this talk

00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:01.969
is to fist survey what kinds of responses

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.713
have been recorded among non-human animals

00:04:04.713 --> 00:04:07.753
to dead individuals and what
these responses might tell us

00:04:07.753 --> 00:04:10.086
about the kind of underlying

00:04:10.982 --> 00:04:14.228
death related concepts in these animals.

00:04:14.228 --> 00:04:16.611
And then at the end I will
also briefly consider grief

00:04:16.611 --> 00:04:18.948
specifically as well as what implications

00:04:18.948 --> 00:04:20.627
a better understanding of these phenomena

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:22.897
might have for animal welfare.

00:04:22.897 --> 00:04:25.528
So, on this graphical
summary what I tried to do

00:04:25.528 --> 00:04:29.461
was to put together, to
give you an idea basically

00:04:29.461 --> 00:04:32.169
of the orders of mammals,
so the taxonomic orders

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.318
of mammals from which we have published

00:04:34.318 --> 00:04:37.564
scientific reports on responses to death.

00:04:37.564 --> 00:04:39.943
And I think one of the
things that quickly pops out

00:04:39.943 --> 00:04:44.467
is that these reports cover
quite a broad taxonomic spread,

00:04:44.467 --> 00:04:46.009
although some orders are represented

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.395
by just one or a few species.

00:04:48.395 --> 00:04:50.741
And that of course
doesn't mean that mammals

00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:53.626
in other orders don't respond to the dead.

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:56.354
It's just that we don't
have, yet have good

00:04:56.354 --> 00:04:59.013
kind of published reports on them.

00:04:59.013 --> 00:05:00.952
So, for example, we don't
really know a great deal

00:05:00.952 --> 00:05:02.617
about how bats or (mumbles)

00:05:02.617 --> 00:05:04.772
or kangaroos respond to the dead.

00:05:04.772 --> 00:05:07.365
Although for at least some of
these kind of missing pieces,

00:05:07.365 --> 00:05:11.282
we do have some anecdotal
evidence that exists.

00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:14.476
Just not scientifically published yet.

00:05:14.476 --> 00:05:15.868
So we'll come back to this figure later

00:05:15.868 --> 00:05:18.186
when we look at what
specific ways there are

00:05:18.186 --> 00:05:22.752
of animals' responses or
animals' treatment of the dead.

00:05:22.752 --> 00:05:23.848
But first what I want to do now

00:05:23.848 --> 00:05:26.539
is to quickly tell you
about three chimpanzee

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.807
case reports that we observed
at our field research site

00:05:30.807 --> 00:05:33.203
which is coordinated by Kyoto University

00:05:33.203 --> 00:05:37.496
and which is located in
Bossou in Guinea West Africa.

00:05:37.496 --> 00:05:40.744
And they're each kind of
incredibly striking cases I think.

00:05:40.744 --> 00:05:42.934
Things you see, once you see them,

00:05:42.934 --> 00:05:44.531
you don't easily forget them.

00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:47.818
All three cases involved young
individuals, young infants,

00:05:47.818 --> 00:05:51.204
so Jokro, Jimato and
Veve, each of whom died

00:05:51.204 --> 00:05:53.619
of a suspected respiratory illness

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:56.175
before they turned three years old.

00:05:56.175 --> 00:05:58.717
And these dead infants,
they weren't abandoned

00:05:58.717 --> 00:06:01.450
by their mothers, but they
continued to be carried

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.585
and to be looked after, to
be groomed and protected

00:06:04.585 --> 00:06:06.538
much like live animals at this age

00:06:06.538 --> 00:06:08.429
would be by their mothers.

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:10.471
And over the course of the carrying,

00:06:10.471 --> 00:06:14.638
all three infants mummified
and the length of the carrying

00:06:15.477 --> 00:06:16.965
was really extraordinary.

00:06:16.965 --> 00:06:18.893
So in the first case,

00:06:18.893 --> 00:06:21.792
carrying continued for more than 27 days.

00:06:21.792 --> 00:06:24.149
In the second case, for 68 days.

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:26.862
And then in the third case, for 19 days.

00:06:26.862 --> 00:06:29.175
And it's extraordinary for many reasons,

00:06:29.175 --> 00:06:33.726
but one of the reasons is
that this length of carrying,

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:38.511
really amazing because the
infants have to be carried

00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:41.428
in ways that no live infant ever is

00:06:42.361 --> 00:06:45.446
because they could no
longer hold on their mother

00:06:45.446 --> 00:06:46.854
and they could no longer cling,

00:06:46.854 --> 00:06:48.054
so they really encumbered their mothers,

00:06:48.054 --> 00:06:51.774
they had to be carried in unusual ways.

00:06:51.774 --> 00:06:55.088
So for example, between,
sorry, by grasping a limb

00:06:55.088 --> 00:06:56.301
between the neck and the shoulder

00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:58.074
which is what you see in these images here

00:06:58.074 --> 00:07:00.067
when the mothers were walking.

00:07:00.067 --> 00:07:02.800
Or by climbing and then,
sorry, when climbing,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.311
holding the body between
the thigh and the belly,

00:07:05.311 --> 00:07:07.699
the so-called thigh
pocket in the chimpanzee,

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:09.040
that's what you see in this image.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.503
Or even by dangling just by the foot

00:07:11.503 --> 00:07:13.778
when resting in the trees.

00:07:13.778 --> 00:07:16.594
And the mothers also
continued to groom the bodies

00:07:16.594 --> 00:07:19.378
and they swatted flies from them.

00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:22.474
You're seeing that in that video.

00:07:22.474 --> 00:07:24.457
And the grooming in particular,

00:07:24.457 --> 00:07:26.812
I think you can interpret
in different ways I guess.

00:07:26.812 --> 00:07:28.994
So you could for example,
argue that the mothers,

00:07:28.994 --> 00:07:31.669
these mothers don't know
that their infants are dead.

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:34.382
And they continue to treat them as live.

00:07:34.382 --> 00:07:37.943
Or that they do know that
the infants are not live,

00:07:37.943 --> 00:07:42.589
not alive, but they choose
to keep them clean anyway.

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:44.293
And then group-mates other than the mother

00:07:44.293 --> 00:07:46.623
also showed a lot of
interest in the bodies.

00:07:46.623 --> 00:07:48.755
So we saw a number of different responses

00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:49.588
from these individuals.

00:07:49.588 --> 00:07:51.814
They ranged from investigatory behaviors

00:07:51.814 --> 00:07:53.812
like smelling and touching and inspecting

00:07:53.812 --> 00:07:56.309
or lifting limbs and dropping them

00:07:56.309 --> 00:08:00.440
to dragging and pulling and
playing with the corpses.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.097
But also to caretaking and attendance.

00:08:03.097 --> 00:08:07.854
So this, for example, here is
this dead infant's grandmother

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:10.811
who sat by the corpse while
the mother was off feeding.

00:08:10.811 --> 00:08:14.802
And she groomed it and
she swatted flies from it.

00:08:14.802 --> 00:08:16.205
And the mothers were
generally quite tolerant

00:08:16.205 --> 00:08:17.848
to these behaviors even if it meant

00:08:17.848 --> 00:08:20.178
relinquishing possession
of the corpses temporarily.

00:08:20.178 --> 00:08:22.474
So you this one particular mother here

00:08:22.474 --> 00:08:23.593
and there's the corpse left behind

00:08:23.593 --> 00:08:26.416
and this is a juvenile that
comes in quite cautiously,

00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:28.695
picks up the corpse and carries it off.

00:08:28.695 --> 00:08:30.507
And you see the mother
initially, she turns around

00:08:30.507 --> 00:08:32.290
and she sort of gets
up as if she was making

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:36.019
to go to get the corpse
back, but eventually she just

00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:40.474
sort of lets the juvenile
run off with it and play.

00:08:40.474 --> 00:08:45.086
And again this is not to
dissimilar to what a live infant

00:08:45.086 --> 00:08:46.789
of this age would be allowed to do.

00:08:46.789 --> 00:08:50.093
Two-year-olds do still travel
with the mother at all times.

00:08:50.093 --> 00:08:52.685
But when the group is
stationary the mothers do allow

00:08:52.685 --> 00:08:55.609
these infants to wander off

00:08:55.609 --> 00:08:58.993
and play with others in the group.

00:08:58.993 --> 00:09:00.825
And then interestingly
or maybe importantly,

00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:02.179
we never saw any aggression

00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:04.035
being directed towards the corpses.

00:09:04.035 --> 00:09:05.504
Although in one case, this is the one case

00:09:05.504 --> 00:09:08.049
when an adult male used
one of these bodies

00:09:08.049 --> 00:09:10.127
in a display during a fight.

00:09:10.127 --> 00:09:11.735
So this was at the point when the body

00:09:11.735 --> 00:09:13.477
had already completely mummified.

00:09:13.477 --> 00:09:16.889
But even here I think
this seemed like rather

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:18.804
kind of gentle handling of the corpse.

00:09:18.804 --> 00:09:20.303
He's not tearing it to pieces,

00:09:20.303 --> 00:09:22.049
he's not sort of flinging it around,

00:09:22.049 --> 00:09:24.131
but actually sort of quite softly

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:26.038
just pulls it along the ground

00:09:26.038 --> 00:09:30.566
and then gently switches
hands when he turns around.

00:09:30.566 --> 00:09:32.646
And just lastly I want to
show a clip that illustrates

00:09:32.646 --> 00:09:34.978
a kind of combination
of different responses.

00:09:34.978 --> 00:09:38.440
So here first of all we've got an infant

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.869
playing with the corpse
and I think he's sort of

00:09:39.869 --> 00:09:43.469
veering between fear and curiosity really.

00:09:43.469 --> 00:09:47.250
Until it seems like curiosity
gets the better of him.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.196
And so this is the dead infant's mother

00:09:49.196 --> 00:09:52.165
and this is the live,
so this infant's mother.

00:09:52.165 --> 00:09:54.163
And if you watch carefully you'll see that

00:09:54.163 --> 00:09:56.917
that live infant's mother is also peering

00:09:56.917 --> 00:09:59.267
at the body with curiosity.

00:09:59.267 --> 00:10:03.518
But then she, in a moment,
she'll show what might be seen

00:10:03.518 --> 00:10:05.580
as a sort of aversion to the corpse.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.518
So watch this.

00:10:06.518 --> 00:10:09.871
She doesn't really, she's
happy for her infant

00:10:09.871 --> 00:10:11.222
to play with the corpse,

00:10:11.222 --> 00:10:15.763
but she really doesn't
want to be touched by it.

00:10:15.763 --> 00:10:18.102
So having said that, this
was really the only time

00:10:18.102 --> 00:10:22.106
when we saw any individual
respond in this way.

00:10:22.106 --> 00:10:25.356
So far I've talked about dead
infant care in chimpanzees,

00:10:25.356 --> 00:10:26.691
but this is something that is seen

00:10:26.691 --> 00:10:28.236
very broadly among primates.

00:10:28.236 --> 00:10:30.755
We have examples, for
example, from geladas,

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:34.151
mountain gorillas, orangutans, lemurs,

00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:36.271
and some of it on a really huge scale.

00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:38.793
So Sugiyama and his
colleagues, for example,

00:10:38.793 --> 00:10:42.628
documented over 150 cases
of dead infant carrying

00:10:42.628 --> 00:10:46.737
over 24 years of observation
on Japanese macaques.

00:10:46.737 --> 00:10:49.559
And in each case really
the theme is the same.

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:52.114
The mothers continue to
show maternal behavior

00:10:52.114 --> 00:10:54.591
toward their dead infants.

00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:57.081
And furthermore the behavior
isn't restricted to primates.

00:10:57.081 --> 00:10:59.419
So other mammals have
been seen to care for

00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:01.027
and to transport dead infants.

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:04.910
So dolphins and whales, for
example, carry dead calves.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.803
Dingos and elephants stay
with their deceased young.

00:11:07.803 --> 00:11:11.870
Or this giraffe here from
Fred Bercovitch's observations

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.971
remains with and is sort of nudging

00:11:13.971 --> 00:11:16.685
her dead calf in this picture.

00:11:16.685 --> 00:11:19.954
So and the behavior itself
is generally explained

00:11:19.954 --> 00:11:22.111
in terms of the persistence of this

00:11:22.111 --> 00:11:26.881
extremely strong mother-infant
bond in these species.

00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:29.048
It's particularly strong in mammals

00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:31.621
where the mother really
invests a huge amount

00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:33.294
into each of her offspring.

00:11:33.294 --> 00:11:35.951
And then if we also add
in non-infant deaths,

00:11:35.951 --> 00:11:36.970
so all their individuals,

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.166
thereto we have some of the
same responses that we see

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:40.897
for infant, that we saw for infants.

00:11:40.897 --> 00:11:43.675
So caretaking like
grooming, that inspection

00:11:43.675 --> 00:11:46.197
and attendance by the body,
but also things that indicate

00:11:46.197 --> 00:11:48.803
maybe more negative or sort of conflicted

00:11:48.803 --> 00:11:50.655
psychological states such as alarm calling

00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:53.738
or aggression and even cannibalism

00:11:53.738 --> 00:11:56.050
and sexual behavior in some cases.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.941
And I think there are some more kind of

00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:00.169
nuanced response classes as well,

00:12:00.169 --> 00:12:03.431
but the majority really do,
the majority which are reported

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.608
in this large collection of papers

00:12:05.608 --> 00:12:07.436
which I'm going to make use of next,

00:12:07.436 --> 00:12:10.697
can be classed into one or other

00:12:10.697 --> 00:12:12.928
of these kind of broad categories.

00:12:12.928 --> 00:12:14.674
So then on the next slide
I'm going to try to show you

00:12:14.674 --> 00:12:16.413
graphically how these different responses

00:12:16.413 --> 00:12:19.728
are distributed among the
mammalian orders and species

00:12:19.728 --> 00:12:21.606
that we saw at the beginning.

00:12:21.606 --> 00:12:23.221
So for example, in chimpanzees,

00:12:23.221 --> 00:12:26.350
other authors have reported
aggression towards corpses

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.526
including those of infants
and even cannibalism.

00:12:30.526 --> 00:12:31.897
And then in other species as well,

00:12:31.897 --> 00:12:36.522
we see quite a sort of
broad spectrum of responses

00:12:36.522 --> 00:12:40.270
from caretaking to sexual behavior.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.950
But I should say that, so
some of these descriptions

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.058
I think are more complete than others

00:12:45.058 --> 00:12:47.829
and obviously for some
orders we have information

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:50.911
on the treatment only of dead infants,

00:12:50.911 --> 00:12:52.963
but not of dead adults or vice versa.

00:12:52.963 --> 00:12:55.203
So I think this I maybe
best seen as really

00:12:55.203 --> 00:12:58.128
just a snapshot of our current knowledge,

00:12:58.128 --> 00:13:00.714
very much just an emerging picture.

00:13:00.714 --> 00:13:03.417
But it does mean that, I
think that we can say that

00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:05.604
at least these responses are present

00:13:05.604 --> 00:13:08.893
in these different orders and species.

00:13:08.893 --> 00:13:09.726
So then the important question

00:13:09.726 --> 00:13:12.111
of what drives these different responses,

00:13:12.111 --> 00:13:14.813
what might determine
when individuals respond

00:13:14.813 --> 00:13:18.472
with caretaking and when
with aggression or alarm?

00:13:18.472 --> 00:13:21.639
And several people here have discussed

00:13:22.815 --> 00:13:25.182
interesting potential
ideas, so for example,

00:13:25.182 --> 00:13:27.168
a death where the cause is clear.

00:13:27.168 --> 00:13:29.311
So let's say a predator attack,

00:13:29.311 --> 00:13:32.228
may lead to less say, alarm calling

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.107
than a case where the cause is unclear,

00:13:37.107 --> 00:13:39.783
so like an opaque illness for example.

00:13:39.783 --> 00:13:41.347
Then state of decomposition.

00:13:41.347 --> 00:13:44.648
So how much like alive
animal the corpse looks.

00:13:44.648 --> 00:13:46.347
It may be that less decomposed corpses

00:13:46.347 --> 00:13:50.016
elicit more kind of normal
or stronger reactions.

00:13:50.016 --> 00:13:52.849
Then the deceased's social status,

00:13:55.124 --> 00:13:57.870
so an alpha male, a dead
alpha male would generate

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.399
more interest than a more peripheral male.

00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:05.207
Or an infant that's not yet
fully socially integrated.

00:14:05.207 --> 00:14:09.374
Also the deceased's social
relationship to the individual.

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:12.378
So a mother will respond,
probably will respond

00:14:12.378 --> 00:14:14.314
differently to her own dead offspring

00:14:14.314 --> 00:14:16.659
than to an unrelated group mate.

00:14:16.659 --> 00:14:19.550
Also, Christophe Boesch
interestingly suggests

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.814
that groups that live in
high predation habitats

00:14:22.814 --> 00:14:25.344
have more frequent
encounters with and therefore

00:14:25.344 --> 00:14:28.966
a more kind of sophisticated
knowledge of death.

00:14:28.966 --> 00:14:32.019
While in a sort of similar vein
Katie Cronin's team suggests

00:14:32.019 --> 00:14:34.110
that a chimpanzee mother
with a dead infant

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:38.307
is actively seeking sensory
information on the corpse

00:14:38.307 --> 00:14:40.393
which may inform her future behavior

00:14:40.393 --> 00:14:43.028
should another one of her infants die.

00:14:43.028 --> 00:14:46.140
So we might be seeing not
only these kinds of proximate

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.742
body cue and relationship quality effect,

00:14:48.742 --> 00:14:52.842
but also learning about
death in determining

00:14:52.842 --> 00:14:54.548
what responses we see.

00:14:54.548 --> 00:14:57.191
But perhaps there's also
slightly different way of looking

00:14:57.191 --> 00:14:59.925
at this if we wanted to
split things up by sort of

00:14:59.925 --> 00:15:01.943
underlying psychological states.

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:05.844
So there are some reactions
that might fall under

00:15:05.844 --> 00:15:09.484
sort of normal interactions
and those might suggest

00:15:09.484 --> 00:15:11.374
that there's a lack of understanding

00:15:11.374 --> 00:15:14.958
that the state of that
individual has changed.

00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.459
Although I think even that's not

00:15:16.459 --> 00:15:19.267
entirely clear in all cases.

00:15:19.267 --> 00:15:22.677
But at some point we begin
to see behaviors that suggest

00:15:22.677 --> 00:15:25.537
that such recognition
has indeed taken place.

00:15:25.537 --> 00:15:27.553
And I think stemming from this recognition

00:15:27.553 --> 00:15:30.876
we may find things like curiosity,

00:15:30.876 --> 00:15:34.858
curious exploration of the
body and we may find fear,

00:15:34.858 --> 00:15:37.936
so fearful responses like alarm calling.

00:15:37.936 --> 00:15:41.729
But essentially I think
that what we might be seeing

00:15:41.729 --> 00:15:45.177
is that at the intersection
of these things

00:15:45.177 --> 00:15:46.825
is a recognition by the individual

00:15:46.825 --> 00:15:49.194
that something's not right.

00:15:49.194 --> 00:15:52.776
So, even though this
corpse may look normal,

00:15:52.776 --> 00:15:55.054
it doesn't act normal when
I try to play with it.

00:15:55.054 --> 00:15:58.597
It doesn't join in when I
hit it, it doesn't respond.

00:15:58.597 --> 00:16:02.105
So in a way the corpse
violates expectations

00:16:02.105 --> 00:16:03.553
as Andre Goncalves calls it.

00:16:03.553 --> 00:16:07.424
To which you might respond
with curiosity or fear.

00:16:07.424 --> 00:16:10.379
Or some combination of these two.

00:16:10.379 --> 00:16:14.000
But if that is the case,
then this can in turn

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.438
tell us about what those expectations are

00:16:16.438 --> 00:16:18.081
that non-human animals have.

00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:19.355
And that comes back to those questions

00:16:19.355 --> 00:16:22.871
that I raised at the very
beginning for the baboon.

00:16:22.871 --> 00:16:24.522
Do they know the difference between

00:16:24.522 --> 00:16:26.132
animate and inanimate things?

00:16:26.132 --> 00:16:28.503
What cues do they use to tell
the difference between things

00:16:28.503 --> 00:16:32.794
that are alive and things
that aren't alive and so on.

00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:34.977
And of course these are some
of the exact same questions

00:16:34.977 --> 00:16:38.571
that developmental psychologists
are asking and studying.

00:16:38.571 --> 00:16:41.693
Children's understanding
of animosity and death.

00:16:41.693 --> 00:16:45.147
And it also links to the motivation behind

00:16:45.147 --> 00:16:49.490
comparative thanatology,
this recently emerged field,

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.581
that seeks evolutionary roots
to death related behavioral

00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:55.643
and psychological phenomena.

00:16:55.643 --> 00:16:57.661
So the idea is that by using information

00:16:57.661 --> 00:17:01.265
from species that are both
closely and distantly related

00:17:01.265 --> 00:17:03.947
to humans we can gain insight
into the evolutionary origins

00:17:03.947 --> 00:17:06.697
of our own responses to the dead.

00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:10.368
So and then returning to grief,

00:17:10.368 --> 00:17:12.673
although I think the adaptive value

00:17:12.673 --> 00:17:15.189
of grief is unclear to us.

00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:17.396
In other words it's not entirely clear

00:17:17.396 --> 00:17:19.192
what the function of grief is.

00:17:19.192 --> 00:17:23.797
It could be a signal to
attract support from others

00:17:23.797 --> 00:17:27.858
or simply it could be just a
by-product of the processes

00:17:27.858 --> 00:17:31.938
that maintain those strong
social bonds in the first place.

00:17:31.938 --> 00:17:35.195
And they linger even once that
individual has passed away,

00:17:35.195 --> 00:17:37.002
one of the individuals has passed away.

00:17:37.002 --> 00:17:41.441
But having said that,
there are among non-humans

00:17:41.441 --> 00:17:45.514
quantifiable behavioral
and hormonal responses

00:17:45.514 --> 00:17:47.659
that accompany the loss of an individual

00:17:47.659 --> 00:17:49.466
with a close social bond.

00:17:49.466 --> 00:17:51.662
So we see loss of appetite, loss of sleep,

00:17:51.662 --> 00:17:53.169
withdrawal from the social group,

00:17:53.169 --> 00:17:57.768
things like lethargy, and
even elevated stress hormones.

00:17:57.768 --> 00:18:01.502
And so given all of this,
I think I agree with

00:18:01.502 --> 00:18:03.954
Barbara King's perspective
here that it's possible

00:18:03.954 --> 00:18:07.904
to decouple grief from
the awareness of death.

00:18:07.904 --> 00:18:10.562
So you don't have to know what death is

00:18:10.562 --> 00:18:13.672
in order to be able to grieve.

00:18:13.672 --> 00:18:18.058
And then finally, that
brings us to this last point,

00:18:18.058 --> 00:18:20.145
which is that managing grief is something

00:18:20.145 --> 00:18:22.970
that we perhaps ought to
bear in mind explicitly

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.416
when devising management plans

00:18:24.416 --> 00:18:27.957
for dying zoo individuals or even pets.

00:18:27.957 --> 00:18:30.680
So in zoos dying animals
are often separated

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.979
from their normal social groups

00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:35.243
and pets that are about to be euthanized

00:18:35.243 --> 00:18:37.958
are also often separated
from their companions.

00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:41.325
But this can lead to
extended periods of searching

00:18:41.325 --> 00:18:43.696
and distress in those
companions that get left behind.

00:18:43.696 --> 00:18:45.775
So alternatives to these practices

00:18:45.775 --> 00:18:48.580
might be seen as more humane.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.465
So this here is the chimpanzee, Pansy,

00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:54.625
who was allowed to die in the
company of her social group

00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:57.659
at the Scotland zoo and
Jim Anderson and colleagues

00:18:57.659 --> 00:18:59.606
who've studied that particular case

00:18:59.606 --> 00:19:03.689
argue that this allowed
those others in the group

00:19:04.991 --> 00:19:06.702
that remained behind to gain a sense

00:19:06.702 --> 00:19:10.043
of the fact that Pansy wasn't coming back.

00:19:10.043 --> 00:19:12.125
So if we consider the
welfare of the animals

00:19:12.125 --> 00:19:14.379
that stay behind then I
think it may be better

00:19:14.379 --> 00:19:18.344
to allow death not to happen
kind of removed in space

00:19:18.344 --> 00:19:21.922
and out of sight, but
actually in the presence

00:19:21.922 --> 00:19:24.253
of the others with whom that individual

00:19:24.253 --> 00:19:26.503
shares a close social bond.

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:30.332
And that might prevent extended distress

00:19:30.332 --> 00:19:33.167
in these close affiliates
and also allow animals

00:19:33.167 --> 00:19:35.817
to learn about the dying process

00:19:35.817 --> 00:19:38.652
and about the finality of death.

00:19:38.652 --> 00:19:40.051
Thank you very much.

00:19:40.051 --> 00:19:43.218
(audience applauding)

00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:46.401
- Thanks very much for the opportunity

00:19:46.401 --> 00:19:49.027
to come and talk with you today.

00:19:49.027 --> 00:19:51.738
I'm gonna speak about
our work on how crows

00:19:51.738 --> 00:19:55.027
and other birds recognize
and respond to their dead.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.504
The message is fairly simple.

00:19:56.504 --> 00:19:58.175
From what we know at this point,

00:19:58.175 --> 00:20:01.932
I think that it mainly is an opportunity

00:20:01.932 --> 00:20:04.819
for them to learn about sources of death

00:20:04.819 --> 00:20:07.470
and places to avoid and perhaps

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.634
other objects in the environment to avoid.

00:20:09.634 --> 00:20:12.266
So I see it as a real arena for learning.

00:20:12.266 --> 00:20:13.645
Before I get into the crows,

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:16.141
I wanted to step back to the
mammals for just a second

00:20:16.141 --> 00:20:18.449
and relate quite an
interesting observation

00:20:18.449 --> 00:20:20.482
I had in Yellowstone National Park

00:20:20.482 --> 00:20:23.564
about four years ago to this day.

00:20:23.564 --> 00:20:26.113
And at this point we were
with a group of students

00:20:26.113 --> 00:20:28.878
looking at a wolf kill trying
to assess the landscape

00:20:28.878 --> 00:20:31.137
that might've contributed to this death.

00:20:31.137 --> 00:20:33.449
And it was an old female that had died,

00:20:33.449 --> 00:20:35.576
she'd been killed about two weeks earlier.

00:20:35.576 --> 00:20:39.701
And the death scene was one
of a large cleft boulder.

00:20:39.701 --> 00:20:41.029
The female had backed into that,

00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:44.745
it was a bison that had been
killed by a pack of wolves.

00:20:44.745 --> 00:20:46.935
And we were measuring the aspects

00:20:46.935 --> 00:20:49.809
of the terrain and the situation.

00:20:49.809 --> 00:20:52.755
There was a lot of still
bloodstained on the rock

00:20:52.755 --> 00:20:56.449
and the bones of the dead
female bison on the ground.

00:20:56.449 --> 00:20:57.769
And as we were busying ourselves,

00:20:57.769 --> 00:21:01.268
we heard a roar of hooves
come over the ridge

00:21:01.268 --> 00:21:03.657
and a whole herd of
about three dozen bison

00:21:03.657 --> 00:21:06.033
displaced us from that scene.

00:21:06.033 --> 00:21:08.830
And we felt pretty bad
for having been there

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.413
and interrupted this situation.

00:21:12.655 --> 00:21:14.283
But the thing that was impressive

00:21:14.283 --> 00:21:17.112
was that these bison
after they pushed us away,

00:21:17.112 --> 00:21:19.013
they all smelled the
bones much as we heard

00:21:19.013 --> 00:21:21.810
with other mammals and
then each one individually

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.964
walked through this cleft in the rock,

00:21:23.964 --> 00:21:25.777
right where the female had been killed,

00:21:25.777 --> 00:21:27.993
and passed through and
then went on their way.

00:21:27.993 --> 00:21:30.598
They were there for
about an hour in total.

00:21:30.598 --> 00:21:32.105
And that's very different than we see

00:21:32.105 --> 00:21:36.486
with the response to when
a crow finds a dead animal.

00:21:36.486 --> 00:21:40.880
So what you see in this video
are the responses of crows

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.450
to finding a dead bird that
we placed on the ground

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.367
right below that telephone pole.

00:21:46.367 --> 00:21:48.591
They come in, they're
very noisy, they gather.

00:21:48.591 --> 00:21:51.803
And they might last for 15 or 20 minutes

00:21:51.803 --> 00:21:54.121
before they move on out of the area.

00:21:54.121 --> 00:21:56.240
And this is a widespread
response that's been seen

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.791
in other members of this
family, the Corvidae,

00:21:59.791 --> 00:22:02.485
that includes things like magpies,

00:22:02.485 --> 00:22:04.197
which have been seen to even bring

00:22:04.197 --> 00:22:07.313
tufts of grass into a dead magpie.

00:22:07.313 --> 00:22:08.232
Or a scrub jays.

00:22:08.232 --> 00:22:09.629
There's been a lot of work on scrub jays

00:22:09.629 --> 00:22:11.923
just north of us here.

00:22:11.923 --> 00:22:15.933
And also ravens gathering around the dead.

00:22:15.933 --> 00:22:18.416
So let me introduce you to
this family of birds briefly.

00:22:18.416 --> 00:22:20.390
They're birds that are
familiar to most of us.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.102
They live close by with us.

00:22:22.102 --> 00:22:24.443
They include the ravens and crows,

00:22:24.443 --> 00:22:26.693
magpies, jays, nutcrackers.

00:22:27.726 --> 00:22:30.460
And they live around the world

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.909
in all the continents except Antarctica.

00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:34.904
And almost all of these species have had

00:22:34.904 --> 00:22:37.710
some sort of interaction as I described

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.826
with the crows to finding the dead.

00:22:40.826 --> 00:22:42.739
So some aspects of this group.

00:22:42.739 --> 00:22:43.840
They're long lived.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.970
They're typically social.

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:48.003
They have long lasting
partnerships with their mates

00:22:48.003 --> 00:22:51.394
and sometimes extended family groups.

00:22:51.394 --> 00:22:54.351
They have rather large
brains for their body size.

00:22:54.351 --> 00:22:57.849
On this graph, these show the
average relationships between

00:22:57.849 --> 00:23:02.016
body size on the x-axis and
brain size on the y-axis.

00:23:03.571 --> 00:23:07.451
For things like fish, and
here's the average bird line.

00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:10.174
And then you'll see that the
dots for the various corvids

00:23:10.174 --> 00:23:13.008
are well above the bird line,
more on the mammal line.

00:23:13.008 --> 00:23:15.275
And even some like the
American crow that I study,

00:23:15.275 --> 00:23:16.770
right on the primate line.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.245
So these are really more
like small flying monkeys

00:23:19.245 --> 00:23:21.103
than they are birds.

00:23:21.103 --> 00:23:23.342
Their brains are quite complex.

00:23:23.342 --> 00:23:25.388
We know now in the last several decades

00:23:25.388 --> 00:23:27.137
that they include places in the brain

00:23:27.137 --> 00:23:30.672
that are analogous and
also homologous to ours.

00:23:30.672 --> 00:23:34.312
For example the hippocampus
is a homologous structure.

00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:39.308
And the amygdala is at least
an analogous structure.

00:23:39.308 --> 00:23:43.107
They have a large forebrain,
all this area here.

00:23:43.107 --> 00:23:44.921
There's a striatum, but a large forebrain

00:23:44.921 --> 00:23:48.126
where more complex sorts
of sensory information

00:23:48.126 --> 00:23:49.931
might be combined and considered.

00:23:49.931 --> 00:23:52.290
And they have important connections

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:55.457
between the forebrain and the thalamus

00:23:56.913 --> 00:23:59.727
back up to the forebrain
that allows these animals

00:23:59.727 --> 00:24:01.504
to reconsider actions and shape them

00:24:01.504 --> 00:24:05.174
before they act upon
those, that information.

00:24:05.174 --> 00:24:08.181
So the typical response is
to get some information in,

00:24:08.181 --> 00:24:11.057
maybe from the eye, process
it in the forebrain,

00:24:11.057 --> 00:24:13.968
and send a response down the spinal cord

00:24:13.968 --> 00:24:15.781
to the muscles to do something.

00:24:15.781 --> 00:24:17.244
But they don't have to always do that

00:24:17.244 --> 00:24:19.728
because of a connection
here that allows that

00:24:19.728 --> 00:24:23.278
information to go back to the
forebrain and be adjusted.

00:24:23.278 --> 00:24:26.746
That's how they, for example,
learn different vocalizations.

00:24:26.746 --> 00:24:28.853
So with an animal like that, long lived,

00:24:28.853 --> 00:24:31.853
social and quite cognitively nimble,

00:24:33.563 --> 00:24:35.756
there are many reasons why
they might attend their dead

00:24:35.756 --> 00:24:38.859
as we discussed just
with Dora's presentation.

00:24:38.859 --> 00:24:41.132
So they may be looking
at a social opportunity,

00:24:41.132 --> 00:24:44.579
a vacant territory, a
potential mate, for example.

00:24:44.579 --> 00:24:47.088
They may be looking to learn about danger.

00:24:47.088 --> 00:24:51.135
They may be looking at
other aspects of that scene

00:24:51.135 --> 00:24:53.447
to learn what caused the death,

00:24:53.447 --> 00:24:56.315
what sort of expectation in the future

00:24:56.315 --> 00:25:00.332
that area may hold for
danger and things like that.

00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:02.572
They may also be grieving and mourning

00:25:02.572 --> 00:25:04.774
a loss to member of their family.

00:25:04.774 --> 00:25:07.476
Or as I said, since these
animals mate for life,

00:25:07.476 --> 00:25:09.309
they might've been with
this same individual

00:25:09.309 --> 00:25:11.855
that's dead now for 20 or 30 years

00:25:11.855 --> 00:25:13.569
and might have a profound relationship

00:25:13.569 --> 00:25:17.509
and interaction with that
animal after it's lost.

00:25:17.509 --> 00:25:19.144
So we have tried to investigate

00:25:19.144 --> 00:25:22.362
this response by doing experiments.

00:25:22.362 --> 00:25:24.792
And what we do is we basically prepare

00:25:24.792 --> 00:25:27.756
taxidermy mounts of individual crows

00:25:27.756 --> 00:25:31.168
and have them in kind of a dead status

00:25:31.168 --> 00:25:33.240
and then we place those
out and see the response

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.740
of wild birds to those mounts.

00:25:37.112 --> 00:25:39.686
And this is a general
description based on what we do.

00:25:39.686 --> 00:25:41.606
There's some sort of a conditioning phase

00:25:41.606 --> 00:25:44.320
where we get animals used
to coming to an area.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.673
Then we present them with some stimulus.

00:25:47.673 --> 00:25:50.527
That could be a dead crow
or a hawk for example,

00:25:50.527 --> 00:25:52.104
just to see the response.

00:25:52.104 --> 00:25:53.361
And then we measure their response

00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:55.212
after they've encountered that.

00:25:55.212 --> 00:25:57.621
And during this time we've
been feeding them at a spot

00:25:57.621 --> 00:25:59.358
so we know they reliably come in,

00:25:59.358 --> 00:26:01.536
they're using that spot to gain food.

00:26:01.536 --> 00:26:03.662
And we can look for a
change in their behavior.

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:06.329
Maybe how long it takes for
them to approach that food

00:26:06.329 --> 00:26:08.715
after they've seen a dead bird there.

00:26:08.715 --> 00:26:10.586
So what we found, and
this is work I should say

00:26:10.586 --> 00:26:13.339
that my Ph.D. student, Kaeli Swift,

00:26:13.339 --> 00:26:14.518
and I have been engaged in

00:26:14.518 --> 00:26:16.719
and Kaeli's continuing this work now,

00:26:16.719 --> 00:26:18.170
but these are some of the early findings

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.405
that she discovered.

00:26:20.405 --> 00:26:23.475
First off in terms of
how many gatherings occur

00:26:23.475 --> 00:26:28.182
around these dead crows,
about 60% of all the crows

00:26:28.182 --> 00:26:31.299
we put out had a large
mob form around them.

00:26:31.299 --> 00:26:33.023
And that's similar to what you would see

00:26:33.023 --> 00:26:36.337
if a hawk was present,
which is a known danger.

00:26:36.337 --> 00:26:38.604
And it's not as often as you would see

00:26:38.604 --> 00:26:41.195
if a hawk had a dead crow
in its grip for example.

00:26:41.195 --> 00:26:43.979
That's almost always elicits
this sort of response.

00:26:43.979 --> 00:26:47.974
So from this comparing to
more controlled situations

00:26:47.974 --> 00:26:50.416
where just a person is there feeding

00:26:50.416 --> 00:26:53.661
or just food is provided,
suggests that this is

00:26:53.661 --> 00:26:56.284
some sort of response to danger for sure.

00:26:56.284 --> 00:26:59.300
And we know that the individuals
are learning something

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.549
about being in this dangerous place

00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:05.057
because their approach to
the food is quite different

00:27:05.057 --> 00:27:08.600
after a danger has been
seen versus not been seen.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.468
So here you just see the amount of time

00:27:11.468 --> 00:27:14.443
pre and post exposure to a stimulus.

00:27:14.443 --> 00:27:17.502
In this case the stimulus
is just food or a person,

00:27:17.502 --> 00:27:19.274
nothing dangerous, no difference.

00:27:19.274 --> 00:27:22.572
And if the stimulus is
a hawk or a dead crow,

00:27:22.572 --> 00:27:26.516
much longer time to approach
that food after seeing that.

00:27:26.516 --> 00:27:29.481
And this kind of narrows that response

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:32.233
'cause actually in some
cases the birds refused

00:27:32.233 --> 00:27:35.394
to come down to food in a
place they had seen a dead crow

00:27:35.394 --> 00:27:37.840
for up to six to eight weeks.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.432
And this is different also depending upon

00:27:40.432 --> 00:27:42.942
whether it's a crow or
a pigeon that they see,

00:27:42.942 --> 00:27:45.282
so they're very sensitive
to the type of stimulus.

00:27:45.282 --> 00:27:48.650
They avoid places after
seeing a dead crow,

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:50.566
even though they had been
feeding there before.

00:27:50.566 --> 00:27:52.486
But if a dead pigeon is placed there,

00:27:52.486 --> 00:27:55.441
there's no real response, no difference.

00:27:55.441 --> 00:27:59.192
And also crows do this
and not all birds do this.

00:27:59.192 --> 00:28:01.477
So we just controlled this
by looking at the response

00:28:01.477 --> 00:28:05.850
of pigeons as well as crows
to this sort of presentation.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.024
And when pigeons see a
place they've been fed at

00:28:09.024 --> 00:28:10.739
that now has a dead pigeon at it,

00:28:10.739 --> 00:28:12.408
they continue to feed there afterwards

00:28:12.408 --> 00:28:14.569
like nothing had happened.

00:28:14.569 --> 00:28:16.779
I suspect turkeys, we've been
seeing some turkey videos

00:28:16.779 --> 00:28:19.646
of turkeys walking around a dead cat today

00:28:19.646 --> 00:28:22.468
and I suspect they act like
pigeons in this respect.

00:28:22.468 --> 00:28:24.900
But crows clearly increase their hesitancy

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.786
to approach a spot after they've
seen a dead animal there.

00:28:29.786 --> 00:28:32.493
And this is a pretty
nuanced response as well.

00:28:32.493 --> 00:28:35.942
So what we see in this
graph is that the response

00:28:35.942 --> 00:28:39.101
to an adult crow that's
dead versus a juvenile crow

00:28:39.101 --> 00:28:42.140
that's dead over here is different.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:46.593
And that's especially different
during the breeding season.

00:28:46.593 --> 00:28:49.077
So when you find a dead juvenile crow

00:28:49.077 --> 00:28:52.907
in the breeding season, which
is a fairly common response,

00:28:52.907 --> 00:28:55.383
lot of young birds die, birds,

00:28:55.383 --> 00:28:57.282
the adult crows and
other crows in the area

00:28:57.282 --> 00:28:58.802
don't pay much attention to that.

00:28:58.802 --> 00:29:02.886
They only scold and form a
mob about a third of the time.

00:29:02.886 --> 00:29:04.297
Likewise during the breeding season

00:29:04.297 --> 00:29:07.655
if an adult is found, scolding
and mobbing is not as common

00:29:07.655 --> 00:29:10.555
as it is during the non-breeding season.

00:29:10.555 --> 00:29:14.115
So this sort of nuanced
response to me suggests

00:29:14.115 --> 00:29:16.679
that this sort of behavior is triggered

00:29:16.679 --> 00:29:20.096
more by an ecological or more of a social

00:29:22.143 --> 00:29:24.626
or ecological factor than
it is perhaps something

00:29:24.626 --> 00:29:28.747
like grieving or mourning
the loss of this individual.

00:29:28.747 --> 00:29:31.161
In fact, I would expect the exact opposite

00:29:31.161 --> 00:29:33.925
if they were really
considering, for example,

00:29:33.925 --> 00:29:35.860
a lost young bird of their own,

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.091
their sibling or their
offspring or their mate,

00:29:39.091 --> 00:29:41.551
you would expect those responses
to be especially strong

00:29:41.551 --> 00:29:43.607
during the breeding season, for example,

00:29:43.607 --> 00:29:46.940
and especially strong among adult birds.

00:29:48.415 --> 00:29:51.234
So we have tried to
understand where in the brain

00:29:51.234 --> 00:29:54.250
the crow is processing this information.

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.035
And using that to help
explain a little bit more

00:29:57.035 --> 00:30:00.104
about why they're doing
this sort of thing.

00:30:00.104 --> 00:30:02.539
And let me explain our procedure to you

00:30:02.539 --> 00:30:04.001
a little bit here in this slide.

00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:06.873
We're doing PET imaging of live crows

00:30:06.873 --> 00:30:10.221
as they view various sorts
of dangerous stimuli.

00:30:10.221 --> 00:30:12.864
A hawk, a person that
had just captured them

00:30:12.864 --> 00:30:16.153
or a person holding a
dead crow for example.

00:30:16.153 --> 00:30:18.802
And what we do, shown up here at the top,

00:30:18.802 --> 00:30:22.005
is we capture our birds in the wild.

00:30:22.005 --> 00:30:23.591
We wear a mask when we capture them

00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:25.966
so that they learn a particular face

00:30:25.966 --> 00:30:28.048
associated with that dangerous experience

00:30:28.048 --> 00:30:30.174
being captured in the wild.

00:30:30.174 --> 00:30:32.872
We capture them with a net
gun that goes off with a blast

00:30:32.872 --> 00:30:34.044
and pins them to the ground,

00:30:34.044 --> 00:30:36.630
it's a pretty scary thing for a bird.

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.099
And we don't want them
to associate that with us

00:30:39.099 --> 00:30:41.340
when we see them later and
we want to be able to have

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.277
anybody take on the role
of that dangerous person

00:30:44.277 --> 00:30:45.683
by putting on this mask.

00:30:45.683 --> 00:30:48.563
So we wear a mask when we catch them.

00:30:48.563 --> 00:30:50.268
We then bring the birds into captivity

00:30:50.268 --> 00:30:52.413
and care for them
wearing a different mask.

00:30:52.413 --> 00:30:55.969
So we have one person that's
good here caring for the birds

00:30:55.969 --> 00:30:58.843
and one person that's bad
that has captured the bird.

00:30:58.843 --> 00:31:01.408
And we keep the birds for about a month.

00:31:01.408 --> 00:31:04.684
And during this time we bring
them into a smaller cage

00:31:04.684 --> 00:31:07.868
shown in the middle diagram here

00:31:07.868 --> 00:31:10.443
where they are acclimated overnight

00:31:10.443 --> 00:31:13.973
and then the next morning we
perform a procedure upon them.

00:31:13.973 --> 00:31:16.476
And that procedure is
simply to catch the bird

00:31:16.476 --> 00:31:20.393
out of the cage, inject
it with a glucose mimic

00:31:22.123 --> 00:31:25.755
that we use as a tracer to
indicate where synaptic activity,

00:31:25.755 --> 00:31:29.090
where nerve cells are
actively communicating

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:33.847
with one another and we then
put them back in that cage

00:31:33.847 --> 00:31:37.710
after they've been given the
shot of glucose in their belly.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.471
And then we show them something.

00:31:39.471 --> 00:31:42.429
We let them while they're
awake look out and observe

00:31:42.429 --> 00:31:45.570
perhaps just a person in the
room that they never seen.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.572
They could observe the
person that caught them

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:49.151
or the person that cared for them

00:31:49.151 --> 00:31:53.318
or a person holding a dead crow
or a hawk or nothing at all.

00:31:54.175 --> 00:31:56.723
And then during that 20 minutes or so

00:31:56.723 --> 00:31:59.661
we continue to let them
see that person on and off.

00:31:59.661 --> 00:32:01.793
And we then anesthetize them.

00:32:01.793 --> 00:32:04.974
And this tracer with the PET
imaging allows us to basically

00:32:04.974 --> 00:32:07.309
step back in time while
they're anesthetized

00:32:07.309 --> 00:32:11.134
and see where in the brain
that tracer has accumulated

00:32:11.134 --> 00:32:12.918
during the time when they
were actually looking

00:32:12.918 --> 00:32:15.145
at that stimulus we gave them.

00:32:15.145 --> 00:32:17.902
So this way we can keep
them still, get a nice image

00:32:17.902 --> 00:32:20.361
and see what's going on in their brain.

00:32:20.361 --> 00:32:23.093
Then wake them up, let 'em rest for a day.

00:32:23.093 --> 00:32:25.424
Let the tracer, the
radioactive tracer clear

00:32:25.424 --> 00:32:28.035
and they can be released back to the wild.

00:32:28.035 --> 00:32:30.065
So for example, here's
what a crow would see

00:32:30.065 --> 00:32:33.438
if it was sitting in our cage metabolizing

00:32:33.438 --> 00:32:36.177
that glucose we gave it and
looking out and seeing a person

00:32:36.177 --> 00:32:39.253
it had never seen before
holding a dead crow.

00:32:39.253 --> 00:32:41.733
The images we get of
their brain are striking.

00:32:41.733 --> 00:32:43.820
They show relative activity

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.183
by how bright the areas are here.

00:32:46.183 --> 00:32:50.350
This is the glucose fluorescing
basically in the tomography.

00:32:51.605 --> 00:32:54.273
And what you see here are bright
spots on either hemisphere

00:32:54.273 --> 00:32:57.038
of the brain which are the
entopallium of the bird,

00:32:57.038 --> 00:33:00.324
that's the visual processing
center of a bird's brain

00:33:00.324 --> 00:33:04.059
assessing information coming
from the two eyes here.

00:33:04.059 --> 00:33:05.355
I'm gonna show you a set of graphs

00:33:05.355 --> 00:33:06.855
that looks somewhat like this figures

00:33:06.855 --> 00:33:10.661
that basically show MRIs in
gray to show you the structure

00:33:10.661 --> 00:33:13.420
of the bird's brain and
then the red areas indicate

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.495
what parts of the brain
were most activated

00:33:15.495 --> 00:33:18.337
in a given set of birds that saw one thing

00:33:18.337 --> 00:33:21.292
versus a set of birds that
saw something quite different.

00:33:21.292 --> 00:33:23.317
And in this case, this
shows the part of the brain,

00:33:23.317 --> 00:33:25.937
and this is the front
part of the bird's brain,

00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:28.117
that's activated when they
saw a person in the room

00:33:28.117 --> 00:33:29.979
versus nobody else in the room.

00:33:29.979 --> 00:33:32.054
So any kind of person in this case.

00:33:32.054 --> 00:33:34.761
There's a lot of higher order processing

00:33:34.761 --> 00:33:37.376
occurring in the forebrain of these birds

00:33:37.376 --> 00:33:40.422
as they consider that person
and also in the striatum

00:33:40.422 --> 00:33:43.021
as they possibly are making
connections between that person

00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:45.707
and something that it had previously done.

00:33:45.707 --> 00:33:48.294
Now if we look at them
in response to basically

00:33:48.294 --> 00:33:50.190
how they see particular people,

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:52.392
what we have on the top panel here

00:33:52.392 --> 00:33:54.941
is the response of birds
when they looked out

00:33:54.941 --> 00:33:58.305
and they saw the person that
had previously captured them,

00:33:58.305 --> 00:33:59.782
so a dangerous person.

00:33:59.782 --> 00:34:01.800
And they're recalling at this point

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.805
something about that person.

00:34:03.805 --> 00:34:05.662
They already know that he was dangerous

00:34:05.662 --> 00:34:07.883
and now what we see activated most clearly

00:34:07.883 --> 00:34:09.472
in addition to that frontal area

00:34:09.472 --> 00:34:12.065
that I showed previously
is their amygdala.

00:34:12.065 --> 00:34:15.091
So they're basically responding
like other vertebrates do

00:34:15.091 --> 00:34:17.450
with a strong response
on the right hemisphere

00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:20.946
of their brain, in the
amygdala region that indicates

00:34:20.946 --> 00:34:23.438
they're responding to a known danger,

00:34:23.438 --> 00:34:25.993
a learned danger I should say.

00:34:25.993 --> 00:34:27.635
In contrast when they see a person

00:34:27.635 --> 00:34:29.333
that they've never seen before

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:31.689
and they're learning about
that person's behavior

00:34:31.689 --> 00:34:33.768
because it's holding a dead crow,

00:34:33.768 --> 00:34:35.520
what is activated most strongly

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.358
is the hippocampus in the bird.

00:34:37.358 --> 00:34:39.848
So what we interpret is going on here

00:34:39.848 --> 00:34:42.320
is that these birds are
acquiring information,

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.114
they're learning about
this dangerous person

00:34:45.114 --> 00:34:47.975
by its association with a
dead crow, and in this case,

00:34:47.975 --> 00:34:51.422
they're recalling
something already learned.

00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:54.150
We know something about the
way information proceeds

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.664
from the eyes up to the bird's brain.

00:34:56.664 --> 00:34:59.717
And I just show you this
diagram to point out

00:34:59.717 --> 00:35:03.368
the complexity with which
this information travels

00:35:03.368 --> 00:35:06.223
from the retina up
through the basal ganglia

00:35:06.223 --> 00:35:07.972
and into the forebrain.

00:35:07.972 --> 00:35:10.548
And it's a rather simple picture actually

00:35:10.548 --> 00:35:13.522
when they're looking at a
person that they've learned

00:35:13.522 --> 00:35:17.748
to be threatening as
compared to the situation

00:35:17.748 --> 00:35:19.822
when they're first
assessing somebody that's

00:35:19.822 --> 00:35:24.023
potentially dangerous by, in
fact, holding this dead crow.

00:35:24.023 --> 00:35:27.025
So here the hippocampus is
involved as well as the forebrain

00:35:27.025 --> 00:35:29.023
and the visual processing centers.

00:35:29.023 --> 00:35:30.945
And in this case it's mainly the forebrain

00:35:30.945 --> 00:35:34.515
and the visual processing
centers interacting.

00:35:34.515 --> 00:35:38.054
So all of these field experiments
and laboratory experiments

00:35:38.054 --> 00:35:40.605
basically point me to one conclusion.

00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:43.337
When we show a crow a dead crow

00:35:43.337 --> 00:35:46.186
that's not a familiar individual,

00:35:46.186 --> 00:35:49.928
that they're responding and
learning about that situation.

00:35:49.928 --> 00:35:51.753
Perhaps the person associated with it

00:35:51.753 --> 00:35:54.312
or the place associated with that death.

00:35:54.312 --> 00:35:57.444
Quite clear I think in this respect to me.

00:35:57.444 --> 00:35:58.734
But what else could we be missing?

00:35:58.734 --> 00:36:01.460
And to me this is the more
interesting part of the work

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:05.542
that we basically, I can
only tell you, I don't know.

00:36:05.542 --> 00:36:07.623
But I hope to find out at some point.

00:36:07.623 --> 00:36:11.173
But this is a pair of ravens
interacting with one another.

00:36:11.173 --> 00:36:13.181
They form very close relationships.

00:36:13.181 --> 00:36:15.997
And surely I would guess,
we would see differences

00:36:15.997 --> 00:36:19.745
in the brain activity of a
bird after it had lost its mate

00:36:19.745 --> 00:36:22.172
than if it just encounters a dead bird

00:36:22.172 --> 00:36:24.471
that it doesn't know personally.

00:36:24.471 --> 00:36:25.978
But we haven't done that experiment.

00:36:25.978 --> 00:36:27.444
It's something that could be done,

00:36:27.444 --> 00:36:30.194
but ethically is difficult to do.

00:36:31.054 --> 00:36:33.072
There are other things
that suggest there may be

00:36:33.072 --> 00:36:36.341
a lot more going on than
just learning about a site.

00:36:36.341 --> 00:36:39.072
And these are more anecdotal observations.

00:36:39.072 --> 00:36:42.220
I mentioned earlier that when
magpies come into their dead,

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.374
they've been observed to carry grass.

00:36:44.374 --> 00:36:46.028
And maybe that's just the nesting material

00:36:46.028 --> 00:36:48.607
that they were carrying
when they encountered that

00:36:48.607 --> 00:36:50.913
or maybe it was something more purposeful.

00:36:50.913 --> 00:36:54.214
So for example, in crows
this picture shows one

00:36:54.214 --> 00:36:57.029
that was found that was
surrounded by these sticks.

00:36:57.029 --> 00:36:59.067
There were no trees around,
there was nothing where

00:36:59.067 --> 00:37:02.075
these sticks could've just
been there incidentally.

00:37:02.075 --> 00:37:05.911
Maybe a human put them
there or perhaps the crow

00:37:05.911 --> 00:37:08.797
had come in and put those
sticks around this dead crow.

00:37:08.797 --> 00:37:10.457
We don't know, but have
several observations

00:37:10.457 --> 00:37:11.926
like this from people.

00:37:11.926 --> 00:37:15.517
And then finally, just a week ago,

00:37:15.517 --> 00:37:17.358
a woman sent me this image which she took

00:37:17.358 --> 00:37:20.455
on the Michigan State University campus.

00:37:20.455 --> 00:37:22.433
And what you see here is a crow

00:37:22.433 --> 00:37:24.642
that is looking at a dead crow.

00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:27.642
The dead crow is only recently died.

00:37:28.569 --> 00:37:30.206
The woman suggested it might've hit

00:37:30.206 --> 00:37:32.240
a window or something by the looks of it.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.995
And this bird flew in, totally silent,

00:37:34.995 --> 00:37:37.268
brought this piece of tinfoil in its bill

00:37:37.268 --> 00:37:39.692
and set it down in front of the dead crow.

00:37:39.692 --> 00:37:43.021
And it stood there for
20 minutes watching this.

00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:45.610
I have no idea if these are a mated pair

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:48.033
or if again, this was anything
other than incidental,

00:37:48.033 --> 00:37:50.099
but it's curious to me
that they didn't scold,

00:37:50.099 --> 00:37:52.826
this bird didn't scold and
didn't attract a crowd in

00:37:52.826 --> 00:37:54.629
like we regularly see.

00:37:54.629 --> 00:37:57.176
So I think there's much more
going on here than we know

00:37:57.176 --> 00:37:59.476
and it will take much more
sophisticated experiments

00:37:59.476 --> 00:38:03.643
to get at them, which hopefully
we'll do in the future.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.750
With that I would thank you
very much for your attention.

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:11.409
(audience applauding)

00:38:11.409 --> 00:38:15.244
- So I'm also very grateful
for this invitation.

00:38:15.244 --> 00:38:17.431
I think, I haven't been this excited

00:38:17.431 --> 00:38:19.608
about death for a long time.

00:38:19.608 --> 00:38:22.884
(audience laughing)

00:38:22.884 --> 00:38:27.436
So just to set the context
of my talk a little bit,

00:38:27.436 --> 00:38:32.216
you'll remember when Dora
presented the baboon slides

00:38:32.216 --> 00:38:36.783
and the various questions that
we might ask of those baboons

00:38:36.783 --> 00:38:39.578
with respect to their
understanding of death.

00:38:39.578 --> 00:38:42.336
What I'll be telling you
I think in part today

00:38:42.336 --> 00:38:44.772
is that the answer to
many of those questions

00:38:44.772 --> 00:38:47.091
with respect to children
at a fairly young age

00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:50.621
is yes, that they have an understanding.

00:38:50.621 --> 00:38:54.788
But then I'll go on to say more
about how that understanding

00:38:55.727 --> 00:38:59.894
might be displaced or amplified
by the notions of afterlife

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:06.017
or religion that that particular
culture presents to them.

00:39:07.764 --> 00:39:11.226
So that's the gist of the presentation.

00:39:11.226 --> 00:39:12.975
Some acknowledgements here.

00:39:12.975 --> 00:39:14.570
My good colleague, Rita Astuti,

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:18.123
whom you'll be hearing
more from this afternoon.

00:39:18.123 --> 00:39:21.427
Marta Gimenez with whom I
did some research in Spain.

00:39:21.427 --> 00:39:24.489
Three colleagues at the
University of Texas.

00:39:24.489 --> 00:39:25.322
I'll mention them later

00:39:25.322 --> 00:39:29.343
when I talk about some work in Vanuatu.

00:39:29.343 --> 00:39:33.010
So, as I've said,
children probably acquire,

00:39:35.432 --> 00:39:39.676
and certainly by the age of
seven or eight have acquired,

00:39:39.676 --> 00:39:43.919
what we might think of as a
biological theory of death.

00:39:43.919 --> 00:39:47.850
That's to say they seem
to understand that death

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:51.781
is a terminal point for all
mental and bodily processes.

00:39:51.781 --> 00:39:54.783
And indeed children of this
age, seven, eight, nine,

00:39:54.783 --> 00:39:58.129
it varies a little bit
from child to child,

00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:01.319
also seem to understand
the universality of death,

00:40:01.319 --> 00:40:05.486
that it applies to everybody,
that it's irreversible.

00:40:06.641 --> 00:40:08.339
And it's also true that they understand

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:11.327
something of the mechanics of death.

00:40:11.327 --> 00:40:14.744
That's to say that the body is a machine.

00:40:15.905 --> 00:40:19.168
That there are various
parts, invisible parts,

00:40:19.168 --> 00:40:23.636
lungs, heart and so forth,
which have to be coordinated,

00:40:23.636 --> 00:40:26.126
and when those parts break down,

00:40:26.126 --> 00:40:30.293
then death is inevitable
with various consequences.

00:40:31.394 --> 00:40:34.811
At the same time, children will encounter

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:39.173
a religious account or
a supernatural account

00:40:39.173 --> 00:40:40.411
and part of what I want to discuss

00:40:40.411 --> 00:40:42.426
as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:40:42.426 --> 00:40:44.967
is the relationship in the child's mind

00:40:44.967 --> 00:40:47.459
between these two different accounts.

00:40:47.459 --> 00:40:51.184
So in order to explore that question

00:40:51.184 --> 00:40:55.086
of the relationship
between the two accounts,

00:40:55.086 --> 00:40:59.100
we, that's to say myself
and Marta Gimenez,

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.183
tested children of five years of age,

00:41:03.138 --> 00:41:08.089
sorry, seven years of age
and 11 years of age in Spain.

00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:10.617
I mention Spain advisedly in some sense

00:41:10.617 --> 00:41:12.378
because of course these
children were therefore

00:41:12.378 --> 00:41:15.872
growing up in a particular
religious culture.

00:41:15.872 --> 00:41:19.789
The children were not
just quizzed about their,

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:25.221
as it were, immediate or
biological conception of death,

00:41:25.221 --> 00:41:29.388
but we tried to prompt their
religious conception as well.

00:41:30.329 --> 00:41:32.358
And we did this therefore in the context

00:41:32.358 --> 00:41:34.441
of two different stories.

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:38.825
One about the death of a grandparent

00:41:38.825 --> 00:41:41.390
and at the end of the story,

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:44.557
the grandchild is visited by a doctor.

00:41:45.801 --> 00:41:48.808
And the other also about
the death of a grandparent,

00:41:48.808 --> 00:41:52.936
but in this story, the
grandchild who's lost

00:41:52.936 --> 00:41:55.886
their grandparent is visited by a priest.

00:41:55.886 --> 00:41:59.422
So I'll just show you those two stories.

00:41:59.422 --> 00:42:01.941
As you can see toward the end here,

00:42:01.941 --> 00:42:05.609
"The doctor came to talk to
Juan about what had happened.

00:42:05.609 --> 00:42:08.838
And, "He said to Juan, 'Your
grandfather is dead now.'"

00:42:08.838 --> 00:42:12.752
You can see that there
is no hint in this story

00:42:12.752 --> 00:42:16.669
of an afterlife or there
are no religious cues.

00:42:17.923 --> 00:42:21.553
The second story, the priest
story, is fairly similar,

00:42:21.553 --> 00:42:25.572
thus to say death of a
grandparent who's been ill,

00:42:25.572 --> 00:42:26.962
goes to the hospital.

00:42:26.962 --> 00:42:29.498
But as you can see at
the end of the story,

00:42:29.498 --> 00:42:33.149
Marta, the protagonist,
is visited by a priest

00:42:33.149 --> 00:42:37.184
rather than by a doctor who
explains what has happened.

00:42:37.184 --> 00:42:39.934
And puts to Marta the claim that,

00:42:40.831 --> 00:42:42.823
"Your grandmother is now with God."

00:42:42.823 --> 00:42:47.653
So each child listened
to both of these stories.

00:42:47.653 --> 00:42:50.903
And after each story we would ask about

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.943
the functioning of various processes.

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:01.539
Sometimes we asked about
bodily processes, for example,

00:43:01.539 --> 00:43:03.377
"Have his eyes stopped working?"

00:43:03.377 --> 00:43:07.078
And sometimes we asked
about mental processes,

00:43:07.078 --> 00:43:08.700
"Can he still see?"

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.742
And as in this case, we
tried to choose pairings,

00:43:11.742 --> 00:43:15.531
that's to say where we would
focus in on a bodily organ

00:43:15.531 --> 00:43:19.186
and an accompanying mental process.

00:43:19.186 --> 00:43:20.141
We couldn't always do that,

00:43:20.141 --> 00:43:23.680
but roughly speaking, that was our goal.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:27.847
So ultimately the children
answered about 14 questions,

00:43:29.617 --> 00:43:31.913
seven about functioning of the body,

00:43:31.913 --> 00:43:35.111
seven about the functioning of the mind.

00:43:35.111 --> 00:43:36.666
The children gave their reply.

00:43:36.666 --> 00:43:40.456
They would either say this
process was continuing or not.

00:43:40.456 --> 00:43:43.403
And then we would ask them
to offer an explanation

00:43:43.403 --> 00:43:46.403
of why it had stopped or conversely,

00:43:47.527 --> 00:43:50.704
why the process was continuing.

00:43:50.704 --> 00:43:55.692
And we found that we could
allocate children's answers to

00:43:55.692 --> 00:44:00.371
three different categories,
religious, biological,

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:03.064
and a more equivocal set of replies.

00:44:03.064 --> 00:44:05.766
So let's just present the way in which

00:44:05.766 --> 00:44:09.227
we scored children for
each of those categories.

00:44:09.227 --> 00:44:12.270
So religious answers, well in this case,

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:15.252
the child would claim that
a given process continues,

00:44:15.252 --> 00:44:18.081
so yes, he can still see.

00:44:18.081 --> 00:44:21.603
And then they, when we'd
say, "Well, how is that?"

00:44:21.603 --> 00:44:24.633
They would supply a religious explanation.

00:44:24.633 --> 00:44:28.073
"In Heaven everything can
work even if she is dead."

00:44:28.073 --> 00:44:30.020
"The soul keeps working," and so forth.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.520
So you can see very clearly in these cases

00:44:34.436 --> 00:44:37.032
references to religious notions,

00:44:37.032 --> 00:44:39.582
heaven to soul and so forth.

00:44:39.582 --> 00:44:42.593
Now if we turn to the biological answers,

00:44:42.593 --> 00:44:45.360
here the child claims that
the process has stopped.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.593
And as you can see,

00:44:46.593 --> 00:44:49.804
they're pretty blunt
about why it's stopped.

00:44:49.804 --> 00:44:52.620
"He's been eaten by worms, he has no body.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.755
"He's just bones."

00:44:53.755 --> 00:44:55.739
"If he's dead, nothing can work."

00:44:55.739 --> 00:44:59.354
And then finally, no credit answers.

00:44:59.354 --> 00:45:02.161
These were replies where the child either

00:45:02.161 --> 00:45:05.903
didn't offer an explanation
or if they did so,

00:45:05.903 --> 00:45:07.670
it didn't seem to fit in with the judgment

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:11.837
that they'd made about the
process working or not working.

00:45:12.711 --> 00:45:16.197
So what I'm gonna do next is just show you

00:45:16.197 --> 00:45:19.260
the replies for the seven-year-olds

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.927
and just to give you a heads up,

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:28.407
the biological answers are
black, I mean the bars are black.

00:45:29.833 --> 00:45:32.867
The religious answers are white.

00:45:32.867 --> 00:45:35.048
And in between you'll see some gray

00:45:35.048 --> 00:45:37.215
for equivocal so to speak.

00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:40.866
More than that, I'll show
you the extent to which

00:45:40.866 --> 00:45:45.454
the child offers religious
replies or biological replies

00:45:45.454 --> 00:45:47.718
or equivocal replies with respect

00:45:47.718 --> 00:45:50.200
to those two story settings.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.596
Remember the priest story
and the doctor story

00:45:53.596 --> 00:45:56.139
and also within those two stories

00:45:56.139 --> 00:45:59.889
for mental processes
versus bodily processes.

00:46:02.418 --> 00:46:06.357
So here's as I say, an overview
of the seven-year-olds.

00:46:06.357 --> 00:46:08.551
And you can see it's fairly black.

00:46:08.551 --> 00:46:12.467
That's to say most of
the time the children

00:46:12.467 --> 00:46:16.590
are giving biologically oriented answers.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.586
And if you look at the left
hand side of the figure

00:46:19.586 --> 00:46:23.753
where I've charted replies
for the doctor stories,

00:46:25.175 --> 00:46:27.629
whether it be about the body or the mind,

00:46:27.629 --> 00:46:31.191
you can see that biology is dominating.

00:46:31.191 --> 00:46:34.589
But if you shift over to
the two right hand columns,

00:46:34.589 --> 00:46:35.977
you see that religion is beginning

00:46:35.977 --> 00:46:38.966
to get a look in so to speak.

00:46:38.966 --> 00:46:41.848
More religious replies and the proportion

00:46:41.848 --> 00:46:44.867
of biological answers is declining.

00:46:44.867 --> 00:46:47.448
So in other words, when
you present the same child

00:46:47.448 --> 00:46:50.865
or well, essentially the same child, yes,

00:46:53.081 --> 00:46:55.150
a story with some religious cues,

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:58.461
they pick up on those cues
and they start to interpret

00:46:58.461 --> 00:47:02.628
the death in a different context
or in a different fashion.

00:47:04.378 --> 00:47:07.134
So that's the picture
for the seven-year-olds.

00:47:07.134 --> 00:47:09.210
Now we can ask what we will,

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:12.127
might find with the older children,

00:47:13.677 --> 00:47:17.844
with the 11-year-olds and the
extent to which biology might,

00:47:18.945 --> 00:47:22.505
so to speak, consolidate
itself or religion might

00:47:22.505 --> 00:47:25.706
consolidate itself or there might be

00:47:25.706 --> 00:47:28.654
some competition between these two modes.

00:47:28.654 --> 00:47:30.692
And here's what we find.

00:47:30.692 --> 00:47:34.275
You can see that religion
is predominating,

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.543
especially when we've given the child

00:47:38.543 --> 00:47:41.371
as you see in the two right hand columns,

00:47:41.371 --> 00:47:42.973
those afterlife cues.

00:47:42.973 --> 00:47:44.486
So if the priest is introduced,

00:47:44.486 --> 00:47:47.838
whether the child is asked
about the body or the mind,

00:47:47.838 --> 00:47:49.823
there's a lot of religious talk

00:47:49.823 --> 00:47:52.911
in their replies and justifications.

00:47:52.911 --> 00:47:56.328
So the next step that we took was to ask,

00:47:59.414 --> 00:48:04.148
given that we had presented
each child with two stories,

00:48:04.148 --> 00:48:08.842
to ask how consistent any
individual child might be

00:48:08.842 --> 00:48:12.895
across those two stories and
indeed across essentially

00:48:12.895 --> 00:48:16.228
the 28 questions that we had asked them.

00:48:17.384 --> 00:48:21.134
So at one extreme, a given child might be

00:48:21.134 --> 00:48:23.452
consistently biological in their answer.

00:48:23.452 --> 00:48:25.957
They might assume that death
is terminal and that's that,

00:48:25.957 --> 00:48:27.773
no matter what the process

00:48:27.773 --> 00:48:30.251
and no matter what the story context.

00:48:30.251 --> 00:48:31.412
Conversely they might be

00:48:31.412 --> 00:48:34.581
consistently religious in their answers.

00:48:34.581 --> 00:48:37.893
And finally, we could
imagine an individual child

00:48:37.893 --> 00:48:41.742
who shifts their ground
depending on the story context

00:48:41.742 --> 00:48:44.335
or indeed, on the particular process

00:48:44.335 --> 00:48:48.198
that they're being invited to think about.

00:48:48.198 --> 00:48:52.304
So you'll see in the next slide,
again these two age groups,

00:48:52.304 --> 00:48:54.037
seven-year-olds and 11-year-olds,

00:48:54.037 --> 00:48:56.360
but I'm gonna show you
the proportion of children

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.654
falling into these three categories.

00:48:59.654 --> 00:49:01.495
So here are the findings.

00:49:01.495 --> 00:49:03.359
So you can see that the seven-year-olds

00:49:03.359 --> 00:49:06.461
as we might of suspected
from the earlier figure,

00:49:06.461 --> 00:49:10.628
approach death from a predominantly
biological perspective.

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:14.253
On the other hand, if
you look at that red bar,

00:49:14.253 --> 00:49:16.509
we do see some proportion,

00:49:16.509 --> 00:49:18.437
about 30% of those seven-year-olds,

00:49:18.437 --> 00:49:21.765
who are mixing it, who
go backwards and forward

00:49:21.765 --> 00:49:25.364
so to speak between the
biological and religious.

00:49:25.364 --> 00:49:29.801
And a small proportion who
are consistently religious.

00:49:29.801 --> 00:49:31.718
Now if we turn to the 11-year-olds,

00:49:31.718 --> 00:49:35.885
we might've imagined that the
consistently religious bar,

00:49:37.203 --> 00:49:39.951
the white bar, would be the one showing

00:49:39.951 --> 00:49:43.270
the most sharp increase between

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:44.952
the younger children
and the older children.

00:49:44.952 --> 00:49:47.002
That's the not the case as you see.

00:49:47.002 --> 00:49:49.644
What we do see is a decline in

00:49:49.644 --> 00:49:52.043
consistently biological responding

00:49:52.043 --> 00:49:56.329
and an increase in this
mixed pattern of responding

00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:58.609
where the child depending
upon the particular question

00:49:58.609 --> 00:50:01.492
we've asked is inclined to offer

00:50:01.492 --> 00:50:05.665
a biological account
or a religious account.

00:50:05.665 --> 00:50:07.997
More generally I would say and these data

00:50:07.997 --> 00:50:11.731
are fitted into other data, it looks as if

00:50:11.731 --> 00:50:15.898
children by the age of late
middle childhood so to speak,

00:50:17.662 --> 00:50:19.836
have arrived at these two accounts.

00:50:19.836 --> 00:50:22.966
They don't necessarily
think of the two accounts

00:50:22.966 --> 00:50:24.990
as competitors with each other.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:28.052
They think of them as
compatible with each other.

00:50:28.052 --> 00:50:31.148
But it's also true and
this is going a little bit

00:50:31.148 --> 00:50:33.575
beyond the data, but I
think it's very plausible,

00:50:33.575 --> 00:50:35.493
that the starting point for young children

00:50:35.493 --> 00:50:37.184
is the biological.

00:50:37.184 --> 00:50:39.773
So they arrive at this biological account

00:50:39.773 --> 00:50:43.335
of which as I said
earlier, by seven or eight

00:50:43.335 --> 00:50:45.576
they realize is a universal account

00:50:45.576 --> 00:50:47.755
and therefore applies to themselves.

00:50:47.755 --> 00:50:50.225
And it may be that that's
the foundation ultimately,

00:50:50.225 --> 00:50:54.392
this biological account for
their increasing appreciation

00:50:55.674 --> 00:50:59.775
of the message that is offered
by religion so to speak.

00:50:59.775 --> 00:51:03.088
Which after all in some sense presupposes

00:51:03.088 --> 00:51:05.087
the biological account,
but then denies it,

00:51:05.087 --> 00:51:07.754
which says death is not the end.

00:51:10.253 --> 00:51:14.128
So there's a sense in which
from our point of view

00:51:14.128 --> 00:51:18.295
we are seeing somewhat
paradoxical conceptual development

00:51:19.204 --> 00:51:22.205
here where conclusions that
the child has arrived at

00:51:22.205 --> 00:51:24.573
from a relatively objective point of view

00:51:24.573 --> 00:51:27.976
are going to put aside
or set aside in part

00:51:27.976 --> 00:51:30.595
by virtue of religious teaching.

00:51:30.595 --> 00:51:34.762
So there's a quick summary of
what I've just reported to you

00:51:35.696 --> 00:51:39.642
and as I've emphasized,
as children get older,

00:51:39.642 --> 00:51:43.021
this mixed stance is
the one that dominates.

00:51:43.021 --> 00:51:46.880
I'm going to give you a very
quick taste of Rita's talk

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.749
by showing you a map of Madagascar.

00:51:48.749 --> 00:51:50.736
That's all I'm going to do.

00:51:50.736 --> 00:51:54.899
I'm going to show you a
picture of her field site.

00:51:54.899 --> 00:51:57.473
She will tell you what happens
when you go to Madagascar

00:51:57.473 --> 00:52:00.556
and you repeat this kind of interview

00:52:01.448 --> 00:52:03.908
with children and with adults.

00:52:03.908 --> 00:52:05.464
Bearing in mind that in Madagascar,

00:52:05.464 --> 00:52:07.591
we're not talking about
a Christian culture,

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:09.016
we're talking about a
culture which believes in

00:52:09.016 --> 00:52:11.907
the existence of the ancestors.

00:52:11.907 --> 00:52:15.894
So I'm gonna move on quickly
instead to Tanna, Vanuatu.

00:52:15.894 --> 00:52:20.422
As you can see off the
east coast of Australia.

00:52:20.422 --> 00:52:23.417
And in particular this island of Tanna

00:52:23.417 --> 00:52:26.761
is one where my colleagues in Austin

00:52:26.761 --> 00:52:29.132
led by Christine Legare have been doing

00:52:29.132 --> 00:52:31.886
these kinds of interviews with children

00:52:31.886 --> 00:52:34.553
and indeed with adults in Tanna.

00:52:35.705 --> 00:52:36.538
Okay.

00:52:37.425 --> 00:52:41.266
They took essentially the design study,

00:52:41.266 --> 00:52:46.247
the study design that I described
a moment ago to Vanuatu.

00:52:46.247 --> 00:52:49.997
But they also tested
adults in Austin, Texas.

00:52:51.084 --> 00:52:54.213
And the basic question
was the extent to which

00:52:54.213 --> 00:52:57.800
we would find a distinctive pattern,

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.839
particularly in Vanuatu or
whether we would replicate

00:53:01.839 --> 00:53:05.108
the basic pattern we'd seen in Spain.

00:53:05.108 --> 00:53:08.458
One, it seems like a
minor mathological point,

00:53:08.458 --> 00:53:10.956
but I think it's of greater significance.

00:53:10.956 --> 00:53:14.405
In this particular study, each participant

00:53:14.405 --> 00:53:18.992
was only presented with one
story, not with two stories.

00:53:18.992 --> 00:53:21.098
So you could argue looking
back at the results

00:53:21.098 --> 00:53:23.912
we got in Spain that
the reason why children

00:53:23.912 --> 00:53:27.731
showed this duality, this
co-existence of two accounts,

00:53:27.731 --> 00:53:31.398
was precisely because the two
children had been presented

00:53:31.398 --> 00:53:34.515
with two different narratives about death.

00:53:34.515 --> 00:53:38.545
In this study then, each
participant only got one story

00:53:38.545 --> 00:53:40.105
and we'll see if nonetheless,

00:53:40.105 --> 00:53:43.438
we get this pattern of mixed responding.

00:53:44.944 --> 00:53:46.913
So that's the basic question.

00:53:46.913 --> 00:53:48.891
And I'm going to show you
now the results that we got

00:53:48.891 --> 00:53:53.245
when we presented a story
with afterlife cues,

00:53:53.245 --> 00:53:57.509
similar to the one that
I mentioned a moment ago

00:53:57.509 --> 00:53:59.876
with respect to Madrid and Spain,

00:53:59.876 --> 00:54:02.237
but with certain cultural
adjustments given,

00:54:02.237 --> 00:54:03.737
given the culture.

00:54:05.901 --> 00:54:08.087
The two cultures I should say.

00:54:08.087 --> 00:54:10.562
So here are the findings.

00:54:10.562 --> 00:54:13.734
Pretty straightforward as you can see,

00:54:13.734 --> 00:54:17.250
in both places we see that
the consistently biological

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:19.393
is in the minority.

00:54:19.393 --> 00:54:22.810
In both places we do see some individuals

00:54:23.695 --> 00:54:27.204
who offer consistently
religious responding.

00:54:27.204 --> 00:54:30.695
But the very clear
result is this prevalence

00:54:30.695 --> 00:54:34.467
of a mixed stance or mixed responding

00:54:34.467 --> 00:54:38.632
both in the United States and in Vanuatu.

00:54:38.632 --> 00:54:42.799
So that leads me to then
some overall conclusions.

00:54:44.213 --> 00:54:48.519
It looks as if from our data
and actually that's echoed

00:54:48.519 --> 00:54:52.422
not just in Spain, but also in Madagascar,

00:54:52.422 --> 00:54:56.255
that young children don't
really pay much heed

00:54:58.815 --> 00:55:01.023
to the religious narrative which is

00:55:01.023 --> 00:55:03.257
available in their culture.

00:55:03.257 --> 00:55:07.424
They come to an understanding
of death in biological terms.

00:55:08.653 --> 00:55:11.738
And more probing interviews than those

00:55:11.738 --> 00:55:14.017
I've presented to you today suggest

00:55:14.017 --> 00:55:17.814
as I mentioned earlier, that
this is part of a theory

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:19.776
in the sense that the children also can

00:55:19.776 --> 00:55:23.667
invoke various unobservable bodily organs

00:55:23.667 --> 00:55:27.066
and realize that the body is coherent

00:55:27.066 --> 00:55:30.983
or has to work coherently
for life to continue.

00:55:31.954 --> 00:55:33.719
And when life stops,

00:55:33.719 --> 00:55:37.048
you see a termination of most processes.

00:55:37.048 --> 00:55:40.458
So children have established that notion

00:55:40.458 --> 00:55:43.416
by around seven or eight years of age.

00:55:43.416 --> 00:55:46.833
As that theory or account is consolidated

00:55:47.974 --> 00:55:50.162
it seems as if they become more receptive

00:55:50.162 --> 00:55:53.053
to the existing theological, supernatural

00:55:53.053 --> 00:55:56.847
or religious account that
exists in their culture.

00:55:56.847 --> 00:56:01.013
And that, having said that, it's not as if

00:56:01.013 --> 00:56:05.165
that religious stance leads
them to forget or suppress

00:56:05.165 --> 00:56:07.285
what they know about biology.

00:56:07.285 --> 00:56:10.666
So what you see among
large numbers of people

00:56:10.666 --> 00:56:14.017
in all of these populations is a tendency

00:56:14.017 --> 00:56:16.847
to oscillate between the two accounts.

00:56:16.847 --> 00:56:19.597
And to the best of our knowledge,

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.595
these two accounts are not perceived to be

00:56:23.595 --> 00:56:25.409
in conflict with one another.

00:56:25.409 --> 00:56:27.104
And I think Rita will present you

00:56:27.104 --> 00:56:31.001
with more ethnographic
evidence this afternoon

00:56:31.001 --> 00:56:34.103
that indeed people move rather smoothly

00:56:34.103 --> 00:56:36.774
from one account to the other.

00:56:36.774 --> 00:56:38.869
Now let me just say one or two words

00:56:38.869 --> 00:56:41.860
about the broader implications then

00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:45.090
of these developmental findings

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:49.646
for more comparative
approach that we will be

00:56:49.646 --> 00:56:52.335
reviewing in the course of today.

00:56:52.335 --> 00:56:55.199
So these developmental
findings may or may not

00:56:55.199 --> 00:56:58.561
point to what happened in
the course of human history.

00:56:58.561 --> 00:57:02.180
And they may or may not point to ideas

00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:05.892
that we can bring to
primatology in particular.

00:57:05.892 --> 00:57:07.192
Could it be that primates have some

00:57:07.192 --> 00:57:11.359
minimal biological understanding
and should we assume that

00:57:12.602 --> 00:57:14.142
the religious notion of course,

00:57:14.142 --> 00:57:16.398
would ultimately in the human species

00:57:16.398 --> 00:57:18.617
build on that biological notion.

00:57:18.617 --> 00:57:22.896
Which is already hinted
at in our close cousins.

00:57:22.896 --> 00:57:24.960
Let me stop there, thank you.

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:28.127
(audience applauding)

00:57:29.989 --> 00:57:33.656
(light instrumental music)
