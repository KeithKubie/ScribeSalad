00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So as we saw, this quiz was particularly tricky.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It wasn't obvious how to work out the right answer.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We're really interested in supporting phone numbers from

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
a bunch of different countries or formats, but we're really only interested

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in that hyphen if it's followed by more digits.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Conceptually, you might think "Wow, I really want to group

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the hyphen and the digits together and then have either all of them or none of them."

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We don't know how to do that just yet, but we will in a few more minutes,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.243
and then you'll get a chance to show off your mastery in the homework.
