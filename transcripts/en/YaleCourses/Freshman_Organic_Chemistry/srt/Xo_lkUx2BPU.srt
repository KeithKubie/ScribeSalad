1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's get started. Welcome to the
parents who have made it today.

2
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:11,001
Thank you for sending us your bright
people to do a pay our salaries and learn

3
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:16,290
from us. Uh, as, uh, the,

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,360
we've spent most of the semester so
far figuring out what bonds is and,

5
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:23,400
and how quantum mechanics works and so on.

6
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:27,120
But now we're trying to find out how it
really happened, how people discovered,

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,740
how chemistry in general and organic
chemistry in particular work than we

8
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:35,520
started with [inaudible].
And now we're in the next generation,

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,560
which is salient in Sweden.
And as we said last time,

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,930
he was important for analysis.

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,630
He got good atomic
weights for 50 elements.

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,580
We'll talk today about a
electrolysis and dualism. Uh,

13
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:55,260
he was important for his teaching and
writing for the first half of the 19th

14
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:55,711
century.

15
00:00:55,711 --> 00:01:00,711
He was the main man and in chemistry
and his notation for composition that we

16
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:04,860
talked about last time that we still use.
Okay,

17
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:08,160
so now we're going to talk about atomic
weights and equivalents and what was

18
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:11,890
involved there. We started this last
time. Remember showed how gay lose sock.

19
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,040
I had an alternative to, uh, to
Dalton. There was this question about,

20
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,620
uh, what, even if you knew, uh,
the proper ratios of elements,

21
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:25,800
what you didn't know was the ratios of
the atoms that were in them because you

22
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:28,560
didn't know whether an atomic
weight should be doubled or halved.

23
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,720
So they had the question about silicon
chloride was at sic sic l two S I sic l

24
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:38,670
three, s I c l four. So how could you
possibly settle something like this?

25
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,180
Uh, Dalton did it by assuming that
if you had only one common hat,

26
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,720
one compound, it had to be one to
one. Gay Lusaka went with the map,

27
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,400
the volumes of the gases
that were involved,

28
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,350
which turned out ultimately to be correct.

29
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,190
Although it wasn't really widely
accepted for about 60 years.

30
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,360
But there was another neat way of
doing it depending on crystals. Uh,

31
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,840
mid Salish and Austrian,
uh,

32
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:09,050
had this device on which you mount a
crystal and reflect light off it through a

33
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:12,270
telescope.
So when you do that,

34
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:15,420
you know precisely if it comes right
up the middle of the telescope,

35
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,230
you know exactly what direction
the, um, the plane of the surf,

36
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:21,630
that surface of the crystal is.

37
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,820
So what you can do then is rotate it by
a certain number of degrees until some

38
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:30,360
other face of the crystal
reflects precisely,

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,250
and then you can measure very,

40
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:35,610
very accurately what the angle
between those two faces is.

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,560
So that was crystallography in
those days before x-ray. Okay.

42
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,860
So here's his paper on relating
crystal shape to chemical proportions.

43
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,470
There was sound like not
closely related phenomena,

44
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,500
but here he's talking about arsenates
and phosphates and here are the pictures

45
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:58,500
he drew. They drew a beautiful
pictures of crystals in those days.

46
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:02,890
If that's all you can do, you'll
do it right? Uh, so he has an art.

47
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,630
Betty saw that the crystals were the same
shape for corresponding arsenates and

48
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:12,580
phosphates. This diammonium by arson
aid and the diammonium by phosphate,

49
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,600
right?

50
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,980
So he measured the angles and here's his
table at the angles corresponding and

51
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,140
you can see they're very,
very close to one another.

52
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,630
Those are the differences
in tenths of degrees.

53
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,890
So these crystals are precisely the same.
Now what can you conclude from that?

54
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,720
Anybody got an idea where
you can go from here?

55
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,080
So you know that there's an arsenite
and the phosphate with the same chemical

56
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:38,920
composition,

57
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,743
right?

58
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,570
And they give exactly the same shape.

59
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:47,920
So the thing that's things that packed
together must be exactly the same.

60
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,470
So they must have the corresponding know,

61
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:54,340
however many arsenates there are
arsenic Adams, there are in one,

62
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:57,490
there must be exactly the same number
of phosphorous atoms in the other.

63
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,060
Otherwise they could not possibly
be exactly the same shape.

64
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,440
So now you know something that we,

65
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,370
there was this need for relative
atomic weights. Was Dalton, right?

66
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,360
Was Water Aho or was Gailey's sock right?
That it was h two o right?

67
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:13,870
At least in this case,
this thing called ISO morphism,

68
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:18,640
the same shape of the crystals provided
definitive atomic weight ratios for at

69
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:21,690
least some of the Adam pairs.
So arsenic,

70
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:25,420
Adam's must play exactly the same role
in arsenates that phosphorous atoms play

71
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:30,340
in phosphates. And therefore, if you
have a hundred grams of nitrogen,

72
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:35,341
oxygen and hydrogen that combines to give
these these salts with 30.64 grams of

73
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:39,370
phosphorous or 78.11 grams of arsenic,

74
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,610
it must be that our snake Adam is 2.55
times as heavy as the phosphorous atom,

75
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,300
right?

76
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,970
That is,
it can't be half that or twice that.

77
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,670
It has to be exactly that because they
have to be the same number to give

78
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:56,590
exactly the same shape. Okay, so there
was one way of determining this ratio,

79
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:59,290
but it wasn't trivial.
Okay?

80
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,320
Now here's presale is his
table of atomic and Mike,

81
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:06,280
your weights from the or 1831 and
if we zoom in on it a bit here,

82
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,460
you can see he gave two
columns for the atomic weights,

83
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,610
one based on oxygen being 100 units and
the other based on h with a bar across

84
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:20,580
it being one. Now the bar across Adam's
means that the atoms are doubled.

85
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,010
You can have it without a bar,
which is a single atom or the bar across.

86
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,850
That means it's a doubled them.
So he had actually noticed,

87
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,750
if you go down the column there
that if you assume h two is one,

88
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:33,910
then obviously h here is a half,

89
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,813
right?

90
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,680
So these were the numbers he had in
1831 and we could compare them with what

91
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:45,000
they would be nowadays if you scaled
to oxygen as we defined it now to be 15

92
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:50,001
point 900900900 four and then you see
that they're off by about 1% up or down.

93
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,280
How does that compare with
what Dalton was getting?

94
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:57,060
Do you remember how accurate he was?
He was about 10.

95
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,920
So here in, in uh, 25 years,

96
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:05,810
they've gotten 10 fold more accurate
in what the atomic weights are. Okay.

97
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,370
Uh, now combustion analysis was, was, was,

98
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:14,510
and would continue to be from the time
of Avazi a white through the whole 19th

99
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:18,770
century,
the heavy carrier for organic chemistry.

100
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,330
Okay, here's the way, but
salients did combustion analysis.

101
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:28,570
So he started with a tube in which he
put a half a gram of organic substance

102
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,560
that was going to be analyzed, three
grams of sodium chlorate you remember?

103
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,150
That's what gay Lusaka used to burn
things with. Why that rather than air,

104
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,810
why did Gail Lusaka use it
rather than air? Do you remember?

105
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,590
Cause a lot of things wouldn't burn
in air. Right. They would char. Okay.

106
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:49,490
So,
but he used this,

107
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,050
they use Galeas socks oxidizing agent and
50 grams of sodium chloride was ground

108
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:56,440
up with this stuff just so that,
uh,

109
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,290
the reaction wouldn't get out of
hand so it wouldn't explode. Okay.

110
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,220
So those are put in there.

111
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:06,221
Then he heated up the neck and drew it
out and plugged it in to that bulb on the

112
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:10,970
right. Right. So he joined
it to that bulb, which would
serve for collecting water,

113
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:14,750
which is a combustion product and
a calcium chloride drying tube,

114
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:15,584
which would get the,

115
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,940
which would get the rest of the water
that didn't condense and the bulb. Okay.

116
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,970
Then he assembled this thing along the
bottom so that the gasses that came out

117
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,790
after the water was removed what exit in
and be collected in this bell jar over

118
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:34,400
mercury.
And in that there was a bulb that floated,

119
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,510
which held potassium hydroxide,
solid potassium hydroxide,

120
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,280
which would absorb the co two,

121
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,400
thereby separating it from the
oxygen that would come through.

122
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,850
You get oxygen just by
heating sodium chlorate. Okay.

123
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,390
And then he closed the top with
a piece of, of glove leather.

124
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:52,550
So the mercury that was
floating on couldn't,

125
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,120
little drops of mercury wouldn't get
in because as you know from hefting it,

126
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,000
that would change the way to good deal.
Okay.

127
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,440
So what he did was build a fire
and move that barrier back.

128
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,650
So with heat from one end to the other
and the gases would come out and bubble

129
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:11,510
up in the bell jar. Right. And, and
fill up a good deal of the bell jar.

130
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,930
Right. Uh, and notice that the,

131
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:19,220
that the tube had been wrapped with
metal to keep it from popping when it got

132
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:22,400
hot in the fire because there'd be
pressure inside in order to bubble through

133
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,190
the mercury. Uh, okay.

134
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,720
So then the cools it off the
gas contracts, right? The,

135
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,370
the Koh absorbs co two. So you're
left with oxygen in the bell jar.

136
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:39,170
And the, and the CEO two is
absorbed on the potassium hydroxide,

137
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:44,390
but he then after the mercury rises,
as the gas gets absorbed,

138
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,630
but after the mercury stops rise,

139
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,440
he waits 12 hours to make sure he's got
all the co two absorbed because it has

140
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:54,960
to get through the glove leather. Right.
So it takes quite a while. It took a,

141
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,940
you know, much more than the day
to do it to do an analysis. Uh,

142
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,960
so after it stops rising,
he takes it apart.

143
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,130
It takes the glove leather off the top
ways that and finds out how much co two

144
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:07,010
there was.
So he's got the water and the CO2,

145
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,260
therefore the hydrogen and the carbon and
this was a much better way of doing it.

146
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,710
Then, uh, then Lavoie CA's
which required, you know,

147
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:18,360
three or four people operating
in that big machine. Okay.

148
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:22,800
Electricity was another really
important contribution from butts alias.

149
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,670
Okay. Uh, to, to, uh,

150
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,160
but it also was a contribution to
the royal institution in London, uh,

151
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,590
where this is a demonstration of a,

152
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,240
of a n two o at the Royal Institution,

153
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:39,870
but the guy holding the bellows there is,
uh,

154
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,920
is Humphry Davy who became the head of
the Royal Institution and was the head

155
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:52,140
then a big science. So
in 18, seven and eight,

156
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:54,600
he made some very important experiments.

157
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,320
It was based on the work of Volta who
was just a little more than a decade

158
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,660
earlier, who had invented this
thing shown on his desk here,

159
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:07,350
which was the voltaic pile,
which was a pile of copper and zinc,

160
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,490
uh, disks. And when you put
copper and zinc together,

161
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:14,910
you can get 1.1 volts out of it.
Okay.

162
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,950
So this was going to be big science.

163
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:21,600
So he put together 24 such pairs
of things, which, which uh,

164
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,670
which meant you could get 26 volts.
Those were six inches square. Right?

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,750
Then he made another, there's the battery
incidentally, that Butts alias had,

166
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:33,570
which is instill in Stockholm.
Okay.

167
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,890
Then he put one with a hundred such
things. So he could get 110 volts.

168
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,690
Then he made another one.

169
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,340
They were only four inches
square now of 165 volts. Right?

170
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,670
And then he could hook them together in
series so he could get 301 volts across

171
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:54,750
this thing. And then he tried
doing experiments with it.
So this is what he said.

172
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,390
I acted upon aqueous solutions of potash
and soda. You know what potash is?

173
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,870
Potassium hydroxide and soda.

174
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,250
Soda is sodium hydroxide saturated
that common temperatures by the highest

175
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:14,940
electrical power I could command and
which was produced by a combination of

176
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:19,830
Voltaic batteries belonging to the Royal
Institution containing 24 plates of

177
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:22,280
copper and zinc, 12 inches
square, a hundred plates,

178
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:27,030
six inches and 100 and 554 inches square.
So this is that battery,

179
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:30,870
as I just said, put 300 and whatever
number of volts across this thing.

180
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,530
Though there was a high
intensity of action.

181
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,060
The water of the solution alone was
affected in hydrogen and oxygen,

182
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:42,810
disengaged with the production of
much heat and violent effervescence.

183
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,130
I could believe that. And so,
so he wasn't about to give up.

184
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:49,650
He tried it again,
the presence of water appearing.

185
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:52,470
Thus to prevent any decomposition.
I used potash,

186
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:55,290
so potassium in igneous fusions.

187
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:59,950
So he put a flame to it and melted it by
means of a stream of oxygen gas from a

188
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:04,210
gas almond or applied to the flame of
a spirit lamp which was thrown onto a

189
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:06,520
platinum spoon containing potash.

190
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:11,080
This alkali was kept for some minutes
in a strong red heat and in a state of

191
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:12,250
perfect fluidity,

192
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,470
the spoon was preserved in communication
with the positive side of the battery.

193
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:20,120
I don't know how he held this thing,
uh,

194
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,710
of the power of 106 inches highly charged.

195
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:28,570
And the connection from the negative
side was made by a platinum wire by this

196
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:31,360
arrangement.
Some brilliant phenomenol were produced.

197
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,560
The potash appear to conduct her
in a high degree and as long as the

198
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:39,400
communication was preserved
to most intense light was
exhibited at the negative

199
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:41,170
wire and a column of flame,

200
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,950
which seemed to be open to the development
of combustible matter arose from the

201
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:48,370
point of contact. Right? Then
he did another experiment,

202
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:51,310
a small piece of pure potash had
been exposed for a few seconds to the

203
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:51,881
atmosphere.

204
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:56,110
So as to give a conducting power to the
surface was placed upon an insulated

205
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:57,140
disc of [inaudible],

206
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,290
connected with the negative side of the
battery of the power of 250 of 604 in a

207
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:06,220
state of intense activity and a platinum
wire communicating with the positive

208
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:10,060
side was brought in contact with
the upper surface of the Alkali,

209
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,390
small globules having a high metallic
luster and being precisely similar

210
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:19,510
invisible characters to quicksilver.
What's quicksilver?

211
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,760
Live silver, right?
Mercury of course. Okay.

212
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,790
Some of which burnt with explosion and
bright flame as soon as they were formed

213
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,060
and others remained and we're merely
tarnished and finally covered with a white

214
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:35,290
film which formed on their
surfaces. What was this right?

215
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:39,280
He electrolyzed uh,
he says potash,

216
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:42,910
potassium hydroxide. What
did he get? Potassium metal.

217
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:47,911
So He'd discovered a new element and
from soda he got sodium from potash,

218
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,020
potash. She got potassium. Okay.

219
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:55,630
Now this was a great
triumph for English science,

220
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,790
but those were the
period of great rivalry.

221
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:02,170
18 seven and eight the peninsular
war was going on in Portugal,

222
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,700
Spain against the French in
particular against Napoleon.

223
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,520
Napoleon had studied science a certain
amount as a student at the AA call,

224
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:14,770
Amelie tear in Paris. In fact,
he had been examined by Laplas,

225
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,030
the Lavoie,
CA's a colleague and measuring heat.

226
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,770
So, uh, he wasn't about to
knuckle under to England in this,

227
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:28,090
so he got his crew together,
including Gailey's sock and said,

228
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,090
why haven't we discovered this?
And Galia [inaudible] said,

229
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:33,610
we don't have the battery. He
says, you've got your battery.

230
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,800
So this was the battery. They that
Galeas sat constructed at garden.

231
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,740
So it consisted of 601 kilogram copper
plates and 603 kilograms zinc plates.

232
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:50,311
So he had 2.6 tons of metal and
in in six different troughs here.

233
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,090
And then he hooked them
together in series.

234
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,660
Alright,
so he's now got 650 volts.

235
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,990
Now the Napoleon was
interested in science,

236
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:06,350
so he came to visit the lab one day
and there's an account of this in the,

237
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,940
in the biography of Sam,
of Humphry Davy with that rapidity,

238
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:13,280
which characterized all his motions.

239
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,430
And before the attendance could
enter pose any precaution,

240
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,850
he thrust the extreme wires to the
battery under his tongue and received a

241
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:22,461
shock,

242
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:27,440
which nearly deprived him of sensation
after recovering from its effects,

243
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,770
he quitted the laboratory without making
any remark and was never afterwards

244
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:37,490
heard to refer to the subject.
Okay,

245
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:40,640
so that was the end of the French
competition with Humphry Davy.

246
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:45,641
But Davey himself built one with a
thousand plates with so 2,200 volts.

247
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:47,714
And with this,

248
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,430
he was able to prepare a bunch of elements
in addition to sodium and potassium,

249
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:56,870
Boron, magnesium, calcium, and barium
were all due to Sir Humphry Davy.

250
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,110
But that wasn't really the most
important thing for chemistry.

251
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,410
W supplied more than new elements.
It's supplied an idea.

252
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,490
And the idea was the organizing
principle for what was called dualism.

253
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,240
And dualism was the idea that there were
things that were positive and things

254
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:14,210
that were negative and they would
be attracted to one another.

255
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,100
Not only would they be attracted one
another, but they could trade partners.

256
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,760
Okay.
So remember we saw last time that the,

257
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:26,000
that the alchemists already
had vitriolic and Kukri or,

258
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,470
or copper sulfate. So here we
saw last time was copper sulfate.

259
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,810
Let me see if I can get
this thing going here.

260
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,823
Oh,
here.

261
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,270
Is it? Half tomorrow. There we go.

262
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,240
So there's copper sulfate
and nice and blue.

263
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,580
But let me get the light behind.
That should be good. Okay,

264
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,940
so we'll put some in here.
So this is copper as a,

265
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,510
as a positive stuff and
sulfate is negative stuff.

266
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,570
And now we'll take sodium hydroxide.
So,

267
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,420
and put a little bit in.

268
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:14,080
So there's a precipitate and actually
it's much more complicated than people

269
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:15,380
thought it was in those days.

270
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:19,400
It gets quite dark blue if you
put a lot of a lot in there.

271
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:22,390
But now a white whitish
precipitates going to form,

272
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,880
but you don't see very well here. Maybe
it doesn't know how to focus on that.

273
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:31,240
Uh, let's see. I can get
something for it to focus on

274
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,540
there. There you see the
precipitate. Okay, so obviously
something happened, right?

275
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,830
And according to dualism,
this is what happened, right?

276
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,920
You Mix it with caustic
soda and you have ab and CD,

277
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:51,420
positive and negative on the left,
sodium hydroxide, copper sulfate,

278
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,780
and they change partners and you
get a precipitate. So you have,

279
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,010
it's explained by electricity.
And this is then is what dualism was.

280
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,440
Uh, so we've noticed that
this is our family tree.

281
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:08,460
You remember? And now we've
looked at a elemental analysis,

282
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:11,850
Adams and dualism.
Notice that people are entered into this,

283
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:15,150
not by when they made their contribution
because they made it at many different

284
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:19,680
times, but by when they were born. So
you can see what the generations were.

285
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,080
So first we had lavoie ca then presale,
he is,

286
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:25,770
and now we're into a new generation of
people who are going to contribute when

287
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,740
they get to be 20 to
30 years old down here.

288
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:34,490
So the next thing we're going to talk
about is urea and isomers and the benzoyl

289
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,000
radical and the theory of
substitutions and types. Okay.

290
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,760
And our players are John Baptiste onto,

291
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:47,770
they do ma in France and
Leiby and volar in Germany.

292
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:52,770
And they were all born right around 1800.
Between 1,818 three okay.

293
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:56,220
And here they are on the, on
the, uh, outside of the building.

294
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,550
So we're going to look
at villa and liebig. Now,

295
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:02,880
here's the volar writing
to Brett's alias in Sweden.

296
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:05,400
He's going to be the next generation,
uh,

297
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,120
saying having developed the greatest
respect for you through studying your

298
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:09,954
writings.

299
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,590
I've always thought it would
be my greatest good fortune
to be able to practice

300
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:15,870
this science under the
direction of such a man,

301
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,300
which has always been my fondest desire.

302
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:21,150
Those who have seen such
letters will recognize these as,

303
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,500
as consistent up to the present
day. Uh, he said, he goes on to say,

304
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:28,080
although I earlier had
planned to become a physician,

305
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,300
and at the end he says with the greatest
respect treed Richville Villar from

306
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:37,260
Frankfurt on mine.
He was a great guy.

307
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:41,190
They carried on correspondence their
whole lives. It's really entertaining.

308
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:46,440
And because partly because Voler had sort
of a lame mish sense of humor and was

309
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:48,300
a cartoonist. So, for example,

310
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:52,090
in this letter to put Sally's
in 1837 so this is, uh,

311
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,980
10 years later, he said to see
this old friend palm stet again,

312
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:58,320
especially here in Gooding
and was a real delight.

313
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,220
He was just the same old guy with the
sole exception that he no longer wears the

314
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:05,280
little toupee swept up over
his forehead as he used to do.

315
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:08,580
So Villar drew this cartoon in there.
Okay.

316
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:12,720
But what do you know what you
know volar for probably is urea.

317
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,170
How many people have heard
about villa and urea? Okay.

318
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,730
But the interesting thing is that the
urea was not the main contribution.

319
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:23,640
He also invented the aluminum
incidentally are discovered aluminum,

320
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,020
but urea wasn't really
the main for our purposes,

321
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:32,340
wasn't the main contribution
from this, uh, work of, of volar.

322
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,490
And you'll see that there are a couple
of problems for next Wednesday and

323
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:38,910
readings on the web that support
this with original documents.

324
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,750
So he wrote in 1828 to produce alias.
Perhaps.

325
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:46,230
You still remember the experiment I
carried out in that fortunate time when I

326
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:50,980
was working with you in which I found
that whenever one tries to react cyanic

327
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:54,370
acid with ammonia,
a crystalline substance appears,

328
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:58,840
which is a nerd behaving neither
like CYA eight nor like ammonia.

329
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,990
So that,
that's what was funny,

330
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:05,180
that it didn't behave like you
would expect for ammonium cyanide.

331
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,260
So the idea was it should be a
double decomposition reaction.

332
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,810
This dualistic thing
where you change partners.

333
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,750
So you start with ammonium chloride,
silver Saya and eight.

334
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:16,420
That was another way he
did it and he and he,

335
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:19,840
you should get ammonium signed eight and
silver chloride was as a precipitate.

336
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:21,940
So then you can,
you've prepared ammonium signing,

337
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,310
but you can test whether ammonium signed.
Eight is the salt ammonium signed,

338
00:21:26,311 --> 00:21:30,580
eight one is to see whether it has the
ammonium ion in it and that you can tell

339
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:34,810
by pulling the proton, often changing it
back into ammonia, which you can smell.

340
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,970
Okay. But when he treated it with
sodium hydroxide, he didn't get ammonia.

341
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,010
Okay. Or you can test. So it doesn't
behave like an ammonium salt,

342
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,420
nor did it behave like a, like a
cyanide salt. If you treat it with acid,

343
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:52,090
you don't get the smell
of science cyanic acid.

344
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,140
And if you treat it with LEDs,
you don't get led sign and eight.

345
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,920
So it appears not to be either
ammonia or the cyanic acid anymore.

346
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,150
Okay.

347
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,320
But what it did do when treated with
nitric acid was to give brilliant crystal

348
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:09,154
flakes.

349
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,990
So the crystals were what allowed him to
identify it and he knew that you've got

350
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:18,310
the same thing when you
treated urea with nitric acid,

351
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,240
just like those from urea and nitric acid.
Right.

352
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,190
So this raised the question for its alias,
wrote to Villar in reply to that,

353
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:31,870
it is a unique situation that the
assault nature so entirely disappears.

354
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:36,871
It doesn't look like dualism anymore
when the acid of the ammonia combined one

355
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:40,090
that will certainly be most
enlightening for future theory.

356
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:45,070
So might Imodium, Cya,
Nate actually be urea,

357
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,300
might urea ammonium Cya.
Nate with very curious properties.

358
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,670
So vola wrote back to personalities.

359
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:56,500
I recently performed a small experiment
appropriate to the limited time I have

360
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,840
available. He was doing a
lot of teaching at this time,

361
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:04,180
which I quickly completed in which thank
God, did not require a single analysis.

362
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:09,010
That was what was a pain in
the neck to do. So this was,

363
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:10,840
this is the data from,
from uh,

364
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:15,100
Villers letter and the same thing
was published his paper in 1828.

365
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:20,020
So it turned out that doctor proud to
physician in London had already analyzed

366
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:24,490
urea and reported its composition
in terms of nitrogen, carbon,

367
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,640
hydrogen, and oxygen. That
is its ultimate analysis.

368
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,730
And volar without doing an experiment,

369
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,890
knew what the analysis should be
for ammonium sayand aid, right?

370
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:39,070
Because he had births,
aliases, atomic weights,

371
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,390
so he could calculate for a substance of
that formula what the percent by weight

372
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:46,730
should be. And they agreed.
You can see very, very well.

373
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,490
So it looked like urea
and ammonium signed.

374
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:53,030
It had the same analysis and
therefore where the same thing,

375
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,870
okay, the discrepancies were
less than 2%. Remember the,

376
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:01,840
the atomic weights are only
good to about 1% okay. So the,

377
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:04,640
therefore these things appear
to be identical. In fact,

378
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,240
it's interesting to compare them with
the modern values, which you see here.

379
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,400
What do you notice in the first row?

380
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,060
Okay,

381
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,160
when you compare the numbers
in the first row, Russell?

382
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,590
Yeah.

383
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,670
What's the same?
Which is better experiment or theory?

384
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,213
What?

385
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,950
No, no. The first, the first is
Prouts analysis. The first column,

386
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,430
the last column is Brett's
alias volar theory.

387
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,910
And the middle is what we think is correct
because it's based on what we have.

388
00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:52,740
Now what do you say? Aha. So there
is a good lesson for us, right?

389
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,660
Experiment is better than theory,
but if you look more closely,

390
00:24:57,661 --> 00:25:02,520
there's a much more interesting story
here. So the moral is don't dry lab,

391
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:06,840
don't be like Lavoie Oza and try to
make your experiments conform to theory.

392
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,510
Right?
So because of that dot,

393
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:14,580
Dr Prout has gotten a reputation among
historians of science as a paragon of

394
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:19,920
accuracy and honesty. The very
model for x lab work. Right?

395
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,280
Okay. But let's look more
carefully. You notice, for example,

396
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,430
that he didn't make these things
add up to a hundred percent.

397
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,620
Would you expect them to?
What would love,

398
00:25:28,621 --> 00:25:32,010
what would happen if it had been Lavoie
Xia doing it? What would they add it to?

399
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,760
100% exactly here at this.
And why not?

400
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,550
Because he's being honest. Maybe. Okay.

401
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:45,780
So notice incidentally that the theory
didn't add up to a hundred percent.

402
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:50,160
Now how do you get those numbers?
How would volar have gotten those numbers?

403
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:54,960
He decided how many atoms of
nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen,
there are in the compound.

404
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,820
He'd see according to the atomic weights,

405
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:00,240
how much each of those would
way he'd add them all together.

406
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,081
That would be the total.

407
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:05,400
And then he'd divide each one by the
total to get how many percent it was.

408
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,920
Is that clear to everyone
how you do about it?

409
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,190
So how do you do that and not get
it to add to a hundred percent?

410
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,540
Well, I recalculate it using Burt's
alias numbers and that's what I got.

411
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,100
Now you'll notice a couple things
here. One here, you'll notice what,

412
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,350
okay,

413
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,430
did he just truncated numbers?
He didn't round them off, right?

414
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:39,250
So it's always going to be low and
indeed it is low. His um, but that,

415
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:42,650
that's not low enough. Right?
What else do you notice

416
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,070
Angela?
He switched the numbers in the last row.

417
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,603
Okay.

418
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:58,960
He made an error. But the important thing
is he didn't notice. He made the error.

419
00:26:58,961 --> 00:27:03,550
He added it up and sought. It
was 99.8 and thought, well,

420
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:05,320
what the heck?
It's 99.8.

421
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,300
It didn't because this was early days
of doing this kind of stuff. Okay.

422
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:15,430
Now, so we come over to doctor
prout is this experimental candor?

423
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,250
Well,
you find out if you add the numbers,

424
00:27:18,251 --> 00:27:21,820
it's actually 99.94 or
five he added wrong.

425
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,150
Okay.
And now,

426
00:27:25,151 --> 00:27:29,470
but those things really agreed right now.

427
00:27:29,471 --> 00:27:34,180
You wonder how did old doctor prout do
this to measure it to one part in 5,000

428
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,320
right?

429
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,700
It turned out he measured the volume
of the gas and Hoodie reported was 6.3

430
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:42,490
cubic inches of gas.
Right?

431
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,810
So was he just lucky that it happened to
be right to force significant figures?

432
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,783
No,

433
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,080
because that's not how
he did the experiment.

434
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:53,750
What he reported was not
actually experimental.

435
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,270
He had a theory about atomic weights.

436
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,300
His theory was that everything
was made of hydrogen,

437
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,360
which isn't so far wrong
in terms of weight, right?

438
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:05,870
Because a proton and the neutron and
have the same way to Proton is hydrogen.

439
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:09,740
So everything is a sum of protons
and neutrons. Prac for weight.

440
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:14,180
The electrons are don't count
for much. Right? So it's
not actually such a bad, uh,

441
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:19,220
theory. So in his system, carbon was six,
oxygen, eight, nitrogen 14, you know,

442
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:22,790
that was what Integer, you
multiply them by. Incidentally,

443
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:27,110
hydrogen was called protitle from Proto,
let's say from Ila [inaudible],

444
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,670
which means the first substance.
Okay? So he had this theory.

445
00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:35,870
So what he did was do a proximate
analysis, get about what the ratio is,

446
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:39,830
figure out what the ratio should
be in terms of small whole numbers,

447
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:43,310
and then multiplying by
his atomic weights. That's,

448
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,070
so these numbers are not
really experimental numbers.

449
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,540
They're more likely Lavoie Waze.

450
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,290
All right. So, uh,

451
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:57,160
so what he said was it was one, one to
one, and that gives those numbers. Okay.

452
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,391
So proud.

453
00:28:58,391 --> 00:29:02,890
Did dry lab by making an
approximate analysis and
reporting results corrected by

454
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:07,660
his theory and so much for the paragon
of accuracy and honesty as far as we

455
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:09,400
would see it.
Okay.

456
00:29:09,401 --> 00:29:14,380
But his theory was better than
parts alias as experiments.

457
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,410
That's interesting.

458
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,480
Okay,
so now ammonium sign it to Rio.

459
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,600
Let's review that from the point of
view of what we've been talking about.

460
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,340
So you have ammonium,
what makes it reacted?

461
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,123
Dana?

462
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,630
Hi Homo or low Lumo.

463
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,960
It's got a positive charge.
That's

464
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,140
one clue.

465
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,400
Anybody got an idea,
John?

466
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,401
And what?

467
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:56,990
What do you suppose that low little
bio is in terms of localized orbitals?

468
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:59,060
We're not going to talk about things
to go over the whole molecule.

469
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,790
There's not much to deal
with here at pneumonia.

470
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,993
You and you

471
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,523
can't hear very well

472
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,460
sigma star of Nh. Okay. So
that'll be a, that'll be the Lumo.

473
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,230
How about a homo on the other side?

474
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,053
There's a hint.

475
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,350
Okay. Unshared pair on nitrogen
with a negative charge. Okay,

476
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,140
so we've got these and we can do the,

477
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:37,130
the make and break trick attack
the Sigma Star with that.

478
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,223
Right?

479
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,640
So we've got back to ammonia
and cyanic acid, the uh,

480
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,640
possible starting place for getting there.
But if you have these two things,

481
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:51,110
you can react them with one another.
What makes ammonia reactive? Nh. Three.

482
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,630
High Homo. The unshared payer.
And how about the cyanic acid?

483
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,320
What do you see that it looks
like a functional group.

484
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,170
Don't worry too much about
how big it has to be.

485
00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:11,970
Just see something that looks
familiar. C O Double Bond. Pi Star,

486
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:15,740
right. Okay. Now so we can,

487
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,840
so one of these can attack the other
and we could arrange them like that and

488
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:22,110
draw curved Arrow and we could
attack the co double bond.

489
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,130
But you could also attack
the CN double bond.

490
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:31,670
And in fact these aren't so different
because when you attack one and make an

491
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:35,640
unshared pair on the other,
in this case, for example,

492
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,530
that high homo on the nitrogen,

493
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:42,270
the end minus can be stabilized by mixing
with the Pi Star of the carbon eel.

494
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,480
Right?
So you could actually draw it either way.

495
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,330
So it really doesn't make any difference
which way you draw it at the beginning.

496
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:55,750
But what you can do is then have a
further reaction that the homeowner on the

497
00:31:57,591 --> 00:32:00,350
bottom reacting with the sigma star.
Again,

498
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:04,670
although they probably can't
line up bright within a molecule,

499
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:09,410
it's probably one molecule attacking
another molecule to do this. Okay.

500
00:32:09,411 --> 00:32:13,580
And get the hydrogen transfer.
And that is urea. Okay.

501
00:32:13,581 --> 00:32:16,900
So there's how you go from ammonium
signed eight d urea. It's quite uneasy,

502
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,290
a chain of events.

503
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:23,291
You could have done it the other way too
like that and you'd get this compound.

504
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,550
But those molecules,

505
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:30,080
those molecules that the urea and this
one can lose a proton, go back on Louis,

506
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,910
go back on one side or the other.

507
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,610
And ultimately you get the
one that's more stable,

508
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:37,070
which is the one that has the
carbon oxygen double bond,

509
00:32:37,071 --> 00:32:39,560
which is a very stable molecule,

510
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:43,220
a very stable grouping as we'll
learn later in terms of law.

511
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,790
You can actually understand it in
terms of Homo Lumo mixing here too.

512
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,750
But any rate, that's what
happened. So the question arises,

513
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,830
can ammonium cyanide exist
or does it always change?

514
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,850
Is there such assault or does it
always change to, to uh, urea.

515
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,590
And in fact it done.

516
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:05,110
It's our old pal and you're a great uncle.
Uh,

517
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,360
in 1998 with Kenneth Harris did an x ray
structure that showed that you can have

518
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,200
ammonium sign eight.

519
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:15,200
This was the first time that had
ever been proved to be to exist.

520
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,330
And there's what it,
what it looks like,

521
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,480
but notice the nitrogens on the ammonia
there point toward oxygen's not toward

522
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:27,800
nitrogens. So it's not, so you
couldn't, from this arrangement,

523
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:30,230
you couldn't have done that thing that we,
that we,

524
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:33,350
the mechanism that we drew in
order to get from here to there.

525
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,610
Okay.
So but that,

526
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,720
but the fact of getting
urea of product, of, of uh,

527
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:46,280
of animal metabolism from purely
as far as they were concerned,

528
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:51,310
inorganic things which is said to have
done away with the idea of vitalism was

529
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:53,120
not from my perspective,

530
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:57,320
the most important contribution here
because this is what Voltaire wrote toward

531
00:33:57,321 --> 00:34:02,321
the end of that paper in 1828 I refrain
from all considerations which so

532
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:07,470
naturally suggest themselves from this
fact is that is that ammonium signed

533
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:12,471
eight and urea have the same analysis
especially in respect to the composition

534
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:18,371
ratios of organic substances and re
in respect to similar elemental and

535
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:23,330
quantitative compositions among compounds
with very different properties as

536
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:27,710
maybe supposed among others of
full Minnick acid and cyanic acid.

537
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,610
We already did those.

538
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:32,300
That was a problem early on when
we were drawing Lewis structures,

539
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,040
so two different arrangements at the same
atoms and have a liquid hydrocarbon in

540
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:43,070
the old defiant gas,
the Ola finance gas,

541
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:48,071
the gas that will make an oil is ethylene
and ch two ch two but that's very

542
00:34:48,591 --> 00:34:49,400
similar to the,

543
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:54,400
that's exactly the same ratio of Adams
as you have in a long hydrocarbon.

544
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:56,000
If it has a double bond in it,

545
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,250
it must be left to further investigation
of many similar cases to decide what

546
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:03,710
general laws can be defined there from.
Now this,

547
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,270
this is an interesting point because
when people have certain tools available,

548
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,990
they tend to think that that's all
the tools that could be available and

549
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:16,190
therefore it gives all the
information that's possible, right?

550
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:18,500
So if what you can do
is elemental analysis,

551
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,290
you think that once you have
the ratio of the elements,

552
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:23,210
you know everything about the substance.

553
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,650
But what he shows here is that there can
be different substances that have the

554
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:31,850
same elemental analysis like
urea and ammonium cyanide.

555
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:37,250
So the possibility of saw Mariza's
showed there was more to be known.

556
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,940
Then people thought when all they
could do was elemental analysis.

557
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,660
So full Minuchin cyanic
acid was very important.

558
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,760
As we'll see in just a second.

559
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,490
Now puts alias wrote a paper just two
years later in 1830 on the composition of

560
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:54,900
tartaric acid.
Remember we,

561
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:59,950
we spoke before about how
pervasive tartaric acid is
in the 19th century and the

562
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,220
development of organic
chemistry and receive,

563
00:36:03,221 --> 00:36:07,580
make acid also called John's
acid from the vose, uh,

564
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,370
on the atomic weight of lead oxide
together with general marks on substances

565
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:14,250
that have the same composition
but different properties.

566
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,750
So he found that tartaric acid and this
John's acid from the vogue also called

567
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:19,740
receive make acid,

568
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:24,330
had exactly the same analysis
their salts did right.

569
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:29,670
And here in fact, as a picture of it,
I have the actual stuff right here.

570
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:34,740
This is from a court,
from a wine bottle and on top of it here,

571
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,330
if we're lucky, see, uh,

572
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,750
you can see those. And
that's the, that we,

573
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:49,020
we took one of the crystals and put it on
the x Ray. There's what they look like.

574
00:36:49,021 --> 00:36:53,430
They're beautiful little crystals and
their calcium. Tartrate. So I remember it.

575
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,640
You get a tartaric acid grows from
tartar on the walls of the wine barrels.

576
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,190
Okay. But this is what was
important, I thought at,

577
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,660
he wanted to give a name
for this phenomenon, things
that had the same analysis,

578
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:07,710
but we're clearly different.

579
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:12,630
I thought it necessarily to choose
between the words homo synthetic and ISO

580
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,020
Merrick.

581
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,070
The former is built from homos equivalent
and synth atos put together the latter

582
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:19,470
from Eso.
Mary's has the same meaning,

583
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,710
although it only properly says
put together from the same pieces.

584
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,880
The latter has the advantage with
respect to brevity and Ufuk [inaudible].

585
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,720
So it's shorter and it sounds
easier to say. So from now on,

586
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:35,721
we're going to choose isomers isomer to
talk about this phenomenon by isometrics

587
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,901
substances.

588
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:41,010
I understand those which possess the
same chemical composition and the same

589
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:45,480
atomic. By that he means molecular
weight, but different properties.

590
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,970
Okay,
so that's where isomers came from.

591
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,250
It showed there was more to be discovered.

592
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,330
There must be something about how these
pieces are put together that's different.

593
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,760
But how can you possibly find that out?

594
00:37:56,761 --> 00:38:00,720
Just by doing reactions
in weighing things. Okay.

595
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:05,580
Same chemical composition, but
different properties. Okay?

596
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:08,490
So there's more to chemistry
than the analytical composition,

597
00:38:08,491 --> 00:38:10,140
which is what they were good at measuring.

598
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,040
Now we know the importance of
atomic arrangement or structure.

599
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:19,170
So there are four cs that we'll
organize things about, composition,

600
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:24,710
constitution configuration
and con formation.

601
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,980
But you gotta be, patient does
take a little while to get there.

602
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:33,780
It was several more decades.
Okay? Now these, uh,

603
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,840
isomers of CNO have been calculated
to death in 2004 and we actually did a

604
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:44,170
problem, sat and showed these
earlier on. But here's what they are.

605
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:47,450
They're cyanic acid.
And notice this is the same anti in,

606
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,140
but you pulled the proton off
one end and put it on the other.

607
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,580
It's somewhat less stable, but
they interconvert easily. Okay?

608
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,540
There's the one, when you put nitrogen
in the middle, it's considerably higher.

609
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:00,220
That's called full Minnick acid.

610
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,250
And if you put the hydrogen
on the other end of that one.

611
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,700
Now the bottom one is what
volar we're working with,

612
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:11,770
but the top one was being studied by the
other Guy Liebig, the full Minnick acid.

613
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:13,360
And the name comes from Fullman,

614
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:18,361
which means lightning because I like so
many young lads leave big enjoyed things

615
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:23,920
that would blow up, right? He blew the
window out of the pharmacy where he was,

616
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,150
where he was serving as a,
as an apprentice, right?

617
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:32,140
And then he went to gay loose
sock to work on silver fulminate,

618
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:36,600
which is not great stuff to work on as
people who know from fulminate snow,

619
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,580
but any on 1824,
he was in Paris working on that.

620
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:42,070
And Galas sock noticed the paper from,

621
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:47,430
from Voler on the analysis of silver it
and saw that they had the same analysis.

622
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,020
So he, he got them
together. Gay Lusaka did.

623
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:54,070
Now know that when we're going to talk
much more about the interaction of those

624
00:39:54,071 --> 00:39:54,551
two guys,

625
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:59,140
but notice in this portrait of leaving
that there is a device down in the bottom

626
00:39:59,141 --> 00:39:59,921
right.
Remember,

627
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:02,860
people when they got their portraits made
always put something they thought was

628
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:07,450
significant there. So this is what he
thought was significant. And here it is.

629
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,873
Okay.

630
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:13,410
It's not the actual one. This is,
uh, uh, made by our glass blower.

631
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,463
Yeah.

632
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,740
And you've seen it before.
For example,

633
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:21,940
you come by this,

634
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,290
when you're hurrying to
class and notice right there,

635
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,970
same thing,
right?

636
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,440
Or if any of you are a student members
of the American Chemical Society that's

637
00:40:34,441 --> 00:40:39,441
on the logo because that was the most
important device of the 19th century for

638
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:45,810
organic chemistry.
It's called the five bulb apparatus.

639
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,710
The food's Kugel opera.
Okay.

640
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,740
And it was used by liebig for analysis.

641
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,220
So here's how [inaudible] did
his analysis and you can see the,

642
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:58,190
the five bald apparatus here.
So,

643
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,610
so he had a too much like
Brett's aliases in which the,

644
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,900
he put burning charcoal in there to
heat it up and generate the gases,

645
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,430
but on a much smaller scale
than Brits alias did. Okay.

646
00:41:10,431 --> 00:41:14,630
It came through a drying agent that
collected the water, that was a product,

647
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:19,760
and then it came into the,
this the fifth Kugel Operat,

648
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,830
uh, which was the co two collectors.
So in here with sodium hydroxide,

649
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:29,810
right. And what the way it worked was, it
was tilted a little bit. You notice that?

650
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:30,520
That it's,

651
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,150
that it's propped up here with some pieces
of wood so that the bottom isn't flat.

652
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,410
It's tilted like this.
Okay, so the gas comes in.

653
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,053
Yeah.

654
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:51,080
And because it's tilted, it bubbles
from one to the next. Right.

655
00:41:51,081 --> 00:41:54,420
So mix as well and absorbed.
So you don't remember Lavoie Z.

656
00:41:54,421 --> 00:41:58,040
I needed a couple of guys standing there
to stir those things so that the CEO

657
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:02,780
too, this was self collecting,
right? And then at the end,

658
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,210
you're cool. You're cool.
The thing I'm now notice,

659
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:06,800
what do you notice about the bulbs?
Here?

660
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,660
There are different size and
you had to put it this way,

661
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,520
not this way.

662
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,080
Why did you have to do it this way?

663
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,053
Okay.

664
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:27,240
Because what happened at the end?
You stop the fire and it would suck back.

665
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,270
So this had to be big enough to hold
all the liquid. This one didn't.

666
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,490
So they were different size.

667
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:44,060
You don't want to make both of them big
because you want to keep it as light as

668
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,460
possible.
It was made out of very thin glass.

669
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:51,380
So there's only one that still exists
that, that, uh, that Leiby cad.

670
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,620
And, uh, so it was tilted for the
reason we said, and here's the,

671
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,040
here's the original one,
which is still in, in, uh,

672
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,420
in Giesen in Germany where
he was a professor then. I,

673
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,270
but this was a great
advance because with this,

674
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,540
a single student could do three analyses
in a day rather than whether than,

675
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,370
uh, Lavoie Zia is big machine that
required for people working forever or,

676
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,620
or, but sale Ileus,
which required, you know,

677
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:21,440
waiting overnight for the co two
to be absorbed all and so on.

678
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:24,230
So this was the most important thing.
And everybody,

679
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:29,060
all the students who wanted to be organic
canvas went to learn how to do this in

680
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:33,890
Giessen. So liebig is every, almost
every one's great, great, great, great,

681
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:35,930
great. Whatever, grandfather in chemistry,

682
00:43:35,931 --> 00:43:39,980
because all the people who went out to
teach studied how to do this with him in

683
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:40,814
Giessen.

684
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,680
So here's a portrait a little
bit later portrait of, of uh,

685
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,140
liebig after he had gone to Munich
to be a big wheel and, and uh,

686
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,660
but again, he chose in his portrait to
have a picture of the film of Kugel.

687
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:57,440
Operat. But if you look at it carefully,
you see something very interesting.

688
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,430
You see what it is.

689
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,460
As far as I know no one
ever noticed this before.

690
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,300
It's hooked up backwards.

691
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,960
How could he possibly have
hooked it up backwards?

692
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:19,460
He must told hundreds of students over
the years, look, when you put it together,

693
00:44:19,461 --> 00:44:20,870
you put it this way,
not this way.

694
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:24,620
It's like which to buy the condenser
you connect to the water, right?

695
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:28,550
It's exactly the same kind of thing,
right?

696
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:33,600
So I just think that's amazing that he
did. He didn't notice that. But anyhow,

697
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,490
uh, there we got it backwards. Okay.

698
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:42,180
This was his teaching laboratory, which
still exists in Giessen. It's a museum.

699
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:46,230
It's interesting to go there and
there's a, uh, uh, on the wall,

700
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:49,740
there's this thing and it shows all of
his students and Grad students and great

701
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:52,620
grands students who became
distinguished professors.

702
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:57,630
And the ones in red are ones who got the
Nobel prize, the ones with red on them,

703
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,820
and you could,
you could extend it now.

704
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,020
It just stops in the middle of the 20th
century practically everyone's descended

705
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:06,840
from Lee. Be Concluding you. Okay,

706
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:12,140
this is his lab and here this is uh,
uh,

707
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:16,710
here's the orientee Gosa
from Mexico and he was,

708
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,160
he was supposed to be so good at analysis
that he could do better than leaving

709
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:25,140
did. Right. So he's the one that got to
hold the five co five bulb apparatus.

710
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,430
And what do you notice about it?
He's holding it upside down.

711
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:31,860
The potassium hydroxide would run out,
right?

712
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:37,260
And this guy is AWS Hoffman who there's a,

713
00:45:37,261 --> 00:45:41,150
there's this thing of him is a master
in shining teacher of chemistry at

714
00:45:41,151 --> 00:45:44,520
triumphant discover of
analysts and aniline dyes.

715
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:48,680
And he also was the guy that was
really good at languages and,

716
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:51,900
and devised a lot of the
names we use nowadays.

717
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:57,170
So we'll talk about that later
and hear in the background.

718
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:00,840
Looking through a window into the lab is,
it looks to me,

719
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,540
I'm not sure that that's what it is,
but it looks like a bust.

720
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,930
Is it look like a bus to you.
And if it's a bust,

721
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:10,890
it's probably this bust of Levy.
So there's,

722
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,610
it's fun to go there.
Okay.

723
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:17,010
So in 1832 leave,

724
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:21,720
Vic and volar collaborated to
develop the law, the radical theory,

725
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,080
and we'll just give an introduction to
that and not go all the way through it.

726
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,740
So leave, we can fully remember had
been introduced by Gailey's SOC.

727
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,160
So they were the same age and
doing similar kinds of things.

728
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:37,610
So they first met in Frankfurt at 1825
and five years later when they were

729
00:46:39,691 --> 00:46:41,730
writing, they first used
the familiar, you know,

730
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:44,760
like two and in French or do in Germany.

731
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:47,850
If you're a really great friends with
someone, you know, within the family,

732
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:52,590
you use that. So they became
great pals and in 1832, uh,

733
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,680
volar said,
I longed to do some more significant work.

734
00:46:55,770 --> 00:47:00,480
Shouldn't we try to shed some light on
the confusion about the oil of bitter

735
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:04,380
almonds. But where to get material. Right.

736
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,220
So you know, Baker, JT
Baker didn't exist then,

737
00:47:08,221 --> 00:47:12,600
but if they were now they could just
order up a order up a bottle of it.

738
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,110
So C, can you smell this? Yeah,

739
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,750
you recognize the owner here. We'll
pass it around carefully. Don't drop it.

740
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:24,870
It's not that bad,

741
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:28,170
but you don't want to drop it and
see if you recognize the odor.

742
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,500
Like almonds is the oil of
better almonds. Good. Okay.

743
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,030
Okay.
So in June of 1832 just the next month,

744
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,010
liebig wrote to his pal volar and said,
my poor dear volar,

745
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:48,280
how empty is every comfort against such
a loss because his young wife had just

746
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:51,850
died. When I think how content
happy you were during your move,

747
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:54,850
what attachment and love you had
for one another. The good wife,

748
00:47:54,851 --> 00:47:58,510
so young and full of life, so
irreplaceable for her parents and for you.

749
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:02,080
Come to us Derval are, although we
may not be able to give you a comfort,

750
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:04,900
we will perhaps be able to
help you bury your grief.

751
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,470
Stayed in castle at this time would
only be detrimental to your health.

752
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:10,540
We need to be busy with something.

753
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:15,340
I have just been able to get some of
Migdal and from Paris and I'm ordering 25

754
00:48:15,341 --> 00:48:19,090
pounds of bitter almonds. You must
not travel. You must busy herself,

755
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:23,740
but not in castle. I haven't had the
courage to tell my wife yet. Come to us.

756
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,450
I expect you at the end of this week.

757
00:48:25,451 --> 00:48:27,850
Know what he didn't want to tell her
about was the death of Fuller's wife

758
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:29,260
obviously.
Okay,

759
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:33,280
so then in July volar says it came,

760
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:35,890
the oil of bitter almonds has
come with the books from Paris.

761
00:48:35,891 --> 00:48:38,230
I've kept half of it and I'm
here with sending you the rest.

762
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:41,800
I've already started all kinds of
experiments with it without being able to

763
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:45,070
obtain any precise results.
It seems to be a hard nut.

764
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:49,750
This is an example of
[inaudible] lame sense of humor.

765
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,610
He did this all the time.

766
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,320
I'm coming soon to you and we'll be able
to report so they work together for two

767
00:48:56,321 --> 00:49:01,210
weeks on this and develop the most
important theory on basis of these

768
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:03,670
experiments. Volar returned. He said,

769
00:49:03,671 --> 00:49:07,120
here I am again in my gloomy lonesomeness
not knowing how to thank you for all

770
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:09,940
the love with which you took
me in and kept me for so long.

771
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,300
How happy I was to work with you
from moment to moment here with,

772
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,510
I'm sending the paper on
oil of bitter almonds.

773
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,780
So next time we'll talk about what they
did with their oil and bitter almonds.
