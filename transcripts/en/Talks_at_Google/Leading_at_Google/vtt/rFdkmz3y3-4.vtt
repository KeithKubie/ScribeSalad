JIMMY PEARSON: So
without further ado,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.946
I'll bring up Rob Smith.

00:00:08.946 --> 00:00:09.898
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.403 --> 00:00:12.278
ROB SMITH: Thank you.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.090
JIMMY PEARSON: So I
talk to Rob beforehand

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.970
about maybe letting him give
his own biography because I'm

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.400
pretty sure I wouldn't be
able to do it any justice.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.704
ROB SMITH: Yeah, so here I am.

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:27.120
Well, first of all, I want to
thank you all for having me.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.960
I really appreciate having the
platform and the opportunity

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.560
to talk about my book, but
also talk about all the issues

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.250
that we're going to
discuss, that are about it.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.330
So my name is Rob Smith.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.890
I'm, among other
things, the author

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.014
of "Confessions of a Don't
Ask, Don't Tell Soldier:

00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:44.380
How a Black Gay Man Survived
the Infantry Coming Out

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.430
in the War in
Iraq," which is what

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.710
we're going to be talking
a lot about today.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.180
I'm also a lot of
different things.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.520
I'm a black man, I'm a
gay man, I'm a veteran.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.642
I'm somebody who--
yeah, yeah, right?

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:57.350
JIMMY PEARSON: Right,
yeah, that's right.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.725
ROB SMITH: And there is not--
and it's really interesting

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:02.240
that I got that
shout out, because I

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.260
work in media right now.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
So I'm kind of like an
activist turned journalist.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.440
So I'm a journalist at
Yahoo Finance right now.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.590
And there are-- a lot
of these identities

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.090
that I inhabit are very
under-represented in media

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.340
today and in tech.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.230
So it feels good to get
that shout out as a veteran.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.234
So, yeah, I'm the
author of this book.

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:26.900
I'm a black man.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.380
I'm a gay man.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.020
I'm a veteran.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.870
I'm a lot of different things.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.490
And I won't bore you with
going through the form bio,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.867
but that's all on the website,
robsmith.online.com and find it

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:39.200
on the Twitter bio and all that.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.339
So I hope you guys like
look me up, and follow me,

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:42.380
and all that other stuff.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.280
JIMMY PEARSON: Yeah, and
actually while we're at it,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.071
I should say there are
copies of Rob's book

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:51.480
available in the back for
$10, getting a nod, cool.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.290
So if you are interested,
they're available in the back.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.480
And we will also have time
for questions at the end.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.372
So friendly reminder up front,
and I'll repeat it again,

00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:01.580
when you do have a question,
don't just shout it out.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.180
Line up behind the mics so that
we can get it on the recording.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.550
ROB SMITH: And I'll be around
to sign any copies that

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.974
are purchased today as well.

00:02:08.974 --> 00:02:10.280
JIMMY PEARSON: Cool.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.960
So yesterday was
international coming out day.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.070
And there is a really
interesting excerpt

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.182
in your book from when
you came out to your mom.

00:02:18.182 --> 00:02:20.390
And I thought given that
international coming out day

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.640
was yesterday, that might
be an appropriate place

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.320
to start if you want, if
you don't mind reading it.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.945
ROB SMITH: I don't
mind reading at all,

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:28.360
that's while we're here.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.350
Yeah, yesterday
was coming out day.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.600
And did a lot of
tweeting, usually

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.540
do talks on coming out day.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.030
To me, coming out
day is about being

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.532
represented in all of your
identities everywhere you are.

00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:43.740
I don't have to come out as
a black man all the time.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.115
This is the first thing that
people see when they see me.

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:50.630
But I am put in the position
to come out as a gay man,

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.200
over, and over, and over
again, and you pick and choose

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.720
the different ways that
you want to come out.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.790
Now this excerpt that
I'm going to read right

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.720
now is me coming out over
the phone to my mother

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.450
when I was very young,
and when I was just

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.980
starting out in the military.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.990
It did not go
well, and I'll just

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.560
read this little bit for you.

00:03:13.957 --> 00:03:15.540
I opened the door
to the barracks room

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.140
slowly and discreetly and picked
up the phone to dial my mother.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.700
I wasn't sure why
I felt the need

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.400
to do to provide a
teaser to a conversation

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.740
that we wouldn't be
having for two months,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.930
but a strong sense of
relief had come over me

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.450
ever since I admitted it to
myself, I'm gay, I like guys.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.600
I heard her warm, yet gravelly
voice, on the other end.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.190
She'd obviously been smoking.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.170
"Hello," she said.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.760
"Hey mom, it's me,
how you doing?"

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.125
"Fine, and you?"

00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:44.790
"I'm OK, what are you up to?"

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.230
"Just driving,
Robert, what's up?"

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.960
"Uh, nothing."

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.640
I felt my throat
begin to close up.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.890
I suddenly became
tense and nervous,

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.912
and I was struggling to
find the words to say.

00:03:55.912 --> 00:03:57.370
"So why are you
calling me, Robert?

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.100
I'm on the road driving."

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.519
Husband number three
lived in North Carolina.

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.060
He worked for a
truck driving company

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.130
that delivered loads
of various products

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.660
all across the country.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.030
She'd moved down my
senior year of high school

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.400
and embarked on a career
in driving, leaving

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.990
me to live with
paternal grandparents

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.910
for the remainder of my time.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.351
"Um, OK, you know I'm coming
back home for Christmas,

00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:17.850
right?"

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.024
"Yes, Robert, I know."

00:04:20.024 --> 00:04:23.310
"Well, there's something I
wanted to talk to you about."

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.801
There was a long uncomfortable
stream of absolute silence.

00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:28.800
I could hear the wind
whipping in the background

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.320
from the cracked window
of her 18 wheeler.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.080
I wondered what city she was
driving to this time, what

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.390
the scenery was like
wherever she was,

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.430
anything to fill the silence.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.119
After what seemed like forever,
she continued, "What is it?

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:44.160
You're not gay, are you?"

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.710
The words hit me like a
well-timed punch to the gut.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.400
My knees buckled a little bit.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.170
And I stumbled onto the
corner of my bed, shocked.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.100
"Well, what if I was?"

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.425
I said, in a quiet
little boy voice.

00:04:58.425 --> 00:05:00.990
"Robert, you know that's not
allowed in the army," she said.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.020
"You also know that's
not God's plan."

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.290
Her voice was cold and
harsh, unforgiving.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.566
Whatever the words to
respond to this were,

00:05:09.566 --> 00:05:10.440
I couldn't find them.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.850
"Do you hear me?"

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.370
She said.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.390
I felt like I was adrift, like
I was floating above myself

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.870
watching this happen.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.610
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.770
I was supposed to
call and give her

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.307
a primer that I wanted to
talk to her about something,

00:05:24.307 --> 00:05:26.390
so that maybe it wouldn't
be such a big shock when

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.169
I told her during the holiday.

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.960
When I did tell her
after Christmas dinner,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.660
she would hug me and tell
me that she loved me,

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.540
and that I was her
son no matter what.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.430
I would hug her
back as tears of joy

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.610
streamed down my cheeks,
while flurries of perfectly

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.160
soft white snow fell outside.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.070
That was how it was supposed
to happen, but it wasn't.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.010
It was happening right now,
and I wasn't exactly feeling

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.720
the love.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.342
"Yes, I hear you," I said,
in a low-defeated croak.

00:05:55.342 --> 00:05:58.062
"And you better not tell anybody
else either, you hear me boy?

00:05:58.062 --> 00:05:59.770
Those people there
are not to be trusted,

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.070
and you can't be
getting kicked out.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.528
How are you going to pay for
college if you get kicked out?

00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:04.940
Where you going to live?"

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.025
"I don't know, mom."

00:06:06.025 --> 00:06:08.086
"I know you don't.

00:06:08.086 --> 00:06:09.460
Is that what you
called me about?

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.990
I got to get back to driving.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.640
Call me next week."

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.730
She hung up, and I sat on the
edge of the bed, motionless.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.090
Soon after, I
realized I was crying.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.610
Out in the distance I could
hear the faint chant of soldiers

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.000
calling cadence while they ran.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.010
Their voices comforted me.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.270
When I heard them, it was
almost as if I wasn't so alone.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.815
And it was only when they
stopped that I knew I was.

00:06:34.926 --> 00:06:35.878
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.170
JIMMY PEARSON: Thank
you for reading that.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.820
I think, it's actually
kind of funny,

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.859
because I feel my own heart
rate rising as I sit here,

00:06:45.859 --> 00:06:48.150
hearing you read it, because
I think a lot of-- there's

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.880
a lot of similarities between
a lot of coming out experience.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.902
And clearly, I
could see that you

00:06:52.902 --> 00:06:55.235
were transported back there
a little bit as you read it.

00:06:55.235 --> 00:06:58.572
And I appreciate you
sharing that with us.

00:06:58.572 --> 00:07:00.030
One thing I wanted
to ask you about

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.830
is the very end of
that passage where

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.260
you talk about hearing
the soldier's calling

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.579
cadence in the background and
feeling comforted, but then

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:08.620
feeling very, very alone.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.227
And I wanted to ask you, I think
that that points to something

00:07:12.227 --> 00:07:14.310
that kind of runs throughout
the book, of the Army

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.400
being a source of community
and a source of comfort

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.392
in a lot of
circumstances, but also,

00:07:19.392 --> 00:07:20.850
in some ways,
because of Don't Ask,

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:26.190
Don't Tell, exacerbating your
loneliness at the same time.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.450
Was it both of those things?

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.360
Was it really more one of
those things than the other?

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.650
What was that
juxtaposition like for you?

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.024
ROB SMITH: You know, I think
it was both of those things.

00:07:35.024 --> 00:07:37.050
I think that when I
talk about the military,

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.360
and when you read the
book, you'll find out,

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.840
a lot of people think that
just writing this book,

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.000
that I'm here to
bash the military

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.610
or bash being a vet or
anything, because they actually

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.890
had that discriminatory
policy for so long.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.250
And that's not what I do.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.870
I think things are more--

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.390
there are more shades of gray.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.250
It's not a total
black and white thing.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.660
When I was in the
military, I did

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.050
feel completely isolated
from other people, purely

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.700
because of my
sexual orientation,

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.770
because I knew what it
was, and because I also

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.187
knew that I could get kicked out
of the military at any point.

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:10.020
And when I talk about
Don't Ask, Don't Tell,

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.410
and when I talk about
serving under that,

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.570
I think it's really
important for people

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:19.134
to realize that what happens
when you get kicked out under

00:08:19.134 --> 00:08:20.550
Don't Ask, Don't
Tell, is that you

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.050
get a dishonorable discharge.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.240
That means college
benefits gone,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.740
health care benefits gone.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.730
All of these things that have
made my life so much better

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.970
as a veteran, who did get
an honorable discharge,

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.600
would get taken away.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.831
And I think that
that really connects

00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:38.789
to a lot of the battles
that we're having right

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:45.000
now as an LGBTQ community about
equal workplace protections.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.570
Conversations that we're
having with trans people being

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.730
able to be open and out
about their identities

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.120
at work right now.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.590
So I felt very alone, very
isolated because of this.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.490
But at the same time, I had
a lot of good relationships

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.750
with people that I served with.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.120
I had a lot of good times.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.440
I felt a lot of camaraderie.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.350
I felt a brotherhood.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.740
And I only say brotherhood,
because the infantry was all

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.790
male.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.760
So that was a combat
position that wasn't

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.600
open to women at the time.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.730
So I really did feel all that.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.330
But at the same time,
having to serve under

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.370
Don't Ask, Don't Tell, made
it that much more difficult.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.690
I felt like I couldn't
be my entire self.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.440
We have these conversations
about bringing

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.250
our entire selves to the
workplace when we are LGBTQ,

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.220
or we are Latino,
or African-American,

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.630
or any of these other
different identities.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.080
And I felt like I couldn't
bring my entire identity

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.660
to that workplace.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.020
JIMMY PEARSON: Do you think
that that inhibited your ability

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.910
as a soldier in any way?

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.230
ROB SMITH: Absolutely, because
serving in the military

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.780
depends on you bringing
100% of yourself to the job.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.300
I was a good soldier.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.920
I was an OK soldier.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.110
I felt, when looking
back at it, I

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.790
feel like if I was
able to be out,

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.440
I could have been
a great soldier,

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.120
I could have been
an amazing soldier.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.560
Because I wouldn't have had to
have that barrier that's there,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.130
that had to be there to keep
me from everywhere else.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.800
I feel like right now, in
the position that I'm in,

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.840
whether it's reporting
at Yahoo Finance,

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.240
whether it's doing
talks, and things

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.604
like that, I'm able to bring
my entire self to work.

00:10:22.604 --> 00:10:25.020
And even though that may not
be the most comfortable thing

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.990
at all times for other people,
it's more comfortable for me,

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.092
because I feel like I don't
have anything to hide.

00:10:30.092 --> 00:10:31.800
I don't have to hide
the fact that I just

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.030
got married a month ago.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.840
I don't have to watch my--

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.270
Thanks.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:38.610
JIMMY PEARSON: Congratulations.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.870
ROB SMITH: Thank you.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.000
You guys will applaud if
you guys see his cape.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.130
Follow me on Instagram.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.340
His cape was amazing.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.614
But I don't have to pick
and choose my pronouns

00:10:49.614 --> 00:10:51.780
when I'm talking about the
person that's in my life,

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.720
I can say this is my husband,
and this is what's going on.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.730
And at that point
in time, yes, it

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.567
did make me feel completely
separated from everyone else,

00:10:59.567 --> 00:11:01.650
because I couldn't be open
about who I really was.

00:11:04.556 --> 00:11:06.430
JIMMY PEARSON: This
might get into a question

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.805
I was going to ask you after
your next reading, actually.

00:11:08.805 --> 00:11:12.575
Are there any ways that
you felt that as a gay man

00:11:12.575 --> 00:11:14.200
you could actually
be a better soldier,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.680
or you brought something
more to the table

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.859
than maybe your straight
brothers in arms did?

00:11:19.859 --> 00:11:21.400
ROB SMITH: You know,
that's so funny,

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.730
because I've never gotten
that question before.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.570
And so I really have
to think about it.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:29.800
And now that I'm thinking
about the question,

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.750
I think the only
thing that I can say,

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.420
as somebody who is
gay or somebody who

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:39.480
is a person of color,
I think that there's

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.930
an empathy that comes in seeing
the world from other people's

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:43.960
eyes.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.470
And when I get into the
chapters about Iraq in the book,

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.350
and I have a reading from Iraq
coming up a little bit later,

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.410
I think that I was
able to empathize

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.680
with the plight of the
people that were there,

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.260
maybe more so than some
of the other soldiers who

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.480
were straight, white dudes.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.269
And there's nothing wrong with
straight, white dudes, OK?

00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:05.310
There's nothing wrong with
straight, white dudes.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:11.420
It's just that it's more
intrinsic to me as a gay man,

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.350
as a black man, to be able to
see the world through the lens

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.800
of somebody who is not
like most other people

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.600
that I'll come
into contact with.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.340
JIMMY PEARSON:
That's interesting.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.260
ROB SMITH: Do I do
I think being gay

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.050
would help me do my job any
more or less than anybody else?

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.200
I don't really think so.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:28.640
JIMMY PEARSON: Yeah.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.290
ROB SMITH: I was a
pretty good shot.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.082
I was a great shot.

00:12:31.082 --> 00:12:32.581
JIMMY PEARSON: That
makes one of us.

00:12:32.581 --> 00:12:35.300
ROB SMITH: Yeah, better than
a lot of the straight people,

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.710
actually--

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:37.310
funny enough.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.309
JIMMY PEARSON: And you
don't think that anything

00:12:39.309 --> 00:12:40.800
to do with your
sexual orientation.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.110
ROB SMITH: It could be.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.750
JIMMY PEARSON: You never know.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.208
ROB SMITH: Well now that we
can be out in the military now,

00:12:45.208 --> 00:12:47.250
somebody needs to
commission this study.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.530
And we need to see like
gays, and lesbians,

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.700
and trans soldiers, we
need to see how they're

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.070
shot compare to straight ones.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.964
Maybe it can be an argument
for LGBTQ recruitment.

00:12:57.964 --> 00:12:59.380
JIMMY PEARSON: Hey
you know, we'll

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.500
take whatever we can get, right?

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.340
Actually, what I
was thinking of,

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.410
and I think it's related
to your empathy point,

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:08.326
and about putting yourself
in someone's shoes,

00:13:08.326 --> 00:13:12.170
is kind of code
switching, and the ability

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.550
that a lot of LGBT
folks have to do that.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:19.085
And I think that's related to
your next excerpt, which it's

00:13:19.085 --> 00:13:20.960
a really entertaining
part of the book, where

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.870
you talk about your first
experience at a gay club.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.120
ROB SMITH: The first gay club.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.550
JIMMY PEARSON: I think there's
some points in there about code

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.180
switching, as well.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.290
So do you mind sharing?

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.150
ROB SMITH: Yeah, and this is--

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.860
technically, it's
my second gay club.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.399
My first one was in Ohio
when I was 17 years old.

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:39.190
And we won't go throw
that place out there.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.670
I think they're still around.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.795
JIMMY PEARSON: Don't want
to get anyone in trouble?

00:13:43.795 --> 00:13:45.100
ROB SMITH: No, no, not at all.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.960
So I found myself
in my barracks room

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.720
later that night, once again
in front of the computer,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.330
but this time it
wasn't for online sex.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.990
Sergeant Norman, as creepy and
terrifying as he was to me,

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.650
had provided an opportunity that
I had never really been aware

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.970
of until now.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.280
I type Hide and Seek
Colorado Springs

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.890
into the Google search
bar, and anxiously clicked

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.090
on the web site.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.760
After I winced at the choppy
yellow and black flash

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.240
animation that opened the site,
I looked at the information.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.070
Hide and seek, as
I was informed,

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.940
via the text on the website, was
Colorado Spring's hippest gay

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.100
and straight inclusive bar.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.220
It was open on the
weekends until 5:00 am.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.690
It was 21-plus until 2:00
am and 18-plus afterwards.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.570
I cringed at having to wait
until 2:00 am to get in,

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.900
but I knew exactly what I was
going to be doing this weekend.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.540
I'd only been to one
other gay club in my life.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.250
It was a small hole
in the wall called

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.630
Club X in Sandusky, Ohio.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.700
I'd spent the summer after
high school graduation

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.950
working in an amusement
park, and truly exploring

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.660
what quote, unquote, gay,
meant for the first time,

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.250
at least on the dance floor.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.790
The first time I entered, it
was like sensory overload.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:00.210
It was the darkest place
I'd ever been to in my life,

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.600
lit only by a strobe disco
ball and the lights of the bar.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.250
I looked to my
right and saw boys

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.680
dancing with boys and
girls dancing with girls

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.930
for the first time in my life.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.970
Their bodies dripped
with sweat and glitter,

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:15.180
sparkling as the glitter
bounced from the strobe lights.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.820
There were many nights that
summer I spent twirling,

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.780
being free on the dance floor.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.986
I was twirling before
Kenya Moore, by the way.

00:15:22.986 --> 00:15:25.770
A couple people got that.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.810
I thought back to
those nights, as I

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.110
made the decision to go to Hide
and Seek, just to check it out.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.460
The night I was to make my
initial trip to the gay bar,

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.540
I paced around the small
barracks room in anticipation.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.900
It had been a while since my
nights at the gay bar in Ohio.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.930
I modeled my clothing choices
after the men on Queer

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.320
as Folk, which I still watch
religiously every week,

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.325
fully absorbing the show's
ideas about gay life.

00:15:49.325 --> 00:15:49.940
Oh, God.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:55.890
I walked into the bathroom and
looked at myself in the mirror.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.370
I wore a black A-shirt,
chosen to show off

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:02.010
the muscles I had gained from
the days spent working out

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:05.520
in Kuwait, and a skin-tight
pair of leather pants

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.780
I'd bought from a discount
store a few days earlier.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.040
I don't usually read
the section aloud,

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:17.042
so I'm finding it quite
entertaining, actually.

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:19.500
There were a lot of men in the
club scenes on Queer as Folk

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.150
that wore leather
clothes, so I figured

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.280
that was the popular look.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.830
As I pranced back and forth
in front of the mirror,

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.140
while keeping an eagle
eye on the clock,

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.230
I imagined what it would be
like to walk into the gay club.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.280
Would men want me?

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.630
Would I be desired?

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.760
I thought so, and it
made me even more excited

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.736
to make the trip.

00:16:36.736 --> 00:16:39.110
I put on a large coat and
walked out of the barracks room

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:40.410
to my car.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.800
I instinctively looked around
to make sure nobody noticed me.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.400
Got in the car and pulled
out as silently as possible.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.400
In my hand, I held directions
that I'd printed out.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.100
And I was surprised to see the
club was only a 15 minute drive

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.270
from the base.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.760
When I pulled up to it, I
was struck at how ordinary

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.170
it looked.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.200
It was a small building
offset by two outside patios

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.490
on both sides.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.220
An ancient awning hung
over the entrance decks.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.010
Several men hung out lazily
on the old patio furniture

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.470
that decorated the decks.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.319
I summoned my energy
and exited the car.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:17.460
The brisk wind stimulating
goose flesh on my bare arms.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.034
I put my chin up,
my shoulders back,

00:17:19.034 --> 00:17:20.700
and walked to the end
of the line, where

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.859
other patrons waited to get in.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.390
Frightened, but
aware, I continued

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.180
to look around and
behind me for any sign

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.150
that someone had
recognized me as a soldier.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.160
I thought back to
the decal in my car

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.590
that was used for
entry into Fort Carson.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.930
Did anybody see me
get out of the car?

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.060
Would anyone here be able
to recognize the decal

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.350
and turn me in?

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.030
I tried not to let the
thoughts get the better of me.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.470
I did my best to hide my
anxiety while I waited in line.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.900
I decided that I wouldn't
look back to the car

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.342
so that even if someone
recognized the decal,

00:17:51.342 --> 00:17:52.800
they wouldn't be
able to see that I

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.440
was the one who owned the car.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.350
I studied the guys in
line in front of me.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:02.310
They were young, thin,
and overwhelmingly white.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.280
My presence commanded
attention from some of them.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.530
I was greeted by a
dismissive look up and down

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.900
and a shoulder turned
back to the front.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.280
I looked at my
watch, and noticed

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.650
that it was 2:00 am
on the dot, finally.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.070
After waiting in line for
what seemed like an eternity,

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.440
I noticed it began to move.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.690
The line behind me had grown.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.850
I was far too nervous to
look anyone in the eye,

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.150
so I glanced back, taking in
only shoulders, tight jeans,

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.720
and scuffed up shoes.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.870
After moving through the
line, I entered the club

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.504
and into a different world.

00:18:33.504 --> 00:18:34.920
Making my way
through the hallway,

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.140
I noticed more guys
who were around my age.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.050
The place was filled with
the stench of old beer.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.940
My shoes stuck to the
floor as I walked down

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.380
the narrow staircase.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.910
I could see ancient messages
written on the wall.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:49.710
Johnny G sucks cock.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.080
Alan P takes it raw.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.660
There was something exciting,
sleazy, and dangerous,

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.660
not only about the messages,
but about where I was.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.160
I was scared as
hell, but secretly

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.490
thrilled to be breaking the
rules, just by being here.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.640
As I walked deeper into the
labyrinth of the dark club,

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.500
I found myself further
away from all the

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.440
stresses that dominated
my life at the base.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.320
Sergeant Norman's harassment,
the constant fear and worry

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.900
that someone would figure
out my sexual orientation,

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.390
and the new promise
and threat of war,

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.180
were all relegated
to a place far away

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.250
as I explored this dark and
mysterious new world of Hide

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.578
and Seek.

00:19:25.578 --> 00:19:29.965
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:29.965 --> 00:19:31.340
JIMMY PEARSON:
First of all, what

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.040
a great name for a gay bar.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.340
There should be a college
course on names of gay bars.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.780
Hide and Seek, I
really like that one.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.920
But part of what I love
about that passage,

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:48.230
is that it speaks to kind
of this idea of intersecting

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.950
identities that you talked
about before, and also not just,

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:55.100
in terms of you as a black man,
or as a member of the Army,

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.410
or as a gay man, but even
within the gay community,

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.260
there's all these different kind
of boxes we put each other in

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.110
and stuff.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.590
And there is this feeling I
think among a lot of people

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.006
that you come out,
and then you're

00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:07.080
just accepted into
the gay community.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.290
And you've got all the right
cards, you watch Queer as Folk,

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.510
and you're good to go.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:14.060
And what's cool
about that passage

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.795
is that it speaks to how
that's not always the case.

00:20:17.795 --> 00:20:20.420
I talked about the boxes we put
our selves into, twinks, bears,

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:20.830
whatever.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.070
Twinks judging you in the line.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.780
You don't want to be associated
with the bear on the dance

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.740
floor.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:28.880
So I was wondering if you could
speak more about after you came

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:35.150
out, what your experience of
being accepted or not accepted

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.010
into the LGBT
community was like.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.750
ROB SMITH: Well,
I'll tell you this.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.350
You made a really good point.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.010
And I give a lot of talks
on college campuses,

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.950
like all across the
country, and a lot of these

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:49.160
are younger kids, 18 to 22.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.060
And some people are out,
some people are not out.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.290
And I think that, like you
said, there is this idea

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:58.730
that, wow, you know, we're
all gay, or we're all LGBTQ,

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.680
and we're going to be
in this big community,

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.766
and there's just nothing
but love and acceptance,

00:21:02.766 --> 00:21:03.890
and it's going to be great.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:07.700
And that is just not
the case, unfortunately.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.869
I think my experience
coming out is definitely

00:21:11.869 --> 00:21:13.285
kind of like
relegated to Colorado

00:21:13.285 --> 00:21:15.710
and where I was living
a time at the time.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.680
It was not easy,
even when I came out.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.960
And this is even post-military.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.580
Because you come
out and you think

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.496
that you have all this
stuff in common people,

00:21:24.496 --> 00:21:27.410
because specifically talking
about being gay, we're all gay.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:31.892
And then you realize, oh,
those are the white guys,

00:21:31.892 --> 00:21:34.100
and they don't really want
to talk to the black guys.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.730
Or this is this group, and
you have to be in this group,

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.220
or you have to be in that group.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:42.020
And I have to say
that this book,

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:46.760
I lived these stories
in the early 2000s.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.980
And the more things
have changed,

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.840
the more they've kind
of stayed the same.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.930
Case in point, we
look at the images

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:56.660
that we have of LGBTQ
people in the media.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.290
And still to this day, they
tend to be primarily images

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.430
of white gay men.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.560
And this is something
that's starting to change.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.350
And I'm glad that
this is changing.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:09.500
But even to this day, I
do an Instagram account

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.630
with my husband at
Robert and Misha.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.730
And sometimes we
get liked, and we

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.370
get commented by a lot
of these other blogs,

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.250
that are like cutest gay
couples, or gay couples,

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.180
or whatever.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.450
So I look at these
Instagram feeds,

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.340
and they are
completely dominated

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.250
by white gay male couples.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.050
And this Instagram
we're talking about.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:33.110
Like this is 2017 going on 2018.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:36.950
And there are a lot of different
things in the community that

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.370
can divide us, from race,
to socioeconomic status,

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:41.670
to all those different things.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:45.320
And I've definitely experienced
my fair share of racism

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.120
in the LGBTQ community.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.460
I've experienced my
fair share of classism.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.800
These are things that
are definitely happening

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.420
and definitely still going on.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:57.980
But the good thing about now,
where we're sitting right here

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.960
and talking about
this in 2017, is

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.870
I think that we are now starting
to talk about these things

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:03.800
more.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.400
And when you speak about them
more, and you speak to them,

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.480
I think that it allows
us, and it gives us

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.610
the tools to try to change
some of these things.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:19.060
So if I say on Twitter, or
I write an article about why

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.980
are so many heads of
LGBTQ organizations

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.650
white people will
talk about that.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:26.330
And people say why is this.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:31.070
And when transgender women
and men speak up and say,

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.224
we need to be represented, and
why are all these trans women

00:23:34.224 --> 00:23:36.140
white and then we have
people like Laverne Cox

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.900
and Janet Mock come out,
and then kind of like change

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.130
that conversation around what
the face of transgender is.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.680
And I think that for me,
in writing this book,

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.530
and making the very
specific choice

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:53.060
to put my image on the
cover, is saying that this is

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.860
a book about a black gay man.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.190
And I'm going to put
my face on the cover.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:59.900
Because back in
the day, when I was

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.733
talking to publishers
and things about that,

00:24:01.733 --> 00:24:04.490
one thing about the
publishing industry

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:10.190
is that you will be told
in not uncertain terms

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.860
that sometimes putting a
black face on the cover

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.880
is not going to sell.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.824
JIMMY PEARSON: Really?

00:24:15.824 --> 00:24:16.990
ROB SMITH: Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.950
And even doing things
that are LGBT oriented,

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:23.270
putting a black face on the
cover is not going to sell.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.780
So it was very important
for me to represent myself

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.480
and other black
gay men, I think,

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.034
by putting myself on the cover.

00:24:30.034 --> 00:24:31.450
JIMMY PEARSON: We
should see if we

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.880
can prove them wrong by
buying a lot of gay books

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.270
with a black person
on the cover.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.250
ROB SMITH: Absolutely.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.380
But there should be more.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.870
And a point to that is
that, still to this day,

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:45.610
we are going on, what, 15
years after the war in Iraq.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.900
This is still one of, I
believe less than five books

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.960
that have been written by
African-American soldiers

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.060
of any sexual
orientation or gender

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.180
identity about their
experiences in Iraq.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.330
So in writing this book,
and in doing this--

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.530
and I like to bill it as
"Moonlight" meets American--

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.540
"Moonlight" meets
"American Sniper."

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:13.390
So the question is why, when
we look at these books that

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.820
are about the military,
when we watch these movies,

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.430
when we watch these
miniseries, why are they always

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:22.570
about straight white
men, when the military is

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.610
one of the most
diverse organizations

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.950
you'll ever work in your life,
you know, I've ever worked in.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.072
It's still the only place
in my entire career,

00:25:30.072 --> 00:25:32.530
and I've done a lot of things,
where I've had a black boss.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.620
It's still the only place
I've ever had a black boss.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:41.480
So I really wanted to make
sure that that was represented.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.980
JIMMY PEARSON: It's
interesting when

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.750
you talk about how you lived
these in the early 2000s,

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:47.815
and now it's 2017, and
things have changed,

00:25:47.815 --> 00:25:48.940
but there's still the same.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:49.820
ROB SMITH: Yeah.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.290
JIMMY PEARSON: I'm a little
embarrassed to admit this,

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.430
one of the first things
that came to my mind

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:53.330
was "Will and Grace."

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:54.144
ROB SMITH: Yeah.

00:25:54.144 --> 00:25:55.810
JIMMY PEARSON: It was
popular back then,

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:59.030
and it's now back, God help us.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.460
And it's always been
kind of controversial,

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:05.990
specifically because it paints
a very specific white, affluent,

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:07.850
urban picture of what
gay life is like.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.750
ROB SMITH: It does, and I think
the reason why is because--

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:16.022
and this speaks to having people
of color that are actually

00:26:16.022 --> 00:26:18.230
writing, and having people
of color that are actually

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.980
creating.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.222
Because the first thing,
when-- the first bit of advice

00:26:22.222 --> 00:26:23.930
that people give you
as a writer, is they

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.202
say write what you know.

00:26:25.202 --> 00:26:26.660
And if we have a
lot of people that

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.480
are in positions of power
that are even putting out

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.516
gay or LGBTQ content,
that are white guys,

00:26:31.516 --> 00:26:33.890
the first thing they're going
to write is what they know.

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.260
What they know is upper
middle class, white gay guys,

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.940
living in large cities.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.580
And that's great, because God
knows, there's a lot of them.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.040
But there's also a lot of
different people having

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.970
a lot of different experiences.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.630
And the most exciting
thing now is--

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:52.556
I'm having a meeting with some
agents in a couple of weeks,

00:26:52.556 --> 00:26:53.930
because I'm really
trying to push

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.450
like getting this adapter
for the big screen,

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.310
or Netflix, or
something like that.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:00.860
I think that the most
exciting thing right now

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:03.710
is that there's so many
platforms out there.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.650
So not only do we have
the Legacy Networks,

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.150
but we have the Hulu's and the
Netflix's and the Facebook's,

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.690
and all that stuff.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.680
And there's so much
more opportunity

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.320
to get different
stories that represent

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.482
marginalized
communities out there.

00:27:17.482 --> 00:27:19.190
And if you have a
movie like "Moonlight,"

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:23.030
that just won an Academy
Award for Best Picture, that

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:26.840
means that somewhere out
there, somewhere, there

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.350
are people that are open and
receptive to these stories.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:33.052
And I think that now
is the time for that.

00:27:33.052 --> 00:27:35.510
Even though the new "Will and
Grace" is still pretty funny.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.385
JIMMY PEARSON: Is it?

00:27:36.385 --> 00:27:37.280
ROB SMITH: It's OK.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.120
JIMMY PEARSON: I wasn't
a fan of the original.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.620
I gave myself away earlier.

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.510
I wasn't really a
fan of the original.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.650
Well, that's cool.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:43.595
ROB SMITH: Yeah.

00:27:43.595 --> 00:27:45.220
JIMMY PEARSON: And
one other question I

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.636
have about this
idea of acceptance

00:27:46.636 --> 00:27:50.720
in the LGBT community is,
what about as a veteran

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.999
specifically, do you feel that
you are viewed differently,

00:27:54.999 --> 00:27:57.290
for better or worse, as a
veteran in the gay community?

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:58.540
Or does it not come up at all?

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.665
ROB SMITH: It doesn't come
up in the gay community.

00:28:00.665 --> 00:28:03.190
I can talk to being a veteran
in the overall community.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.350
JIMMY PEARSON: Sure.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:04.820
ROB SMITH: And what I'll
say about being a veteran,

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.230
just in the
community in general,

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.576
is that people don't
understand, people

00:28:08.576 --> 00:28:09.950
don't understand
being a veteran.

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:11.570
People don't respect
being a veteran.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:16.280
People think military
service is strange and odd.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.110
These are things
that I've dealt with

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:21.380
and a lot of different workplace
situations I've been in.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:26.270
When you have an all-volunteer
military that adds up to,

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:30.500
I think maybe 1% to 3%
of America's population,

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.050
and this is specifically
talking about America,

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:37.010
then chances are that the
vast majority of people

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.590
don't know anybody
who served, have never

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.860
met anybody who served, don't
have anybody in their family

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:43.700
who served.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.150
So they have no idea.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:50.270
And so the idea is
that these are just--

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.060
poor people are just
cannon fodder for America.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:57.050
And that's some of the
feedback that I've gotten.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:00.410
And this is stuff that
comes from wealthy liberals

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:01.580
on the coasts.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:05.210
And these are some of the ideas
that people carry with them,

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.010
before they find out
that I'm a veteran.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:10.940
And then I make things
very awkward for them

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.390
when they bring this stuff up.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.765
And then people
talk about things

00:29:13.765 --> 00:29:16.910
like the military industrial
complex and all that.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.279
And those are valid arguments.

00:29:19.279 --> 00:29:20.820
Those are valid
things to talk about.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:24.890
And even in the
LGBTQ community, I

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.470
think that speaking
about veterans issues

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.860
and speaking positively
of the military

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:35.390
is seen as somehow conservative
or right leaning, which

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:36.860
I've never understood.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:41.120
But I've gotten that feedback
within our community as well.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.300
And I've never quite understood
that, because for me,

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:50.000
the military was the way to
expand my life and my borders

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.870
beyond the small town
that I was raised in Ohio,

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:57.050
the small city of Akron, Ohio.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:00.060
So I think that we have
a lot of work to do,

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:04.010
both as an LGBTQ community,
and as a mainstream American

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:05.482
community in general.

00:30:05.482 --> 00:30:07.190
We have a lot of work
to do when it comes

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:08.810
to understanding veterans.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:11.740
And also, people that
are in hiring positions

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:16.460
in organizations, instead of
the first thing that you think

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.670
about when you talk to
a veteran is about PTSD,

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:22.430
or how horrible war must
be, or anything like that,

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.370
think about what
this person may be

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.250
able to bring to this
organization, what

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:31.520
are the qualities that
the military instills

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.160
in people that could help
in your organization.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.530
I will tell you that
for me personally,

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:40.010
it just gave me a higher
level of discipline

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:43.130
than a lot of people
that I work with in a lot

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:45.500
of different situations.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.000
JIMMY PEARSON: It's
interesting, you

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.440
brought up a really
good point that I

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.190
think is a little under
appreciated, which

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:53.840
is not only is the
all-volunteer force so small,

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.790
just numbers, say, a
few people are going

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.590
to have interactions with it.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:03.530
But it's also disproportionately
southern, lower

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:04.781
on the economic ladder.

00:31:04.781 --> 00:31:06.530
ROB SMITH: Lower middle
class, absolutely.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:10.140
JIMMY PEARSON: Yeah,
and so, a lot of these--

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.380
I think you used the term
wealthy coastal liberal

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.850
or something like that--

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.610
are especially removed
from it, in a way.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:18.410
ROB SMITH: Very much
removed from it.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.420
JIMMY PEARSON: So
in the interest

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.180
of spreading a little
bit more about what

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.380
the experience of being
in Iraq is actually like--

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.230
ROB SMITH: Yes.

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.990
JIMMY PEARSON:
That's a good a segue

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.720
as any into the last passage
that you're going to read.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.440
ROB SMITH: It is.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.180
And I will keep this
brief, because I

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.760
know we wanted to open
it up for questions.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:39.410
So this is-- here we go.

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:41.630
And this is very short.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:46.160
So this is basically, I served
for slightly under a year right

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.140
after the initial invasion.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:52.940
My-- actually my entire
company convoyed into Iraq.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.880
So we drove from
Kuwait into Iraq.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:02.190
And we kind of made little
pit stops along the way.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.940
And this is describing that.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.620
When we crossed the border into
Iraq just a few hours later,

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.560
I noticed an immediate
difference in the scenery.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.230
The streets of Iraq had a
look of war-strewn desperation

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.120
to them that was
hard to stomach.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.100
Everywhere I looked
I saw Arabic language

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.660
that I couldn't understand.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.150
The roadsides were littered
with abandoned fighter vehicles

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.180
that the Saddam loyalists had
used in their futile attempts

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.950
to defend themselves against
the American invaders.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:34.950
Small, brown Iraqi children
would come out of nowhere

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.470
sometimes, running and
waving with the tanks.

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.810
We were moving slow
enough in the 15 to 20

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:42.990
vehicle convoy for them to
keep up with to a point.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.990
They wore tattered pants and
t-shirts with logos and brands

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:48.660
from them that were
distinctly from the '80s.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.760
Their high voices were
filled with joy and hope

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.810
as they chanted, "America, USA,"
with bright smiles and hands

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:57.180
extended in the
thumbs up position.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.850
Many times they were
alone, but sometimes older,

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:03.600
hardened Iraqi men, who
looked at us with contempt

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.530
and distrust joined them.

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:07.920
I smiled and waved
at the children.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.440
They were ignorant of the
fact that I was doing so

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.750
with a semi-automatic
weapon positioned directly

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.280
in front of me.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.050
When I saw the faces
of the adult men,

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.185
I gripped my weapon just
a little bit tighter.

00:33:18.185 --> 00:33:19.560
I pressed the
button of my weapon

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.010
deeper into my shoulder in
case any unforeseen events

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:25.770
required me to have it
in position immediately.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.480
I would look each
man in his eyes

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.810
above the heads of the
small, simple children

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:32.650
they were protecting.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.270
I matched the
contempt in their eyes

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:36.992
with steely resolve in mine.

00:33:36.992 --> 00:33:38.450
They needed to know
that I wouldn't

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:40.370
hesitate to pull
the trigger in case

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:42.200
they wanted to try anything.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.480
I found myself locking
eyes with most of them

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.080
until we were
safely out of view.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.700
I wondered what
they thought of us,

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.010
American infidels who had
come to violently overthrow

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:52.120
the regime.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.880
I saw a lot of children and
a lot of angry Iraqi men

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.280
during those days on the convoy.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.110
I thought a lot about
how I would feel

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.070
if the situation was reversed.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:03.250
What if my country had
been bombed into submission

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.380
for reasons that
were still murky?

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.050
What was it about America that
determined that we were always

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:09.359
right in using force?

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:10.900
If we were to listen
to what was told

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.790
to us by the government
and our leaders,

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:15.650
Saddam Hussein was a
bloodthirsty tyrant.

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:19.480
He was to unleash weapons
of mass destruction

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.510
onto an unsuspecting
American public.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.850
I just couldn't allow
myself to be convinced.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:28.510
Were the 9/11 attackers
not based in Afghanistan?

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.607
The shift from talking about
Afghanistan to focusing on Iraq

00:34:31.607 --> 00:34:33.190
was so swift and
smooth, I didn't even

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:34.719
realize it happened.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:37.690
All I knew was that after
returning from the first six

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:41.130
month deployment in Kuwait,
all talk had suddenly

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:42.750
shifted to Iraq.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:45.229
I wanted to trust what
was being told to us,

00:34:45.229 --> 00:34:46.770
but the questions
in my head wouldn't

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:48.960
allow me to do so fully.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.320
Was blind trust a prerequisite
to serving the country,

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.270
or does it just make it
easier to do the job?

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.790
JIMMY PEARSON: So I'll just ask
you one question about this,

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.414
because I do want to open it up
for audience questions as well.

00:35:04.414 --> 00:35:05.390
ROB SMITH: Sure.

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:06.260
JIMMY PEARSON: I
think what you see

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:08.060
here is your point
that you made earlier

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.895
about empathy kind of
made explicit, right?

00:35:09.895 --> 00:35:10.520
ROB SMITH: Yes.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.187
JIMMY PEARSON: As
you imagine what

00:35:12.187 --> 00:35:14.270
it's like to be those
children or those angry men.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:17.570
And it's related to this
question of the doubt

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.400
that you felt, and
whether that doubt was

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.820
an impediment to you serving.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.860
So I guess that's
my question for you

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.040
is, if you could say more
about whether you did feel that

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:32.120
to some extent that empathy
was a blocker for you

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.370
and something that made
this much more difficult.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:35.750
ROB SMITH: It was.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:43.830
Like I said in that
segment, or in that reading,

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.450
there was a lot of
misinformation that

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:47.190
was going on around that time.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.780
I mean, now we can
look back on it,

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:53.500
and we can say we know
what it was about.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.170
And it wasn't necessarily
about the fear

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:58.440
that Saddam Hussein had WMDs.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.890
And there was a lot of
doubt, a lot of fear,

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.920
a lot of conversations going on
between me and other soldiers.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.120
And I get into that a
little bit in the book.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.200
There's a lot of talk about
exactly why are we here.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.957
There's a lot of rumors about
Saddam's going to be over,

00:36:12.957 --> 00:36:14.790
and they're going to
love us, and we're just

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.706
going to be out of here
in a couple of months.

00:36:16.706 --> 00:36:17.695
And that didn't happen.

00:36:17.695 --> 00:36:18.570
JIMMY PEARSON: Right.

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.770
ROB SMITH: It's quite
obvious that didn't happen.

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:26.070
But I do think that being
an other in the military,

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.410
being a black person
in the military--

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:31.350
and I deal with some of the
racial issues more explicitly

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.184
earlier on when I talk
about basic training.

00:36:33.184 --> 00:36:35.266
Because when I was in basic
training in the south,

00:36:35.266 --> 00:36:37.590
I was the only black person
in the entire company.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.669
But I think that
when you're there,

00:36:39.669 --> 00:36:42.210
and you're dealing with a lot
of-- let me tell you something,

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:44.130
you're dealing with a
lot of good old boys.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:46.170
And you're dealing, in
a lot of situations,

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:49.380
where sometimes you are one of
the only black people around.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:53.400
And you will kind of
understand and get

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.450
a kind of an inside view
of how people treat others.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:59.190
I talk a little bit
about in the book

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:02.230
about how they used to call
the Iraq people like haji.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:04.460
You know, haji but better
not mess up, or haji better

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.418
not do this, because
we'll put a bullet in him,

00:37:06.418 --> 00:37:07.560
all that other stuff.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:12.700
And just as a black person,
as a black man, I just--

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.030
some of the conversations
and some of the behaviors

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:18.430
just felt to me
intrinsically wrong.

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:19.850
And I get into
that a little bit.

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:24.430
But I do feel like I had more
empathy going in that situation

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:27.210
just as a person of color.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:29.380
And I will identify
myself as a person

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.940
of color in that instance.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.940
Because that's something
that I shared in common

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.560
with them, the Iraqi people.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.370
Like we are both
people of color.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:39.170
And when you look
at the military,

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:43.540
it was these overwhelmingly
white male forces

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.060
that were coming in to kind
of dominate that situation.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:51.130
So I think that it did help me
look at it through a lens that

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.470
was a lot different,
which brings it

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.170
back to why I thought it was
so important to put this out.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:58.630
Because the lens of--

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.160
taking the gay out of it--

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.070
the lens of the military,
a view of the military

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.470
through the lens of
a black man, is not

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:08.410
something that exists enough.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:10.390
JIMMY PEARSON: Yeah.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.470
All right, I have a ton
of follow-up questions,

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:14.220
and stuff about my own
personal experience

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.130
that we'll talk
about afterwards.

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:18.160
But I do want to make
sure that everyone

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.470
has time to ask questions,
and we're at a quarter till.

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:23.150
So reminder, if you
do have questions,

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:27.260
please line up behind the
mics, and we'll open it up.

00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:31.390
I think you're the
only one right now.

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:32.375
AUDIENCE: Right to the front?

00:38:32.375 --> 00:38:32.840
ROB SMITH: Yes.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.340
I'm so glad somebody
had a question,

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.980
because it's so awkward
when people don't.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.780
It's the worst.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:42.960
AUDIENCE: So my question
comes out of the first reading

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.800
that you had from your book,
when you talked about coming

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.480
out to your mother.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.900
And you mentioned
to her quoting how

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.900
it wasn't part of God's plan.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.900
And I often hear about
people using religion

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:58.280
as a stick to beat back what's
uncomfortable or strange

00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.390
to them.

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:01.280
And I'm wondering,
it sounds like you

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:05.810
come from a household that
had a good deal of faith,

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:08.480
or at least, that was
part of the culture.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.210
And I was wondering if you could
talk about your experiences

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:15.660
coming out to those with
kind of a faith upbringing

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.180
and in that community.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:21.200
And then, on top of
that, if you, yourself,

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.490
have found a faith group that
is accepting to you since.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:28.220
ROB SMITH: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:32.120
I did I grew up in a Christian
household, African Methodist

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.100
Episcopal to be specific.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:41.120
And I know a lot of people,
particularly black gay men,

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.690
who were born and
raised in the church,

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:47.870
and who were born and raised
in homophobic churches.

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:52.220
And when you internalize
those messages

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.520
when you're very young, they can
be very, very hard to overcome.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.980
And I've spoken to people
that have had that experience

00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.120
in their churches.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.140
For me, I didn't
have that experience

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.650
in my church growing up.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:06.020
I never heard
anything either way

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:09.650
about anything gay in my church.

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:11.970
It was just never about that.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:17.090
And so I feel like I'm able to
have a relationship with God

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:20.600
right now, but it doesn't
have that baggage on it, where

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.429
I had to come back and realize
that oh, all of these things

00:40:23.429 --> 00:40:25.220
that were being told
to me about being gay,

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.080
or homosexuality, or
whatever were wrong,

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.560
and they were a perversion
of what the Bible is saying

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.220
and all that stuff.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.250
To be more specific about a
faith community that I found,

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:40.150
I'm more spiritual than overtly
religious at this point.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:42.910
There were-- I
mean, at my wedding,

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:46.990
I have a friend that's a choir
master at a church on the Upper

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:47.920
East Side.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.460
He semi-officiated my ceremony.

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.540
We jumped the broom.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.554
And everybody who's-- everybody
knows the slave tradition

00:40:55.554 --> 00:40:57.220
of jumping the broom
and all that stuff.

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.600
They jumped the
broom because they

00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.808
weren't unable to be married.

00:40:59.808 --> 00:41:01.180
And so I did that at my wedding.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.090
And I have a kind
of mentor that is

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:08.650
a black gay pastor at an
affirming church on the Upper

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:09.610
West Side.

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:15.010
So that's what my relationship
is to faith and Christianity

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:15.730
right now.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:18.740
And I know that some people
in the community hate it.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.700
They hate anything that
has to do with faith,

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.600
because there are so many
people who use faith, and who

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.804
use Christianity, and
who use these things,

00:41:27.804 --> 00:41:29.470
and they pervert those
messages in order

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:31.900
to ostracize people
that are gay,

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.950
and people in the
LGBTQ community.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:38.410
And I understand why people
are so hesitant to embrace it.

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:40.810
I've never really
had that experience.

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:42.845
And my mother brought that up.

00:41:42.845 --> 00:41:44.720
And by the way, we're
on very good terms now.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:47.140
These things
happened a while ago.

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.030
So we were able to kind
of come back around.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.070
And I say, look,
parents are people too.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:53.260
And coming out isn't always
an after-school special.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.470
Mine certainly wasn't.

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:58.510
But she was going through
a lot at the time.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:01.150
She got cancer twice.

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:04.480
And she was at a
point in her life

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.520
where she was very
religious, and that's

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.770
where that was coming from.

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:11.320
So I would say that my
relationship with Christianity

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.040
right now is fairly strong.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.790
JIMMY PEARSON: Thank
you for the question.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:18.480
ROB SMITH: Sure.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.462
Who was first?

00:42:19.462 --> 00:42:20.420
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:20.700
ROB SMITH: OK.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.450
JIMMY PEARSON: Why
don't you go ahead.

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:22.722
We'll split mic to mic.

00:42:22.722 --> 00:42:24.555
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for coming here,

00:42:24.555 --> 00:42:26.221
and I really appreciate
you speaking out

00:42:26.221 --> 00:42:27.680
about your experiences.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.720
My question is about the
people you served with.

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.178
Do you have an
ongoing relationship

00:42:31.178 --> 00:42:32.827
with a lot of the
people that you

00:42:32.827 --> 00:42:34.202
served with when
you weren't out,

00:42:34.202 --> 00:42:36.810
and did you have to come out
to them, and how did that go?

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:40.350
ROB SMITH: Yeah, well I will
say Facebook is a powerful tool.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:41.970
That might get edited out.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:44.580
No, Facebook is a
really powerful tool

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:45.810
to just connect with people.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:48.300
And I'm friends with,
I'm Facebook friends

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.680
with people that I served.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.360
And we're in open dialogue.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.610
As a matter of fact, somebody
just commented on a post

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:55.567
that I made about
this the other day.

00:42:55.567 --> 00:42:57.150
And he asked me if
he was in the book.

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:58.230
And I said, yeah,
you're right there.

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:00.563
Of course, your name has been
changed, because I changed

00:43:00.563 --> 00:43:03.810
everybody else's name but mine.

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:06.870
So I do still have those
relationships with them.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:09.150
And the reactions
when I came out,

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:12.752
and I got into a lot of heavy
activist work when Don't Ask,

00:43:12.752 --> 00:43:14.460
Don't Tell was still
the law of the land.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.751
I was arrested at the White
House protesting Don't Ask,

00:43:16.751 --> 00:43:17.850
Don't Tell.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:20.502
And then when a lot of
that stuff was happening,

00:43:20.502 --> 00:43:22.960
they would kind of hit me up
via social media and all that.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.750
And it ranged from we kind
of figured you were gay,

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.450
but nobody really cared to--

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:28.720
oh, this is a big surprise.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.630
But you know what, it doesn't
make a difference to me,

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:32.330
because, you know,
you were still Smitty,

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:34.121
you know, you're still
Smitty, you're still

00:43:34.121 --> 00:43:36.580
a soldier, stuff like that.

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:42.210
So I do have those
relationships still to this day.

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:44.040
And I guess the
worst part about it

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.980
is that I know that
those relationships could

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.380
have been stronger.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:51.616
But it was just, with that law,
it just wasn't good timing.

00:43:51.616 --> 00:43:52.470
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:53.350
ROB SMITH: Sure.

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:54.775
And you had one?

00:43:54.775 --> 00:43:55.650
AUDIENCE: Yes, hello.

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:56.520
ROB SMITH: Hi.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.103
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is Kelsy, I just

00:43:58.103 --> 00:44:00.564
wanted to thank you so
much for being here,

00:44:00.564 --> 00:44:02.984
and for serving our country,
and for sharing your story.

00:44:02.984 --> 00:44:04.596
You kind of stole
my question, so I'm

00:44:04.596 --> 00:44:06.750
going to tweak mine a
little bit, if that's OK.

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:09.594
So you spoke about how it was
really hard for you to come out

00:44:09.594 --> 00:44:11.840
to you mom, and you
couldn't, obviously, come out

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.185
when you were in the military.

00:44:13.185 --> 00:44:15.660
So who did you confide
in during that time,

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.774
and how did you cope with the
mental health aspect of it?

00:44:18.774 --> 00:44:21.570
Because I know, when
you're hiding who you are,

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:23.610
sometimes it brings
depression or anxiety.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:27.127
So how did you cope with that
and who did you confide in?

00:44:27.127 --> 00:44:29.210
ROB SMITH: You know, right
after the first reading

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:33.650
I did, I talk about the night
that I almost ended my life.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:38.330
And I talked to my sister, who
was and remains my best friend,

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:40.130
and she kind of talked
me off the ledge.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:44.120
So when I was in the military,
I confided with her a lot.

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.270
There are people that I
came out to on the sly

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:49.250
when I was in the military.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:51.900
But to tell you the truth,
at that point in my life,

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:54.560
it was a very kind
of lonely road.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.440
And I'm really glad that she
brought up the conversation

00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.820
about mental health.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.620
I speak out about
an organization

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:01.890
called the Soldiers Project.

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:04.100
If nobody knows what
the Soldiers Project is,

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:07.220
it is an organization-- you
go to soldiersproject.org,

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.920
and if you are a veteran,
or even active duty,

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.600
I believe, in the
armed forces, they

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.020
have a network of
therapists and psychiatrists

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:16.310
that work for free.

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:19.430
And they will connect you
to somebody in your area

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:21.840
within 24 to 48 hours.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.230
I didn't really
start taking control

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:27.320
of my mental health
and dealing with what

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.790
I needed to do in that realm
until about maybe five,

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:31.700
six years ago.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:34.970
And I found my therapist
through the Soldiers Project.

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:37.959
And it has been an
immense help for me

00:45:37.959 --> 00:45:40.250
to work through some of the
stuff that is in this book.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:42.680
And also, some of
the mental health

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:47.150
stuff that just comes with being
a gay person in this society.

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:51.480
You are just not like
87% of other people.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.890
And I think that
we kid ourselves

00:45:54.890 --> 00:46:01.560
when we ignore the mental stress
that comes along with that.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.920
So that was the way--
to answer your question,

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.700
I wasn't able to start taking
care of my mental health

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.800
until about six or
seven years ago.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.860
Because it was
really time to start

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:16.077
dealing with some of the issues
that this work brings up.

00:46:16.077 --> 00:46:16.910
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:17.972
ROB SMITH: Thank you.

00:46:17.972 --> 00:46:19.430
Thanks for giving
me an opportunity

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:20.900
to mention the Soldiers Project.

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.354
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:22.354 --> 00:46:23.520
ROB SMITH: Yeah, absolutely.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.970
JIMMY PEARSON: Yeah, definitely.

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:27.640
ROB SMITH: They give me nothing
but free mental health care,

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.139
by the way.

00:46:30.169 --> 00:46:31.794
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:46:31.794 --> 00:46:32.750
Fascinating story.

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:34.840
And thank you for your service.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.390
One of the things--

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:42.180
you're intersecting in so many
interesting ways, soldier,

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.990
veteran, gay, black.

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:53.340
And I know in my experience
as a gay white man,

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.228
I don't have to--

00:46:55.228 --> 00:46:57.470
well, another aspect
of my identity

00:46:57.470 --> 00:47:01.660
is that I'm a Christian, which
I don't reveal much here.

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.710
ROB SMITH: OK.

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:04.710
AUDIENCE: So I'm wondering
are the other aspects

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.120
of your identity that you
found easier to expose.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.990
Like in your workplace, is
it easier to be a veteran

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:13.030
or easier to be gay?

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:17.620
ROB SMITH: I'll
tell you, you want

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.990
you to be completely
honest, in any workplace,

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:21.640
it's not easy to
be anything that's

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.490
not heterosexual and white.

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:27.941
Let's just keep it
all the way real.

00:47:27.941 --> 00:47:30.440
When I think about identities
and which one is easier to be,

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.665
I mean, I would
think that for me--

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:37.920
that's a tough one,
because to me, it's

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.360
not about what's
easier, it's not

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.490
about what identity is
easier to be for me,

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:45.370
it's about fully inhabiting
all of my identities.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.040
And I feel like
I've done the work

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.980
to get to this point, where
I'm comfortable enough

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:53.910
with who I am that what other
people think of me, based

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:57.762
on these things, don't matter.

00:47:57.762 --> 00:48:01.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:06.980
So I can't take on--
oh, my god, you know,

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.050
is everybody going
to think that I'm

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:10.730
less capable because I'm black.

00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:12.920
Or are they going to
think that I shouldn't

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.660
be on camera because I'm gay.

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:17.490
Or are they going to think I'm
crazy, because I'm a veteran.

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:20.810
You know, I physically
can't take those things on.

00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:24.050
So I have to own all of
these identities in any space

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:25.850
that I enter into.

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:30.020
And this is-- I mean, look, I'm
dealing in finance right now,

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.720
where I am dealing with--

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.490
the majority of people
that I deal with

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:36.290
are white and straight.

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:40.310
And if I kind of
carry that baggage

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:42.290
from my identities
on my back, it

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:46.430
would really hinder my
ability to do my job

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:47.960
and to be effective in my job.

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.910
I hope that answers
the question.

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:52.750
So to completely
answer the question,

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:55.640
there is no one thing
that's easier than the other

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.600
to deal with.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.750
I will tell you that as a
black man in society, that is

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:01.280
the identity that people see.

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.710
That is how I am treated.

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:06.560
People don't know gay, and
they don't know veteran,

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.150
but they know black.

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:11.210
And that is how I'm
treated more so.

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:14.060
So that is that kind
of discrimination

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:17.510
that is more overt to me
in my life than anything

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:22.571
based on religion or sexuality.

00:49:22.571 --> 00:49:23.525
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:49:23.525 --> 00:49:24.960
JIMMY PEARSON: Hey.

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.870
AUDIENCE: So you talked a
bit about misconceptions

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:29.490
in the broader
population about what

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:34.050
it means to be in the military,
or just lack of knowledge.

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:39.000
And I was wondering what
you thought or believed

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.870
about the military before
you decided to enlist

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:46.770
and where those ideas came from.

00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:50.720
ROB SMITH: I was
very young, I was 17.

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.740
Yeah, obviously,
five years ago-- no.

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:56.910
So I was I 17, I was very young.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:59.710
And my ideas about
the military were--

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:02.364
so, one of the things that--
this is a story that you're not

00:50:02.364 --> 00:50:03.780
going to get from
a straight book,

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.370
is about how I was
completely obsessed

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:07.080
with my military recruiter.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.220
He was just gorgeous.

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:10.170
Oh, my god.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:10.840
I mean he--

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.756
JIMMY PEARSON: They pick
them for that reason.

00:50:12.756 --> 00:50:14.650
ROB SMITH: They do, I
mean, they really do.

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:17.850
And this is-- there's some
embarrassing stuff in there

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:21.210
about how my heart just went
pitter-patter when he came by.

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:23.910
But he was filling
my head with a lot

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:26.259
of stories about how
it'd be just like camping

00:50:26.259 --> 00:50:27.300
and all that other stuff.

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.258
So I was getting this
idea, well, the infantry,

00:50:29.258 --> 00:50:30.604
that will be cool.

00:50:30.604 --> 00:50:33.020
And you know, I'll get to sleep
out, and I'll get to camp,

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:34.436
and I'll get to
do all this stuff.

00:50:34.436 --> 00:50:35.790
Mind you, 17 years old.

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:37.830
That was not the case.

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:43.330
So those ideas of the military
did not come to fruition.

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:45.340
It was definitely
not summer camp.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:49.600
It was no fairy tale
or anything like that.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:56.270
But like I said before, I think
that the experiences that I've

00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:58.400
had just made me stronger.

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.590
It made me kind of unbreakable.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:02.570
And I wouldn't wish
some of the stuff

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:04.790
that I went through on anybody.

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:08.180
But I do believe that right now,
when we have things like-- when

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:13.250
Don't Ask, Don't Tell is over,
and the military is trying

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:16.730
to come, I guess, into 2017.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:18.230
Slowly, but surely,
they'll be here,

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:20.480
even though there's still
some issues with transgender

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.270
soldiers that we're still
trying to work out nowadays.

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:26.190
And nobody knows what's
going on with that.

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:32.090
But I do think that there are
a lot of positive qualities

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:33.062
that the military has.

00:51:33.062 --> 00:51:34.520
There's a lot of
positive qualities

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.950
that it can instill
in a lot of people.

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:38.840
And I'd never want
to bash the military.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.267
I only bash discrimination,
discriminatory policies,

00:51:42.267 --> 00:51:43.350
and discriminatory people.

00:51:46.052 --> 00:51:48.510
AUDIENCE: I feel really bad,
because I know you're waiting,

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:50.968
but I think that has to be our
last question, because we're

00:51:50.968 --> 00:51:52.780
about out of time.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:53.720
I really am sorry.

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:54.950
But Rob is going to hang
out for a while afterwards.

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:55.949
ROB SMITH: I'll be here.

00:51:55.949 --> 00:51:57.344
I'll hang out, so we'll talk.

00:51:57.344 --> 00:51:59.760
JIMMY PEARSON: And I did want
to have one last opportunity

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.380
to say thank you to Rob.

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:04.670
A, for joining us, but B, on a
personal note, as a sailor who

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:08.120
served both before and after
Don't Ask, Don't Tell repeal,

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.635
for your activism, and helping
to get that policy repealed,

00:52:10.635 --> 00:52:11.260
and everything.

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:11.640
ROB SMITH: Absolutely.

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.650
Thank you for your service.

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:13.691
JIMMY PEARSON: Thank you.

00:52:13.691 --> 00:52:14.859
Thank you for your service.

00:52:14.859 --> 00:52:16.400
Thank you again to
Rob, and thank you

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.890
to everyone for coming
and for your questions.
