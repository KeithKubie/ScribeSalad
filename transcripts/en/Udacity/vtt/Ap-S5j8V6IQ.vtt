00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here's the earth, and here are the sun's rays coming in parallel to strike the earth.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This would be the equation and this line up here would be the tropic of cancer

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
where the sun's rays are striking the earth perpendicularly.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If I have some 1 m long rod, let's say, here at some latitude north of the Tropic of Cancer,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I can sort of see that there would be a shadow down here cast by the rod.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In fact, I'm going to draw some lines to help guide our eyes.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We know that this angle here is 23.5 degrees,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
because this is where the sun's rays are striking vertically.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This angle I'm going to call α and I can tell since this line is parallel to this line

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
this angle is α as well.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Well, clearly my latitude--I'll call that l--is just equal to 23.5 plus whatever this angle α is.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I just need to find α.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Let's zoom in here, because this is where α is showing up to see if we can figure what's going on.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Here's our object with a height of 1 m and here come the sun's rays,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
which makes this the shadow down here.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The shadow also has a length of 1 m.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now I can see that this angle α is this angle formed by the sun's rays and the object,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
so the tangent α is just equal to this opposite side over the adjacent side,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
or 1/1, which is just equal to 1.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
If I use a calculator to find the inverse tangent of 1,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I find that α is equal to 45 degrees.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Since my latitude is just 45 + 23.5, I have a latitude of 68.5 degrees N.
