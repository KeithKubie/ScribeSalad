00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.301
Lee:<i> I'd come to
 South Africa,</i>

00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:04.971
<i> I'd launched myself
 into exploration.</i>

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:06.038
<i> And out I went</i>

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:09.141
<i> looking to combine
 these technologies</i>

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:11.044
<i> satellite imagery
 and handheld GPS.</i>

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.278
<i> I started mapping sites.</i>

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:15.247
<i> I saw that cave sites
 formed in linear lines.</i>

00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:17.150
<i> I saw fossil sites
 clustered together.</i>

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.119
<i> It intrigued me so much,
I put together a list of targets</i>

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.855
<i>printed them on an A-4 sheet,
loaded my dog into the car</i>

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:25.458
<i>and on the first day out I found
 21 new cave sites.</i>

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.994
<i> It became an
 addictive process.</i>

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:30.062
<i>By July of that year, 2008</i>

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:34.033
<i> I'd found more than
 600 cave sites.</i>

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:37.937
<i> I discovered more than
 60 new fossil sites.</i>

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:40.773
<i>And I thought if this was
my legacy, it's fantastic.</i>

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:43.376
<i>This will be my gift to future
generations of scientists.</i>

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.078
( applause )

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:50.650 line:0%
These discoveries
began in a situation

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.687
that I found myself in
back in the 1990's.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:01:00.326
A situation where exploration
appeared to have been finished

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.494
in the field of
paleoanthropology

00:01:02.494 --> 00:01:04.230
in the search for human origins.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.565 line:0%
I found my own university

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:09.202 line:0%
closing my
exploration program.

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:11.971 line:0%
I found myself in a situation

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:15.641
of assisting in a job search
to find a new director,

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:19.078
<i>to push the paleoanthropology</i>

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:21.647
<i> the human origin study
 in a new direction:</i>

00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:23.315
<i> Towards technology.</i>

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:26.586
<i>Towards the application of
 using modern technology</i>

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:30.323
<i>to study existing fossils,
 not to find new ones.</i>

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:32.425
That young man that was
going to take over

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.994
my directorship position and
lead us in a new direction

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:37.163
was killed in a motorcycle
accident in London.

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:40.466
But we had already invested
in that direction.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:43.469
We had post-doctoral students,
computers, everything

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.604
and one of them, a young
Kenyan named Job Kibii

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:46.972
came into my office and said

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:49.542
would I be his
post-doctoral supervisor

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.277
now with this
tragedy I said, "No.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.113
Because I can't be.

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:56.049
You're a lab guy,
I'm a field guy.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.585
But I've just found this
site that's bugging me.

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:00.587
So, if you want to learn
to be a field guy

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:04.023
let's go out to the site and
see what it has to offer."

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:06.426
<i> August 15th 2008</i>

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:13.199
<i>Job, myself, my dog Tau, my
then nine-year old son, Matthew</i>

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:14.767
<i> walked up to the site.</i>

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.235
<i> I got to the edge of it,
 we're looking around</i>

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:17.770
<i>I said, "Go find fossils."</i>

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.606
<i> And with that off
 Matthew and Tau went.</i>

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:21.941
And I was talking
to Job, and I said

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.476
"You know, I don't know why
they left this little hole.

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:26.078
Miners had actually found this

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:28.381
and just put a couple
of blasts into it.

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:29.681
But then they'd left it."

00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:31.116
And as I finished saying that

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.720
<i> Matthew, who is now
 15 yards off the site</i>

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.055
<i>in the middle of grass says</i>

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.990
<i> "Dad, I found a fossil."</i>

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.092
<i>I almost didn't go and look.</i>

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:42.628
But he's my nine-year old son,
and I like all of you

00:02:42.628 --> 00:02:43.863
you want to encourage
fossil hunting

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:46.465
so I started walking
towards him...

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:47.834
( audience laughter )

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.235
...and this is what I saw.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.837
<i> And, five meters away</i>

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:53.640
<i>I knew his and my life were
 going to change forever.</i>

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.541
<i> Because sticking out of
 the side of that rock</i>

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.643
<i>I saw a hominid clavicle.</i>

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.846
Matthew says I cursed,
I don't remember that.

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:02.715
And I turned the rock over and

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:05.818
there sticking out of the back
of it was a jaw and a tooth

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:09.455
and that would lead to
an extraordinary time.

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:12.358
<i>Matthew had found a skeleton.</i>

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:15.427
<i> One of the rarest things
 you can ever find.</i>

00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:19.598
<i> That skeleton would be
 part of this skull.</i>

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:22.668
<i> We would eventually
 find another one</i>

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:25.037
<i> and then another one,
 and then another one</i>

00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:26.472
<i> and then another one.</i>

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:28.640
We would call that
little site, Malapa

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.678
and it would for a
moment in history

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:35.915
be one of, if not the
richest early hominid site

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:37.550
on the continent of Africa.

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:42.154
<i> Skeletons in remarkable
 pristine condition.</i>

00:03:42.654 --> 00:03:44.023
<i> The organic material.</i>

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.492
<i>I threw myself into this.</i>

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:49.895
<i> This was a
 paleoanthropological</i>

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:51.931
<i> equivalent of winning
 the lottery.</i>

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:55.201
<i>We don't find these things.</i>

00:03:56.035 --> 00:04:00.406
Over the years following
that, 2011, 2012, 2013

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:04.210
we would have the time
of our scientific lives.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.480
Something like 15 papers
in the journal Science.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.116
More in the journal Nature.

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:12.285
Dozens of peer-reviewed
articles.

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:14.419
It was living a
scientific dream.

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.690
It was our version of
a scientific lottery

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.959
all from a little site
that looks like that.

00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:22.828
A hole in the ground.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:25.264
And I realized at that moment,

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.601
this was about
June-July of 2013,

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.536
that I had made an error.

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:33.939
That error was pretty
fundamental and pretty simple.

00:04:34.373 --> 00:04:40.412
I had not been exploring
since Matthew had said

00:04:40.412 --> 00:04:42.148
"Dad, I found a fossil."

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:45.151
I had literally won the
lottery, why would you?

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:46.419
Fair enough to say that

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.921
I was putting together
this great scientific team

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:50.122
we were producing this research

00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:52.492
but I had not gone back
out and gone to those

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:54.927
hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of sites that

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:56.596
I had discovered
walking those hills.

00:04:56.596 --> 00:05:00.166
<i> And so, I decided to go
 back out in the field.</i>

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:02.468
<i> And if you can imagine
 that this landscape</i>

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:06.639
<i>is less than 45 minutes outside
of the city of Johannesburg.</i>

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.974
<i> It looks like that.</i>

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:10.076
<i> And when you look at
 that you probably see</i>

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:13.879
<i> one these beautiful,
rolling African landscapes.</i>

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:15.448
<i>But that's not what I see.</i>

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:19.752
I see a giant block
of Swiss cheese.

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:23.723
Because underneath that
Dolomitic limestone

00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:28.360
are a network of hundreds
of kilometers of caves.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.363
Well, most of them are not
these big cavernous-type caves

00:05:31.363 --> 00:05:34.367
that some of you may envision
when you hear the word cave.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:37.203
Most of them are these
small narrow trenches

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:39.004
and splits in the ground,

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:42.041
forming along ancient
fault lines.

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:44.677
And I was thinking,
"how am I going to do this."

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:48.180
I had done cave exploration in
this region back in the 1990's.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.683
And I had looked and
squeezed my way

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:54.287
through these things in the
90's, and had not found much.

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:57.823
And as I was thinking of how
I would move forward

00:05:57.823 --> 00:05:59.525
with an exploration program

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:02.461
to take my surface images
and move them underground

00:06:02.461 --> 00:06:04.797
a pirate walked into my office.

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:07.433
<i>He was a former student of mine.
 Pedro Boschoff.</i>

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:11.136
He had gone off diamond
prospecting in Central Africa

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:13.706
and failed,
and had come back destitute.

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:16.441
And said, "I made a mistake.
Paleoanthropology is my love

00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:19.579
please can you give me a job,
I want to get back into it."

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:23.349
And I said,
"You know, your timing's good."

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:24.483
( audience laughter )

00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:26.451
"I want to get underground."

00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:31.357
And Pedro quickly found out
something that I already knew.

00:06:31.357 --> 00:06:33.059
That like me he had
no longer become

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.961
physiologically appropriate for
much of this underground work.

00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:37.797
( audience laughter )

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:41.467
These are narrow squeezes.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:45.338
<i> But I said,
 "You know, get out there</i>

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:48.207
<i> and go to areas
 we know the best."</i>

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:50.342
<i> I had learned something
 from Malapa.</i>

00:06:50.776 --> 00:06:52.511
<i> And so we went to
 the caving club</i>

00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:55.381
and found two young men

00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:57.483
who were
physiologically appropriate.

00:06:57.783 --> 00:06:59.451
( audience laughter )

00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:02.955
<i>On the right was Rick Hunter,
who was a member of Mensa</i>

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.490
<i> who had been
kicked out of high school</i>

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.625
<i> for blowing up the
 high school science lab</i>

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:09.995
<i> that is a true story,
and was working as a builder.</i>

00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:13.532
<i>And on the left, Steve Tucker,
 an accountant by day.</i>

00:07:13.532 --> 00:07:15.501
We showed them what
we were looking for.

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:17.136
Kind of casts, photographs

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:20.306
and sent them into some
of these deeper recesses.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:22.642
<i> Steve and Rick
 went into the site</i>

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:24.577
<i> that they expected
 the least from.</i>

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:28.581
<i> Perhaps the best known
cave site in South Africa</i>

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.216
<i> if not in Africa.</i>

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:32.151
<i> The Rising Star system.</i>

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.019
<i>It was completely mapped.</i>

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:36.655
<i> Or so they thought,
until they worked their way</i>

00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:39.458
<i>on that late evening up an area</i>

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:41.293
<i> after spending
 four and a half hours</i>

00:07:41.293 --> 00:07:44.563
<i>going through torturous sort of
little squeezes and crevasses</i>

00:07:44.563 --> 00:07:47.166
<i> up a thing that's called
Dragon's Back on the map.</i>

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:50.202
<i> A series of collapses
 that's knife-edged.</i>

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:55.674
<i>They were 40 meters underground,
they climbed about 20 meters,</i>

00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:58.977
<i>to look down a little slot</i>

00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:01.981
<i> that was
seven and half inches wide.</i>

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:06.152
<i> Into the darkness and
of course they went down.</i>

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:10.990
<i>Down more than sixty feet
 into this narrow slot.</i>

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:12.858
<i> Squeezing their way in</i>

00:08:12.858 --> 00:08:15.561
<i>not knowing if it was going
 to open up at any time</i>

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:17.162
<i> and down you drop--</i>

00:08:17.162 --> 00:08:20.533
<i>at the bottom they entered
 a little narrow passage.</i>

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.435
<i> And there they began
 to immediately see</i>

00:08:23.435 --> 00:08:26.739
<i>small white bits on the ground
 that looked like bones.</i>

00:08:27.239 --> 00:08:31.210
<i>They followed them in which led
to a slightly larger chamber.</i>

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.012
<i> And there they saw
 material on the ground.</i>

00:08:34.012 --> 00:08:36.181
<i> And they thought it
 looked a lot like</i>

00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:38.450
<i> what I'd told them
 we were looking for.</i>

00:08:38.884 --> 00:08:42.121
<i> October 1st 2013,
 I was sitting at home.</i>

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:44.523
The front intercom
at my gate went.

00:08:44.523 --> 00:08:47.159
I picked up the intercom
and there a voice said

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:49.962
"You're gonna wanna let us in."
It was creepy just like that.

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:54.000
-( audience laughter )
-( Lee chuckles )

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.101
It was Pedro.

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:58.003
And I opened the gate
eventually and let them in.

00:08:58.003 --> 00:09:00.706
And there Steve
opened up his laptop

00:09:01.607 --> 00:09:04.443
and I saw the most
extraordinary pictures

00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:06.712
I thought I would
never see in my life.
