[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.227 --> 00:00:06.810
KERRY ANN KING: Steve
is going to talk

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.300
to us about the new
super power for women--

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.350
self-defense for women.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.460
Go ahead and have a seat.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:20.030
So I wanted to bring up
the first thing right away.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.730
Self-defense for women.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.840
I think one of the things that
I really got out of the book

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.040
was your attitude
towards this is really

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.700
about protecting women, partly
from your own experience

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.060
as a law enforcement officer but
also from your own experience

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.900
as a young man.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.090
And I thought that that
was really an interesting--

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.620
because I think as a woman
it's easy to say, oh, well, I

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.810
have intuition, great.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.910
Men are strong, and
women are intuitive,

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.489
and we're going to be
victims, and men are not.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.837
But I think part of what
was interesting to me,

00:01:07.837 --> 00:01:09.420
and really moving
in reading the book,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.220
was that you, in fact,
had had an experience that

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.310
made sexual assault something
that you could empathize with.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.780
STEVE KARDIAN: Yeah, when
I was in eighth grade,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.780
I was playing on a
recreation football team.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.840
And I ended up breaking my back,
and I ended up in the hospital.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.850
And while I was in the
hospital, I was bedridden.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.290
I couldn't do anything.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.170
And about the fourth day
in, a priest came in,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.870
and he introduced himself.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.700
And I was a practicing
Catholic at the time.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.350
He asked me if I wanted to--

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.140
some small chat.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.940
And then he said, would you
like to give confession, my son?

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.680
When I tell people, it
almost sounds like a joke.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.080
And I said, sure, so
I gave him confession.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.670
I don't remember
exactly what I said.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.400
And then towards or at basically
when I thought I was done,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.370
he looks to me, and he
says, just like this,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.410
I remember clearly.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.070
He says, "Steven,
do you masturbate?"

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.310
And as a 14-year-old boy,
and this being a priest--

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.085
priests were God back then--

00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:17.710
I knew that there
was something really,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.230
really wrong with that
question, especially the way

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.370
that he said it.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.820
So I thought I was being clever.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.690
I said, I don't even
know what that is.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.650
And he asks me, your
back is broken, Steven?

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.630
And I said, yes.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.570
And so he puts the Bible
down, and he pulls down

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.630
the covers of the bed sheets.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.030
And then he pulls down
my pajamas and underwear,

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.100
and he lifts my
member off my belly.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.420
And he says, it's when
you play with this,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.670
looking straight into my eyes.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.345
And I have no idea if it
was 5 seconds, 10 seconds,

00:02:49.345 --> 00:02:50.720
something spooked
him, whether it

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.260
was the nurses out in the hall.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.070
And he put me back down and
grabbed his Bible, and he left.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.835
And my best friend came in.

00:03:00.835 --> 00:03:02.460
And I told him, I
said, Sal, you're not

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.810
going to believe what happened.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.560
And he said, we have
to tell your parents.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.440
I said, I know we do.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.800
Because what they would
do, they'd drop him off.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.133
He'd run up, and they'd come up.

00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:11.280
So they came up,
and we told them.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.680
And the police were called,
the hospital administrators

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.312
were called.

00:03:14.312 --> 00:03:16.770
And they were around my bed,
and they were interviewing me,

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.205
and they were asking me
all sorts of questions.

00:03:19.205 --> 00:03:21.330
And the police officer says
to the doctor, he says,

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.170
hey, doc, is he on medication?

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.840
Again, we had a much different
vision of priests back then.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.840
So the doc kind
of looks, he goes,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.270
well, he was on medication
when he came in,

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.400
but he's not on it anymore.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.400
So the doctor looks at
me and goes, Steven,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.680
could this have been a dream?

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.810
And right then and there,
even me as a 14-year-old kid,

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.840
especially my parents,
they were like, done.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.720
That was a really
horrific event compared

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.140
to people that are true
survivors that have

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.420
gone through way more horrific.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.800
That just showed me that there
are people above you in higher

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.980
places that certainly
don't have a problem taking

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.470
advantage of-- he did it to
me, he did it to many others.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.279
Back then, it was really
difficult to track

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:11.070
that sort of stuff.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.010
That's way over the years
the priesthood was really

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.350
discovered as to
what they were doing.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.420
And I've done 1,000
media interviews.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.149
I haven't told that.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:24.044
I waited for it to be
included in the book.

00:04:24.044 --> 00:04:26.460
KERRY ANN KING: And that was
one of the things that really

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.510
moved me about reading the book,
was Steve is coming at this not

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.090
from the perspective of
someone who's coming to tell us

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.550
how to take care of
ourselves, but someone who's

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.990
really interested and has the
experience of what it feels

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.950
like to be powerless,
and wants women,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.620
who are more likely to be
victimized, to be empowered.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.850
And that, I thought, was
really a wonderful thing

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.630
about the book.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.540
Having said that, a lot of what
we're going to talk about today

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.090
also applies to all genders.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.090
My two sons and one
daughter are here today

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.120
because I felt like
the information was

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.290
important enough, and that
it applies to everyone.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:17.194
So let's talk about
situational awareness.

00:05:17.194 --> 00:05:19.610
This is something that you get
right into at the beginning

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.540
of the book, and
today that I realized

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.182
I was really bad at
when I started reading.

00:05:26.182 --> 00:05:27.890
Tell us a little bit
about the importance

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.710
of situational awareness.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.543
STEVE KARDIAN: We're
in a digital age today.

00:05:30.543 --> 00:05:31.760
We're on our mobile devices.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.230
They're attached to our hands.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.550
We're listening to
music in our ear buds.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.420
And the predator utilizes--

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.180
a huge part of his game is
the element of surprise.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.700
So if we remove that
from him, first of all,

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.274
if you even present
as a hard target,

00:05:46.274 --> 00:05:47.690
he's likely going
to go elsewhere.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.270
I've done social
experiments on television

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.210
where I've actually shown how
the predator would compromise

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.950
someone.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.130
But by employing
situational awareness,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.810
you walk into a building,
look to the left or right.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.130
You walk out of a building,
look to the left or right.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.942
Everything has a baseline.

00:06:08.942 --> 00:06:10.400
You're looking for
something that's

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.960
outside of that baseline.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.819
When you walk into a mall
with today, active shooters,

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:17.360
you want to know
where the exits are.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.810
Because when things go
bad, that is not the time

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.950
to create a plan of action.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.805
KERRY ANN KING: You used one
of the phrases that is really

00:06:26.805 --> 00:06:27.930
useful in the book as well.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.500
Hard target versus soft target.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.740
What's a hard target,
what's a soft target?

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.460
STEVE KARDIAN: A soft target,
actually, years ago, there

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.300
was the Grayson, Stein study.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.400
And they took video footage of
people walking down a Manhattan

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.650
street, and they took it to
these hardened criminals--

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.050
murderers, rapists, killers--

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.400
and they showed them the video.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.580
And they said, what do
you see in terms of people

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.410
that you would try
to take advantage of.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.520
They let petite women, petite
men, older seniors, men

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.720
and women walk by.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.850
But they were looking
at particular traits

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:08.380
in terms of their gait,
their posture, their stride.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.040
And they all, independently
of one another,

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.950
identified those
particular traits

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.520
where they identified--
everyone independent chose

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.530
the same people as soft targets.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.990
So when I did a social
experiment with Inside Edition,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.470
I went on to a college campus,
and I watched the young women

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.360
coming out of the
classroom building.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.460
And I was looking for the
women that were texting.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.940
I was looking for the women
that were on the cell phone.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.481
I was looking for the women that
were looking at their notes.

00:07:34.481 --> 00:07:36.919
I was looking for the women
that were eating their lunch

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:39.460
and saying, oh my god, it's a
beautiful day, I'm out of here.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.190
The women that came out and
scanned the parking lot,

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.010
saw me, maybe didn't see me,
but were walking assertively,

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.510
with a purpose, I let them go.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.050
And I targeted the women
that were preoccupied.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.100
That preoccupation,
when you're surprised,

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.770
you are that much more
vulnerable, if you will.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.020
So it was a social experiment.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.420
Every girl, all
eight of the women

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.120
that I targeted for
being soft targets,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.580
allowed me in their car
and drove off with me.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:11.570
And it was a segment to show
are college students really

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.070
trusting.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.800
Are we really trusting
when we're out and about

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.270
in a comfortable
environment, which

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.606
would be the college campus.

00:08:17.606 --> 00:08:19.480
KERRY ANN KING: So this
is really interesting

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.500
because the distraction is
one thing that I got out

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.250
of the book.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.820
I realized that I'm that woman
who gets to the subway station,

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.800
puts her bag on the
ground, and starts digging

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.180
for her metro card.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.090
I stopped doing that right away.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:41.530
But distraction is definitely
a factor, and cell phones.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.014
There's a big
distraction that I notice

00:08:45.014 --> 00:08:47.770
when I'm out and about in the
evening in particular, which

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:52.220
is alcohol for young women.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.710
And that's something you
also talk about in the book,

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.540
because people drink
a lot these days,

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.260
and drinking is a big
part of socializing.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:08.560
And you talk about
how to go out but not

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.650
turn yourself into a soft
target because you're

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:12.819
out to have a good time.

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:14.860
STEVE KARDIAN: Well, a
lot of the sexual assaults

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.130
that we see that are
perpetrated on college campuses,

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.830
in nightclubs, they
involve alcohol by one

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.050
or both-- usually both parties.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.860
And it's a neurotoxin, and
it changes your behavior

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.520
to some degree.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.410
It lowers your inhibitions.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:33.850
It makes you less
able to mentally

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.457
be able to deal with the
situation, and physically,

00:09:36.457 --> 00:09:37.540
because of the neurotoxin.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.650
Everything slows down.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:39.610
Your thought process.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.680
God forbid if you did
have to fight back,

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.940
you are now 20%, 30%, 40%
less efficient and effective

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.335
to deal with someone that
means to compromise you.

00:09:49.335 --> 00:09:50.335
KERRY ANN KING: Exactly.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.440
So we have these multiple
distractions now.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.131
I was thinking about your book.

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:01.630
I was walking down the street
and saw three young women, one

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.010
of whom could barely stand up.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.580
And it occurred to me that
one who could barely stand up

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.250
was lucky her
friends were sober.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.430
That's one thing you
talk about in the book,

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.860
is safety in numbers.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.230
STEVE KARDIAN: Yeah, we
advocate go out as a group,

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.250
go home as a group.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.550
But we also are
realists, and knowing

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.190
that, in the perfect
world, that will happen.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.740
If you go out as a group,
and one of the girls

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.470
wants to leave early, or one of
the girls wants to stay late,

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.320
or maybe she met someone
that she's interested in,

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.970
and she wants to
hang out with them,

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.460
you've got to deal with that.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.020
And so in the book, I
give step-by-step things

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.489
that you can do on how to best
depart from that situation.

00:10:41.489 --> 00:10:43.780
Like some people, oh, we're
going to go out as a group.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.250
But man, you walk
into this place,

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.005
and you just get that
feeling things are not good.

00:10:48.005 --> 00:10:50.380
You want to get out of there
because the longer you stay,

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.520
it's going to get better.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.440
The environment will
likely get worse.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.480
Whether it's a club,
or a frat house,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.470
or a party among
friends, there's

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.270
many things that could go wrong.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.940
That first feeling you get,
if you walk in and you say,

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.580
I really don't belong here, you
want to follow that feeling.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.640
KERRY ANN KING: And
that's something

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.640
that I think is another
important takeaway

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.670
from the book, is allowing
your body to tell you

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.680
what's going on.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.440
You talk about how that
gut feeling is actually

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.880
a real, physical sensation
that you can listen to.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.310
STEVE KARDIAN: Yeah, I've
had it over the years

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.960
in law enforcement
so many times.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.360
My first experience was at 17.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.280
Long story short,
I saved the life

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.620
of a child that was
buried in the sand when

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:46.080
20 adults stood around and
just stood there, frozen.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.190
And I was going to walk 15
minutes away to a place called

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.384
Indian Town in Old Saybrook.

00:11:51.384 --> 00:11:53.550
I went five minutes, I had
this overwhelming feeling

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.750
that I had to turn back.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.237
And I convinced my
girlfriend-now-wife

00:11:57.237 --> 00:11:58.320
that we've got to go back.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.630
And if I hadn't gone back,
this young 8-year-old boy

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.510
would have died.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.060
KERRY ANN KING: I think one
of the things you talk about,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:14.280
though, is how women
are socialized to ignore

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.960
some of their gut feelings.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.740
We're taught to be
nice, we're taught

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.540
to be helpful, we're
taught to be polite,

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.819
and how that's not necessarily
the best thing for us to do.

00:12:30.819 --> 00:12:33.360
STEVE KARDIAN: You ought to meet
some of the female cops I've

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:33.930
worked with.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.450
They have amazing intuition.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.450
But in general, in some
homes, some families,

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:44.120
you're brought up in such a
way as to kind of put your--

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.930
statistics show that it's 50/50.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.150
I believe women have the
greater gift of intuition,

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.320
but often they're
apt to put it aside.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.170
In all the social experiments
that I did, 21 out of 21 women,

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.100
they all said, I knew
something wasn't right,

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.790
but I'm the team leader,
I wanted to help.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.209
So they have that feeling,
but they sometimes

00:13:05.209 --> 00:13:06.000
don't listen to it.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.960
So it's important.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.460
It could be a sense
of foreboding.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.850
It could be a tickle in your
belly, that gut feeling,

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:11.350
they say.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.766
It could be a lump
in your throat.

00:13:12.766 --> 00:13:16.020
It could be a little tingle
in your chest, the hair rising

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.454
on the back of your neck.

00:13:17.454 --> 00:13:18.870
Because every woman
that I've ever

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:23.250
dealt with in the history
of my law enforcement,

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.990
when they were
encountered personally

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.510
by someone that meant
them an ill intent,

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.100
they had that feeling.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.260
They knew something
wasn't right.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.190
And if we listen to that,
the only thing intuition

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.400
will do you wrong is
you will disregard it.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.750
If you listen to it,
it will never harm you.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.750
KERRY ANN KING: Yeah,
that's really interesting.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.040
How many people here have
had that sense of foreboding

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.360
and kept going with
whatever you thought?

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.810
Oh, but he's really cute.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:57.270
Oh, but she's a little old
lady, she can't possibly

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.790
have anything against me.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.200
Why would she?

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.130
And I think that that's one of
the key takeaways from reading

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.610
the book, is really
allowing yourself

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:13.810
to listen to that little
voice in your head.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.380
But then one of
the things that I

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:21.660
think we tend to do in
our desire to be nice

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:26.670
is be afraid that we
are judging people.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.640
And what occurred to me
as I was reading the book

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.850
was really the idea
of racial profiling.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:40.020
I think particularly for
young women out on their own,

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.980
not wanting to judge someone
based on the way they're

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.080
dressed, or their race, or their
ethnicity, we tend to be like,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.960
oh, I don't want to think that.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.580
And is there a way
that you can kind of

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.400
understand that that's not
where you're doing versus maybe

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.750
when you might be doing it?

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.350
STEVE KARDIAN: Well, if you
have that uncomfortable feeling,

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.570
and there's certain
pre-indicators of behavior

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.370
that people will do when
they're targeting you.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:10.800
For example, recently I did some
interviewing on subway groping.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.320
And all these women that
had been subway groped,

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.940
they were like, did
that just happen?

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.830
No, can't be, did
it just happen.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.190
I think he did.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.390
And so they debate amongst
themselves as to what it is.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.480
If someone, regardless
of whether they're

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:29.070
in a business suit, or they're a
blue collar, it doesn't matter.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:33.920
If they give you that feeling
that you don't belong there,

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.430
particularly with them.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.110
You might have a
target glance, somebody

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.750
that wants to maybe
steal something for,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.850
and he sees-- oh, look
at that gold bracelet.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.950
It's called a target glance.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.900
He's looking at that
because he wants it.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.520
It's like in law enforcement,
if he looks at my gun,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.260
he wants to go for my gun.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.890
He looks at the doors
and the windows,

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.181
it's likely he wants to escape.

00:15:51.181 --> 00:15:54.604
So people subconsciously
will do things

00:15:54.604 --> 00:15:55.770
that will put you on notice.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:16:00.970
And you may not know why, but
you'll say, I just don't feel--

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:04.020
you're talking to
yourself, of course.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.800
our internal subconscious
is about 80%.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.730
So we have dialogue with
ourselves all day long.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.740
We are assessing, look at
that person over there,

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.230
but we're talking to ourselves.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.150
So listen to that inner voice.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:19.874
It's very powerful.

00:16:19.874 --> 00:16:22.040
KERRY ANN KING: So you
mentioned that target glance.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.810
Are there any other
things that a woman

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.920
should look for in
a person, regardless

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.900
of how they're dressed
or who they happen to be,

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.370
that should put you on notice?

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.010
STEVE KARDIAN: We refer to it
as "keep your head on a swivel

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.270
and watch your six."

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.300
So as you're going,
you're just glancing.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.561
And if you happen
to see something,

00:16:44.561 --> 00:16:45.810
maybe somebody's watching you.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.840
Maybe he's off on the sidewalk,
or a little bit excreted,

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.220
or you're in that
subway and he's

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.710
waiting sort of in the back
because you'll pull out

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.168
a couple of dollars,
and he'll want

00:16:54.168 --> 00:16:59.970
to give you his bogus subway
token, which has nothing on it,

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.640
for like $2 so you save $1.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.880
You notice that by
target glancing.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.355
When you're walking by someone,
it's OK to put them on notice.

00:17:09.355 --> 00:17:10.980
You don't have to
look at them, but you

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.220
sort of glance this way.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.740
And a lot of people,
when they feel

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.560
intimidated, they feel that
someone is targeting them,

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.812
they feel that someone
is maybe watching them

00:17:18.812 --> 00:17:20.520
for whatever purpose,
they might do this,

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.552
or they might look away.

00:17:21.552 --> 00:17:23.760
But you get into the habit,
keep your head on a level

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.880
where you'll look this way,
and you just keep walking.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.880
That's the sign
of a hard target.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.810
If you were to stalking
me out, watching me,

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.910
and I looked, and I went
kind of like this, that's

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:37.410
the sign that I'm intimidated.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.930
Or if I looked away, that's
a sign that I'm intimidated.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.040
So we get into the habit.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.310
You can practice it.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.692
Just look at somebody
randomly for a half a second,

00:17:45.692 --> 00:17:47.400
and just bring your
head back on a level.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.560
That's a sign of a hard target.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.210
That's a sign of strength.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:55.260
Taking away the element
of surprise from someone

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.610
takes away 70% of someone
that wishes you bad instead.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.440
KERRY ANN KING: And
that was really key,

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:06.450
the idea that you create a
blueprint for these situations.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.750
STEVE KARDIAN: When I saved
that kid on the beach,

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:13.110
I had read a pamphlet
about rescue breathing.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.450
None of the adults on that
beach knew what to do.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.780
I read a pamphlet a
month before vividly,

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.310
and I was able to perform
and save his life.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.040
So when you think
about something

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.540
could go wrong--
somebody's breaking

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.690
into your dorm, your apartment,
your house, and what do I do?

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.530
Your heart rate goes
up to 175 beats.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.240
You go into the frozen zone.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.921
At 115 beats, you lose your
fine motor skills, your ability

00:18:38.921 --> 00:18:39.420
to dial.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.630
I've seen men and women
not be able to dial 911.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:47.410
Upwards towards 135, 145,
you lose your complex,

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.540
which are a lot of what
martial art programs teach.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.410
Our program at 145 to
175 thrives because we

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.120
use gross motor skills.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.730
Our big, stronger muscles.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.670
But if you don't
have a plan, you're

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.910
more apt to panic and
not know what to do.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.410
So by creating
that plan, thinking

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.451
about something that could
go wrong in your life,

00:19:09.451 --> 00:19:10.460
come up with a solution.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.360
Think about it vividly.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.980
In law enforcement, we
call it visualization.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.854
The military calls it
emergency conditioning,

00:19:14.854 --> 00:19:17.750
and we use it very,
very effectively.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.217
Thank God I've never
had to use my weapon.

00:19:21.217 --> 00:19:22.550
I've never had to shoot anybody.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.474
But in my mind, I've gone
through thousands and thousands

00:19:25.474 --> 00:19:27.140
and thousands of
scenarios so that there

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.930
would be no gray line
where I had to save my life

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.310
or the life of the third person.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.810
KERRY ANN KING: And
that's one thing

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.880
I would say about
reading the book.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.100
Not all of what
you'll read in here

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.230
will be easy to read,
especially as someone

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.344
who has been a victim.

00:19:40.344 --> 00:19:42.260
There were a couple of
things that I read here

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.740
and it was like, wow,
that's what happened to me.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.560
And it was not easy to read.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.850
But I think one of the
benefits of reading

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.690
about it is that that's
another opportunity to rehearse

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:58.080
without being in the situation.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:03.950
So, just because we
talked about it before,

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.030
anybody take our boxing class?

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.460
I know Lauren does.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.290
What's the difference
between what

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:18.650
you teach and, say, what
Josh or Xavier teaches

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.249
people in our boxing classes?

00:20:20.249 --> 00:20:21.290
STEVE KARDIAN: For women?

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:23.000
KERRY ANN KING: Yes,
in terms of defense.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.450
STEVE KARDIAN: We started
20-something years ago.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.070
We had a group of
survivors-- sexual assault,

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.710
domestic violence,
kidnapping, date rape drugs--

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.543
and they asked us to
put together a program.

00:20:29.543 --> 00:20:31.800
So my partner, Brad
Parker in Phoenix,

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.541
Arizona, long-time martial
artist, boxer, karate guy,

00:20:34.541 --> 00:20:37.040
began teaching them some really
cool martial art techniques.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.630
And he found out
quickly two things.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.120
They couldn't retain
the technique.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.740
New people couldn't retain
the technique in a 45

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.000
to 60-minute class.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.670
And number two, he was teaching
them how to fight like a man.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.680
Now, if you teach a woman
to fight like a man,

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.320
and she goes up against a man
who typically, in that dynamic,

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.570
through evolution, men
typically are bigger, stronger,

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:55.150
more pain tolerant.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.342
Men have a reptilian brain.

00:20:56.342 --> 00:20:58.550
If you've ever seen a real
street fight, guy punches,

00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:59.540
guy punches back.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.160
Guy kicks, guy kicks back.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.640
Guy bites, guy bites back.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.832
So it's telegraphing.

00:21:04.832 --> 00:21:06.290
And I see it in
the police academy.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:07.810
If you've never been
punched in the head,

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.990
it's like a lightning bolt
going through your head,

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.200
and it can take all
the fight out of you.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.330
So he began reversing
that process

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:16.340
and teaching him how to
fight like a woman using

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.215
their bigger, stronger,
more powerful weapons

00:21:18.215 --> 00:21:20.340
against a man's more
vulnerable points,

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.880
putting them in the positions
that they found themselves in.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.520
And we were talking earlier
about high-level martial

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.740
artists that I have
done investigations

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.860
on that their martial
art didn't work

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.250
against their non-martial art
acquaintance or boyfriend.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.896
And it's devastating to them.

00:21:35.896 --> 00:21:37.520
The dynamic of a
sexual assault, you're

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.186
going to be grabbed
and taken somewhere,

00:21:39.186 --> 00:21:42.860
or you're going to be grabbed
and brought down to the ground.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.409
Say the intent was right now,
it would be within five seconds

00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:47.450
that he would be trying
to get you to the ground.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:51.080
If you're taken from point A
to point B and it's a stranger,

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.300
in the 90th percentile, you're
just not going to come back.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.520
It's unforgiving.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.100
So we do that
preventative aspect.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.040
Don't ever let yourself be
taken from here to there.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.250
The guy says, "Do what
I say or I'll kill you.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:04.880
Don't scream."

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.570
You scream.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:06.260
"Don't run."

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.850
You run.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.410
He can't harm you there.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:10.460
He can't kill you.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.480
He doesn't want to
kill, he doesn't

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.610
want to sexually assault
you, harm you in some way.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.620
He wants to get you to
the secondary location.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:21.350
So by fighting back, your
value to him as a soft target

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.470
diminishes.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.860
So he would rather
move on elsewhere

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.020
because he relies on the
compliant fear factor

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.530
that what he says will
get you to do what he

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:32.630
wants you to do through fear.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.940
Or he may say something
like, if you do what I say,

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.900
everything will be OK.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:40.497
And you'll want to believe that,
but the end result is horrific.

00:22:40.497 --> 00:22:42.080
KERRY ANN KING: So
then the techniques

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.200
that you're talking about are
ones that can extricate you

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:50.420
quickly, and also I
think empower you to feel

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.370
like you can do something.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:56.047
And I think I'll just say,
from personal experience,

00:22:56.047 --> 00:22:57.380
I have a lot of karate training.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.463
I've done a lot of boxing.

00:22:58.463 --> 00:23:00.200
Taught kickboxing.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.750
The last time I
was in a situation

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.780
where I would have thought all
of that would have applied,

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.180
none of it applied because
I had no rehearsal.

00:23:12.986 --> 00:23:15.740
Yeah, I could kick
someone in the head,

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:19.440
but kicking them in the head was
not going to be the solution.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.520
So having lots of
fancy Taekwondo skills

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.955
doesn't necessarily translate.

00:23:25.955 --> 00:23:27.830
STEVE KARDIAN: You might
kick the guy's butt,

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.740
but your objective is to change
his behavior enough so that you

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.440
can escape the situation.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.540
I've been knocked out by girls
90 pounds when I wore the suit.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.656
Kicking through the suit
knocked me out unconscious

00:23:41.656 --> 00:23:43.906
because of the ground is
their base, kicking up-- it's

00:23:43.906 --> 00:23:44.870
called an upkick.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.420
Actually, it's illegal in
UFC, or Ultimate Fighting

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.760
Championship, where they
kick up from the ground,

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.450
and his targets are
much more accessible.

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.630
So again, you might
kick his butt.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.151
Your objective--
change his behavior

00:23:58.151 --> 00:23:59.900
so you've got three,
four, or five seconds

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.210
to escape the
situation, if you will.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.800
KERRY ANN KING: Last thing.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:08.990
I would like to hear
five things a woman can

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:16.160
do when she leaves this room
to not be a soft target.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.080
STEVE KARDIAN: Employ
situational awareness.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.060
Take in your environment.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.240
I mentioned that
everything has a baseline.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.950
You're looking for things that
are a little bit off baseline.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.800
The baseline in New York City
is different than the baseline

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.250
in a small suburb in Tennessee.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.730
However, regardless of where you
are, if you drop your guard low

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.260
enough, there would be--

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.410
could be-- someone there
to take advantage of you.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.150
Believe in that gut feeling.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.000
Let that intuitive
process be a guide.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.250
Get in touch with it.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:50.450
People watch.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.580
I go into a restaurant,
my back is to the wall,

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.204
and I'm watching
people, and I'm trying

00:24:54.204 --> 00:24:56.397
to figure out is he having
a good day, or a bad day,

00:24:56.397 --> 00:24:57.980
or what does she do
for a living, what

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.000
does he do for a living.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.860
Or a family,
they're interacting.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.780
And I say, I wonder
what their conversation

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:07.670
is by looking at their
facial expressions.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.080
Learn some self-defense.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.360
Create that blueprint.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.840
Think of something bad happens
to somebody in your family,

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.794
or a friend, or in the media.

00:25:16.794 --> 00:25:18.710
Think about what would
I do in that situation.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:21.860
Or you're on the subway, and you
see somebody hassling somebody,

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.400
and he's not leaving them alone.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.520
Well, start to think,
what would I do?

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.080
How would I handle that?

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.210
And come up with a
solution to a problem,

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.580
because when it
really happens, you'll

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.420
never have the opportunity
to create a plan of action

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.940
like you would prior.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:42.050
So if we examine it, think
about it, we create a file.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.210
Your brain doesn't
know if you've lived it

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.070
or if you've thought
about it vividly.
