00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.610
Want to know more about a person?

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.240
Stop stalking their fb pics, and ask for a
pic of their brain!

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.880
That's way less creepy!

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.190
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.529
The study of Phrenology once dominated the
scientific mind.

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.779
Literally, this philosophy or theory suggested
that shape of the head defined a person’s

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.000
intelligence or personality.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.990
A person’s whole story could be read on
their head like an open book.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.580
While that so called “science” has been
totally debunked, turns out the shape of your

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.880
brain could say something about who you are.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.360
While personality always brings up the debate
of nature vs nurture, whether it’s genes

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.989
or environment, the shape of your brain matters.

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.340
In recent years researchers are finding that
certain personality traits were linked to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.890
the size of various areas of the brain.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.340
The size of an area of the brain is often
correlated with strength in that area.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.730
So someone with a large prefrontal cortex,
an area associated with emotion, might be

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.899
better at regulating their feelings.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.600
Before we get to us, let’s take a look at
one of our closest cousins, the chimp.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.460
And they do have similar personality traits
as we do.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.600
In this study published in the journal NeuroImage,
researchers used MRI techniques to scan the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.820
brains of over 100 different chimps.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.840
They also used a list of 40 questions to judge
the chimp’s personality, which rated things

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.550
like extraversion, openness, agreeableness,
dominance.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.680
Most of these kinds of tests use neuroticism
in humans rather than dominance, but it’s

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.070
kind of hard to tell if a chimp is neurotic,
it’s not like he’ll still talk about the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.260
one time he thought one chimp waved at him
but he was really waving at the chimp behind

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.260
him.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.970
They found that the chimps with more positive
traits likes extraversion had more gray matter

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.460
in the anterior cingulate cortex in both sides
of the brain.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.710
But chimps with negative traits like dominance
had more gray-matter in the left anterior

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.310
cingulate cortex and the right prefrontal
cortex.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.020
But what about in human brains?

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.820
Recent research suggest that certain connections
in the brain can spell happiness for some

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.010
people.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.190
Published in the journal Nature Neuroscience,
the study examined “connectomes” of 461

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.190
people.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.890
Connectomes being the map of the various connections
in the brain.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.280
The researchers found “a strong correlation”
of positive traits and specific types of connectivity.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.310
But it’s not just connection, it’s the
size of certain regions too.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.500
In another study published in the journal
Psychological Research, scientists scanned

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.720
the brains of over 100 different people.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.920
They too found links between region size and
personality.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.130
In this case the medial orbitofrontal cortex
was larger for those with some positive traits

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.200
like extraversion.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.100
And those with more negative emotions had
a larger mid-cingulate cortex.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.550
So it’s not an exact match to chimps, I
mean chimp brains are pretty different from

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.550
ours.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.350
But it’s clear that if a scientists could
scan your brain right now, they could tell

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.510
a whole lot about you.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.580
And don’t be worried if you don’t measure
up.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.050
DNA isn’t destiny and neither is brain structure.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.110
The brain is surprisingly fluid.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.700
You can grow certain areas of the brain with
practice, just like working out makes a muscle

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.790
bigger, habitual practice can change the brain.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.560
Several studies, like one study published
in the journal NeuroReport show that meditation

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.700
causes thickening in the prefrontal cortex,
a part of the brain that deals with emotional

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.700
processing and well-being.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.060

Size matters too, to learn more about that,
