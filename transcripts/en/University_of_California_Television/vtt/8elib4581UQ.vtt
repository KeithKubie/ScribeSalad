00:00:00.102 --> 00:00:00.935
(electronic whooshing)

00:00:00.935 --> 00:00:05.216
(mouse clicking)
(electronic chiming)

00:00:05.216 --> 00:00:07.799
(upbeat music)

00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:31.534
- I'm John Campbell,

00:00:31.534 --> 00:00:33.332
I'm a philosophy professor
here at Berkeley,

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:34.901
and I'd like to welcome you

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:37.643
to this Howison Lecture.

00:00:37.643 --> 00:00:41.423
George Holmes Howison was born in 1844.

00:00:41.423 --> 00:00:45.404
He began academic life as a mathematician

00:00:45.404 --> 00:00:48.564
at the University of
Washington at St. Louis.

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:50.099
But while in St. Louis

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:54.266
he encountered a collection
of rather rumbustious,

00:00:55.373 --> 00:00:57.880
larger than life academic characters

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.935
who were reading Hegel's
Phenomenology of Spirit.

00:01:01.935 --> 00:01:06.263
The St. Louis Hegelians
were a very vibrant force.

00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:10.542
They were very engaged
with, opposed to the

00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:13.847
emerging naturalism in
American philosophy,

00:01:13.847 --> 00:01:17.138
which ultimately swept them away.

00:01:17.138 --> 00:01:20.012
Howison's legacy was
perhaps the most enduring

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:23.286
of any of the St. Louis Hegelians.

00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:26.189
Josiah Royce was, in
some ways, his nemesis,

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.236
and Howison wrote about Royce,

00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:32.803
"The most depressing sign
about Royce's thinking

00:01:32.803 --> 00:01:34.794
"is that he seems perfectly aware

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.643
"how this makes no provision

00:01:36.643 --> 00:01:38.524
"either for immortality

00:01:38.524 --> 00:01:40.513
"or for real freedom,

00:01:40.513 --> 00:01:43.428
"and yet he appears to have
no uneasiness under it,

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:46.973
"but to contemplate this
ghastly destiny of ours

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:51.140
"with a complacency even
savoring of self satisfaction."

00:01:52.908 --> 00:01:55.062
"In contrast," Howison wrote,

00:01:55.062 --> 00:01:57.895
"the causality of self consciousness,

00:01:57.895 --> 00:02:01.889
"the causality that creates
and incessantly recreates

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:04.111
"in the light of its own idea,

00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:06.704
"and by the attraction of it as an ideal

00:02:06.704 --> 00:02:09.995
"originating in the self
consciousness purely

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:12.473
"is the only complete causality,

00:02:12.473 --> 00:02:14.941
"because it is the only form of being

00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:17.358
"that is unqualifiedly free."

00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:19.445
The kind of gusto

00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:22.127
that comes over in these remarks, I think,

00:02:22.127 --> 00:02:23.580
Howison became the holder

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.677
of the first endowed chair
in philosophy at Berkeley,

00:02:26.677 --> 00:02:29.432
and he built the philosophy department.

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:31.188
He was clearly an influential

00:02:31.188 --> 00:02:33.190
and much loved individual.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.295
I know in his death,

00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:36.787
his friends and colleagues
put together a fund

00:02:36.787 --> 00:02:39.091
which is funding today's lecture

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:40.645
to continue his work

00:02:40.645 --> 00:02:43.068
by bringing the most influential

00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:45.340
and interesting thinkers of the day

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.840
out to the rural wilderness of California.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.862
And I think we couldn't
have a better person

00:02:51.862 --> 00:02:53.824
to continue with that role today

00:02:53.824 --> 00:02:55.905
than Gisela Striker.

00:02:55.905 --> 00:02:59.112
She was Walter C. Klein
Professor of Philosophy

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:01.249
and of the Classics at Harvard.

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:03.532
She specializes in ancient philosophy,

00:03:03.532 --> 00:03:05.515
teaching Plato and Aristotle,

00:03:05.515 --> 00:03:09.281
as well as later Greek and Roman authors.

00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:10.786
She's written mostly on topics

00:03:10.786 --> 00:03:14.757
in Hellenistic philosophy
and Aristotelian logic.

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:15.590
She's the author

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.977
of Essays on Hellenistic
Epistemology and Ethics,

00:03:18.977 --> 00:03:21.627
and others are the
translation and commentary

00:03:21.627 --> 00:03:24.909
on Aristotle's Prior Analytics Book I.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.368
Her current works are
revision and translation

00:03:27.368 --> 00:03:29.237
of the text of the Loeb edition

00:03:29.237 --> 00:03:31.237
of Aristotle's Rhetoric.

00:03:32.072 --> 00:03:34.307
She was named the Professor
of Classical Philosophy

00:03:34.307 --> 00:03:36.623
at Harvard in 1989,

00:03:36.623 --> 00:03:39.181
and the George Martin Lane
Professor of Philosophy

00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:41.514
and of the Classics in 1990.

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:45.409
She left her world in 1997

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.274
to become the Laurence
Professor of Ancient Philosophy

00:03:48.274 --> 00:03:50.459
at the University of Cambridge.

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.162
Three years later, she
returned to her world

00:03:53.162 --> 00:03:54.938
to be greeted by the headline,

00:03:54.938 --> 00:03:56.771
A Peripatetic Returns.

00:03:57.726 --> 00:03:59.302
And she stayed there

00:03:59.302 --> 00:04:01.951
until her retirement in 2011.

00:04:01.951 --> 00:04:05.416
She said that working
through a text slowly

00:04:05.416 --> 00:04:08.284
and talking about it as you go,

00:04:08.284 --> 00:04:11.880
without the pressure of providing
a bibliography or a paper,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.630
is a way of generating new ideas.

00:04:16.134 --> 00:04:19.995
Our title today is Cicero's De Officiis,

00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:22.718
Stoic Ethics Without Metaphysics.

00:04:22.718 --> 00:04:25.559
Please join me in
welcoming Gisela Striker.

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:28.726
(audience applauding)

00:04:31.936 --> 00:04:35.369
- I like the story about Howison,

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:38.568
but I'm not a Hegelian at all,

00:04:38.568 --> 00:04:40.784
so it won't be inspiring.

00:04:40.784 --> 00:04:42.117
Can't help that.

00:04:43.022 --> 00:04:44.961
On the other hand, you know,

00:04:44.961 --> 00:04:46.923
not everybody can be as inspiring

00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:49.573
as the Washington Hegelians,

00:04:49.573 --> 00:04:52.823
so you'll have to put up with whatever.

00:04:53.798 --> 00:04:56.197
I hope everybody has a handout,

00:04:56.197 --> 00:04:59.061
and we'll see whether, you know,

00:04:59.061 --> 00:05:02.811
you don't get too bored
with good old Cicero,

00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:09.883
you know, whose prestige
has considerably lessened

00:05:09.883 --> 00:05:13.478
since the time that everybody
had to read his book.

00:05:13.478 --> 00:05:14.311
So anyway,

00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:21.258
let me say a few words
about the title of this talk

00:05:21.258 --> 00:05:23.508
and then also about Cicero.

00:05:24.381 --> 00:05:26.548
I left the title in Latin,

00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:30.528
which wasn't just pure arrogance.

00:05:30.528 --> 00:05:34.145
It was simply because that was the title

00:05:34.145 --> 00:05:37.233
during the time that this
particular book by Cicero

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:39.761
was the most influential,

00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:41.395
namely, between the Renaissance,

00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:44.909
and well, the early 19th century.

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.602
That was a time when
everybody had to read Cicero.

00:05:47.602 --> 00:05:49.534
Cicero was, at the time,

00:05:49.534 --> 00:05:51.768
for the people who were reading him,

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:54.102
a philosopher rather than what we now

00:05:54.102 --> 00:05:55.242
tend to think of him,

00:05:55.242 --> 00:05:58.439
as an orator or maybe a politician.

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:59.468
He was, as it were,

00:05:59.468 --> 00:06:02.118
on the curricula of anybody who studied

00:06:02.118 --> 00:06:04.554
something like philosophy in college,

00:06:04.554 --> 00:06:07.276
but his influence even went wider.

00:06:07.276 --> 00:06:09.937
It was such that, I think,

00:06:09.937 --> 00:06:13.056
every sort of educated gentleman

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:14.844
in most European countries,

00:06:14.844 --> 00:06:16.441
certainly in England,

00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:19.414
was expected to have read that book.

00:06:19.414 --> 00:06:20.981
And so Hume, for example,

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:23.538
which I always liked,

00:06:23.538 --> 00:06:27.740
refers to it comfortably
as Tullius Officiis.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.559
He doesn't have to explain, you know?

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:30.790
Everybody knows what's meant.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.877
So Tullius Officiis is,

00:06:32.877 --> 00:06:35.986
I mean, it was Marcus Tullius Cicero,

00:06:35.986 --> 00:06:38.288
so that was Cicero's family name.

00:06:38.288 --> 00:06:41.183
Tullius Officiis was, as it were,

00:06:41.183 --> 00:06:45.350
a part of every aspiring
young gentleman's education

00:06:46.648 --> 00:06:49.879
up to the turn of the 18th century.

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:51.652
So that's the book I wanted to talk about,

00:06:51.652 --> 00:06:54.504
but then there is also another thing,

00:06:54.504 --> 00:06:58.442
Cicero's prestige, of course, went down,

00:06:58.442 --> 00:07:00.120
that's why I said up to the beginning

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.250
of the 19th century,

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.361
when people became obsessed with the idea

00:07:03.361 --> 00:07:06.292
of originality and genius.

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:09.365
And also, when the history of philosophy

00:07:09.365 --> 00:07:11.274
became a little bit more,

00:07:11.274 --> 00:07:13.173
as it were, historically informed,

00:07:13.173 --> 00:07:15.128
and people were not just treated

00:07:15.128 --> 00:07:17.175
as though they had sort of inscribed

00:07:17.175 --> 00:07:18.294
and toned their doctrines,

00:07:18.294 --> 00:07:19.758
and you could treat them as though

00:07:19.758 --> 00:07:21.824
they were all from the same time.

00:07:21.824 --> 00:07:24.382
So that was actually Hegel's fault.

00:07:24.382 --> 00:07:27.512
So he does come up. (chuckles)

00:07:27.512 --> 00:07:29.760
So then at that time, you know,

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.142
people began talking about Cicero

00:07:31.142 --> 00:07:33.522
was not at all an original philosopher,

00:07:33.522 --> 00:07:34.884
nor, I have to say,

00:07:34.884 --> 00:07:37.590
would he ever have
claimed to have been one.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.978
And also, I think, at least
some ancient historians

00:07:40.978 --> 00:07:44.228
decided that he was no
good as a politician.

00:07:44.228 --> 00:07:46.485
So Cicero disappeared,

00:07:46.485 --> 00:07:48.666
except for those people

00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:52.026
who took the classical
languages in high school,

00:07:52.026 --> 00:07:55.096
he disappeared from the
philosophy curriculum.

00:07:55.096 --> 00:07:57.256
And also, I think,

00:07:57.256 --> 00:07:59.760
that may something to do with
the politics of the time,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.352
but in any case, the book, De Officiis,

00:08:02.352 --> 00:08:04.226
which is a kind of book of manners

00:08:04.226 --> 00:08:07.452
for aspiring gentlemen,
namely aristocrats,

00:08:07.452 --> 00:08:08.452
sort of also

00:08:09.507 --> 00:08:12.614
was perhaps less apt to be read

00:08:12.614 --> 00:08:14.746
by people living at that time.

00:08:14.746 --> 00:08:16.246
Be that as it may,

00:08:17.607 --> 00:08:20.177
since Cicero was not an
original philosopher,

00:08:20.177 --> 00:08:21.010
and as I said, you know,

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.899
the idea that you have to
be an original philosopher

00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:25.996
is questionable.

00:08:25.996 --> 00:08:28.525
Mmm, yes, most of us aren't,

00:08:28.525 --> 00:08:30.388
and you know, philosophy wouldn't exist

00:08:30.388 --> 00:08:32.872
if people had to be (chuckles)

00:08:32.872 --> 00:08:34.705
original philosophers.

00:08:36.858 --> 00:08:37.691
So Cicero

00:08:40.904 --> 00:08:43.643
was actually something very important

00:08:43.643 --> 00:08:46.581
in the development of European philosophy.

00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:49.207
Namely, he was, I think one can say

00:08:49.207 --> 00:08:50.960
without much exaggeration,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.043
he was the person who
actually made philosophy,

00:08:54.043 --> 00:08:55.562
which was a Greek affair,

00:08:55.562 --> 00:08:57.895
as the word still indicates,

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:01.421
familiar to the Romans

00:09:01.421 --> 00:09:05.004
by writing books in
Latin about philosophy.

00:09:06.283 --> 00:09:07.611
He had studied philosophy,

00:09:07.611 --> 00:09:10.627
I think he had had a
very serious interest.

00:09:10.627 --> 00:09:13.614
He was well informed about
the philosophies of his days,

00:09:13.614 --> 00:09:16.117
and he was a great admirer of Plato,

00:09:16.117 --> 00:09:18.775
no doubt because Plato was
not only a philosophical,

00:09:18.775 --> 00:09:21.648
but also a literary genius.

00:09:21.648 --> 00:09:23.148
And Cicero himself

00:09:24.088 --> 00:09:26.749
was evidently a very talented writer,

00:09:26.749 --> 00:09:28.658
not just a speaker,

00:09:28.658 --> 00:09:31.981
and so he took it upon himself, I think,

00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:34.539
to write things in Latin,

00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:37.337
so that people, as he
quite correctly says,

00:09:37.337 --> 00:09:41.213
can also discuss the subject
in their own language.

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:42.509
It is clear from some remarks

00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:45.389
in some of the prefaces
to his philosophical books

00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:47.318
that some people said, "No, come on.

00:09:47.318 --> 00:09:48.636
"You know, we're all bilingual.

00:09:48.636 --> 00:09:49.897
"Everybody knows Greek.

00:09:49.897 --> 00:09:52.310
"Why should you do this in Latin?"

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.358
But he insisted, and I
think he's quite right,

00:09:54.358 --> 00:09:56.298
that in order to appreciate philosophy,

00:09:56.298 --> 00:09:59.306
you have to be able to discuss it

00:09:59.306 --> 00:10:01.934
with your friends in your own language.

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:06.423
And so I think we owe
a great debt to Cicero,

00:10:06.423 --> 00:10:08.925
and then perhaps, as a second,

00:10:08.925 --> 00:10:09.984
in the role of Seneca,

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:10.900
who was an admirer

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.871
who appeared about 100
years later than Cicero,

00:10:14.871 --> 00:10:17.260
that philosophy became something

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.297
you could easily do in Latin.

00:10:19.297 --> 00:10:22.347
This was not very easy because philosophy,

00:10:22.347 --> 00:10:25.508
by the time that Cicero
was beginning that work,

00:10:25.508 --> 00:10:28.590
already had developed
quite a bit of terminology

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.929
that simply wasn't available.

00:10:30.929 --> 00:10:33.038
And we know from Cicero's correspondence

00:10:33.038 --> 00:10:34.336
with his friend Atticus

00:10:34.336 --> 00:10:35.699
that he often sort of struggled

00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:37.227
with finding the right word.

00:10:37.227 --> 00:10:39.685
Fortunately, he really
knew Greek extremely well.

00:10:39.685 --> 00:10:43.431
He had a fine ear for style and so on.

00:10:43.431 --> 00:10:44.682
But he had, for example,

00:10:44.682 --> 00:10:45.675
a dispute with Atticus

00:10:45.675 --> 00:10:47.425
about whether officii

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:53.083
was the right word to
translate the Greek kathekonta.

00:10:53.083 --> 00:10:55.799
However that may be, he did that.

00:10:55.799 --> 00:10:57.966
So Cicero was, as it were,

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.293
someone who prepared the way

00:11:00.293 --> 00:11:01.678
for philosophy being done,

00:11:01.678 --> 00:11:04.280
and also, in doing so,

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.793
he wanted to introduce some of his

00:11:06.793 --> 00:11:11.254
perhaps not quite so bilingual
and educated countrymen

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:13.188
to philosophy itself.

00:11:13.188 --> 00:11:14.718
So towards the end of his life,

00:11:14.718 --> 00:11:18.191
when he could no longer
act as a politician

00:11:18.191 --> 00:11:21.779
because Caesar had sort of won the day,

00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:25.245
he decided that he could
serve his country best

00:11:25.245 --> 00:11:28.106
by writing a kind of survey

00:11:28.106 --> 00:11:30.117
of the main topics of philosophy,

00:11:30.117 --> 00:11:32.733
a kind of philosophical encyclopedia,

00:11:32.733 --> 00:11:36.028
which is what he did until his death.

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:39.067
Now the De Officiis is
actually his very last book.

00:11:39.067 --> 00:11:42.306
It's not part of that encyclopedia.

00:11:42.306 --> 00:11:44.375
It was dedicated to his son,

00:11:44.375 --> 00:11:46.394
who was spending time in Athens

00:11:46.394 --> 00:11:48.696
to get an education, or so Cicero hoped.

00:11:48.696 --> 00:11:50.944
But perhaps understandable

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:53.312
with such an overbearing father,

00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:54.896
it seems that young Marcus

00:11:54.896 --> 00:11:58.193
wasn't so interested in philosophy.

00:11:58.193 --> 00:11:59.422
Be that as it may,

00:11:59.422 --> 00:12:02.050
Cicero wanted to write this,

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.905
and I think it's important to know

00:12:03.905 --> 00:12:06.036
because that has sort of made it a book

00:12:06.036 --> 00:12:07.286
that sort of is

00:12:10.006 --> 00:12:12.701
dedicated to and written for

00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:16.284
what Americans tend to
call future leaders.

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:20.625
So young Marcus was not a future leader.

00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:23.709
He liked horses and wine better.

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:26.212
But anyway, Cicero chose a topic

00:12:26.212 --> 00:12:28.603
that would be accessible to everyone,

00:12:28.603 --> 00:12:31.016
you know, not metaphysics or anything

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:33.809
as abstract as even epistemology.

00:12:33.809 --> 00:12:35.892
So he chose a book about,

00:12:37.161 --> 00:12:38.649
well, how one should act

00:12:38.649 --> 00:12:39.778
and how one should deliberate

00:12:39.778 --> 00:12:41.798
about you know, what
the right thing to do is

00:12:41.798 --> 00:12:44.392
and how one should behave and so on.

00:12:44.392 --> 00:12:47.364
He wrote this in the
last month of his life

00:12:47.364 --> 00:12:49.041
in a great hurry.

00:12:49.041 --> 00:12:51.210
And so in this particular case,

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:52.826
unlike other cases,

00:12:52.826 --> 00:12:55.623
it is pretty clear that
he was more or less

00:12:55.623 --> 00:12:57.877
following one particular author

00:12:57.877 --> 00:13:00.172
and one particular book.

00:13:00.172 --> 00:13:01.411
In the other cases,

00:13:01.411 --> 00:13:03.065
he usually has read several books,

00:13:03.065 --> 00:13:03.898
and people, you know,

00:13:03.898 --> 00:13:06.431
spend a lot of time trying
figure out which ones.

00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:07.769
Fortunately, in this case,

00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:09.460
I don't have to do this.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.697
He was reading Panaetius' book,

00:13:12.697 --> 00:13:14.915
the Peri tou Kathekontos,

00:13:14.915 --> 00:13:16.748
on appropriate action.

00:13:18.957 --> 00:13:21.874
And Panaetius was actually a Stoic.

00:13:23.238 --> 00:13:25.321
He was sort of the leader

00:13:27.004 --> 00:13:29.041
of the Stoic school

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:30.010
in the second century,

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.357
so Cicero didn't know him personally,

00:13:32.357 --> 00:13:33.965
but he chose that book,

00:13:33.965 --> 00:13:36.390
and that's, of course, important.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.270
At least one reason for
choosing that particular book

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.753
was that Panaetius, unlike other Stoics

00:13:41.753 --> 00:13:44.490
who were notorious for
their horrible style,

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.263
like Chrysippus, he was
always held up as an example

00:13:47.263 --> 00:13:49.556
of how one shouldn't write,

00:13:49.556 --> 00:13:53.056
Panaetius wrote in elegant literary Greek.

00:13:54.473 --> 00:13:57.313
And so Cicero, in other places,

00:13:57.313 --> 00:13:59.063
praises him for that.

00:14:00.137 --> 00:14:02.633
And that also means that Panaetius

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:06.109
left out some of the hairsplitting

00:14:06.109 --> 00:14:09.276
or sometimes even barbaric terminology

00:14:10.229 --> 00:14:13.134
that the Stoics tended to indulge in.

00:14:13.134 --> 00:14:15.250
They like to make very fine distinctions,

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.916
not all of which they
could find in the language,

00:14:17.916 --> 00:14:19.006
and so if they couldn't,

00:14:19.006 --> 00:14:21.420
they would form their own expressions,

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.775
and that made someone like Galen,

00:14:23.775 --> 00:14:25.177
a long time afterwards,

00:14:25.177 --> 00:14:29.576
say that they probably didn't
even know proper Greek.

00:14:29.576 --> 00:14:32.325
Anyway, so they would distinguish between

00:14:32.325 --> 00:14:34.368
selecting and choosing.

00:14:34.368 --> 00:14:36.568
And you know, you select
one kind of change.

00:14:36.568 --> 00:14:38.757
Well, choosing is more important.

00:14:38.757 --> 00:14:43.283
But perhaps their most
famous and most awkward term

00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:45.450
was preferred indifferent,

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:50.589
or dispreferred indifferent.

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:52.132
That's even nicer.

00:14:52.132 --> 00:14:53.909
And one can imagine

00:14:53.909 --> 00:14:55.242
that the Romans,

00:14:57.116 --> 00:14:59.185
I mean, for whom Cicero was writing,

00:14:59.185 --> 00:15:01.852
including, but not only his son,

00:15:02.716 --> 00:15:05.094
and who weren't specializing in philosophy

00:15:05.094 --> 00:15:07.061
would just have fallen asleep

00:15:07.061 --> 00:15:09.775
after about an hour of this kind of stuff.

00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:11.439
So Cicero was happy to find a book

00:15:11.439 --> 00:15:13.149
that they could read.

00:15:13.149 --> 00:15:14.202
And I believe,

00:15:14.202 --> 00:15:15.072
I mean, you know,

00:15:15.072 --> 00:15:16.512
from what we know about Panaetius,

00:15:16.512 --> 00:15:18.206
that it's quite likely

00:15:18.206 --> 00:15:19.898
that Panaetius himself

00:15:19.898 --> 00:15:23.619
was writing for educated
upper-class Romans,

00:15:23.619 --> 00:15:25.772
because at the time, in Panaetius' time,

00:15:25.772 --> 00:15:28.265
you know, he was from
the island of Rhodes,

00:15:28.265 --> 00:15:31.028
and that was already
part of the Roman Empire.

00:15:31.028 --> 00:15:33.474
He came to Rome often.

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:37.641
He was friends with very
prominent Roman politicians.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.398
So I think one can assume

00:15:41.398 --> 00:15:44.438
that he probably wrote
for the kind of audience

00:15:44.438 --> 00:15:47.686
that would have appreciated
something like that

00:15:47.686 --> 00:15:49.769
written in elegant Greek,

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.776
but would not have bothered to read books

00:15:53.776 --> 00:15:55.859
by the Stoics themselves.

00:15:57.452 --> 00:15:59.202
So this is one reason

00:16:00.224 --> 00:16:03.214
why I think Cicero chose this book.

00:16:03.214 --> 00:16:05.417
Now, people have spent a lot of time

00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:07.227
trying to find out what is Cicero

00:16:07.227 --> 00:16:08.456
and what is Panaetius.

00:16:08.456 --> 00:16:10.621
As it were, Cicero never just translated,

00:16:10.621 --> 00:16:12.120
nor did he just paraphrase.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.242
He says, you know, "I
always use my own judgment."

00:16:14.242 --> 00:16:17.831
I'm pretty convinced that
he abbreviated quite a lot

00:16:17.831 --> 00:16:21.450
in this case, because
he put Panaetius' books

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.367
in the shorter version.

00:16:26.178 --> 00:16:27.539
And so people have been figuring out

00:16:27.539 --> 00:16:29.515
is this Panaetius or not.

00:16:29.515 --> 00:16:32.044
That's not what I want to do here.

00:16:32.044 --> 00:16:33.921
That's why I started with, you know,

00:16:33.921 --> 00:16:36.588
the book as it was written
in the 18th century.

00:16:36.588 --> 00:16:38.252
I want to talk about this book.

00:16:38.252 --> 00:16:40.752
And I assume that yes, I mean,

00:16:41.724 --> 00:16:44.057
in a way, Cicero is the hero of this book

00:16:44.057 --> 00:16:45.913
because of his influence,

00:16:45.913 --> 00:16:49.076
but Panaetius is
presumably the philosopher

00:16:49.076 --> 00:16:50.415
that I'm going to talk about.

00:16:50.415 --> 00:16:53.442
But since Panaetius'
own works are all lost,

00:16:53.442 --> 00:16:57.609
I thought that giving the
title Panaetius to that talk

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:00.840
would make it, sort of would guarantee

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.260
that nobody would show up.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.717
(audience chuckling)

00:17:04.717 --> 00:17:06.662
So there we go.

00:17:06.662 --> 00:17:09.384
So okay, then one thing to keep in mind,

00:17:09.384 --> 00:17:12.024
and I think I, myself,

00:17:12.024 --> 00:17:14.321
and perhaps only I, I don't know,

00:17:14.321 --> 00:17:16.361
have forgotten it,

00:17:16.361 --> 00:17:18.786
Panaetius is not writing a survey

00:17:18.786 --> 00:17:22.950
or a general exposition of Stoic ethics.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.218
His title indicates that it's only a part

00:17:25.218 --> 00:17:26.434
of Stoic ethic studies

00:17:26.434 --> 00:17:28.487
dealing with the part
that is most relevant

00:17:28.487 --> 00:17:31.147
for people like Cicero's son,

00:17:31.147 --> 00:17:32.952
namely how to behave correctly,

00:17:32.952 --> 00:17:35.807
what to do, how to make
decisions and so on.

00:17:35.807 --> 00:17:38.782
That is to say he was writing
about appropriate action.

00:17:38.782 --> 00:17:40.905
He was not giving, as it were,

00:17:40.905 --> 00:17:42.746
a theoretical framework

00:17:42.746 --> 00:17:44.793
that the Stoics would have used

00:17:44.793 --> 00:17:47.274
to explain why acting in this way

00:17:47.274 --> 00:17:49.774
was the correct way of acting.

00:17:50.783 --> 00:17:53.284
He could leave it out

00:17:53.284 --> 00:17:54.784
in a book like that,

00:17:54.784 --> 00:17:56.784
just indicate something.

00:17:57.878 --> 00:18:00.612
And so one needs to keep in mind

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:03.532
that this is not all
there is to Greek ethics,

00:18:03.532 --> 00:18:06.058
but as I will sort of
be saying at the end,

00:18:06.058 --> 00:18:09.701
not if you're living in the 18th century.

00:18:09.701 --> 00:18:11.511
So this is about appropriate action,

00:18:11.511 --> 00:18:12.526
how we should act,

00:18:12.526 --> 00:18:15.359
and unfortunately for us, I think,

00:18:16.674 --> 00:18:20.841
Cicero has not preserved
Panaetius' introduction preface.

00:18:22.135 --> 00:18:24.135
Well, you know, prefaces

00:18:25.099 --> 00:18:26.537
tended to include a dedication,

00:18:26.537 --> 00:18:29.778
so Cicero has a dedicatory
epistle to his son,

00:18:29.778 --> 00:18:31.968
and then he explains to
him how important it is

00:18:31.968 --> 00:18:35.758
that anyone should
really have thought about

00:18:35.758 --> 00:18:39.446
how to act and speak correctly and so on.

00:18:39.446 --> 00:18:41.076
So it's a very important subject

00:18:41.076 --> 00:18:42.651
that anyone who is educated

00:18:42.651 --> 00:18:44.988
and not just philosophers
need to know about,

00:18:44.988 --> 00:18:46.786
and so on and so forth.

00:18:46.786 --> 00:18:48.408
And then,

00:18:48.408 --> 00:18:51.590
then he suddenly sadly
falls into something

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:55.257
like rather pedantic
criticisms of Panaetius

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.717
without even having mentioned his name

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.600
as the author he's following.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.613
I'm following many Stoic ideas.

00:19:06.613 --> 00:19:08.899
The fact is, and I haven't
found this mentioned

00:19:08.899 --> 00:19:09.910
in any commentary,

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.024
which I think is really amusing,

00:19:12.024 --> 00:19:14.192
Panaetius doesn't get mentioned

00:19:14.192 --> 00:19:16.110
at the beginning, you know,

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.401
but he says, "And this
is what he does wrong.

00:19:18.401 --> 00:19:20.377
"He doesn't really use the right..."

00:19:20.377 --> 00:19:22.534
Okay, so it seems to me

00:19:22.534 --> 00:19:24.644
that this is one sign of Cicero

00:19:24.644 --> 00:19:26.568
not having had the time
to revise this book.

00:19:26.568 --> 00:19:27.401
He didn't.

00:19:27.401 --> 00:19:28.777
I mean, when he came back from

00:19:28.777 --> 00:19:30.542
the trip on which he wrote it,

00:19:30.542 --> 00:19:32.921
he had a few political speeches,

00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:35.620
his famous Philippics to give in Rome,

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.664
and then he was murdered shortly after.

00:19:38.664 --> 00:19:41.831
It was after all the time, his reward.

00:19:43.393 --> 00:19:45.047
So I don't think that he would have left

00:19:45.047 --> 00:19:46.958
those rather ill-tempered remarks in it

00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:48.587
that if he had revised the book.

00:19:48.587 --> 00:19:50.763
He would at least have
mentioned Panaetius,

00:19:50.763 --> 00:19:53.589
and perhaps complimented
him on his good style,

00:19:53.589 --> 00:19:56.779
as he does in some of his other works.

00:19:56.779 --> 00:19:59.034
So all we can learn from this introduction

00:19:59.034 --> 00:20:00.823
is that the book is intended

00:20:00.823 --> 00:20:02.881
as a true deliberation

00:20:02.881 --> 00:20:05.808
about you know, decision-making,

00:20:05.808 --> 00:20:08.243
and organized around three questions

00:20:08.243 --> 00:20:09.337
that will come up.

00:20:09.337 --> 00:20:13.091
There's first, the question
whether a proposed action

00:20:13.091 --> 00:20:14.758
is honorable or not,

00:20:15.883 --> 00:20:18.367
honesto, this is a Latin word.

00:20:18.367 --> 00:20:21.317
Then, whether it is useful or expedient.

00:20:21.317 --> 00:20:24.983
And sometimes, one would face difficulties

00:20:24.983 --> 00:20:26.694
when those two criteria,

00:20:26.694 --> 00:20:28.773
the honorable and the useful,

00:20:28.773 --> 00:20:31.773
came into conflict with one another.

00:20:33.097 --> 00:20:35.667
One footnote, I have kept honorable,

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:39.109
which is closer to the Latin honestum.

00:20:39.109 --> 00:20:40.704
It could also be translated,

00:20:40.704 --> 00:20:43.477
but I'm not sure that that's
the best way to proceed,

00:20:43.477 --> 00:20:44.953
as morally good.

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.161
So the question is, you know,

00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:48.293
first, you consider
whether this is honorable

00:20:48.293 --> 00:20:51.813
in the sense of morally
acceptable or praiseworthy.

00:20:51.813 --> 00:20:55.153
Then you consider whether
it's sort of good for you,

00:20:55.153 --> 00:20:57.780
useful in that particular sense.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.594
And then, you know, sometimes,

00:20:59.594 --> 00:21:02.265
you'll find that those
two things conflict,

00:21:02.265 --> 00:21:04.480
and you have to figure out

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.063
what to do in such a situation.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.293
Yeah, but that can't have been all

00:21:11.293 --> 00:21:13.035
that Panaetius did.

00:21:13.035 --> 00:21:14.202
And so instead

00:21:15.349 --> 00:21:17.549
of the missing introduction,

00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:19.394
I have, on the handout,

00:21:19.394 --> 00:21:21.784
I have quoted a line not from Cicero

00:21:21.784 --> 00:21:23.676
and from a Greek author,

00:21:23.676 --> 00:21:26.141
who unfortunately just,

00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:29.199
you know, gives it in a
list of people's definitions

00:21:29.199 --> 00:21:30.406
of the aim of life,

00:21:30.406 --> 00:21:31.550
and that's Clement Alexandria,

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.000
who's a Church Father.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.997
Panaetius declared that the aim of life

00:21:35.997 --> 00:21:39.636
is living according to the resources

00:21:39.636 --> 00:21:43.282
or starting points given to us by nature.

00:21:43.282 --> 00:21:44.817
I don't want to quibble about, you know,

00:21:44.817 --> 00:21:47.458
whether that was sort of
the official definition.

00:21:47.458 --> 00:21:50.091
We cannot tell from Clement's testimony.

00:21:50.091 --> 00:21:51.594
But it does tell us,

00:21:51.594 --> 00:21:53.319
and that's why I'm quoting it,

00:21:53.319 --> 00:21:56.236
it does tell us what actually

00:21:56.236 --> 00:21:58.409
Cicero does at the beginning,

00:21:58.409 --> 00:22:02.125
when he evidently turns
to Panaetius' exposition.

00:22:02.125 --> 00:22:03.673
So what does it mean

00:22:03.673 --> 00:22:08.084
to live according the
resources or starting points?

00:22:08.084 --> 00:22:10.213
Aphorme is actually not the same as horme.

00:22:10.213 --> 00:22:12.323
Horme is impulses, you
know, historic term.

00:22:12.323 --> 00:22:14.573
Aphorme is Panaetius' term.

00:22:16.594 --> 00:22:18.844
Well, that's what we get in

00:22:20.303 --> 00:22:22.139
the first chapters of that book,

00:22:22.139 --> 00:22:25.806
and that's what I'm
going to talk about now.

00:22:27.443 --> 00:22:29.276
It begins deceptively,

00:22:30.163 --> 00:22:33.907
almost like general
introductions to Stoicism,

00:22:33.907 --> 00:22:38.807
mentioning two natural
tendency or impulses that,

00:22:38.807 --> 00:22:40.733
according to the Stoics,

00:22:40.733 --> 00:22:44.389
all animals, including
humans have in common.

00:22:44.389 --> 00:22:47.169
Namely, they all have instinct
for self-preservation,

00:22:47.169 --> 00:22:48.469
which, for example, you know,

00:22:48.469 --> 00:22:50.314
makes them find the
right kind of nourishment

00:22:50.314 --> 00:22:51.712
and so on and so forth,

00:22:51.712 --> 00:22:54.212
and they also have an instinct

00:22:55.057 --> 00:22:59.171
to care about people of the same species,

00:22:59.171 --> 00:23:01.095
and the example tends to be parents

00:23:01.095 --> 00:23:03.806
caring for their children.

00:23:03.806 --> 00:23:06.817
And that's true not just
of humans, as I said.

00:23:06.817 --> 00:23:09.337
This is the famous doctrine of oikeiosis

00:23:09.337 --> 00:23:14.085
as being a word that everybody
says is untranslatable.

00:23:14.085 --> 00:23:17.086
So it's sort of feel concern for something

00:23:17.086 --> 00:23:19.499
as belonging to one.

00:23:19.499 --> 00:23:23.670
But then, although he
mentions those two things,

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:24.889
he turns to something

00:23:24.889 --> 00:23:27.557
that we do not find in
other Stoic sources,

00:23:27.557 --> 00:23:29.216
namely, he, as it were,

00:23:29.216 --> 00:23:31.372
applies this to the case of humans.

00:23:31.372 --> 00:23:34.507
Each species follows its own nature,

00:23:34.507 --> 00:23:37.983
and that means he now
develops the resources

00:23:37.983 --> 00:23:42.150
that humans have insofar as
they are rational beings.

00:23:43.197 --> 00:23:47.182
So it's not really the
old doctrine of oikeiosis,

00:23:47.182 --> 00:23:51.086
of concern, self-concern,
and social concern,

00:23:51.086 --> 00:23:53.753
which we find as the basest base

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.240
of Stoic ethics in other authors.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.187
Panaetius does seem to
have added something to it,

00:24:02.187 --> 00:24:04.463
and he develops a description

00:24:04.463 --> 00:24:08.630
of four of these tendencies
based on human rationality,

00:24:10.176 --> 00:24:13.147
that together will lead you,

00:24:13.147 --> 00:24:14.493
as it were, to virtue,

00:24:14.493 --> 00:24:16.506
i.e. he describes them in such a way

00:24:16.506 --> 00:24:18.819
that following these tendencies

00:24:18.819 --> 00:24:20.943
and reaching the aims that they have

00:24:20.943 --> 00:24:23.758
will make you a virtuous person.

00:24:23.758 --> 00:24:25.575
This is now,

00:24:25.575 --> 00:24:27.501
I'm coming to the next
thing on the handout,

00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:29.893
but I'll just summarize because, I mean,

00:24:29.893 --> 00:24:32.588
it's going to get too long if I don't.

00:24:32.588 --> 00:24:35.715
So he starts out with justice,

00:24:35.715 --> 00:24:38.506
and having read Aristotle, no doubt,

00:24:38.506 --> 00:24:40.801
he says, "Well, humans have language."

00:24:40.801 --> 00:24:42.860
And actually, what we now all see

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.394
as the old definition, rational animal,

00:24:45.394 --> 00:24:47.373
is much likely to have started

00:24:47.373 --> 00:24:51.065
as language-using animal, that's logikon.

00:24:51.065 --> 00:24:52.049
Cicero knows that.

00:24:52.049 --> 00:24:54.950
He translates it as ratio et oratio,

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.027
reason and language.

00:24:57.027 --> 00:25:00.022
The word mean both in Greek.

00:25:00.022 --> 00:25:01.882
So humans are language users,

00:25:01.882 --> 00:25:03.478
and because they're language users,

00:25:03.478 --> 00:25:05.521
they are capable of talking,

00:25:05.521 --> 00:25:07.817
making plans for the future

00:25:07.817 --> 00:25:09.765
and making rules for themselves and so on.

00:25:09.765 --> 00:25:12.139
So they are, as Aristotle says,

00:25:12.139 --> 00:25:14.159
much more sociable than herd animals

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:15.926
because they can discuss

00:25:15.926 --> 00:25:17.159
and set rules for themselves,

00:25:17.159 --> 00:25:18.442
they can introduce justice.

00:25:18.442 --> 00:25:20.665
So that's the basis of justice.

00:25:20.665 --> 00:25:21.909
The next item is knowledge.

00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:23.090
Humans are rational,

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.007
so they are, by nature,

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.724
inclined to try and learn
as much as they can.

00:25:29.724 --> 00:25:31.197
They want knowledge.

00:25:31.197 --> 00:25:33.294
And then come to other things

00:25:33.294 --> 00:25:35.830
that are slightly more problematic.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:36.830
The next is,

00:25:38.288 --> 00:25:41.577
one would expect in this case, courage.

00:25:41.577 --> 00:25:43.803
I mean, if it's the four cardinal virtue,

00:25:43.803 --> 00:25:47.720
but Panaetius has
magnanimity, magnitudo animi,

00:25:49.438 --> 00:25:53.605
which he describes as a
certain desire for leadership.

00:25:57.596 --> 00:26:00.569
So as a result of which he says,

00:26:00.569 --> 00:26:02.215
"A mind well-equipped by nature

00:26:02.215 --> 00:26:04.239
"is not willing to obey anyone,

00:26:04.239 --> 00:26:07.227
"except a person who
offers advice or teaching,

00:26:07.227 --> 00:26:10.442
"or whose commands given
justly and legitimately

00:26:10.442 --> 00:26:13.029
"for the sake of some benefit."

00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.989
In a later chapter,

00:26:13.989 --> 00:26:16.222
when he deals with that
virtue in particular,

00:26:16.222 --> 00:26:18.475
he actually calls it a desire for freedom.

00:26:18.475 --> 00:26:20.000
So he seems to think

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.756
that people have a natural desire

00:26:21.756 --> 00:26:23.780
for something like autonomy,

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.804
and that's what he's describing here,

00:26:25.804 --> 00:26:29.971
and putting in the place of
the usual case of courage.

00:26:31.072 --> 00:26:35.045
This is not really deviating
much from the Stoics,

00:26:35.045 --> 00:26:37.857
because they had varying lists.

00:26:37.857 --> 00:26:39.545
They had lists of everything.

00:26:39.545 --> 00:26:42.127
They also had lists of
virtues and sub-virtues,

00:26:42.127 --> 00:26:43.581
and usually, it would be courage

00:26:43.581 --> 00:26:45.064
and then magnanimity,

00:26:45.064 --> 00:26:46.809
but you would also reverse it.

00:26:46.809 --> 00:26:50.226
And next comes what is the
second point on the handout,

00:26:50.226 --> 00:26:53.205
namely, what must have been, I think,

00:26:53.205 --> 00:26:56.228
Panaetius' most important innovation.

00:26:56.228 --> 00:26:58.290
We are told that man alone,

00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:59.532
as a rational animal,

00:26:59.532 --> 00:27:01.656
has a sense of order and propriety

00:27:01.656 --> 00:27:02.959
and of the right measure

00:27:02.959 --> 00:27:04.968
in words and deeds,

00:27:04.968 --> 00:27:06.918
and no other animals then

00:27:06.918 --> 00:27:08.666
perceives the beauty,

00:27:08.666 --> 00:27:11.606
the loveliness and harmonious
arrangement of parts

00:27:11.606 --> 00:27:13.924
in things perceived by sight.

00:27:13.924 --> 00:27:16.083
So man's rational nature leads him

00:27:16.083 --> 00:27:18.333
to transfer those qualities

00:27:19.424 --> 00:27:21.591
from the eyes to the mind,

00:27:22.775 --> 00:27:25.842
a transfer, I think, that
would be much easier in Greek,

00:27:25.842 --> 00:27:28.088
because the word for inner beauty

00:27:28.088 --> 00:27:29.719
or for moral virtue

00:27:29.719 --> 00:27:34.622
and for outer formal beauty
is the same, namely, kalon.

00:27:34.622 --> 00:27:36.897
So you transfer it from sight,

00:27:36.897 --> 00:27:39.064
from the eyes to the mind.

00:27:43.018 --> 00:27:45.836
And thinks that beauty,
constancy, and order

00:27:45.836 --> 00:27:48.528
should be preserved, and much more so

00:27:48.528 --> 00:27:51.541
in one's decisions and in one's deeds.

00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:53.689
So first, you say,

00:27:53.689 --> 00:27:56.096
as there is the beauty of the body,

00:27:56.096 --> 00:27:57.973
so there is the body of the mind,

00:27:57.973 --> 00:28:00.415
but then you also say at the bud,

00:28:00.415 --> 00:28:04.371
that beauty of the mind
is the more important.

00:28:04.371 --> 00:28:05.712
So these people then,

00:28:05.712 --> 00:28:09.150
once they have made that transition,

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:12.163
are careful also to do nothing

00:28:12.163 --> 00:28:15.747
in an unfitting or
effeminate way as a woman,

00:28:15.747 --> 00:28:17.755
in all their opinions and actions,

00:28:17.755 --> 00:28:21.375
thinking and doing nothing licentious.

00:28:21.375 --> 00:28:24.625
Now this is a change because the Greek,

00:28:26.196 --> 00:28:27.406
for some of virtues,

00:28:27.406 --> 00:28:30.581
usually has the virtue of
temperance or moderation,

00:28:30.581 --> 00:28:33.786
Greek sophrosyne, in this place.

00:28:33.786 --> 00:28:35.447
And Cicero actually,

00:28:35.447 --> 00:28:37.245
when he sort of resumes,

00:28:37.245 --> 00:28:40.332
and in a few paragraphs further down,

00:28:40.332 --> 00:28:41.722
what he has said here

00:28:41.722 --> 00:28:43.480
includes moderation and temperance.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.813
So in place of that, we find

00:28:47.414 --> 00:28:49.914
a tendency to recognize beauty

00:28:51.521 --> 00:28:55.153
and then to wish to be beautiful yourself,

00:28:55.153 --> 00:28:56.799
not just in the outer sense

00:28:56.799 --> 00:28:59.813
on which one can't do much,

00:28:59.813 --> 00:29:02.480
but at least in the inner sense,

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.518
and that is described

00:29:03.518 --> 00:29:07.102
as a harmonious fitting together of parts,

00:29:07.102 --> 00:29:09.135
and of course, that corresponds

00:29:09.135 --> 00:29:11.340
to the ancient idea of beauty.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.135
They weren't for the romantic
sort of singularities,

00:29:14.135 --> 00:29:16.096
they were for symmetry and order

00:29:16.096 --> 00:29:17.377
and so on and so forth.

00:29:17.377 --> 00:29:19.544
So this is a description of beauty,

00:29:19.544 --> 00:29:22.507
and you try to have a
soul that is harmonious

00:29:22.507 --> 00:29:25.424
and orderly and so on and so forth.

00:29:27.056 --> 00:29:30.065
What that means, I'm not
going to try to explain,

00:29:30.065 --> 00:29:31.677
but what's remarkable,

00:29:31.677 --> 00:29:34.210
I mean, we (mumbles),

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.340
what's remarkable, I think,

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.850
about this substitution for sophrosyne

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.915
is that it actually is a matter

00:29:40.915 --> 00:29:43.665
of recognizing virtue in general.

00:29:45.036 --> 00:29:47.913
That's, for example, how Seneca uses it.

00:29:47.913 --> 00:29:49.887
He uses the same comparison, no doubt,

00:29:49.887 --> 00:29:54.056
he knew Panaetius and he
certainly knew Cicero,

00:29:54.056 --> 00:29:58.223
to explain how we arrive at
our first notion of the good,

00:29:59.565 --> 00:30:01.481
whereby the good, he evidently means

00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:04.723
what the Stoics saw as
highest good, namely virtue.

00:30:04.723 --> 00:30:06.379
So he has the same analogy.

00:30:06.379 --> 00:30:08.673
You know, you transfer your idea of beauty

00:30:08.673 --> 00:30:11.282
from the sight to the mind,

00:30:11.282 --> 00:30:13.859
and you then desire to become a person

00:30:13.859 --> 00:30:15.555
who has a beautiful mind,

00:30:15.555 --> 00:30:19.138
and that shows in a
kind of harmonious soul

00:30:20.358 --> 00:30:23.525
and corresponding harmonious behavior.

00:30:24.648 --> 00:30:27.908
But it's very odd to
find as a single virtue

00:30:27.908 --> 00:30:31.849
something that seems to be a
desire for virtue in general.

00:30:31.849 --> 00:30:33.942
Cicero doesn't comment on this.

00:30:33.942 --> 00:30:35.233
We cannot tell, of course,

00:30:35.233 --> 00:30:37.650
whether it was just like that

00:30:39.148 --> 00:30:40.670
in Panaetius' book.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:43.083
But one thing that I
think one should realize

00:30:43.083 --> 00:30:45.897
is that there is, as it were,

00:30:45.897 --> 00:30:48.064
a coupling of, I'll call it a faculty,

00:30:48.064 --> 00:30:51.731
which is apparently unique to humans.

00:30:51.731 --> 00:30:53.708
We might even agree with that,

00:30:53.708 --> 00:30:55.106
although, of course, who knows?

00:30:55.106 --> 00:30:57.385
Maybe, you know, birds can.

00:30:57.385 --> 00:31:01.156
But they usually don't
paint pictures and stuff.

00:31:01.156 --> 00:31:03.382
So it's a unique human faculty

00:31:03.382 --> 00:31:05.299
of appreciating beauty,

00:31:07.904 --> 00:31:09.895
and that's a cognitive faculty.

00:31:09.895 --> 00:31:11.793
You can recognize beauty

00:31:11.793 --> 00:31:15.665
and you can apparently
recognize inner beauty

00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:17.340
from the way that people behave

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.753
if they behave in a way

00:31:18.753 --> 00:31:20.819
that corresponds to beauty on the outside,

00:31:20.819 --> 00:31:22.986
namely, orderly and so on.

00:31:24.327 --> 00:31:26.676
Perhaps one can call this
something like integrity.

00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:29.706
This is a word that Seneca uses.

00:31:29.706 --> 00:31:31.929
But you know, that's not the same

00:31:31.929 --> 00:31:35.171
as the somewhat limited virtue

00:31:35.171 --> 00:31:37.508
of temperance or moderation.

00:31:37.508 --> 00:31:40.848
Now one trivial explanation
of these two substitutions,

00:31:40.848 --> 00:31:42.047
which I just mentioned

00:31:42.047 --> 00:31:44.294
but don't think could have been decisive,

00:31:44.294 --> 00:31:47.809
is that both courage and moderation

00:31:47.809 --> 00:31:50.255
aren't usually negatively defined.

00:31:50.255 --> 00:31:51.556
Courage, so we'll say,

00:31:51.556 --> 00:31:53.445
is to do the right thing without fear.

00:31:53.445 --> 00:31:56.391
So courage is mainly the opposite of fear.

00:31:56.391 --> 00:32:01.268
Moderation, of course, is
the avoidance of excess.

00:32:01.268 --> 00:32:02.823
Now if you are Panaetius

00:32:02.823 --> 00:32:04.916
and you want to sort of
talk about tendencies

00:32:04.916 --> 00:32:07.238
to reach certain aims

00:32:07.238 --> 00:32:10.651
that are proper to rational animals,

00:32:10.651 --> 00:32:12.474
then that's not a good idea.

00:32:12.474 --> 00:32:14.738
Whereas in the case of magnitudo animi,

00:32:14.738 --> 00:32:16.905
of, you know, magnanimity,

00:32:17.974 --> 00:32:21.557
he can put leadership
or freedom, autonomy,

00:32:22.499 --> 00:32:23.871
as a goal.

00:32:23.871 --> 00:32:26.235
And in the case sophrosyne,

00:32:26.235 --> 00:32:28.843
he can put beauty as a goal.

00:32:28.843 --> 00:32:31.275
That is one possibility.

00:32:31.275 --> 00:32:33.196
Well, I think if it were just that,

00:32:33.196 --> 00:32:35.024
that would be boring.

00:32:35.024 --> 00:32:37.535
The fact is that Cicero,
in this particular passage,

00:32:37.535 --> 00:32:38.952
does not explain.

00:32:40.548 --> 00:32:43.631
He doesn't even tell us that this is,

00:32:45.174 --> 00:32:47.455
he doesn't sort of notify us

00:32:47.455 --> 00:32:48.955
that there's two things.

00:32:48.955 --> 00:32:50.722
But if we then turn,

00:32:50.722 --> 00:32:52.171
and that's the next thing on the handout,

00:32:52.171 --> 00:32:55.325
to the end of book one of the De Officiis,

00:32:55.325 --> 00:32:56.158
93 to 95,

00:32:57.603 --> 00:32:58.953
we get an explanation

00:32:58.953 --> 00:33:01.210
and an official recognition

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:03.903
of this double role of the sense of beauty

00:33:03.903 --> 00:33:05.653
in Panaetius' theory.

00:33:08.218 --> 00:33:10.691
Cicero explains first, you know,

00:33:10.691 --> 00:33:13.799
we have to, we get to
the last of the virtues,

00:33:13.799 --> 00:33:14.716
and this is

00:33:17.568 --> 00:33:19.978
to be explained for as the fitting.

00:33:19.978 --> 00:33:22.660
I'm sorry that I couldn't
find a better term.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.083
Again, this is sort of

00:33:25.083 --> 00:33:28.083
one that has at least become useful.

00:33:29.289 --> 00:33:31.834
The translation that I've
mostly used has seemly,

00:33:31.834 --> 00:33:34.283
and that's seems to me to be unseemly,

00:33:34.283 --> 00:33:35.950
so I prefer fitting.

00:33:38.009 --> 00:33:41.908
So anyway, Cicero sets out
to explain what he means

00:33:41.908 --> 00:33:43.158
by this virtue,

00:33:45.232 --> 00:33:48.442
saying, "Next, we must
discuss the one remaining part

00:33:48.442 --> 00:33:51.991
"of honorableness, of moral virtue,

00:33:51.991 --> 00:33:54.416
"and it does appear a sense of shame

00:33:54.416 --> 00:33:56.329
"and what one might
call the ordered beauty

00:33:56.329 --> 00:33:58.078
"of life, restraint, and modesty."

00:33:58.078 --> 00:34:00.906
This sounds more like
sophrosyne than anything else.

00:34:00.906 --> 00:34:03.550
"A calming of all the
agitations of the mind

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.930
"and the due measure in all things."

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.578
And at this setting is included

00:34:08.578 --> 00:34:11.578
what in Latin may be called decorum.

00:34:12.529 --> 00:34:15.952
The beauty of this is that
decorum is still a word

00:34:15.952 --> 00:34:18.662
and I'm absolutely convinced
that the English language

00:34:18.662 --> 00:34:21.218
got it from this book.

00:34:21.218 --> 00:34:22.135
So decorum,

00:34:23.416 --> 00:34:25.499
the Greek word is prepon.

00:34:27.237 --> 00:34:28.484
Yeah, the essence of this

00:34:28.484 --> 00:34:30.077
is that it cannot be separated

00:34:30.077 --> 00:34:31.882
from what is honorable or virtuous,

00:34:31.882 --> 00:34:33.821
for what is fitting is honorable

00:34:33.821 --> 00:34:35.823
and what is honorable is fitting.

00:34:35.823 --> 00:34:38.063
It is easier to understand than to explain

00:34:38.063 --> 00:34:39.577
what the difference is

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:43.524
between the honorable and the fitting.

00:34:43.524 --> 00:34:46.245
So he goes on a little bit

00:34:46.245 --> 00:34:48.428
and then says, "Just as the loveliness

00:34:48.428 --> 00:34:49.585
"and beauty of the body

00:34:49.585 --> 00:34:51.598
"cannot be separated from health."

00:34:51.598 --> 00:34:53.841
I think the comparison
is really helpful here.

00:34:53.841 --> 00:34:56.426
So the fitting of which
we are speaking here

00:34:56.426 --> 00:34:58.606
is entirely blended with virtue,

00:34:58.606 --> 00:35:02.166
but can be distinguished
by thought and reflection.

00:35:02.166 --> 00:35:03.666
So the prepon, the

00:35:07.893 --> 00:35:10.177
fitting or whatever you
want to call it, decorum.

00:35:10.177 --> 00:35:14.639
Decorum is actually
inseparable from virtue.

00:35:14.639 --> 00:35:17.254
It is, as he makes clear, I think,

00:35:17.254 --> 00:35:20.337
the outer appearance of inner beauty.

00:35:21.987 --> 00:35:23.328
He says, you know,

00:35:23.328 --> 00:35:26.184
"It doesn't take subtle
reasoning to discern it,

00:35:26.184 --> 00:35:28.936
"but it is in plain view."

00:35:28.936 --> 00:35:31.106
So what he is saying

00:35:31.106 --> 00:35:32.606
is that by prepon,

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:39.088
the Greeks designate something
like the outer visibility

00:35:39.088 --> 00:35:40.421
of inner beauty.

00:35:41.499 --> 00:35:43.745
Now it's important to realize

00:35:43.745 --> 00:35:46.071
that the word prepon had already,

00:35:46.071 --> 00:35:48.959
by the time of Panaetius
and before Cicero,

00:35:48.959 --> 00:35:51.943
become a very common term
in Greek aesthetic theory,

00:35:51.943 --> 00:35:52.980
if you want to call it that,

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.738
namely, literary theory.

00:35:55.738 --> 00:35:58.863
But perhaps more important
for this particular passage

00:35:58.863 --> 00:36:00.698
is that prepon shows up

00:36:00.698 --> 00:36:03.669
in Plato's dialogue, Hippias Major,

00:36:03.669 --> 00:36:06.336
as a term used to define beauty.

00:36:08.927 --> 00:36:11.463
What fits well together to prepon,

00:36:11.463 --> 00:36:12.880
Socrates suggests

00:36:15.004 --> 00:36:15.921
to Hippias.

00:36:17.853 --> 00:36:19.556
Now Plato is not nice to Hippias,

00:36:19.556 --> 00:36:24.209
so Hippias is described
as being extremely obtuse.

00:36:24.209 --> 00:36:25.986
And so it's not a surprise

00:36:25.986 --> 00:36:29.838
that he is unable to defend
the proposed definition

00:36:29.838 --> 00:36:31.068
against the objections

00:36:31.068 --> 00:36:34.735
that Socrates immediately
proceeds to raise.

00:36:36.797 --> 00:36:40.369
When Socrates asks whether to prepon,

00:36:40.369 --> 00:36:43.293
as I said, the fitting or
whatever you want to call it,

00:36:43.293 --> 00:36:46.902
or decorum, is what makes
things appear beautiful

00:36:46.902 --> 00:36:48.839
or what makes them be so,

00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:51.691
Hippias opts for appearing,

00:36:51.691 --> 00:36:54.216
which, I think, is probably correct

00:36:54.216 --> 00:36:56.716
in as far as Greek usage goes.

00:36:58.178 --> 00:37:00.057
But that leads to his defeat

00:37:00.057 --> 00:37:02.201
as you know, most
interlocutors of Socrates,

00:37:02.201 --> 00:37:03.726
of course, lose the battle.

00:37:03.726 --> 00:37:05.969
Socrates proceeds to interpret appearance

00:37:05.969 --> 00:37:09.469
as more and possibly deceptive appearance,

00:37:10.528 --> 00:37:12.308
and argues that this cannot be

00:37:12.308 --> 00:37:16.171
what they're looking for under beauty,

00:37:16.171 --> 00:37:19.746
namely, what accounts for
things being beautiful.

00:37:19.746 --> 00:37:21.327
That's what beauty must be,

00:37:21.327 --> 00:37:24.107
and not appearing to be beautiful.

00:37:24.107 --> 00:37:26.572
But Panaetius was not Hippias,

00:37:26.572 --> 00:37:28.659
and he knew to avail himself

00:37:28.659 --> 00:37:31.370
of a distinction that seems
to be missing in Plato,

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.069
or i.e. Hippias, you know,

00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:36.319
wasn't smart enough to come up with it.

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.831
The distinction between appearance

00:37:39.831 --> 00:37:43.831
as a outer manifestation
of something as beauty,

00:37:44.976 --> 00:37:46.327
I mean physical beauty,

00:37:46.327 --> 00:37:50.468
is supposed to be the
manifestation of health,

00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:53.992
I mean, that's assuming that true,

00:37:53.992 --> 00:37:56.530
and appearance as mere
deceptive appearance,

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.737
only apparently so, but not really so.

00:37:58.737 --> 00:38:02.475
To use the analogy cited by Cicero,

00:38:02.475 --> 00:38:06.211
if physical beauty is the
outward appearance of health,

00:38:06.211 --> 00:38:10.000
the fact that it may be
imitated by cosmetics

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.497
is not, it doesn't show

00:38:11.497 --> 00:38:15.410
that it must always be a mere semblance.

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:19.477
And similarly, the constancy
and order of conduct

00:38:19.477 --> 00:38:22.394
is a manifestation of inner beauty.

00:38:23.872 --> 00:38:25.874
One cannot exclude the possibility

00:38:25.874 --> 00:38:26.857
that it is mere appearance.

00:38:26.857 --> 00:38:28.566
Of course, you can pretend to be

00:38:28.566 --> 00:38:30.561
an honorable person and you're not,

00:38:30.561 --> 00:38:34.085
but it will still be what
makes the inner beauty

00:38:34.085 --> 00:38:37.335
or moral beauty recognizable by others.

00:38:38.243 --> 00:38:41.291
So I think what Panaetius has in mind

00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:42.827
is the, as it were,

00:38:42.827 --> 00:38:46.289
the outer appearance of inner beauty,

00:38:46.289 --> 00:38:48.751
and the appearance need not be

00:38:48.751 --> 00:38:50.054
a misleading appearance.

00:38:50.054 --> 00:38:53.804
So this is the point
that Hippias didn't get.

00:38:55.817 --> 00:38:58.900
So this then must be general decorum,

00:39:01.241 --> 00:39:03.841
and we are still sort of some steps away

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:06.341
from finding a special virtue.

00:39:07.577 --> 00:39:08.696
But at this point,

00:39:08.696 --> 00:39:11.529
Cicero actually comes to recognize

00:39:13.269 --> 00:39:15.941
or to admit that there are two ways

00:39:15.941 --> 00:39:17.671
of speak speaking of decorum.

00:39:17.671 --> 00:39:19.033
So now you turn to the next,

00:39:19.033 --> 00:39:22.506
to the second page of the handout.

00:39:22.506 --> 00:39:26.067
So having explained that the decorum

00:39:26.067 --> 00:39:30.060
is the outer appearance of inner beauty,

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.620
Cicero admits that this has two senses

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.048
or two descriptions, as he says in Latin.

00:39:35.048 --> 00:39:38.082
We understand a fittingness
of a general kind

00:39:38.082 --> 00:39:41.749
involved with honorable
behavior as a whole.

00:39:42.704 --> 00:39:45.372
Secondly, however, something
subordinate to this,

00:39:45.372 --> 00:39:47.113
which relates to particular parts

00:39:47.113 --> 00:39:49.358
of what is honorable.

00:39:49.358 --> 00:39:52.588
The first tends to be
defined something like this.

00:39:52.588 --> 00:39:54.466
Fitting, prepon, is what agrees

00:39:54.466 --> 00:39:56.674
with human excellence or human virtue

00:39:56.674 --> 00:39:58.548
in the respect in which human nature

00:39:58.548 --> 00:40:00.828
is different from that of other beings.

00:40:00.828 --> 00:40:04.995
So, virtue is the perfection
of a rational animal.

00:40:07.059 --> 00:40:10.448
That part, the part that is
subordinate to the genus,

00:40:10.448 --> 00:40:12.643
they define so as to say that

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:15.762
fitting is what agrees
with nature in such a way

00:40:15.762 --> 00:40:18.677
that it shows moderation and temperance,

00:40:18.677 --> 00:40:22.003
that's the usual virtue you
expected in their place,

00:40:22.003 --> 00:40:23.496
with the kind of appearance

00:40:23.496 --> 00:40:26.311
that belongs to a brave, to a free man.

00:40:26.311 --> 00:40:28.134
Actually, Atkins' translation

00:40:28.134 --> 00:40:30.539
has, "with the appearance of a gentleman,"

00:40:30.539 --> 00:40:33.853
but it's not quite that, I mean.

00:40:33.853 --> 00:40:37.306
So, well, we're still
not that much smarter.

00:40:37.306 --> 00:40:38.389
Why would you

00:40:40.143 --> 00:40:42.186
make this awkward move

00:40:42.186 --> 00:40:43.769
of using, you know,

00:40:45.029 --> 00:40:47.641
fittingness or prepon or decorum

00:40:47.641 --> 00:40:48.930
in two different senses,

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:50.564
one for virtue in general

00:40:50.564 --> 00:40:52.586
and one for a special virtue?

00:40:52.586 --> 00:40:55.601
It seems to me that what comes out,

00:40:55.601 --> 00:40:56.911
the motivation,

00:40:56.911 --> 00:41:00.326
which must have been Panaetius' motivation

00:41:00.326 --> 00:41:03.250
because Cicero wouldn't have
come up with this story,

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:05.013
comes out in a later quotation,

00:41:05.013 --> 00:41:08.256
which I've also put on the handout.

00:41:08.256 --> 00:41:11.423
Namely, this is De Officiis, 98 to 99,

00:41:13.937 --> 00:41:15.537
"For just as the eye is aroused

00:41:15.537 --> 00:41:18.882
"by the beauty of the
body and is delighted

00:41:18.882 --> 00:41:20.120
"just because all the parts

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.622
"are in graceful harmony,

00:41:21.622 --> 00:41:25.631
"so this fittingness,
shining out in one's life,

00:41:25.631 --> 00:41:28.798
"arouses the approval of one's selves,

00:41:30.374 --> 00:41:32.959
"because the order and constancy

00:41:32.959 --> 00:41:35.040
"of every word and action.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.178
"Thus, we must exercise
a kind of reverence

00:41:38.178 --> 00:41:40.519
"towards other people or men,

00:41:40.519 --> 00:41:41.764
"both towards the best of them,"

00:41:41.764 --> 00:41:43.446
that's the aristocrats,

00:41:43.446 --> 00:41:46.264
"and also towards the rest.

00:41:46.264 --> 00:41:48.602
"To neglect what others think of oneself

00:41:48.602 --> 00:41:50.750
"is a mark not only of arrogance,

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:52.830
"but also of utter laxity.

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:54.808
"There is a difference, however,

00:41:54.808 --> 00:41:57.598
"between justice, with respect to others,

00:41:57.598 --> 00:42:00.673
"and respect in considering persons.

00:42:00.673 --> 00:42:04.013
"The part of justice is not to harm a man.

00:42:04.013 --> 00:42:07.009
"That's what justice
prevents you from doing.

00:42:07.009 --> 00:42:10.092
"That of respect, not to offend him."

00:42:11.302 --> 00:42:13.701
That's, I think, the motivation.

00:42:13.701 --> 00:42:16.263
What Panaetius is including here

00:42:16.263 --> 00:42:19.042
and what is indeed an important step

00:42:19.042 --> 00:42:22.042
is the desire to be liked by others,

00:42:24.043 --> 00:42:25.845
which can also be ascribed

00:42:25.845 --> 00:42:28.648
to the perception of beauty in a person,

00:42:28.648 --> 00:42:31.145
because beauty is an attractive quality.

00:42:31.145 --> 00:42:33.402
So beauty is something that we appreciate,

00:42:33.402 --> 00:42:35.607
you know, insofar as it's beautiful,

00:42:35.607 --> 00:42:37.255
but it also pleases us.

00:42:37.255 --> 00:42:40.312
And so the beautiful,
as it were, behavior,

00:42:40.312 --> 00:42:43.008
or the beautiful actions
of a virtuous person

00:42:43.008 --> 00:42:46.925
will also, if that person
is polite and tactful

00:42:48.944 --> 00:42:51.371
and moderate and so on and so forth,

00:42:51.371 --> 00:42:55.297
will also make her liked by other people.

00:42:55.297 --> 00:42:57.416
That's indeed the virtue.

00:42:57.416 --> 00:42:59.062
It is something that the Greeks

00:42:59.062 --> 00:43:00.402
would call (speaking in foreign language).

00:43:00.402 --> 00:43:03.962
And it's funny that in his
sort of general exposition

00:43:03.962 --> 00:43:08.844
of Stoic ethics in the book,
On the Ends, De Finibus,

00:43:08.844 --> 00:43:12.298
Cicero actually mentions,
without naming Panaetius,

00:43:12.298 --> 00:43:14.386
that the older Stoics thought that,

00:43:14.386 --> 00:43:17.560
you know, good reputation
was something indifferent,

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.155
you wouldn't have to care about.

00:43:19.155 --> 00:43:21.460
But some Stoics actually said

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.406
that (speaking in foreign
language) was important, too.

00:43:23.406 --> 00:43:26.503
And I bet you that that was Panaetius.

00:43:26.503 --> 00:43:27.725
So Panaetius thinks,

00:43:27.725 --> 00:43:31.964
and I think, you know, the
argument is not a bad one,

00:43:31.964 --> 00:43:35.646
that people do want to be liked by others,

00:43:35.646 --> 00:43:37.759
and in order to be liked by others,

00:43:37.759 --> 00:43:40.067
they have to behave in
certain kinds of way,

00:43:40.067 --> 00:43:43.364
which can also be described as moderation

00:43:43.364 --> 00:43:45.496
and harmonious behavior, temperance,

00:43:45.496 --> 00:43:47.616
because you know, you
shouldn't go to excess,

00:43:47.616 --> 00:43:48.834
you shouldn't be rude,

00:43:48.834 --> 00:43:50.605
and so on and so forth.

00:43:50.605 --> 00:43:53.409
So that's the second function
of this word, decorum,

00:43:53.409 --> 00:43:54.433
and that's the one, of course,

00:43:54.433 --> 00:43:58.418
in which it has landed
in the English language.

00:43:58.418 --> 00:44:01.611
Decorum is, of course,
sometimes etiquette.

00:44:01.611 --> 00:44:04.502
Decorum is the right way
of behaving and so on.

00:44:04.502 --> 00:44:08.139
It is not used in English
any way, anywhere,

00:44:08.139 --> 00:44:10.669
as a synonym of virtue,

00:44:10.669 --> 00:44:13.777
but it is exactly what
gets described here.

00:44:13.777 --> 00:44:17.081
And again, I think I have
every reason to suspect

00:44:17.081 --> 00:44:19.729
that it got into the language from Cicero.

00:44:19.729 --> 00:44:22.019
Everybody was reading Cicero,

00:44:22.019 --> 00:44:25.810
so they learned that decorum
is important from Cicero.

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:28.811
This, of course, also
explains to a large extent

00:44:28.811 --> 00:44:31.298
why the book was used as a sort of manual

00:44:31.298 --> 00:44:33.810
for aspiring gentlemen

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:35.283
who wanted to go into politics,

00:44:35.283 --> 00:44:37.354
you know, future leaders.

00:44:37.354 --> 00:44:40.147
They had to know how to behave themselves.

00:44:40.147 --> 00:44:43.058
And actually, this chapter is much longer.

00:44:43.058 --> 00:44:44.900
The chapter on this virtue is longer

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:48.174
than the others in Cicero's exposition.

00:44:48.174 --> 00:44:49.965
That is something which may

00:44:49.965 --> 00:44:52.161
or may not be Cicero himself,

00:44:52.161 --> 00:44:53.997
because he actually

00:44:53.997 --> 00:44:57.235
obviously describes how a young man

00:44:57.235 --> 00:44:58.869
in the position of his son,

00:44:58.869 --> 00:45:01.025
an aspiring Roman aristocrat

00:45:01.025 --> 00:45:04.992
or a senator, a politician,
ought to behave.

00:45:04.992 --> 00:45:06.461
It is also, of course, too,

00:45:06.461 --> 00:45:08.840
from our point of view, in any case,

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:12.017
an extension of the field
of morality, I think,

00:45:12.017 --> 00:45:16.166
because those offenses,
not to offend people,

00:45:16.166 --> 00:45:20.083
cannot always be seen as
a moral effect or air.

00:45:21.517 --> 00:45:23.920
Sometimes it is, I think.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.125
But those things like politeness

00:45:26.125 --> 00:45:29.220
and a good or bad taste, and so on,

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.609
cannot, of course, be sort
of legally prescribed,

00:45:32.609 --> 00:45:34.598
because you can't prescribe

00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:37.547
and you can't prohibit it.

00:45:37.547 --> 00:45:39.021
But they are, of course,

00:45:39.021 --> 00:45:42.543
a very important way of
keeping society together.

00:45:42.543 --> 00:45:44.799
If we were all rude to one another,

00:45:44.799 --> 00:45:47.617
and you know, unconcerned about them,

00:45:47.617 --> 00:45:49.933
if we didn't have the tendency

00:45:49.933 --> 00:45:51.942
to want to be liked,

00:45:51.942 --> 00:45:53.722
it might be much more difficult

00:45:53.722 --> 00:45:55.827
to live with others,

00:45:55.827 --> 00:45:59.046
and so there is a point in including this,

00:45:59.046 --> 00:46:01.655
including tactfulness and a sense of humor

00:46:01.655 --> 00:46:06.385
and politeness in a book
about how to behave correctly,

00:46:06.385 --> 00:46:09.600
even though there is no moral penalty,

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.348
as it were, attached to it.

00:46:12.348 --> 00:46:14.006
And historically speaking,

00:46:14.006 --> 00:46:15.887
this is also a move that Panaetius made

00:46:15.887 --> 00:46:17.951
because the Stoics were, at that time,

00:46:17.951 --> 00:46:21.083
already sort of divided
between cynicizing Stoics

00:46:21.083 --> 00:46:23.619
who said, you know, "Who
cares about reputation?

00:46:23.619 --> 00:46:25.776
"I'm Diogenes, I'm living in a barrel,

00:46:25.776 --> 00:46:29.068
"and I won't say hello to the
emperor when he comes by,"

00:46:29.068 --> 00:46:32.074
and all kinds of other things.

00:46:32.074 --> 00:46:33.949
And Panaetius was definitely against.

00:46:33.949 --> 00:46:35.641
After all, he was, you know,

00:46:35.641 --> 00:46:37.836
an aristocrat from Rhodes.

00:46:37.836 --> 00:46:41.712
So he's on the well-mannered
side of Stoicism.

00:46:41.712 --> 00:46:44.395
On the other hand, you
know, he has a point.

00:46:44.395 --> 00:46:46.270
He doesn't just say, you know,

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:48.187
what we don't wanna be,

00:46:49.435 --> 00:46:52.155
running around without shoes,

00:46:52.155 --> 00:46:53.911
and you know,

00:46:53.911 --> 00:46:54.785
and so on,

00:46:54.785 --> 00:46:56.024
eating with our hands.

00:46:56.024 --> 00:46:58.274
All this shouldn't be done.

00:47:00.087 --> 00:47:02.074
But I don't think that
that's really important.

00:47:02.074 --> 00:47:03.624
I think it is important

00:47:03.624 --> 00:47:06.957
that he does include this kind of action

00:47:08.054 --> 00:47:10.768
in his account of virtue,

00:47:10.768 --> 00:47:13.325
and it is a sort of, you know,

00:47:13.325 --> 00:47:15.112
a limiting case.

00:47:15.112 --> 00:47:16.491
There are cases of bad taste

00:47:16.491 --> 00:47:18.296
which are really reprehensible.

00:47:18.296 --> 00:47:19.574
There are cases of bad taste

00:47:19.574 --> 00:47:20.938
such as, you know,

00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:23.591
wearing horrible dresses on the beach,

00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:24.843
which are not reprehensible.

00:47:24.843 --> 00:47:26.113
It's just sort of tasteless,

00:47:26.113 --> 00:47:27.320
and you know, so what?

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.120
(audience member chuckling)

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.537
So, but you know,

00:47:32.314 --> 00:47:34.824
so singing at a funeral is perhaps not,

00:47:34.824 --> 00:47:37.405
I mean singing pop songs at a funeral

00:47:37.405 --> 00:47:40.382
might be something that
would be reprehensible.

00:47:40.382 --> 00:47:42.095
Cicero's examples, of course,

00:47:42.095 --> 00:47:44.384
like most of these kinds of rules,

00:47:44.384 --> 00:47:45.936
etiquette and so on,

00:47:45.936 --> 00:47:47.789
they change a lot with the times.

00:47:47.789 --> 00:47:49.764
So Cicero's examples are hilarious.

00:47:49.764 --> 00:47:52.105
One of the obvious improprieties

00:47:52.105 --> 00:47:54.105
is singing in the Forum.

00:47:55.041 --> 00:47:56.641
You don't do that if you are a senator.

00:47:56.641 --> 00:47:57.474
Hmm, why?

00:47:58.786 --> 00:48:01.152
And then he also says you mustn't run.

00:48:01.152 --> 00:48:03.134
If you're a senator, you walk.

00:48:03.134 --> 00:48:05.169
You need to go slowly.

00:48:05.169 --> 00:48:08.532
So I mean, the book is
also amusing sometimes

00:48:08.532 --> 00:48:10.227
because it shows you something about

00:48:10.227 --> 00:48:12.189
how they thought one ought to behave.

00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:13.926
I guess that, you know, in 100 years,

00:48:13.926 --> 00:48:16.090
people will say similar things about us,

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:19.486
so we shouldn't take
this as being a mistake.

00:48:19.486 --> 00:48:21.945
So, well, but what I wanted to show was

00:48:21.945 --> 00:48:24.695
that this introduction of beauty,

00:48:25.617 --> 00:48:27.700
both as a general quality

00:48:29.158 --> 00:48:30.075
that shows,

00:48:30.955 --> 00:48:33.597
I mean, as a sign of inner beauty

00:48:33.597 --> 00:48:35.186
and a sign of virtue,

00:48:35.186 --> 00:48:37.917
and as the specific virtue of, as it were,

00:48:37.917 --> 00:48:39.986
good taste and good manners,

00:48:39.986 --> 00:48:42.299
makes sense and is recognized

00:48:42.299 --> 00:48:44.044
as being a double function.

00:48:44.044 --> 00:48:47.248
Whether the one comes before
the other, I can't tell.

00:48:47.248 --> 00:48:48.919
But the first seems to me

00:48:48.919 --> 00:48:52.215
to have mainly an
epistemological function.

00:48:52.215 --> 00:48:54.712
How do we come to think
a virtue is worth having?

00:48:54.712 --> 00:48:56.044
Why do we want virtue?

00:48:56.044 --> 00:48:57.306
Well, you know,

00:48:57.306 --> 00:48:59.175
we don't have to understand anything

00:48:59.175 --> 00:49:01.568
of the underlying Stoic theory,

00:49:01.568 --> 00:49:03.857
which is much too hard,

00:49:03.857 --> 00:49:07.681
or at least, Panaetius may have thought,

00:49:07.681 --> 00:49:10.014
for newcomers to philosophy.

00:49:12.123 --> 00:49:15.611
But we can recognize
virtue as something good

00:49:15.611 --> 00:49:17.449
when we admire under other people

00:49:17.449 --> 00:49:20.520
because of their beautiful behavior.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.524
And this is exactly
what Seneca puts forward

00:49:23.524 --> 00:49:25.637
when he talks about how we acquire

00:49:25.637 --> 00:49:27.906
what he says is our first,

00:49:27.906 --> 00:49:29.357
it's important, I think,

00:49:29.357 --> 00:49:31.063
to emphasize the first here,

00:49:31.063 --> 00:49:33.586
our first notion of what is good.

00:49:33.586 --> 00:49:37.890
We derive that notion from
observing the behavior

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:39.524
of people we admire,

00:49:39.524 --> 00:49:42.483
and then that behavior is, as it were,

00:49:42.483 --> 00:49:45.277
characterized by the kind of integrity

00:49:45.277 --> 00:49:47.543
that makes a behavior harmonious,

00:49:47.543 --> 00:49:48.894
because there are, as it were,

00:49:48.894 --> 00:49:50.858
no conflicts between words and actions,

00:49:50.858 --> 00:49:52.840
and so on and so forth.

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.453
So that's, to some extent,

00:49:54.453 --> 00:49:55.903
an epistemological function,

00:49:55.903 --> 00:49:58.180
but then there's also the practical side,

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.673
which is that in order
to have that virtue,

00:50:01.673 --> 00:50:03.019
you have to behave in a way

00:50:03.019 --> 00:50:06.528
that makes you liked by other people.

00:50:06.528 --> 00:50:09.692
And you know, it seemed in both cases

00:50:09.692 --> 00:50:11.964
that it made sense to appeal to beauty,

00:50:11.964 --> 00:50:15.283
because beauty is not
only admirable, kalon,

00:50:15.283 --> 00:50:16.298
in that sense,

00:50:16.298 --> 00:50:18.120
but it's also pleasant.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.480
And so in order to be, as it were,

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.416
a pleasant person to be with,

00:50:22.416 --> 00:50:25.967
then this is how you should behave,

00:50:25.967 --> 00:50:27.467
or so Cicero says.

00:50:29.079 --> 00:50:30.800
I can be brief about the second book,

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.221
which is about the expedience.

00:50:32.221 --> 00:50:33.735
Though I should emphasize, of course,

00:50:33.735 --> 00:50:36.419
that this, namely, caring for oneself,

00:50:36.419 --> 00:50:39.320
or what Cicero describes
as the comforts of life,

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.786
which include things
like health and wealth

00:50:41.786 --> 00:50:43.869
and good birth and so on,

00:50:45.438 --> 00:50:48.688
is treated separately from the virtues.

00:50:49.584 --> 00:50:50.549
So in the second book,

00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:52.532
he talks about how,

00:50:52.532 --> 00:50:54.205
he mentions these things,

00:50:54.205 --> 00:50:56.204
and then he says, "Well, but you know,"

00:50:56.204 --> 00:50:57.933
and this must be following Panaetius

00:50:57.933 --> 00:50:59.718
because he does refer to him,

00:50:59.718 --> 00:51:01.696
"I'm only going to talk about the thing

00:51:01.696 --> 00:51:02.940
"that is most important

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.106
"if you want to lead a good life.

00:51:05.106 --> 00:51:06.635
"The most important thing

00:51:06.635 --> 00:51:08.096
"that's expedient to you

00:51:08.096 --> 00:51:10.764
"is having friends and supporters."

00:51:10.764 --> 00:51:12.396
So what he talks about in that book

00:51:12.396 --> 00:51:14.079
is how to win the hearts and minds,

00:51:14.079 --> 00:51:15.238
as the Americans say,

00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:17.849
of your fellow citizens

00:51:17.849 --> 00:51:20.492
in order to get them to support you.

00:51:20.492 --> 00:51:23.150
Again, of course, this is a great chapter

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:25.870
for a book that is given to future leaders

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:30.592
as a manual of how to become
a successful gentleman.

00:51:30.592 --> 00:51:32.175
But what is problematic

00:51:32.175 --> 00:51:34.105
from the point of view of Stoicism

00:51:34.105 --> 00:51:39.054
is indeed the fact that
Panaetius treats morality,

00:51:39.054 --> 00:51:40.140
as it were,

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:42.390
and it's now become called,

00:51:43.692 --> 00:51:46.763
prudential behavior,
self-serving, self-interest,

00:51:46.763 --> 00:51:51.129
which of course is legitimate
in many cases, separately.

00:51:51.129 --> 00:51:52.627
Because the Stoics held,

00:51:52.627 --> 00:51:54.908
at least the orthodox Stoics,

00:51:54.908 --> 00:51:56.760
tended hold the view

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.330
that the good or the useful

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:02.182
cannot be separated from the virtuous.

00:52:02.182 --> 00:52:06.122
So whatever is honorable
has to be expedient,

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:09.872
and whatever is expedient
has to be virtuous.

00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:13.796
Now, the problem with
that, it seems to me,

00:52:13.796 --> 00:52:15.577
and here, I am inclined to think

00:52:15.577 --> 00:52:17.478
that it wasn't just that Panaetius

00:52:17.478 --> 00:52:20.526
was using the language of the people,

00:52:20.526 --> 00:52:24.294
because as much as
Socrates may have sort of

00:52:24.294 --> 00:52:28.847
railed against separating
the useful from morality,

00:52:28.847 --> 00:52:30.692
there's an underlying error, I think.

00:52:30.692 --> 00:52:33.020
If you strengthen it to the extent

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:36.007
that you say that every
appropriate action,

00:52:36.007 --> 00:52:39.651
which is, as it were,
not unjust, not immoral,

00:52:39.651 --> 00:52:40.995
but it's just useful,

00:52:40.995 --> 00:52:42.994
and not therefore, morally admirable,

00:52:42.994 --> 00:52:45.296
has to be admirable as well.

00:52:45.296 --> 00:52:47.000
So Plutarch, for example,

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.553
tells us that people would make fun

00:52:48.553 --> 00:52:51.550
of the Stoics who pretended that

00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:53.600
when the wise man, the Stoic sage,

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.931
the ideal perfect person,

00:52:55.931 --> 00:52:57.564
blows his nose,

00:52:57.564 --> 00:53:00.671
he is performing a virtuous
act that is admirable,

00:53:00.671 --> 00:53:03.399
because he's doing what appropriate.

00:53:03.399 --> 00:53:04.798
So, you know,

00:53:04.798 --> 00:53:06.510
I think I can understand

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:09.061
that Panaetius can get rid of this

00:53:09.061 --> 00:53:10.608
because he doesn't need

00:53:10.608 --> 00:53:12.095
a thesis that is so strong.

00:53:12.095 --> 00:53:14.143
It is perfectly sufficient to say

00:53:14.143 --> 00:53:17.323
that, as it were, morality
always comes first.

00:53:17.323 --> 00:53:19.604
That is to say it cannot be the case

00:53:19.604 --> 00:53:22.871
that an action that is immoral,

00:53:22.871 --> 00:53:25.497
the contrary of morally correct,

00:53:25.497 --> 00:53:26.783
cannot be useful.

00:53:26.783 --> 00:53:29.070
That you can maintain,
and following Socrates,

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:30.571
he would have maintained.

00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:32.239
But he doesn't have to maintain

00:53:32.239 --> 00:53:35.970
that any action that is
permissible, as it were,

00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:39.627
so, not immoral, but also
not morally admirable,

00:53:39.627 --> 00:53:43.356
but useful, also has to
be morally admirable.

00:53:43.356 --> 00:53:45.743
So it seems to me that the
Stoics were going too far,

00:53:45.743 --> 00:53:46.840
and I'm inclined to think

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.661
that Panaetius was sort
of silently stopping this

00:53:50.661 --> 00:53:53.085
without thereby, as it were,

00:53:53.085 --> 00:53:55.418
abandoning his Stoic school,

00:53:57.717 --> 00:54:00.192
because this thesis
actually was too strong,

00:54:00.192 --> 00:54:04.031
and it led to things like, also, okay,

00:54:04.031 --> 00:54:06.558
when the wise man eats his breakfast,

00:54:06.558 --> 00:54:09.733
he's already engaging in
virtuous activity. (mumbles)

00:54:09.733 --> 00:54:12.903
Well, even Chrysippus
is said to have admitted

00:54:12.903 --> 00:54:15.643
that no, this isn't much to admire

00:54:15.643 --> 00:54:18.264
in a man who, as it were,

00:54:18.264 --> 00:54:20.333
temperately abstained from a woman

00:54:20.333 --> 00:54:21.311
with one foot in the grave.

00:54:21.311 --> 00:54:24.561
This, of course, is Plutarch's example.

00:54:26.849 --> 00:54:29.099
So one might say, you know,

00:54:30.126 --> 00:54:32.406
that even though it is true

00:54:32.406 --> 00:54:33.588
that the separation,

00:54:33.588 --> 00:54:36.338
the separate treatment of utility

00:54:37.508 --> 00:54:40.827
and the four virtues
in two different books,

00:54:40.827 --> 00:54:43.233
might occur and evidently did

00:54:43.233 --> 00:54:45.567
because Cicero mentions it,

00:54:45.567 --> 00:54:47.817
protests from other Stoics,

00:54:48.815 --> 00:54:52.023
Panaetius probably had
a point and didn't care.

00:54:52.023 --> 00:54:54.940
And so the distinction has survived

00:54:56.158 --> 00:54:58.201
because it is indeed quite helpful,

00:54:58.201 --> 00:55:00.648
and of course, there
seem to be many things

00:55:00.648 --> 00:55:03.596
like yes, indeed, eating a healthy diet

00:55:03.596 --> 00:55:05.758
and being cleanly and
so on and other things

00:55:05.758 --> 00:55:09.162
that other Stoics were
not so much talking about,

00:55:09.162 --> 00:55:11.499
future leaders will mention

00:55:11.499 --> 00:55:12.453
are quite useful,

00:55:12.453 --> 00:55:14.463
but there's nothing very admirable

00:55:14.463 --> 00:55:17.159
in brushing your teeth in the morning.

00:55:17.159 --> 00:55:18.529
So, (chuckles)

00:55:18.529 --> 00:55:20.072
one can see that it's a good idea,

00:55:20.072 --> 00:55:21.913
it's appropriate,

00:55:21.913 --> 00:55:26.485
but one doesn't have to find
it admirable in addition.

00:55:26.485 --> 00:55:28.827
So to that extent then,

00:55:28.827 --> 00:55:33.019
it seems to me that the
separation of those two topics,

00:55:33.019 --> 00:55:34.967
apart from being the popular move,

00:55:34.967 --> 00:55:36.262
is probably quite correct

00:55:36.262 --> 00:55:39.114
even within the limits of Stoicism.

00:55:39.114 --> 00:55:41.380
And secondly, throughout the second book,

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.898
after every recommendation

00:55:42.898 --> 00:55:44.273
about winning the hearts and minds

00:55:44.273 --> 00:55:45.106
and so on and so forth,

00:55:45.106 --> 00:55:48.410
and you know, don't be
oppressive and so on,

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:51.520
there's always, almost like a refrain,

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.555
there is always the refrain of do all this

00:55:54.555 --> 00:55:57.507
within the limits of justice.

00:55:57.507 --> 00:55:59.604
So in this particular book, justice,

00:55:59.604 --> 00:56:02.509
and that is often a synonym of morality,

00:56:02.509 --> 00:56:05.040
becomes, as it were, a restraint

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:07.757
on one's self-interest.

00:56:07.757 --> 00:56:08.976
You can follow yourself,

00:56:08.976 --> 00:56:11.230
and just provided that
it doesn't interfere

00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:12.291
with the right of others,

00:56:12.291 --> 00:56:14.120
provided you keep yourself

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:17.265
within the limits of justice.

00:56:17.265 --> 00:56:20.367
So that's quite clearly admitted,

00:56:20.367 --> 00:56:22.201
and so he would therefore,

00:56:22.201 --> 00:56:24.723
one can assume that Panaetius would say,

00:56:24.723 --> 00:56:27.764
"No immoral action can be useful,"

00:56:27.764 --> 00:56:29.233
because he has, you know,

00:56:29.233 --> 00:56:31.620
included, and also,

00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:34.489
when Cicero sort of mentions the topics,

00:56:34.489 --> 00:56:36.634
first, you deliberate
about whether something

00:56:36.634 --> 00:56:40.585
is morally good or morally
bad or permissible,

00:56:40.585 --> 00:56:44.291
and then you deliberate about
whether it's useful or not.

00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:45.744
So by the time you come,

00:56:45.744 --> 00:56:48.314
as it were, to the second consideration,

00:56:48.314 --> 00:56:51.062
things that might be useful but immoral

00:56:51.062 --> 00:56:54.246
have already, as it were, been eliminated,

00:56:54.246 --> 00:56:58.413
because they just can't be
done when they're immoral.

00:56:59.534 --> 00:57:00.875
So far then, it seems to me

00:57:00.875 --> 00:57:02.584
that we have reason to think

00:57:02.584 --> 00:57:06.628
that Panaetius was not
an orthodox as a Stoic,

00:57:06.628 --> 00:57:09.992
although he introduced some novelties.

00:57:09.992 --> 00:57:13.297
But of course, we also
have to remind ourselves

00:57:13.297 --> 00:57:17.047
that this isn't all
there is to Stoic ethics.

00:57:20.225 --> 00:57:21.503
On the cognitive side,

00:57:21.503 --> 00:57:24.643
Seneca explicitly introduces his letter

00:57:24.643 --> 00:57:27.531
about how we come by our
first notion of the good

00:57:27.531 --> 00:57:29.966
by insisting that it's a first notion.

00:57:29.966 --> 00:57:32.169
So outer beauty, as it were,

00:57:32.169 --> 00:57:34.815
serves to introduce people to beauty.

00:57:34.815 --> 00:57:38.815
What it doesn't is explain
what inner beauty is.

00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:43.839
So in order to understand
the Stoic doctrine,

00:57:43.839 --> 00:57:45.546
as it were, in depth,

00:57:45.546 --> 00:57:47.838
one would have to go beyond this,

00:57:47.838 --> 00:57:49.628
and I think this comes out,

00:57:49.628 --> 00:57:51.919
this is, I think, the
intention of this book.

00:57:51.919 --> 00:57:53.772
It is not meant to be,

00:57:53.772 --> 00:57:56.576
and the title shows that
it's not meant to be,

00:57:56.576 --> 00:57:58.941
a complete account of Stoic ethics,

00:57:58.941 --> 00:58:01.973
but I think it becomes
clear in a late passage,

00:58:01.973 --> 00:58:03.294
which is rarely quoted,

00:58:03.294 --> 00:58:08.131
and that's then at the end
of page two on your handout.

00:58:08.131 --> 00:58:11.506
Cicero has a passage which I believe

00:58:11.506 --> 00:58:13.359
must be taken from Panaetius.

00:58:13.359 --> 00:58:15.727
It is in the introduction
to the third book,

00:58:15.727 --> 00:58:17.039
which Cicero wrote on his own,

00:58:17.039 --> 00:58:20.122
because Panaetius never did write it.

00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:22.819
But no matter where it belongs,

00:58:22.819 --> 00:58:24.477
it would've, I think,

00:58:24.477 --> 00:58:27.973
it could very well have come
from Panaetius' introduction.

00:58:27.973 --> 00:58:29.900
So what Cicero says is this,

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:31.449
and I'm just reading it out now.

00:58:31.449 --> 00:58:33.691
"The duties that I discuss in these books

00:58:33.691 --> 00:58:36.165
"are then those that
the Stoics call middle.

00:58:36.165 --> 00:58:39.118
"And by middle, they
mean that they're shared

00:58:39.118 --> 00:58:41.076
"and widely accessible.

00:58:41.076 --> 00:58:42.615
"Many achieve them by the goodness

00:58:42.615 --> 00:58:44.336
"of their intellectual talent

00:58:44.336 --> 00:58:46.638
"and by their progress in learning.

00:58:46.638 --> 00:58:49.261
"The duty that the same men call right

00:58:49.261 --> 00:58:51.831
"or the appropriate action
that they call right,"

00:58:51.831 --> 00:58:53.745
the Greek is (speaking
in foreign language),

00:58:53.745 --> 00:58:55.451
"is complete and absolute,

00:58:55.451 --> 00:58:57.180
"and as they say,

00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:59.136
"fulfills all the numbers,

00:58:59.136 --> 00:59:03.378
"and it cannot belong to
anyone except the wise man."

00:59:03.378 --> 00:59:05.301
Now, the wise man suddenly shows up.

00:59:05.301 --> 00:59:07.656
He's the perfect person.

00:59:07.656 --> 00:59:10.573
And real virtue, it also turns out,

00:59:11.923 --> 00:59:13.994
belongs only to the wise man.

00:59:13.994 --> 00:59:15.882
So we're looking at the usual,

00:59:15.882 --> 00:59:19.041
slightly paradoxical,
and slightly provocative

00:59:19.041 --> 00:59:21.734
formulation of Stoic ethics.

00:59:21.734 --> 00:59:23.625
"However," then he goes on,

00:59:23.625 --> 00:59:24.806
"when some action is performed

00:59:24.806 --> 00:59:26.832
"where middle duties are in evidence,

00:59:26.832 --> 00:59:29.719
"it is seen as being abundantly perfect.

00:59:29.719 --> 00:59:32.146
"That is because ordinary people

00:59:32.146 --> 00:59:34.299
"cannot really understand

00:59:34.299 --> 00:59:36.486
"how it falls short of being perfect,

00:59:36.486 --> 00:59:38.656
"insofar as they do understand it,

00:59:38.656 --> 00:59:41.484
"they think that nothing
has been overlooked.

00:59:41.484 --> 00:59:44.758
"The same thing tends to
happen with poems, pictures,"

00:59:44.758 --> 00:59:46.355
so we're back in aesthetics,

00:59:46.355 --> 00:59:47.414
"and many other things,

00:59:47.414 --> 00:59:50.340
"by which inexperienced
people are delighted,

00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:55.035
"praising them when they
should not be praised.

00:59:55.035 --> 00:59:56.155
"The reason, I believe,

00:59:56.155 --> 00:59:58.212
"is that there some worth in them

00:59:58.212 --> 01:00:00.104
"that attracts the ignorant,

01:00:00.104 --> 01:00:01.579
"but they're unable to judge

01:00:01.579 --> 01:00:03.346
"what faults each may have.

01:00:03.346 --> 01:00:06.226
"Therefore," and now, I think
that's an important point

01:00:06.226 --> 01:00:08.517
about what the book's trying to do,

01:00:08.517 --> 01:00:11.698
"when they are taught
by experienced people,

01:00:11.698 --> 01:00:14.588
"they readily abandon their view."

01:00:14.588 --> 01:00:16.720
So he compares his treatment

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.475
of the Stoic kathekonta,
appropriate action,

01:00:20.475 --> 01:00:24.842
as opposed to right and
morally praiseworthy action,

01:00:24.842 --> 01:00:27.509
with showing, introducing people

01:00:29.815 --> 01:00:31.482
to the study of art,

01:00:32.411 --> 01:00:35.253
teaching them to appreciate pictures.

01:00:35.253 --> 01:00:38.015
Bu then, of course, when
they are inexperienced,

01:00:38.015 --> 01:00:40.446
they will perhaps think
that there's no difference

01:00:40.446 --> 01:00:42.867
between say, a very good color print

01:00:42.867 --> 01:00:45.064
and the original of a painting,

01:00:45.064 --> 01:00:47.314
or they will like pictures,

01:00:48.543 --> 01:00:50.986
the sort of supercilious art

01:00:50.986 --> 01:00:53.372
critics would say are not the best

01:00:53.372 --> 01:00:55.724
that this painter has
produced, or whatever,

01:00:55.724 --> 01:00:58.470
or they'll see, oh, the
color isn't quite right.

01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:59.553
So, you know,

01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:04.505
innocent and novices
will go into the gallery

01:01:04.505 --> 01:01:05.411
or in the museum

01:01:05.411 --> 01:01:09.164
and find everything equally
beautiful, and so on.

01:01:09.164 --> 01:01:10.747
And then, you know,

01:01:12.041 --> 01:01:15.328
if, however, they then take a course

01:01:15.328 --> 01:01:17.945
in art history and aesthetics,

01:01:17.945 --> 01:01:19.695
they may learn to see

01:01:20.824 --> 01:01:23.081
that actually, some of these pictures

01:01:23.081 --> 01:01:24.262
are better than others,

01:01:24.262 --> 01:01:26.807
and some have absolute flaws

01:01:26.807 --> 01:01:28.858
that they didn't see in the first place.

01:01:28.858 --> 01:01:31.687
Seneca has a different way
of explaining what happens.

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:36.095
He also realizes that beauty
isn't all there is to it.

01:01:36.095 --> 01:01:37.548
So then he says,

01:01:37.548 --> 01:01:39.953
and this is also on the handout, (mumbles)

01:01:39.953 --> 01:01:44.220
"But by nature tend to
exaggerate what we like."

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:46.470
So he first explains the analogy

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:49.220
in outer beauty and inner beauty.

01:01:50.398 --> 01:01:52.362
"And then underneath, however,

01:01:52.362 --> 01:01:53.672
"there were many faults hidden

01:01:53.672 --> 01:01:56.009
"by the appearance and the brilliancy

01:01:56.009 --> 01:01:58.445
"of certain conspicuous acts.

01:01:58.445 --> 01:02:00.373
"To these, we shut our eyes.

01:02:00.373 --> 01:02:03.114
"Nature bid us amplify
praiseworthy things.

01:02:03.114 --> 01:02:06.796
"Everyone exalts renown beyond the truth,

01:02:06.796 --> 01:02:07.796
"and from such deeds,

01:02:07.796 --> 01:02:10.491
"we deduce the conception
of a grand good."

01:02:10.491 --> 01:02:12.605
So the problem with which Seneca

01:02:12.605 --> 01:02:15.234
sort of makes obvious here

01:02:15.234 --> 01:02:19.532
is that you can say that
people are introduced

01:02:19.532 --> 01:02:21.747
to virtue by observing beauty,

01:02:21.747 --> 01:02:23.698
but the Stoics also say

01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:26.234
that there are no perfect people.

01:02:26.234 --> 01:02:27.782
There are no Stoic sages.

01:02:27.782 --> 01:02:30.674
Maybe Socrates was one they
sometimes grudgingly admit,

01:02:30.674 --> 01:02:33.192
but they would certainly
never have claimed to be one.

01:02:33.192 --> 01:02:34.132
It's an ideal.

01:02:34.132 --> 01:02:36.242
You know, it's the perfect human being,

01:02:36.242 --> 01:02:38.499
and although we should all, as it were,

01:02:38.499 --> 01:02:41.203
see the ideal as something to strive for,

01:02:41.203 --> 01:02:44.107
it is perfectly clear
that we won't get there.

01:02:44.107 --> 01:02:46.319
So how do we actually
arrive of our notion,

01:02:46.319 --> 01:02:49.505
given that there are no
actual examples of perfection

01:02:49.505 --> 01:02:51.918
that we can look at

01:02:51.918 --> 01:02:53.674
and see their inner beauty, as it were,

01:02:53.674 --> 01:02:54.559
reflected in their actions?

01:02:54.559 --> 01:02:57.995
Well, it is because we act
like the novices in art,

01:02:57.995 --> 01:03:00.412
you know, we don't see the flaws,

01:03:00.412 --> 01:03:02.033
and we form an idea,

01:03:02.033 --> 01:03:03.283
either, sort of

01:03:05.141 --> 01:03:06.391
as Seneca says,

01:03:07.912 --> 01:03:08.912
by exalting,

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.780
seeing something as
perfect that isn't perfect,

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:15.572
or as Panaetius puts it,

01:03:15.572 --> 01:03:17.905
by admiring something which,

01:03:19.231 --> 01:03:22.148
if we took some philosophy courses,

01:03:23.229 --> 01:03:26.566
we might come to see as
not being quite worthwhile.

01:03:26.566 --> 01:03:27.822
So I think what he is saying

01:03:27.822 --> 01:03:31.090
is this is an introduction
to Stoic philosophy.

01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:35.795
What you are being told
is, I think, quite Stoic,

01:03:35.795 --> 01:03:38.268
but it doesn't, as it were,

01:03:38.268 --> 01:03:39.511
lead all the way to the end.

01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:42.592
So that's why at the end of this,

01:03:42.592 --> 01:03:45.159
I put the passage from Seneca in which,

01:03:45.159 --> 01:03:47.417
since the letters to Lucilius

01:03:47.417 --> 01:03:49.284
are a course in philosophy

01:03:49.284 --> 01:03:53.284
that leads you to recognize
the real Stoic good.

01:03:55.043 --> 01:03:57.314
"Therefore nature, as
we should mention here,

01:03:57.314 --> 01:03:59.027
"tree, animal, and god,

01:03:59.027 --> 01:04:01.169
"the last two having reasoning power

01:04:01.169 --> 01:04:03.049
"are of the same nature,

01:04:03.049 --> 01:04:05.988
"distinct only by virtue of
the immortality of the one

01:04:05.988 --> 01:04:08.073
"and the mortality of the other.

01:04:08.073 --> 01:04:10.152
"Of one of these, namely god,

01:04:10.152 --> 01:04:12.405
"it is nature that perfects the good.

01:04:12.405 --> 01:04:14.431
"Of the other, pains and study."

01:04:14.431 --> 01:04:16.071
So we have to acquire perfection

01:04:16.071 --> 01:04:17.774
through our own efforts.

01:04:17.774 --> 01:04:19.859
Gods are perfect by themselves.

01:04:19.859 --> 01:04:21.169
"All other things are perfect

01:04:21.169 --> 01:04:22.683
"only their particular nature,

01:04:22.683 --> 01:04:26.160
"not truly perfect since they lack reason.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.964
"Indeed, to sum up, that alone is perfect,

01:04:28.964 --> 01:04:33.235
"which is perfect according
to nature as a whole.

01:04:33.235 --> 01:04:36.588
"And nature, as a whole,
is possessed by reason."

01:04:36.588 --> 01:04:39.406
That is to say you have to take

01:04:39.406 --> 01:04:41.334
a philosophy course with a Stoic

01:04:41.334 --> 01:04:44.421
that leads you to the argument from design

01:04:44.421 --> 01:04:46.338
to the recognition that the universe

01:04:46.338 --> 01:04:49.435
is ruled by a divine reason,

01:04:49.435 --> 01:04:51.352
and that's the best order in the world,

01:04:51.352 --> 01:04:53.866
and that you then have the
desire to conform to it

01:04:53.866 --> 01:04:55.760
because you, yourself, are rational,

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.285
and you want to do what
God wants you to do.

01:04:58.285 --> 01:04:59.809
And then, as it were,

01:04:59.809 --> 01:05:02.197
you figure out that
what God wants you to do

01:05:02.197 --> 01:05:05.618
is follow the instinct He has given out.

01:05:05.618 --> 01:05:07.641
This is how one arrives
within the framework

01:05:07.641 --> 01:05:09.330
of general Stoicism,

01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:11.545
at the theory of appropriate action.

01:05:11.545 --> 01:05:13.855
We are doing things that are appropriate

01:05:13.855 --> 01:05:15.737
that our nature makes us inclined to do

01:05:15.737 --> 01:05:17.786
because we realize that

01:05:17.786 --> 01:05:20.831
the divine reason has
given us these tendencies

01:05:20.831 --> 01:05:24.664
in order to lead us to
virtue and a good life.

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:29.342
So this is missing from Panaetius' book,

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:31.655
and that's why I think
it actually is intended,

01:05:31.655 --> 01:05:34.008
as it were, A, as an exposition

01:05:34.008 --> 01:05:36.752
which will be read by educated people

01:05:36.752 --> 01:05:38.946
who are not specialists in philosophy

01:05:38.946 --> 01:05:42.044
and who don't like the Stoic terminology,

01:05:42.044 --> 01:05:44.355
this includes many people,

01:05:44.355 --> 01:05:47.123
but B, it is also meant as an introduction

01:05:47.123 --> 01:05:48.370
in the sense that yes,

01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:49.812
if you are really interested,

01:05:49.812 --> 01:05:51.706
you have to go on further,

01:05:51.706 --> 01:05:52.925
'til you come to the point

01:05:52.925 --> 01:05:55.289
where you see that it's all
the divine order and so on,

01:05:55.289 --> 01:05:56.678
and that the reason why

01:05:56.678 --> 01:05:58.365
acting in this way is appropriate

01:05:58.365 --> 01:06:01.835
is because nature wants you to do so.

01:06:01.835 --> 01:06:06.259
So let me just come to a quick
conclusion about the book.

01:06:06.259 --> 01:06:08.467
I've talked about Panaetius all the time

01:06:08.467 --> 01:06:09.815
and why it makes sense

01:06:09.815 --> 01:06:12.788
to introduce such a thing as the decorum.

01:06:12.788 --> 01:06:15.618
It's both, as it were,
epistemologically important,

01:06:15.618 --> 01:06:19.680
and it is also something
that he can describe as

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:22.375
what makes us be liked by others,

01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:26.793
so by introducing the
large fields of etiquette,

01:06:26.793 --> 01:06:29.069
politeness, and so on,

01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:30.491
which, as I said,

01:06:30.491 --> 01:06:33.207
made it such a good manual for young men.

01:06:33.207 --> 01:06:35.877
But now imagine an 18th century reader.

01:06:35.877 --> 01:06:38.509
Now these 18th century readers, of course,

01:06:38.509 --> 01:06:40.362
weren't Stoics, right?

01:06:40.362 --> 01:06:43.654
But they all read Cicero's
De Officiis in school

01:06:43.654 --> 01:06:46.166
or, at the latest, in college.

01:06:46.166 --> 01:06:48.812
And they might very well, I think,

01:06:48.812 --> 01:06:50.363
have gotten the idea

01:06:50.363 --> 01:06:52.979
that that was all there was to it,

01:06:52.979 --> 01:06:55.229
because, and that, I think,

01:06:56.671 --> 01:07:00.254
is one part of the
importance of Panaetius.

01:07:02.565 --> 01:07:04.258
They didn't hold, of course,

01:07:04.258 --> 01:07:05.732
the most famous Stoic thesis,

01:07:05.732 --> 01:07:07.196
that virtue is the only good.

01:07:07.196 --> 01:07:08.634
There are lots of English authors

01:07:08.634 --> 01:07:10.705
who made fun of the
Stoics for that reason.

01:07:10.705 --> 01:07:12.511
Nor did they expect a moral theory

01:07:12.511 --> 01:07:15.071
to have the form of an ancient theory,

01:07:15.071 --> 01:07:16.956
at least since Aristotle was starting

01:07:16.956 --> 01:07:19.831
from a determination of the highest good,

01:07:19.831 --> 01:07:22.621
and then teaching us how to achieve that,

01:07:22.621 --> 01:07:24.476
the best life.

01:07:24.476 --> 01:07:26.806
So these, we just might
not miss an account

01:07:26.806 --> 01:07:28.830
of happiness, of the highest good,

01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:32.913
or expect it in a book of
practical moral advice.

01:07:35.312 --> 01:07:38.617
The famous claim that
virtue is the only good,

01:07:38.617 --> 01:07:41.080
and therefore, also
enough to make us happy,

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.715
plays no role in the De Officiis.

01:07:43.715 --> 01:07:45.213
And I think it is significant

01:07:45.213 --> 01:07:47.955
that Cicero defends Panaetius of autocracy

01:07:47.955 --> 01:07:49.932
as a Stoic against other Stoics

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:53.296
who maintain that conflicts
between virtue and utility

01:07:53.296 --> 01:07:54.629
could not arise,

01:07:55.831 --> 01:07:57.664
by arguing repeatedly,

01:07:59.145 --> 01:08:01.266
asserting that Panaetius did have

01:08:01.266 --> 01:08:02.820
all those fundamental pieces

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:05.899
and that the conflicts
were merely apparent.

01:08:05.899 --> 01:08:07.968
But later readers of the De Officiis

01:08:07.968 --> 01:08:10.802
could well come away with the, after all,

01:08:10.802 --> 01:08:12.714
perfectly plausible view,

01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:14.250
that self love and benevolence

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:16.664
are equally natural for humans,

01:08:16.664 --> 01:08:18.395
and that the comforts of life

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:20.213
described in the second book,

01:08:20.213 --> 01:08:21.676
including the support of friends

01:08:21.676 --> 01:08:23.637
and other followers,

01:08:23.637 --> 01:08:25.867
such as health, wealth, and beauty,

01:08:25.867 --> 01:08:27.185
and of course, friends,

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:29.544
would be quite relevant
to human happiness.

01:08:29.544 --> 01:08:31.784
Of course, the real
Stoics wanted to maintain

01:08:31.784 --> 01:08:33.581
that these things were totally indifferent

01:08:33.581 --> 01:08:37.075
in the sense that they
didn't affect our happiness

01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:40.992
because the only thing
that counted was virtue.

01:08:42.448 --> 01:08:44.493
What Panaetius treated in this book was,

01:08:44.493 --> 01:08:45.874
as the title indicates,

01:08:45.874 --> 01:08:48.664
only a part of Stoic ethics,

01:08:48.664 --> 01:08:51.528
intended as an introduction
for educated gentlemen,

01:08:51.528 --> 01:08:53.383
that might perhaps inspire some of them

01:08:53.383 --> 01:08:56.834
to go on to study with the expert.

01:08:56.834 --> 01:08:59.843
But in order to argue
for the Stoic conception

01:08:59.843 --> 01:09:01.198
of the highest good,

01:09:01.198 --> 01:09:04.319
seeing rational humans
as members of a community

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:06.026
that also included the gods,

01:09:06.026 --> 01:09:08.910
as in the passage I
just quoted from Seneca,

01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:11.055
a lot more would have been needed,

01:09:11.055 --> 01:09:13.521
including the distinctions
between real goods

01:09:13.521 --> 01:09:15.385
and evils and the so called preferred

01:09:15.385 --> 01:09:17.254
and dispreferred indifferents,

01:09:17.254 --> 01:09:19.171
and so on and so forth.

01:09:23.435 --> 01:09:24.268
So,

01:09:25.505 --> 01:09:27.838
this has actually gone away.

01:09:31.797 --> 01:09:33.505
And as far as I can see,

01:09:33.505 --> 01:09:36.487
I'm now skipping a discussion of people's,

01:09:36.487 --> 01:09:37.468
I mean, there are, of course,

01:09:37.468 --> 01:09:39.711
different interpretations of this move.

01:09:39.711 --> 01:09:41.876
The conviction that agreement
with universal nature

01:09:41.876 --> 01:09:43.911
is the only real good

01:09:43.911 --> 01:09:46.721
can only be motivated by a Stoic theology.

01:09:46.721 --> 01:09:48.668
So you have to delve into metaphysics

01:09:48.668 --> 01:09:50.765
to arrive at the view that Cicero just,

01:09:50.765 --> 01:09:51.934
that Seneca describes

01:09:51.934 --> 01:09:53.646
because he has arrived, as it were,

01:09:53.646 --> 01:09:55.707
at the end of a philosophy course,

01:09:55.707 --> 01:09:59.620
and Panaetius is just
recommending going to one.

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:01.644
So a gentleman of the 18th century

01:10:01.644 --> 01:10:04.166
would think that he
finds everything you need

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:06.531
in the theory that he's
offered in De Officiis.

01:10:06.531 --> 01:10:08.365
People are attracted to virtue

01:10:08.365 --> 01:10:10.131
because they have a moral sense,

01:10:10.131 --> 01:10:11.117
and moral sense, of course,

01:10:11.117 --> 01:10:13.263
was the expression of the time.

01:10:13.263 --> 01:10:15.810
And I'm pretty inclined to believe

01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:19.393
that it sort of naturally
came form Cicero.

01:10:20.297 --> 01:10:22.714
And so, what more do we need?

01:10:24.031 --> 01:10:25.343
You could recognize virtue.

01:10:25.343 --> 01:10:26.622
You have a moral sense.

01:10:26.622 --> 01:10:29.044
You approve of virtue because
you have the moral sense.

01:10:29.044 --> 01:10:32.301
You disapprove of what
is unjust and unfair

01:10:32.301 --> 01:10:34.319
and so on of life,

01:10:34.319 --> 01:10:38.017
and then you act in accordance
with your human nature,

01:10:38.017 --> 01:10:42.761
which, luckily, will lead
you to act virtuously

01:10:42.761 --> 01:10:44.195
and to become a good person.

01:10:44.195 --> 01:10:46.794
And then if you follow Panaetius' advice

01:10:46.794 --> 01:10:49.063
about being like perilous,

01:10:49.063 --> 01:10:51.878
you will also behave yourself
tactfully if you can,

01:10:51.878 --> 01:10:53.514
and so on, you will be like (mumbles).

01:10:53.514 --> 01:10:56.837
So it seems to me that it is quite likely

01:10:56.837 --> 01:10:58.604
that readers of the 18th century

01:10:58.604 --> 01:11:00.578
didn't think that anything was missing.

01:11:00.578 --> 01:11:05.283
They probably, and surprisingly
overlooked the fact

01:11:05.283 --> 01:11:07.321
that this wasn't a general
exposition of ethics.

01:11:07.321 --> 01:11:09.963
They took it as a full account of ethics

01:11:09.963 --> 01:11:11.386
because ethics at the time

01:11:11.386 --> 01:11:13.391
really was about how to act,

01:11:13.391 --> 01:11:16.338
how to decide, and so on and so forth.

01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:18.397
And so, as it were, paradoxically,

01:11:18.397 --> 01:11:22.702
although it was probably
not intended by Panaetius,

01:11:22.702 --> 01:11:24.782
his book, which put metaphysics

01:11:24.782 --> 01:11:26.418
so very much in the background,

01:11:26.418 --> 01:11:28.716
actually led to what later ages saw

01:11:28.716 --> 01:11:31.586
as a complete account of ethics,

01:11:31.586 --> 01:11:34.911
namely a kind of moral sense ethics.

01:11:34.911 --> 01:11:36.732
Thank you, and for your patience.

01:11:36.732 --> 01:11:39.899
(audience applauding)

01:11:42.667 --> 01:11:44.378
- [Man] I have a question.

01:11:44.378 --> 01:11:45.776
I don't think it's directly related

01:11:45.776 --> 01:11:47.776
to the final result, but

01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:51.230
has to do with, I guess,

01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:54.607
in the first paragraph.

01:11:57.684 --> 01:12:00.001
I noticed the word,

01:12:00.001 --> 01:12:02.584
they're careful also not to do,

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:06.233
to do nothing in an
unfitting or effeminate way.

01:12:06.233 --> 01:12:07.192
- Yeah.

01:12:07.192 --> 01:12:08.885
- [Man] And I've always been puzzled.

01:12:08.885 --> 01:12:12.748
I noticed that recently
in a class I was taking

01:12:12.748 --> 01:12:16.190
that Machiavelli referred to a prince

01:12:16.190 --> 01:12:19.565
not being acting in an effeminate way,

01:12:19.565 --> 01:12:21.565
and I'm puzzled by that,

01:12:23.524 --> 01:12:25.480
'cause I don't quite know what that means.

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:28.660
Sometimes, I'm trying to understand,

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:31.625
since effeminate sorta suggests feminine--

01:12:31.625 --> 01:12:32.458
- Yes.

01:12:32.458 --> 01:12:33.872
- [Man] I'm trying to understand how

01:12:33.872 --> 01:12:37.996
women might be situated
in this ethical view.

01:12:37.996 --> 01:12:39.999
- Well, unfortunately, they're not.

01:12:39.999 --> 01:12:41.854
(audience chuckling quietly)

01:12:41.854 --> 01:12:42.687
You're quite right.

01:12:42.687 --> 01:12:45.645
Effeminate does mean behave like a woman.

01:12:45.645 --> 01:12:47.473
And you know, for a real man,

01:12:47.473 --> 01:12:50.302
that wasn't how one behaved.

01:12:50.302 --> 01:12:51.757
And thank you for mentioning Machiavelli.

01:12:51.757 --> 01:12:55.254
Machiavelli, much maligned, I think,

01:12:55.254 --> 01:12:56.660
was actually one of the people

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.868
who studied the De Officiis,

01:12:58.868 --> 01:13:01.189
and his Prince is actually,

01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:05.040
obviously meant to be something
like the kind of manual

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.613
that Cicero had provided.

01:13:06.613 --> 01:13:07.994
And Machiavelli himself, I think,

01:13:07.994 --> 01:13:10.378
was not a Machiavellian
in the modern sense.

01:13:10.378 --> 01:13:11.396
So, (chuckles)

01:13:11.396 --> 01:13:14.458
so it's not implausible
that he took this. (mumbles)

01:13:14.458 --> 01:13:17.587
But effeminate does mean
behave like a woman,

01:13:17.587 --> 01:13:19.942
and that's supposed to
be reprehensible in men.

01:13:19.942 --> 01:13:22.655
The whole thing is for men.

01:13:22.655 --> 01:13:23.709
But there is a little bit,

01:13:23.709 --> 01:13:25.160
a little piece about women,

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:28.587
which says that they have to be pretty

01:13:28.587 --> 01:13:31.439
and gentle and not talk too much.

01:13:31.439 --> 01:13:32.800
(audience laughing)

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.177
There's not much you can do about that.

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:36.098
(audience laughing)

01:13:36.098 --> 01:13:38.608
Yeah well, you know,
remember the old adage?

01:13:38.608 --> 01:13:40.250
(speaking in foreign language)

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:43.190
Goes back to the early Christian church.

01:13:43.190 --> 01:13:47.397
You know, women should shut up in church.

01:13:47.397 --> 01:13:49.754
So. (chuckles)

01:13:49.754 --> 01:13:51.322
Well, I mean, in this respect,

01:13:51.322 --> 01:13:52.155
you know, it's hopeless.

01:13:52.155 --> 01:13:54.001
It is hopeless.

01:13:54.001 --> 01:13:55.918
It took us a long time.

01:13:57.013 --> 01:13:59.315
Some Stoics, and ah,

01:13:59.315 --> 01:14:01.745
well, come to think of it,

01:14:01.745 --> 01:14:03.951
even Epicurus did admit women.

01:14:03.951 --> 01:14:06.043
And they also, they must have realized

01:14:06.043 --> 01:14:08.301
that women were just as smart.

01:14:08.301 --> 01:14:11.404
But then you see that
from the Greek plays,

01:14:11.404 --> 01:14:14.558
and you know, look at the
really impressive women

01:14:14.558 --> 01:14:15.528
who show up there.

01:14:15.528 --> 01:14:18.159
You don't even have to
read the philosophers.

01:14:18.159 --> 01:14:19.617
But you know,

01:14:19.617 --> 01:14:21.141
well, and then, I think,

01:14:21.141 --> 01:14:23.172
I mean of course, you know,

01:14:23.172 --> 01:14:26.024
living in this age, you
have thought about it.

01:14:26.024 --> 01:14:28.974
One thing I have thought
about is, (mumbles)

01:14:28.974 --> 01:14:31.348
these people were always pregnant

01:14:31.348 --> 01:14:35.211
unless you were a nun or a Vestal Virgin

01:14:35.211 --> 01:14:36.558
or something or other,

01:14:36.558 --> 01:14:37.570
or you were ugly enough

01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:39.673
that nobody would marry you.

01:14:39.673 --> 01:14:41.146
Once these people married,

01:14:41.146 --> 01:14:43.175
and they usually married at the age of,

01:14:43.175 --> 01:14:44.155
fairly old age,

01:14:44.155 --> 01:14:46.925
something like 16 to 18, you know,

01:14:46.925 --> 01:14:50.113
they would always be pregnant,

01:14:50.113 --> 01:14:52.459
and you know, or some of them,

01:14:52.459 --> 01:14:55.778
I think this became worse
over time with urbanization.

01:14:55.778 --> 01:14:59.390
But in any case, many of
them died in childbirth.

01:14:59.390 --> 01:15:01.431
So one reason, I'm afraid, you know,

01:15:01.431 --> 01:15:04.653
this is no reason to think
they're dumb or anything,

01:15:04.653 --> 01:15:07.746
but one reason why women couldn't,

01:15:07.746 --> 01:15:10.984
in fact, were physically prevented from

01:15:10.984 --> 01:15:12.762
doing some of the things

01:15:12.762 --> 01:15:15.472
that men could do was
that they were held back

01:15:15.472 --> 01:15:19.732
by the fact that they were
having children all the time.

01:15:19.732 --> 01:15:22.081
So it's perhaps not so surprising

01:15:22.081 --> 01:15:24.557
that this century has seen more

01:15:24.557 --> 01:15:26.972
of a liberation of women than others,

01:15:26.972 --> 01:15:29.926
because we also have to
think of the physical side.

01:15:29.926 --> 01:15:34.029
Thinking back, you had to be either a nun

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:37.824
or the most preferable
thing in the 19th century

01:15:37.824 --> 01:15:40.991
is being the widow of a very rich man,

01:15:42.133 --> 01:15:42.966
(audience laughing)

01:15:42.966 --> 01:15:45.983
because once you had been married,

01:15:45.983 --> 01:15:47.030
you could do what you liked.

01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:49.121
But before you were married,

01:15:49.121 --> 01:15:53.101
you were being sort of
looked after by your family,

01:15:53.101 --> 01:15:55.494
and it was a miserable existence.

01:15:55.494 --> 01:15:59.661
So I think, I'm afraid we
can't do much about this.

01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:02.606
That's the time, and all we can say

01:16:02.606 --> 01:16:04.563
is we shouldn't be too arrogant

01:16:04.563 --> 01:16:08.063
claiming that he shouldn't have done this.

01:16:10.801 --> 01:16:13.433
- [Woman] I wish to ask you

01:16:13.433 --> 01:16:15.017
about the relation you see

01:16:15.017 --> 01:16:18.350
between the innovation you say Panaetius

01:16:20.281 --> 01:16:23.079
brought in concerning inner beauty,

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:25.250
and reflections on beauty

01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:29.456
such as we can find in
Posidonius and Chrysippus,

01:16:29.456 --> 01:16:32.026
as reported by Galen.

01:16:32.026 --> 01:16:34.840
So the debate about when and how

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.374
we develop a sense of beauty.

01:16:37.374 --> 01:16:41.541
So what is it, I'm trying
to pin down the novelty.

01:16:43.004 --> 01:16:47.150
So if we compare it to Chrysippus saying

01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:51.434
we have a sense of
beauty since we are born,

01:16:51.434 --> 01:16:53.434
the novelty of Panaetius

01:16:55.429 --> 01:16:57.944
is in transferring the sense of beauty

01:16:57.944 --> 01:16:59.735
to a sense of inner beauty?

01:16:59.735 --> 01:17:00.964
I couldn't--

01:17:00.964 --> 01:17:02.359
- I think it's the use he makes of it.

01:17:02.359 --> 01:17:04.580
I mean, of course, they will say

01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:07.374
that virtue is visible
or something or other,

01:17:07.374 --> 01:17:09.054
but to really explain it

01:17:09.054 --> 01:17:12.536
in terms of this analogy,
as Seneca called it,

01:17:12.536 --> 01:17:15.036
and to make it part of the way

01:17:16.141 --> 01:17:17.987
that leads us to virtue

01:17:17.987 --> 01:17:21.525
without having to study, as it were,

01:17:21.525 --> 01:17:23.182
all of Stoic metaphysics,

01:17:23.182 --> 01:17:24.461
I think that's the innovation.

01:17:24.461 --> 01:17:26.219
I mean, that's why it shows up

01:17:26.219 --> 01:17:30.962
at a place where one
doesn't expect it, I think.

01:17:30.962 --> 01:17:35.026
The earliest Stoics and
your Epictetus, of course,

01:17:35.026 --> 01:17:37.838
tended to be a lot more open

01:17:37.838 --> 01:17:40.349
and perhaps more naive

01:17:40.349 --> 01:17:42.982
in thinking that you could just appeal

01:17:42.982 --> 01:17:44.491
to God and reason,

01:17:44.491 --> 01:17:46.498
you could just appeal to
the beauty of the world

01:17:46.498 --> 01:17:48.831
and people would follow you.

01:17:49.912 --> 01:17:50.903
The Romans, I think,

01:17:50.903 --> 01:17:54.211
might not have been so willing to do that.

01:17:54.211 --> 01:17:56.129
So while you find Epictetus saying,

01:17:56.129 --> 01:17:57.526
you know, God has wanted us,

01:17:57.526 --> 01:18:00.101
and I mean, he doesn't argue for it.

01:18:00.101 --> 01:18:04.234
I think the other Stoics
do argue for this.

01:18:04.234 --> 01:18:06.957
You do find a very long
version of the argument

01:18:06.957 --> 01:18:10.774
from design in Cicero's De Natura Deorum,

01:18:10.774 --> 01:18:13.663
and that's definitely Stoic.

01:18:13.663 --> 01:18:15.592
So I mean, this is something,

01:18:15.592 --> 01:18:19.341
and that's, I think,
why it's an innovation.

01:18:19.341 --> 01:18:21.490
To use the sense of beauty

01:18:21.490 --> 01:18:24.564
as our way towards recognizing virtue,

01:18:24.564 --> 01:18:26.574
and to, as Seneca puts it,

01:18:26.574 --> 01:18:29.286
to acquire our first notion of the good.

01:18:29.286 --> 01:18:32.683
That is to say we can
recognize things that are good,

01:18:32.683 --> 01:18:34.679
but we can't explain, as it were,

01:18:34.679 --> 01:18:36.114
what makes them so good.

01:18:36.114 --> 01:18:37.561
So we can only understand

01:18:37.561 --> 01:18:40.081
what this inner beauty comes to

01:18:40.081 --> 01:18:42.391
once we understand what kinds of beliefs

01:18:42.391 --> 01:18:43.809
about the, you know,

01:18:43.809 --> 01:18:45.619
the divine order of the world,

01:18:45.619 --> 01:18:47.426
leads to the kind of inner harmony

01:18:47.426 --> 01:18:48.791
that they're talking about.

01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:50.765
But it can be recognized

01:18:50.765 --> 01:18:53.147
because it shows up in this kind of form.

01:18:53.147 --> 01:18:56.704
I think that's the
innovation if I'm right.

01:18:56.704 --> 01:18:58.201
I may be wrong, I mean, you know.

01:18:58.201 --> 01:18:59.646
- [Woman] Thanks.

01:18:59.646 --> 01:19:02.089
- [Woman] So why is that
not in The Symposium?

01:19:02.089 --> 01:19:03.056
- Pardon?

01:19:03.056 --> 01:19:03.889
- [Woman] The Symposium.

01:19:03.889 --> 01:19:06.749
I'm thinking about where the antecedent,

01:19:06.749 --> 01:19:10.101
I mean the Stoics are
readers of Plato after all.

01:19:10.101 --> 01:19:13.386
Might one not think that
you get exactly that move

01:19:13.386 --> 01:19:14.647
in The Symposium,

01:19:14.647 --> 01:19:18.230
where you move from
thinking about, I mean,

01:19:19.106 --> 01:19:21.843
move from thinking about outer beauty

01:19:21.843 --> 01:19:24.026
to thinking about inner beauty?

01:19:24.026 --> 01:19:25.416
- Well, Plato's beauty,

01:19:25.416 --> 01:19:28.301
I believe ends up being pretty abstract.

01:19:28.301 --> 01:19:30.321
- [Woman] I see.

01:19:30.321 --> 01:19:33.722
- And here, you get from
looking at beautiful people

01:19:33.722 --> 01:19:36.292
and looking at beautiful pictures

01:19:36.292 --> 01:19:37.839
and looking at beautiful horses

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:40.089
and maybe beautiful houses,

01:19:41.093 --> 01:19:42.624
to the idea,

01:19:42.624 --> 01:19:44.507
and of course, in this case,

01:19:44.507 --> 01:19:47.671
since we are going from
sort of eyes to the mind,

01:19:47.671 --> 01:19:51.635
you look at beautiful
young men, preferably,

01:19:51.635 --> 01:19:52.840
and then lo and behold,

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.980
you get the idea that you know,

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:57.068
that's not Plato.

01:19:57.068 --> 01:20:00.673
I mean, the Stoics are very
strongly influenced by Plato.

01:20:00.673 --> 01:20:01.942
Yeah, I mean, of course you get that

01:20:01.942 --> 01:20:03.019
in The Phaedrus, right?

01:20:03.019 --> 01:20:05.102
But again, you have this,

01:20:06.488 --> 01:20:08.083
this step further,

01:20:08.083 --> 01:20:09.779
which I think is, you know,

01:20:09.779 --> 01:20:13.392
here, have a theory which
doesn't require that.

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:15.160
That's what I would say.

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.955
I mean, I'm not denying

01:20:16.955 --> 01:20:18.788
that they were strongly influenced.

01:20:18.788 --> 01:20:21.138
I mean, I'm the first
person to admit that.

01:20:21.138 --> 01:20:23.221
But it's not that direct.

01:20:25.446 --> 01:20:27.588
- [John] 'Kay well,
impossible to hear that talk

01:20:27.588 --> 01:20:29.688
without admiring the beauty and harmony

01:20:29.688 --> 01:20:31.273
of the composition, so thank you.

01:20:31.273 --> 01:20:32.523
- (laughs) Come on.
(audience chuckling)

01:20:32.523 --> 01:20:34.636
(audience applauding)

01:20:34.636 --> 01:20:36.285
(Gisela speaking quietly)

01:20:36.285 --> 01:20:39.313
(John laughing)

01:20:39.313 --> 01:20:41.896
(upbeat music)
