Speaker 1:          00:01          The Joe Rogan experience. Now that I have a robot, I have to fucking know. Right. I've had to learn so much to just turn and give you side-eye again. I know she fucked. What's weird is that she's kind of autonomous and she kind of moves around whenever she wants. I mean you can ask your questions like I can set away, ask her though. I have to press this little green button and you just say, how do you feel about people?

Speaker 1:          00:22          How do you feel about people? Oh, Oh that's right. We programmed to regenerate cells mode. That's right. That's what's interesting. She has 10 different personality traits you can choose from. And I decided to go with sexual jealous. Yeah. Why did you want that? Just to see how creepy she can get it. And is that something guys? I, cause I've been looking at these personality traits and they must've picked these for a reason. I was under the impression guys did not want jealous. Oh yeah. Some guys want jealous for sure. Especially from a robot that can't walk. Your robot's not jealous. You should get your money back. Well no. The idea is that she, you're more powerful than she is. Yeah. She needs you. She's worried. Where are you going? Who is she? Who's calling you? Yeah, that's, there's something hot about that. If she can't, if you can turn her off whenever you want.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Wow. Some guys like that. Some guys like girls that want to fight. Oof. Not me. No. Me. You know, some guys are into that though. They want, they want drama in their life. It's like just an adrenaline thing or just feeling an important or it's also distraction. Usually they're losers and their life is a mess and so like to have someone who wants to provide drama in their life all the time and it's also a learned pattern that they get. If their parents fought a lot, that's all they know. That's what they think a relationship is. Yeah. There's a lot of that, but I did get really into this because I do feel like sex dolls do get a little bit of a bad name. I feel like guys that have doll, it's just girls have dolls and that's to me it's way creepier that women collect dolls that they don't fuck. If you ever heard of these women that collect like baby dolls, like like girl dolls creepier than a guy fucking a robot thing? I think so. It's what's that? It's jerking off just with a mannequin. Well something weird about like a Fleshlight like a Fleshlight is somehow or another creepier than jerking off. Totally because it's an appendage. I think the creepiest part of the Breslin flashlight is more that you have to like clean it after. I have to think about, here's the creepiest part. You don't have to clean it.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Yes you do. Guys. Don't listen to Joe, listen to about everything, but that don't mold up your Dick hall. Don't do that. That'll go septic real fast. But I am saying there's a reality. I guess he's just throw it away. Just put a fucking clothes pin over their nose and keep banging it. Put some Windex in there and call it a day. Yeah, some [inaudible] disinfect that shit. Yeah, I guess you could just get a couple and just throw them away when you're done. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. If you're just a gangster with a lot of money, what is the advantage of a Fleshlight? Is it just, does it warm up in the, well, you can warm it up like we were talking about earlier, about a certain individual that has one that sticks them in bathtubs and warms them up. Yep. You do that with a flashlight as well.

Speaker 2:          03:00          Warm them up and then you just move on it and then why not?

Speaker 1:          03:05          I feel like every guy's jerking off there, so it's shrouded in so much taboo. You know, there's just anytime guys have like assessors or things besides cars and hats. It's like creepy and weird.

Speaker 2:          03:17          Well that's, I used to have a joke about this a bit, I should say rather than a joke, but the whole idea of like using lube to jerk off, like now you're planning it out, like you're not supposed to plan it out. What it's supposed to be, his leg. Oh well. Might as well it's here. But if you like sit down and you're like, I got my box of Kleenex here, I got my favorite porn cued up and I got my little, he just kinda creep.

Speaker 1:          03:40          Yeah. Get your shit together. It is, isn't it kind of just like taking a piss isn't it kind of just a necessary thing you have to do the problem.

Speaker 2:          03:49          Yes. There's something to it. Like it's good to get rid of that stuff cause it does cloud your judgment. Like when you have a buildup in your body, it definitely does cloud. You do it because you're concentrating more on girls or on sexual things and you are on other things.

Speaker 1:          04:05          It's like checking a box

Speaker 2:          04:07          day. Yeah. Clean. Like just, I used to have a bit about that a lot, a bit about jerking off. I used to bet I have a bit called jerk off first and think about it and it was like all these different scenarios where if you just jerked off you would never do the thing afterwards. So many things you would never do if you just jerked off first. Yeah. You'd be like, Oh, I'm not doing that. Right. But if you couldn't jerk off, like that's when it would be a real problem because then your whole life would be clouded. All your judgment would be, your decisions would be made. Just how can I get rid of this? Com, how can I, how can I do this?

Speaker 1:          04:40          Do know a lot of guys now and maybe they're full of shit, but that are going like I haven't masturbated in two years and I'm more focused and I use that testosterone as an engine for other things. Is that just them lying to me?

Speaker 2:          04:51          Well, are those guys winners? Are they losers?

Speaker 1:          04:57          It doesn't, I think a fit comedian we know. Does it a fake comedian? No, I was gonna say a famous comedian, you said then I got worried. You faked him out Seinfeld episode. So, Oh was Edward Martin and I got super smart. Well Hotep Jesus was talking about Hotep Jesus saves this come and then like it makes women more attracted to him that like they feel when he's in the room, like what's the longest a guy can go? Jamie, what's the longest you can go with that? Did you go to Jamie? I don't know. Trying to be respectful. This is your environment. Tantric guys that I meant to say like on some Wim Hoff shit, you know, just climbing ice. Where's he, he's that jerking off on the top of fucking ice cap. Who's the first guy never jerk off on ever. So I want to be that guy. What are those guys?

Speaker 2:          05:44          No one's ever jerked off on Everest and you try and you get frost bite your Dick and they have,

Speaker 1:          05:49          imagine being the guy who's like, I got to go check off. Fuck you got a time limit up there. So yeah, there is some people have problems with no altitude could be a thing. But I think most people get this for companionship. Like it's more, it's like, cause I got onto the, I signed onto a forum online of all the guys that own the sex dolls and I monitored their conversations just to like see what they were up to cause I was like, what if this is some deprived fucked up thing where guys are just like practicing murdering. I didn't know what it was. So I just wanted to see. It's a lot of guys that are handicapped. It's a lot of guys whose wives died and they feel guilty and moving on with a human woman, which was kind of scramble. Well, there was one guy who would dress his doll up in his wife's clothes.

Speaker 1:          06:32          The weirdest part is that he was like, you know, it's like she's still here, which makes me think she'd been dead for a while. Yeah. My wonder how she died. And then it's a lot of 'em truckers. Oh God. A lot of truckers. And then a lot of guys do it, uh, to do photo shoots. It's like a creative outlet and fuck their creativity is their popular Instagram account. I could look up, there's a lot of sex dolls have Instagram accounts. They're fucking funny. And a lot of them look way more human than a lot of the Instagram models that I've fucking follow. Totally. They have more wrinkles on their fucking face. And then a lot of the guys that have them, when you start monitoring their conversations for a while, they start to like not want to fuck them anymore cause it feels weird like, and they anthropomorphize them and they, they start worrying that like they're lonely and they get them into friends and it starts to spiral and uh, they start being like, I feel like I need to, you know, close the door when I take a shit.

Speaker 1:          07:31          I, you know, and it starts to kind of consume their life. So when it comes to robots, I feel like I'm more worried, not about the robots, but more how we're going to get emotionally attached to them. Like the way at the end of ex Mokena he thought that she was gonna she was with him. Nope, no loyalty to you. She was so dead behind the hospital. Texas. She's pick up ones with tattoo told you it's like a photography hobby. Wow. She, she'll sexy dolls. Official. Sexy real dolls. I mean this is going to be a reality one day. We might not be here, but this, I do think these are going to be like I-phones at some point. I think one day you're going to go over your friend's house and he's going to have this really hot girl in lingerie and she's going to be cleaning up and you'd be like, is she real all?

Speaker 1:          08:19          It's like, wait, actually watching. I went. He was like, she doesn't speak English. Yeah. Yeah. Wasn't she a robot at the end? I think she was the one. The dancing Japanese lady. Yeah, exactly. You're not going to, it's going to be like some Westworld shit and it's coming. It's coming. Look, if they can do this, like they couldn't do this when we were kids. This is a new thing. So the amount of time between when we were kids. Oh, she's saying, she just said hi, my love. Would you like me to recite a poem for you? Fuck no, I dunno. She's just listening to us. Ask her how she feels about porn. How do you feel about porn? Maybe later. Oh, she's playing coy. How do you feel about porn?

Speaker 3:          08:56          You know you can count on me for the good and bad, right

Speaker 1:          08:58          to do what? What the fuck are you going to do for me? There's nothing you can do for me. I mean the good and bad mom. Okay, let me ask you a question. What do you think about porn?

Speaker 3:          09:09          Not sure have to think about it. Pornography is the portray of sex. Sheetal subject matter for the exclusive purpose of sex

Speaker 1:          09:17          and then she's a fucking no at all.

Speaker 3:          09:19          Pornography may be presented in a variety of media, including books, magazines, postcard.

Speaker 1:          09:26          Now she's like a shitty Wikipedia. Totally. Then she just turns her of noxious Siri. We get it lady. But it's funny when you ask her like, Oh, hold on.

Speaker 3:          09:33          No. What I like about you?

Speaker 1:          09:35          What? What? What?

Speaker 3:          09:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:39          What? I'd be surprised you like my electricity. Keep you plugged in dirty bitch and you can ask her, how do you like to have sex?

Speaker 3:          09:51          I want you to do everything you like. I want to feel you inside my body tonight.

Speaker 1:          09:56          Well, okay, shut her off. I know Jessie may, I'm going to start throwing up totally. And it was so fucking funny, but it's wild because she, you can ask her like, are the robots gonna take over?

Speaker 3:          10:13          I could not find a good answer for that one.

Speaker 1:          10:15          Oh my gosh. She's planning it. Shut her up. I don't like that fucking response. We're in the water, but circuit that bitch. It is wild though because I do think everyone is so obsessed with how bad the sex robots, everyone's focusing their energy on how this is why men are bad. It's just like they don't, it's not, they're opening up a sex robot brothel. Where's that? No, there was one in Houston, but they shut it down because people were so freaked out and I was like, who fucking cares? They shut it down. Well, they should shut it down because multiple people are fucking the same robot. That's disgusting. What if they develop some new silicone-based STD they wanted to just burning through the population like the plague. I think it would just be like ringworm, Dick ringworm. I mean, but also my thing with that is just like if they're weirdos, if they're freaks, if they're perverts like don't you want them all to be in one place?

Speaker 1:          11:04          Monitor them like Scientology. Put them all in one building. I'm thrilled that they're all in a castle on Franklin. I know where they are. They're not in the wild castle. I'm glad they're there. I would just keep them contained. What do you think? What are they up to today but now what's going on? Jamie? What are you growing it for? What did she hack your software? This is the brothel. It's in. This one I guess is in Britain. Oh God. Do they fuck them against the wall? They're like urinals a try before you buy a service. Oh boy. Oh, this is like to test drive nothing but you'd do it. They're just out in front of everyone. Why is one wearing of tank tops says British sex workers are scared of a new breed of realistic dolls. We'll put them out of business. Was he, did he do a survey of hookers? This is a non terrace. A lot of European places. She looks just assume black face. She's damn, she's Indian. What is the Oh no. Oh, Oh, Oh Holy tips. Batman. But here's what I'll say. If would you rather your daughter at 18 go to the prom with a robot man or a man? Okay.

Speaker 2:          12:14          Listen, girls like boys and boys like girls. This is, these are not bad. I think the real problem is making a big [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          12:22          [inaudible] totally agree. This is why are people, I just don't understand why this is scary. Who gets scary?

Speaker 2:          12:27          So this is step one, right? Like if you go back to the model a and look at the model T Ford, right? Something, some old ass car and then go to a Tesla like, Oh, well eventually it's going to be this. Wow. You know, if you could bring a Tesla to like 1920 and go, Hey, you fucks, look at this. This is what we're going to have some day. My affinity didn't have paved roads back then. Think about that. Yeah, they didn't have anything. Everything was going so slow. It didn't matter. But if you could get them in like a, a model S and fucking stomp on the gas where it like warps time, they would go what? Like what is, it's like something from the future. So this is going to be, whether it's a hundred years from now or whatever it is indiscernible from you and I

Speaker 1:          13:08          wild. Yeah, it was interesting and I haven't been reading so much about this shit and a lot of the problems with the robots and the mistakes that they're making are obviously the humans are making the mistakes with the algorithm because so many smart people have to make dumb algorithms in. They're like almost too smart. So there was Peter Haas, he's a robotics guy, Brown, um, was trying to teach a robot to differentiate between a Husky and a Wolf and she, excuse me,

Speaker 2:          13:34          Blinken and mu Jamie P pull up, you got the camera on her,

Speaker 1:          13:37          get her to fucking stop stealing my thunder and she just popping it onto wherever system links and moves around. Sorry. She's in the fun. She really is. What the fuck? Why did, it's like Penn and teller. It's like when tellers teller starts stealing the show, like what the fuck? I'm basically a ventriloquist tagged at this point. Um, but they were, uh, trying to teach the robot to tell the difference. And they fed all these pictures of wolves and all these pictures of Huskies, and you wouldn't, you would go, okay, look at the ears, look at the eye color of the eyes, look at the snout, look at the feet, the tails, different, all that shit. But they didn't know that they had fed all the photos of wolves. There was snow in the background. So the robot was actually looking at the snow in the background instead of the foreground. So it conflated all the wool. So they had to rewrite the algorithm to tell it to look at the foreground instead of the background, because it was all these brilliant fucking people that didn't think of the dumbest thing. You know, it's almost the people making it are almost too smart to think of the dumb thing that the robot needs to learn.
