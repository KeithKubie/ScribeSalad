00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.860
So for talking about online education,
I can think of few people more

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.740
interesting and qualified to talk
about than Dr. Sebastian Thrun.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.730
So thank you so much for
talking to us for a few minutes today.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.490
&gt;&gt; It's a pleasure.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.550
&gt;&gt; So the first thing I wanted
to ask is Udacity's mission

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.310
is democratizing education.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.590
For those students that we have that
aren't too familiar with what that

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.150
means, can you give a rundown
of what that means in practice?

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.470
&gt;&gt; Well, I would say today we live
in a world that good education

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.300
is extremely locked up and inaccessible.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.010
It's expensive.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.520
It's hard to get in.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.850
And it's not geographically distributed,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.450
which means the institutions aren't
in Africa or places like these.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.570
Democratization means
everybody should have access.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.750
We should have access to clean
drinking water, to security, and

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.810
to good education.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.620
I think education is fundamental
in giving people a chance to

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.240
play in this world.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.820
&gt;&gt; I think that's very, very relevant
to what we do in the LMS program,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.750
as you know, because it's so low cost,
it's so flexible, so distributed that we

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.130
have people, especially people in this
class who could never take a class or

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.900
do a program like this, traditionally,
because they can't take a couple years

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.240
off work or they can't, pay six
figures just to get a Master's degree.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.709
And one fo the reasons, especially since
this is an educational technology class,

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.840
is technology a necessary part of that?

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.960
Does it enable us to do something now
that we couldn't do before or are we

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.010
just the only ones who are finally
coming around and say let's do this?

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.670
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.060
It's a necessary but
not a sufficient component.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.430
I don't think alone will be a education.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.190
But I think we live in a world with
the knowledge that we have now

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.768
more better devices.

00:01:23.768 --> 00:01:28.190
We have ability to record video, to do
interactive things like video games.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.920
And those ought to play a role.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.610
We've done this quite a bit and

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.780
we're exploring what's the best
way to deliver education.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.800
And to have interaction with
students and foster interactions but

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.910
technology plays a huge part in this.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.030
&gt;&gt; Is technology mostly about getting
the access to the education, or is

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.690
there other things that technology does
for us that we couldn't do in the past?

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.070
&gt;&gt; Every time you move to a different
medium I think everything changes.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.580
So the way we do lectures today,
a single professor speaking to many,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.410
many students Is because the technology
they're using is a natural human voice.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.390
As we change this into a more
recorded technology and

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.980
digital technology, we can really
change the entire idea of lectures.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.690
We don't need lectures anymore.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.000
We can do it much more interactive,
it turns out.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.780
In technology, you can actually make
class as much fun as a video game.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.500
And a video game is clearly
enough to select to us.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.128
A student can do something to
exercise their own skills.

00:02:19.128 --> 00:02:22.210
&gt;&gt; I would like to think that that kind
of technology is something what allows

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.060
this class to happen.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.890
It allows us to have the kind of
communication between instructors and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.570
TAs and students that we really can't
have in person where everything is very

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.380
guarded in terms of how much
time you have to give to it.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.810
So we have a lot of
people in the class and

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.430
I bet that there are some out there
who are wondering do I want to go into

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.190
research or
do I want to go into business?

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.910
And the class project we have for this
class is very much built around either

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.800
doing something that could become
a research project or doing something

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.770
that could become a start up or
a tool that we use in the program.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.210
You're one of the only people I
know that succeeded in both realms.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.020
So do you have any thoughts for
anyone who might be struggling with

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.180
whether they want to go the research
route or the business route?

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.150
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't struggle about
research versus business.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.170
I think it's kind of very much the same,
to be honest.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.410
I would struggle about impact and about
willingness to experiment and to learn.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.360
I think so
much has not been discovered yet.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.240
I think we would look back
a hundred years from now and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.270
ask what did we [INAUDIBLE] at the time,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.560
we probably concluded was probably
gutsy to do what we're doing.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.260
But it wasn't that good.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.740
It think it's going to get much better.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.700
And it's going to get much better by you
students doing great experiments and

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.740
trying things out even
non-conventional things.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.540
And if you're able to make a dent
in people's ability to learn using

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.370
digital technology, and do it in
a way that it's, financially viable.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.810
Doesn't require having a thousand
professors sit there and

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.590
watch your hand.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.140
Then you might turn to research paper or
you might also turn to start up company.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.490
Or you might join Udacity and work with
us to make the world a better place.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.900
&gt;&gt; Sounds fantastic to me.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.880
That's really guiding principle
behind why we started this class.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.560
So, do you have any final thoughts for

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.449
students taking a masters level
educational technology class?

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.690
&gt;&gt; I think the key thing
is really experimentation.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.320
I have this very deep belief in my heart
that we can make the world a better

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.150
place by democratizing education and
that with fire-stick technology.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.220
Otherwise we couldn't afford doing it.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.250
And what you can do as students,
the students in your class can do,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.610
is to really kind of do crazy things.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.220
Do something that looks
like it's going to fail.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.330
Do something that's audacious.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.550
Do something that is really out of
the world no one has tried before.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.290
Go to Twitter, go to Facebook.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.680
Make something crazy happen.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.399
And make it happen in
a short amount of time so

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.130
you don't waste too
much of your own time.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.980
And look at the data coming back.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.060
I think there is a lot
of surprises in there.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.250
You can discover a lot of good stuff.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.130
And when you find something great come
back to us and send us the application.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.510
We'd love to hire you.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.000
&gt;&gt; Sounds great.
Well thank you again so much for

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.880
talking with us and yeah, thank you.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.380
&gt;&gt; Pleasure.
