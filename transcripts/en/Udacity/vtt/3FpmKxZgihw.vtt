00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.530
As an entrepreneur,
when you start working with an investor,

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.650
there are some compromises that
are going to have to be made.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.780
And one way of thinking about that
is when you make your first pitch to

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.900
an investor,
the investor starts formulating in their

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.410
mind what they think this company should
become, what the product should be.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.950
And that may not be
the same idea that you have

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.810
in your head as the entrepreneur.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.102
And actually,
part of picking the right investors is,

00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:25.908
is there alignment
between these visions,

00:00:25.908 --> 00:00:29.920
the vision that the investor shares and
the vision that the entrepreneur shares?

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.619
And no matter how close
those two visions are,

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.220
sometimes there's going to
be some differences.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.260
And as an entrepreneur,
what you have to decide is

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.830
when the investor's vision is slightly
different, are you going to adjust?

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.710
Are you going to course correct?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.310
And when you're thinking
about doing that and

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.470
you're thinking about those compromises,
it's important to take a step back and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.690
think about it from
the investor's perspective.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.020
They're not in the weeds.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.200
They're not in the detail.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.800
Maybe they're looking
at the bigger picture.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.390
Maybe they're looking at other
companies in the marketplace.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.140
And you have to constantly evaluate,
should you course correct or

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.400
should you really remain on your vision?

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.030
Ultimately though,
if you're taking money from investors,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.612
there are going to be
compromises you have to make.

00:01:08.612 --> 00:01:11.430
They're going to ask you to do
things that may not have been your

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.560
first priority and, sometimes you're
just going to have to do that.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.450
And it comes down to making sure
that your investors are really good

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.150
and that their ideas are sound.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.790
And if they are,

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.980
sometimes they're going to tell you
something that you didn't think of and

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.940
you're going to have to correct.
