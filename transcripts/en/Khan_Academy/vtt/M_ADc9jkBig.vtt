00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.420
Part C. Find all values of
x on the interval negative 4

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.670
is less than x is less than
3 for which the graph of g

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.580
has a point of inflection.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.460
Give a reason for your answer.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.660
So an inflection
point is a point

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.220
where the sign of the
second derivative changes.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.560
So if you take the second
derivative at that point,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.345
or as we go close to that point,
or as we cross that point,

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:30.720
it goes from
positive to negative

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.390
or negative to positive.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.110
And to think about
that visually,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.920
you could think
of some examples.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.030
So if you have a curve that
looks something like this,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.820
you'll notice that over
here the slope is negative,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.040
but it's increasing.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.980
It's getting less
negative, less negative.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.740
Then it goes to 0.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.781
Then it keeps increasing.

00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:53.110
Slope is increasing, increasing,
all the way to there,

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.690
and then it starts
getting less positive.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.720
So it starts decreasing.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.100
So it's increasing.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.739
The slope is increasing over
at this point right over here.

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.280
So even though the
slope is negative,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.821
it's getting less
negative over here.

00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:04.989
So it's increasing.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.730
And then the slope
keeps increasing.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.480
It keeps on getting
more and more positive

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.470
up to about this point.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.261
And then the slope is
positive, but then it

00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:12.340
becomes less positive.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.840
So the slope begins
decreasing after that.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.320
So this right over here
is a point of inflection.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.427
The slope has gone from
increasing to decreasing.

00:01:25.427 --> 00:01:27.510
And if the other thing
happened, if the slope went

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.680
from decreasing to
increasing, that

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.180
would also be a
point of inflection.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.710
So if this was maybe some
type of a trigonometric curve,

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.450
then you might see
something like this.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.380
And so this also would it
be a point of inflection.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.030
But for this, our g of x is kind
of hard to visualize the way

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.702
they've defined it
right over here.

00:01:44.702 --> 00:01:46.410
So the best way to
think about it is just

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.790
figure out where its second
derivative has a sign change.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.450
And to think about that, we have
to find its second derivative.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.490
So let's write g of x over here.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.070
We know g of x is equal to
2x plus the definite integral

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.572
from 0 to x of f of t dt.

00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:04.030
We've already taken
its derivative,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.010
but we'll do it again.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.430
g prime of x is equal to 2
plus-- fundamental theorem

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.130
of calculus.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.920
The derivative of this right
over here is just f of x.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.950
And if we have the second
derivative of g-- g prime prime

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.010
of x-- this is equal to--
derivative of 2 is just 0.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.090
And then derivative of
f of x is f prime of x.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.790
So asking where this has a
sign change, asking where

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.820
our second derivative
has a sign change,

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.180
is equivalent to asking where
does the first derivative of f

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.610
have a sign change?

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.230
And asking where the
first derivative of f

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.540
has a sign change is
equivalent to saying

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.980
where does the slope of
f have a sign change?

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.900
You can view this as the slope
or the instantaneous slope

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.490
of f.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.210
So we want to know when the
slope of f has a sign change.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.330
So let's think about.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.550
Over here, the
slope is positive.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.213
It's going up.

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:02.432
It's up.

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:03.890
It's increasing,
but it's positive.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.050
And that's what we care about.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.600
So let's write it.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.433
I'll do it in green.

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:10.040
So the slope is positive
this entire time.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.780
It's increasing.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.260
It's increasing.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.843
It's positive.

00:03:11.843 --> 00:03:13.570
It's getting less positive now.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.820
It's starting to decrease, but
the slope is still positive.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.510
The slope is still
positive all the way

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.882
until we get right over there.

00:03:20.882 --> 00:03:22.590
You can see it gets
pretty close to zero.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.220
And then the slope
gets a negative.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.320
And then right over here,
the slope is negative.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.530
The slope is negative
right over here.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.530
So this is interesting.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.140
Because even though f is
actually not differentiable

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.960
right here-- so f is not
differentiable at that point

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.669
right over there.

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:42.251
And you could see it because the
slope goes pretty close to 0,

00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:43.850
and then it just
jumps to negative 3.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.700
So you have a discontinuity
of the derivative right

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.430
over there, but we do
have a sign change.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.600
We go from having
a positive slope

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.220
on this part of
the curve to having

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.660
a negative slope over
this part of the curve.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.990
So we experience a sign
change right over here

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.640
at x is equal to 0, a sign
change in the first derivative

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.610
of f, which is the same
thing as saying a sign

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.060
change in the second
derivative of g.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.650
And a sign change in the
second derivative of g

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.970
tells us that, when x is
equal to 0, the graph of g

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.860
has a point of inflection.
