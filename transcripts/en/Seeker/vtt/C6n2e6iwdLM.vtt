Everything’s bigger in America - Including
our crash test dummies! Boy that’s depressing.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.739
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and with the
rising rates of obesity here in America, an

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:18.970
interesting topic has come to light - crash
test dummies.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.279
Recent research from the University of California
found that obese drivers are 78% more likely

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.009
to die in a car crash. And with over two-thirds
of our population now classified as either

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.070
obese or overweight - it makes sense that
our crash test dummies should reflect that

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.540
growing portion of the population.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.270
Well, buckle your seatbelts - because soon
enough, they will. A company called Humanetics

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.110
is currently developing an obese crash test
dummy that weighs 273 pounds - compared to

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.960
the current standard of 167 pounds.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.340
According to the company’s CEO, Chris O’Connor,
seat belts, air bags and other safety features

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.520
have all been designed so that your rear sits
flush against the back of the seat, and the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.030
seat belt is tight against your pelvis.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.230
Obese people, who have larger rears and more
mass around their midsections, tend to sit

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.650
further forward, and the seat belts don’t
grasp around their pelvises as easily.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.830
So the new dummies, which were modeled after
real human cadavers, will accurately reflect

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.990
not just the weight, but the weight distribution,
of the standard obese American. They’ll

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.040
also be slightly taller, since the population
has grown slightly since the original crash

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.070
test dummies were created in the 80s.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.320
The new dummies cost about half a million
dollars EACH, which is on par with the current

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.620
models - but they also last forever. Not to
mention, the potential lives saved - which

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.450
you can’t really put a price on.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.750
Unsurprisingly, obese citizens aren’t the
only other model in development. Currently,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.960
there are models for teenagers and infants,
which are already on the market. But Humanetics

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.409
is also creating a line to reflect the aging,
elderly population, which will be released

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.140
in 2015 - along with the obese models.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.870
They’re also looking at lines designed specifically
for women. Many studies claim that female

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.390
drivers have a much higher fatality rate than
male drivers. Which explains why one of the

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.659
biggest research clinics at General Motors,
is specifically geared for petite women. Because

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.450
they sit much closer to the steering wheel,
than the rest of the population.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.079
What do you guys think about this? I know
it’s super depressing, but until we solve

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:17.180
the obesity crisis, these problems are only
gonna get bigger. Pun NOT intended. You can

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.290
let us know YOUR thoughts in the comments
down below. And as always, thank you guys

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.830
for watching!
