1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.950
Well,
I mean,
you hear about some of the experiments they did on people.
Man,

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.850
that was scary.

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.540
This doctor supposedly I think came in with the operation paperclip.
Oh,

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.630
she signs.
It goes that deep into,
oh my God,
that's horrible.

5
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.610
It's pretty fucked up.
It's,
it's,
it's,
you know,
operation.

6
00:00:16.611 --> 00:00:18.030
Do you know what operation paperclip was?

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.080
Isn't that something like a Hitler thing back in the day with babies?
No,
no,
no.

8
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.200
It was the Nazi scientists that were taken from World War II.

9
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.730
So the United States took Nazi scientists,
including Wernher von Braun,

10
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:30.710
who was the head of NASA,

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.410
a bunch of other scientists and all these Nazis that were working for Germany

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.650
making rockets and involved in like high level science.

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.070
They brought them over to America and sort of whitewash the whole thing.

14
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:48.000
They called it operation paperclip,
holy Wernher von Braun.

15
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:51.210
When he was at the head of NASA,
he was a fucking legitimate Nazi,

16
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.540
like the Simon Wiesenthal Center,
so that if he was alive today,

17
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:57.690
they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity.
I feel like there's still,

18
00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:01.860
you know,
there's still
people in there.

19
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.850
Well sort of.
They've chased those guys down to the far ends of the earth.

20
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.870
[inaudible] a bunch of them.
Those are very powerful positions to be in,

21
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.010
to have that sort of mentality driving it.
That's scary as fuck for sure.

22
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:18.300
You know what's really crazy is Argentina,
Argentina,
and South America.

23
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.990
A lot of Nazis went to Argentina and South America.

24
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:25.740
They fled Germany and Tim Kennedy,
who's a good friend of mine,

25
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:28.050
who was a former UFC fighters,
a soldier,

26
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.850
he was on a show called finding Hitler where there was,

27
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.120
there's been speculation over the years because so many Nazis landed in South

28
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:43.671
America that Hitler had escaped and lived out his life in,

29
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.450
in,
you know,
protected by these other Nazis.
And these South American towns,

30
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.430
like there's towns in South America too.

31
00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:55.350
There's towns in South America where they,
all they do is speak German.

32
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.600
They have October fast.

33
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.800
They have photographs on their walls of their grandfather and ss garb.

34
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.750
That is very,
very scary.
Oh dude,
it's crazy.
Very scary.
He blew me away when I,

35
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:08.420
when I'm,
when he was telling me about this and just great.

36
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.310
And he's a no nonsense guy.
So when he's explaining,
he's like,

37
00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:15.630
you got to understand you're coming to these towns.
Everyone is German.

38
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.920
Oh my God.
They all look like Germans.
They all talk German.

39
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.760
They all have German like houses and German,
like the,

40
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.030
the like German style stuff in their house.

41
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.200
This bizarre fucking crazy to be what happened.
I,
no,
no,

42
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.730
it's maybe not what happened to Hitler.
They're pretty sure they Hitler died,

43
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:38.250
but I'm sure they relocated and that's definitely what happened.

44
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.520
See if you could find that.
Yeah,
Jamie,
we'll find somebody stole it.

45
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.000
It'll blow you away.
This is just a South America look.

46
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:48.630
It looks like a German town.
German dude.
It's crazy.

47
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.890
There's a whole village,
these fucking people,
and there's not just one.

48
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.521
There's many,

49
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:57.570
many of these little little pockets that looks like an Oktoberfest bar.

50
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.690
That's really bizarre.
I mean,
that one looks a little Japanese that well,

51
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:03.610
there's videos though.
It's really crazy.

52
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:06.520
They're drinking out of steins and like the whole deal.

53
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.420
That's a really wild dude.
It's crazy.
Well,
obviously we couldn't get them all.

54
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.840
I mean,
they had to flee somewhere and they're going to set up shop,

55
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.420
make it there.
You know,
make it,
they're homogenous.

56
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.500
They saw the shit was about to hit the fan.
I said,
listen,
I know place.

57
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:23.950
We can get some cool Margarita's we can catch some fucking toast away.

58
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.280
Y'All want a day?
Let's bring Oktoberfest South America.

59
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.040
That's all wild.
I never knew that.
Oh,
it's,
yeah.
I didn't know it either.

60
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.240
It's crazy.
It's really crazy.
I see.
May I think there's too much to know.
