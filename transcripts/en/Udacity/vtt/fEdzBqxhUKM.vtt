00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.570
&gt;&gt; Alright, so are any of these easy to answer right off the bat?

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.810
&gt;&gt; Well, one of them is really easy to answer

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.540
right off the bat, and that's minus 1 minus 1.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.190
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.310
&gt;&gt; Because that's one of the points, so. [LAUGH]

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.448
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, the joint strategy to get the minus

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:20.355
one minus one would be for both players to cooperate, right?

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.790
Again, they're just, you know, they're just willing to do that

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.330
just for the sake of showing they can make that value.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.930
&gt;&gt; Right, and I think I know the answers for the other ones as well

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.010
&gt;&gt; Alright, hit me.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.250
&gt;&gt; So here's how i'm going to, here's how I'm going to, going to talk

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.620
you through my reasoning so that if any point I'm wrong, you can

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.625
gently steer me away from embarrassing myself. Basically I was looking at these

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:42.880
points and I thought hm, they form a kind of a convex hull.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.700
&gt;&gt; Aha!

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.590
&gt;&gt; And I thought well, surely that's just an accident of the numbers

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.820
and then I thought, oh wait, of course we're talking about averages here.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.030
So that means that all sort of possibilities have to be inside the convex hull

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.030
of the outer points. So if I drew a line between those four points,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.630
I would end up with all possible, achievable averages.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.810
&gt;&gt; What, achievable averages, how? How would

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.410
you achieve things inside the convex hull?

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.390
&gt;&gt; I would appropriately average them. So in

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.079
particular, the first thing I'd notice that minus three,

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.990
zero, is outside that.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.450
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.540
&gt;&gt; So, it can't be, it can't be something you can achieve.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.012
&gt;&gt; Right, there's no way to make this minus

00:01:24.012 --> 00:01:26.710
three, zero, certainly not by choosing any of these

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.200
points, but also no combi, no convex combination, no

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.430
probabilistic combination of them, is going to do that either.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.890
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.820
&gt;&gt; So, this one is just right out.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.900
&gt;&gt; Right, so that leaves minus four minus four, and it

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.260
seems pretty. That's inside the convex hull, so there is some

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.470
combination of them that would work.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.416
&gt;&gt; That's right. Any, any sense of what it would be?

00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:50.800
&gt;&gt; 2 3rds, I think 2 3rds D,D 1 3rd

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.199
C,C. And I get that by noticing that D,D is minus

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:57.709
six, minus six, and C,C is minus one minus one, and

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.327
four minus four is two thirds of the way between there.

00:02:01.327 --> 00:02:04.430
&gt;&gt; Boom. Cool. Alright, so you're good with that?

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.590
&gt;&gt; I'm good with that if you're good with that. It's your quiz.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.677
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm excited.

00:02:07.677 --> 00:02:08.025
&gt;&gt; Oh good.

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:09.985
&gt;&gt; So those, it's this, this, the minus one

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:11.947
minus one and the minus four minus four are,

00:02:11.947 --> 00:02:13.484
as as you pointed out there is a more

00:02:13.484 --> 00:02:16.442
general result here. Having to do with the convex hull.

00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:17.269
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.765
&gt;&gt; Alright, so through the magic of computer graphics, I have a

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:21.637
slightly better depiction of this particular

00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:23.756
region now. As you pointed out this,

00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:27.428
this convex hull of the points is really important and what it

00:02:27.428 --> 00:02:31.892
represents is the, we can call it the feasible region, these are average

00:02:31.892 --> 00:02:35.132
payoffs of some joint strategy they, they may have to

00:02:35.132 --> 00:02:39.150
collude to do this. And they may not be particularly happy

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.710
to do that. [LAUGH]. But the fact of the matter is,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.570
they can achieve, by working together, payoffs anywhere inside this region.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.190
&gt;&gt; Huh, so that's what my student Liam

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.820
always meant when he talked about feasible regions.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.350
&gt;&gt; Maybe so, I mean it could be that he meant any number of

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.180
other things like places he's willing to live when he goes to get a job.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.050
&gt;&gt; No, it was all game

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.120
theory stuff, I just never knew what he was

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.580
talking about, but now I do Michael, thanks to you.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.490
&gt;&gt; Sure, hey I'm, I'm happy to help. So

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.380
this is a really useful kind of geometric way

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.530
of picturing something that would otherwise be a little

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.460
bit harder to see, I think in the matrix form.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.220
&gt;&gt; Sure.
