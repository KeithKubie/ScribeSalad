00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.530
MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon and welcome to

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.660
Talks at Google in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.880
Today it's my enormous pleasure
to introduce my former state

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.300
representative and former
Congressman, Barney Frank.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.020
He joins us today to
discuss his memoir, "Frank:

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.750
A Life in Politics
from the Great Society

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.720
to Same Sex Marriage."

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.610
Confession, I'm
completely starstruck.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.640
Barney has been a
hero of mine since I

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.390
moved to Boston in 1973--
Beacon Hill state rep.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.410
And I spent a long time working
on this introduction that

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.350
would do justice to the man and
the great book he has written,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.004
but it was getting
completely out of hand.

00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:00.670
And Barney will be
the first to tell you

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.470
he's not a person with
a whole lot of patience.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.930
So we're just going to cut
through anything else I would

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.970
have said and let me just
welcome one of Massachusetts's

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.830
most astute and effective
politicians, a great fighter

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.350
for people who can't always
fight their own fights,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.781
former Congressman,
Barney Frank.

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:24.643
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:25.074 --> 00:01:26.074
BARNEY FRANK: Thank you.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.450
Thank you.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.650
I'm very happy to
have a chance to talk.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.790
I will talk some.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.050
I don't know how you open up
these bottles without squeezing

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.970
them and getting the water out.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.210
Any awe is reciprocal
because I am not

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.470
naturally good with things.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.710
I have been in a lifelong
war with inanimate objects

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.820
and have mostly lost-- things
like opening a water bottle.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.430
I have had three relationships
with men in my life.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.097
The current one is, of course,
the most meaningful by far.

00:02:13.097 --> 00:02:15.180
And they were all very
different in a lot of ways,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.040
but I can hear each of
them in my head saying

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.420
in exactly the same
tone of voice, Barney,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.560
don't touch that
because I will break it.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.320
I will say that when it came
time for 32 years in Congress

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.620
I had a large
staff, and so I was

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.180
able to take full advantage
of the improvements

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.530
in communications without
myself personally doing them.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.370
And I now have one
assistant, Courtney,

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.875
who does the work for
about 30 people very well.

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:54.140
But I was not using
computers myself very much,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.545
so when I sat down to write
the book I started to do it

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:02.600
and I kept hitting combinations
of keys not intended

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.520
by anybody whoever made one.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.240
And, finally, my husband
was in a Walgreens

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.300
and saw an outsized yellow,
plastic keyboard, which could

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.800
be plugged into my computer.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.340
And that made it possible
for me to write the book,

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.290
with one exception.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.970
There was a key right
next to the spacebar

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.240
that I kept hitting that
kept shutting me down.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:32.110
And he is very handy, and he
applied a little high tech

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.950
solution.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.910
He pried the head
of the key off.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.680
So now I get a sharp pain
in my finger that says,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.550
don't do that.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.230
But at any rate, I am very happy
to be here and a great admirer

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.360
of the company.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.830
I'm going to talk some and
then open it up for questions.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.530
The frame of the book kind
of suggested itself to me.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.420
Jonathan mentioned, he moved
into Beacon Hill in 1973.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.700
That was the year after
I had been elected

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.670
to the state legislature.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.389
My first year in the
legislature was the year.

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.180
One of things that is
sort of serendipitous

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.740
about my career from the
standpoint of LGBT issues

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.895
is that it is virtually
coterminous with the movement

00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:15.160
for LGBT rights.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.220
Not because of everything I did,
it's just given when I was born

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.130
and when I got involved.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.730
I was just starting my
career when Stonewall hit.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.792
And there really is
no social movement

00:04:26.792 --> 00:04:28.500
in the history of this
country, and maybe

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.206
in any other, which has so
clear a delineation point.

00:04:32.206 --> 00:04:33.580
I mean, I can tell
you, because I

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.330
was working for the
major of Boston,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.470
I was in charge of, among
other things, liberal causes.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.800
And as a closeted
gay man, I was kind

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.140
of hoping I would meet other
gay men through my advocacy.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.800
And I can tell you, there
was no gay political activity

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.930
going on in Boston in
1968, '69, and '70.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.150
It just wasn't there.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.010
Actually, the first gay
pride parade was in '71.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.230
I rode in the second one in '72.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:07.540
But I had just started
and when I started out

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.280
I got involved in
politics because I

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.200
had a view of how I would
like to change society

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.330
in the direction of fairer
treatment for people, less

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.430
discrimination, more
personal freedom, less

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.980
economic inequality within
the market framework.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.640
And I was worried
that that was not

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.740
going to work very well because
I was what we then universally

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.270
called a homosexual.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.660
And there was
obviously a conflict

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.000
between being someone
so unpopular--

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.720
I realized I was
gay when I was 13

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.980
and I was just devastated by it.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.130
I thought about that when I read
about this incredibly stupid

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.820
comment by Ben Carson.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.300
And as a point
there, intelligence

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.660
is segmented in my view.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.380
People can be absolutely
brilliant about somethings

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.980
and be a moron about others.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.460
Ben Carson apparently is able
to separate conjoined twins

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.460
and a miraculous kind
of thing, and then

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.500
announces that he believes
being gay is a choice.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.780
And my response was, yes, at
13 I was a typical teenager who

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.870
couldn't wait to be
a member of the most

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.100
unpopular minority around.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.790
Every teenager's dream is to be
despised by all of your peers.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.780
I later learned that
Carson said that that

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.020
was because people
who go to prison

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.780
sometimes engage in gay sex.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.090
Well, the notion that being
in a maximum security prison

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.330
is any kind of a choice
in the first place,

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.260
it should have given a clue
to him that this was not

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.336
fully voluntary.

00:06:48.336 --> 00:06:54.430
At any rate, I thought I could
never get very influential

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.650
and never get a high
position in government.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.590
As the years went
on-- this is 1967,

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.880
when I first got a job--
there's an interesting shift,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.770
they're not related,
but the prejudice based

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.450
on sexual orientation
and even lately I'm

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.470
very happy to see
gender identity

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.050
diminishes substantially,
but respect for government

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.260
also diminishes substantially.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.050
So by the end, I
thought I would never

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.900
be able to have a
great impact on society

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.370
because I could never be
influential in government.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.140
It reached a point
where I was able to be

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.020
influential in
government, but government

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.910
wasn't influential in society.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:40.169
And as I said,
people have said, did

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:42.710
you ever think that you could
be married while you were still

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.770
in Congress to another man.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.320
And wouldn't that have
been very controversial.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.030
And I said, yes, if
you'd asked me even

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.550
in 2004, which was the year that
we first began to have marriage

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.620
here, if I could get
married while still

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.040
a member of Congress, it
would have been very, very

00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.760
controversial.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.270
And in the end,
Jim and I did marry

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.250
in my last year in
Congress and it did

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.580
generate a lot of controversy.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.730
There was space limitations
and a number of my colleagues

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.520
were very angry that
I didn't invite them.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.050
Although I have to say
there is a partisan aspect,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.840
I came back to my
office one day and there

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.690
was a very attractive
piece of pottery

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.050
from a member of Congress
as a wedding present

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.130
who had not been invited.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.450
And she was a Republican and
one of the more reasonable ones.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.334
But she had voted for the
Defense of Marriage Act.

00:08:34.334 --> 00:08:38.070
Had voted in fact, even worse,
for a constitutional amendment

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.770
that would have
invalidated-- not only

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.190
prevented future
marriages, but invalidated

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.400
marriages that already existed.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.932
So I brought the present back.

00:08:46.932 --> 00:08:47.640
She wasn't there.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.670
I left it there.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.460
And she called me
somewhat puzzled.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.180
Was there something the matter?

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.800
And I said, yeah, how
can I accept a present

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.040
from you celebrating an event
that you tried to wipe out?

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:00.840
And I was struck.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.110
She said, yeah.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.450
I was a coward.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.260
And she retired from Congress.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:11.190
I think she was an example of
a disturbing trend, not she,

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:15.010
but the reasons behind it
that is the rightward movement

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:20.585
of the Republican Party, which
a reasonable conservative like

00:09:20.585 --> 00:09:23.430
her could not tolerate
so she had to quit.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.860
But at any rate, the government
became less and less popular.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:34.150
I'm very happy that we
got increased acceptance.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.070
Acceptance actually
is two weak of a word.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.630
We got an absence
of the prejudice.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:44.270
I think the reason for the
defeat of the prejudice

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.460
is very simple.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.280
We stopped hiding.

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:52.580
The prejudice is
literally ignorance.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.147
And there were two
factors as millions of us

00:09:56.147 --> 00:09:57.480
became honest about who we were.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.190
A little about terminology.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.320
In the '70s, '80s, I think
until fairly recently,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.470
when we would be
honest about who

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.000
we were, there would
be well meaning,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.090
non-bigoted people, but still
a little uneasy, and they would

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:20.120
say, look, I'm happy that you're
happy being gay or lesbian,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.130
but why do you have
to discuss it so much?

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:27.930
Can't you just be one
without telling everybody?

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.740
And finally I
pointed out to them

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.830
that this notion that
we were gay and lesbian

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:37.230
discussed our sexuality more
than others was simply wrong.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.720
I pointed out that
straight people

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.930
talk about their sexuality every
bit as much as gay people do.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.780
The difference is when we do
it it's called coming out,

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.712
when they do it
it's called talking.

00:10:49.712 --> 00:10:51.170
You know, nobody
goes through a day

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:57.160
without referring to a partner,
girlfriend, husband, et cetera.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.250
At any rate, I think
that's clearly it.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.400
First of all, by our being
honest who we were we

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.570
destroyed the stereotype.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.820
We were not any
particular person.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:10.400
I also think there's something
about a prejudice which

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.530
is so little based
on reality that you

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.030
have to be told whom you
are supposed to apply it to.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.665
I mean if you have thought
that these are terrible people

00:11:19.665 --> 00:11:21.540
and then you find out
that a number of people

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.240
who you previously admired
are those terrible people,

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.210
that kind of causes
some mental concern.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.799
How bad could it be
if I couldn't tell?

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:32.465
It's also the case
that people found out

00:11:32.465 --> 00:11:35.410
that a lot of people close
to them were gay and lesbian.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.080
So that prejudice
ultimately went away.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.090
And it's an interesting
political thing.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:46.390
As late as 2004, George
Bush used this as a weapon

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.330
against the Democrats.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:52.144
In fact, John Kerry--
very supportive--

00:11:52.144 --> 00:11:53.060
had to worry about it.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.595
In fact, I accompanied
John Kerry--

00:11:54.595 --> 00:11:55.970
I talked about
this in the book--

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.620
to a meeting of gay
people in Washington

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.360
at a human rights campaign.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.790
And he said, well, how do
I explain my opposition

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.030
to same sex marriage?

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.240
And I said, my recommendation
is that you don't explain.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.050
You just say you're against it.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.300
He said, well, if I
just say that they're

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.920
going to think it's just
for political reasons.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.690
And I said, that's
what you hope.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.160
And, think about
it, if someone has

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:28.800
taken a position you dislike,
I mean not judging him morally,

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.810
but in terms of your
own self interest,

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.850
wouldn't it be better if it
was an expedient one rather

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.490
than one more deeply held?

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.340
Because if it was deeply
held and sincerely

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.320
meant you have a hard
time changing it.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.220
But if it was expedient
you can work on it.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.970
And I said, look, in my
experience-- he said, well,

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.650
how can you not explain it.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.140
I told him, I had an
incident once that

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.030
was a debate about
whether or not to seat

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.925
a Democrat versus a Republican
at a contested election

00:12:55.925 --> 00:12:57.685
in Indiana.

00:12:57.685 --> 00:12:59.560
And I liked the democrat,
but it seemed to me

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.090
as you looked at it, there was
no way to tell who had won.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.170
It was very close.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.250
Some of the ballots
were indecipherable.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.130
So I voted not to
seat the democratic.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.270
Tip O'Neill was
then the speaker.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.410
A wonderful man,
but a deep partisan,

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.120
as he should have
been the speaker.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.284
And I voted against
it and somebody said,

00:13:20.284 --> 00:13:21.450
how did the speaker respond.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:26.120
I said, well, he was
mad at me for not voting

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.070
to seat the Democrat
until I clearly

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:35.230
explained to him my reasons at
which point he became furious.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.950
When you have
disagreed with someone

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.400
you almost always make it
worse by telling them why.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.830
You are explaining to
them why they were wrong.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:44.950
So in my experience, if
you're going to have to do

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.100
disagree with
people don't say it.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.930
And Kerry said, well OK, but
how would I explain myself then

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.210
to the people who
are against marriage?

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.130
What do I say to them?

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.680
I said, I think in the
history of the world,

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.280
no one has ever
demanded that anybody

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.630
explain why he agrees with him.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.139
Has anybody ever said,
I agree with you.

00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:04.930
Well, I need to know
why you agree with me.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.500
It doesn't happen.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.070
But at any rate, that was 2004.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.630
By the last election,
2014, Republicans

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.040
were trying desperately
not to argue the case.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:20.730
Best example-- federal
courts in Pennsylvania

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.490
ruled that the Pennsylvania
rules against same sex marriage

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.860
are unconstitutional.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.610
The Republican governor
of Pennsylvania

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.574
then announces that he will
not appeal the decision

00:14:30.574 --> 00:14:32.990
because he's up for reelection
and he doesn't want to have

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.370
to defend that position.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.350
I mean, it has entirely
flipped as a wedge issue.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:38.650
So that one I'm happy about.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.697
We still have to get
legislation passed.

00:14:40.697 --> 00:14:42.280
And there was a
problem as recently as

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.820
a few years ago on
the transgender issue

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.720
and that is now resolved.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:54.680
When I first started introducing
gay rights legislation in 1972,

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.360
it wasn't just entirely
a rational objection.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.350
There was what I call
the blech factor.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.000
A lot of straight men in
particular, the notion of two

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.510
guys having sex troubled them.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.540
For some reason, for a lot
of straight men, as you know,

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.270
the notion of two women
having sex kind of a turn on,

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.670
but two guys-- no.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.320
At any rate, we wore that down.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.970
In 2007 when we tried to
get transgender inclusion

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.864
and anti-discrimination
bill, I realized

00:15:22.864 --> 00:15:24.280
I was running to
that same factor.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.020
That was too new.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.150
That was too
troubling to people.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:31.332
And it's a sign of how
things have gotten better.

00:15:31.332 --> 00:15:33.890
The transgender community
themselves and others,

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.790
we've been able to kind of
get rid of that ick factor

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.060
in that situation in
a much shorter period.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.880
So we're now ready to do
this, but here's the deal--

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.620
there will be no further
legislative advance

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.107
for LGBT people
until in an election

00:15:49.107 --> 00:15:51.190
you get a Democratic House,
Senate, and President.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.170
And one of the things about
respectable opinion today

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.640
is that because of the
excessive partisanship that's

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.000
been engaged in by
some people, there's

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.350
been an overreaction that
condemns all partisanship.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:10.040
In fact, you cannot have and
never have had a functioning

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.730
democratic society
without political parties.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.960
Absent political parties,
absent some groupings

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.010
of people based on
general common views then

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.390
it's pure personality.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:24.000
I mean, the people who wrote
the Constitution, the Founding

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.240
Fathers, had two attitudes
towards parties--

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.960
they hated them and
they formed them.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.880
They said they were
terrible ideas.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.190
Factioned, they called it.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.930
And they were busy
forming parties.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:43.270
And they took it seriously
enough so Alexander Hamilton

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.280
was shot by Aaron Burr.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.590
That was an example
of how seriously they

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.080
took party differences.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.720
Parties are irrelevant.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.290
And the fact is that while
the Republicans are not

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:57.140
any longer actively
going after LGBT people,

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.639
because they understand
that that's not

00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:01.180
a good thing with
the general public,

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.020
particularly with
younger people,

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.569
they are also committed to
never doing anything positive.

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:09.940
So when we get to
questions, the question

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.569
is what's the future
for LGBT rights?

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:15.800
It depends entirely
on the party in power.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.940
And if the Democrats, again,
get the Presidency, House,

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.540
and the Senate,
problems with that

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.290
with the House
redistricting, you'll

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.359
see a national bill adopted.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.770
The tougher part for me,
because that's the good news,

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.516
is what do you do
about government?

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:34.820
In my view, a healthy
society consists

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.296
of a very active
private sector, which

00:17:37.296 --> 00:17:38.420
is a way you create wealth.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.950
And I believe in
the market system.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:44.740
And a public sector
which has three purposes.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.950
One, it's to set down rules
for the private sector.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:52.890
It's to contain
private sector activity

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.890
within certain kind of bounds.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:58.210
Absent that, competition
has a negative effect.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.270
This is one example.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.580
During the financial crisis,
people asked some of the people

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.992
in the financial community,
why are you doing this?

00:18:06.992 --> 00:18:08.200
And the answer was, I got to.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.900
My competition is doing it.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.130
I asked the head of Citicorp,
Chuck Prince, at one point

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:21.300
why he was doing a certain
maneuver with his balance sheet

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.490
and why he wouldn't be
more honest about the debts

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.390
of the company.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.190
He said, because if I put all
these on my balance sheet,

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.840
Goldman Sachs will beat the
hell out of me in the market.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:35.790
So you need some rules to
constrain abuses and check

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.862
people from taking
undue advantage.

00:18:37.862 --> 00:18:39.570
There are some things
you need government

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:44.250
for that no private sector
is going to do because

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.480
of the externalities of it.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.710
The benefits are for everybody.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.300
That's particularly true
in environmental areas.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.770
And then finally unless
you believe in the extreme,

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.840
I think, of the Ayn
Rand philosophy,

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.960
you want to provide some
minimum level of decent comfort

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.300
for people who aren't going
to make it on their own.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.440
Obviously you need inequality
or a capitalist system

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.760
doesn't work.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.770
And people who work hard deserve
more than people who don't.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.250
People who are talented are
going to get more than people

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.000
who don't.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.700
But I think we're not prepared
to let people totally just

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.410
starve to death.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:26.840
And so that's part of what you
do through the public sector.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.780
Throughout our history and
in most other democracies--

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:35.010
stable, capitalist
democracies-- there's

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.670
a tendency to have two parties.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.840
Sometimes they're in
three or four groupings.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.150
But there's a kind of
a more liberal side

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:43.850
and a more conservative side.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.240
Both sides understand
that you need both.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.800
You need a good private sector
and a good public sector.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.250
And the competition is
where you draw the line.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:52.830
In America, the
Republicans would

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:56.870
be pushing the public sector
back some, giving more freedom

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.210
to the private sector.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.640
Democrats, the opposite.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.750
But in each case,
until recently,

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:05.850
people have recognized
the importance of both.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.510
The unusual thing
about American politics

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.750
today is that the Republican
Party to a great extent

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.680
through the Tea Party
is heavily influenced

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.195
by-- and in the House it has
been controlled by-- people

00:20:17.195 --> 00:20:18.590
who disagree with that.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.590
They do not see any great
value in the public sector.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:25.050
And that is the cause
of the breakdown.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.329
People say, what ever
happened to bipartisanship?

00:20:28.329 --> 00:20:29.870
Well, what happened
to it is factual.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.970
It's Barack Obama got elected
and the Republicans said no.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:38.410
When the Bush administration
in the fall of 2008

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:41.260
came to the Democrats and said,
the economy is falling apart,

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.850
we need you to do some
things to help us, we did.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.260
We voted for the TARP, which
will clearly go down in history

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.650
as the most highly successful,
wildly unpopular thing

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.650
the government ever did.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:54.520
And we knew it was
going to be unpopular.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.760
When AIG comes in--
By the way, AIG

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.840
came into the Bush
administration and said,

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.740
we need $85 billion to
cover the commitments

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.640
we made for something called
credit default swaps--

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.020
insurance against
securities-- because we

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.129
don't have the money.

00:21:12.129 --> 00:21:14.170
It turns out they not only
didn't have the money,

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.780
they had no idea
how much they owed.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.040
Because a few days later when
the Bush administration told us

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.850
that they were going
to need $700 billion

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:26.710
to lend to cover debt,
and they were showing

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.230
at how they arrived
at the figure,

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:32.040
and they said and $85 billion
for AIG, somebody said,

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.590
no, no, you already
told us that.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.550
We were paying attention.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.070
And their answer
was, no, no, this

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.260
is an additional $85 billion.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.270
AIG not only couldn't
cover its debts,

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.440
it had no idea how much it owed.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.330
A side, by the way,
is that the founder

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.900
of AIG, Maurice
Greenberg-- known

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.560
as Hank after the
baseball player--

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.070
is now suing the federal
government on the grounds

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.720
that he was not treated fairly
when the federal government

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.640
came up with the $180
billion it ultimately

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.960
was to cover the debts that
his company had incurred.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.730
I have characterized
that as the arsonist

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:09.170
suing the fire department for
water damage to his property.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.600
But that's the
dilemma we have now.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:19.260
My frustration is this--
we have this generally

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.243
acknowledged fact right
now, whether or not

00:22:21.243 --> 00:22:24.170
you think it's a problem
varies ideologically--

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:28.630
as the country's getting
richer, the distribution

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.230
is very unequal.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:34.930
And an overwhelming percentage
of the additional wealth

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.260
is going to a very
small number of people.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.580
And the great bulk of the
population is kind of just

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.130
held even.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:47.500
I believe that's the explanation
and I'll wrap up with this

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.563
and throw it open.

00:22:48.563 --> 00:22:50.470
The dilemma the
Democrats have faced--

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.930
the question is, from
our standpoint, we

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.860
are doing things that are in
the interest of working people.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.860
Why is it that white, working
class and middle class

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.680
men don't vote for us?

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.430
As I note in the
book, the only group

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:08.560
of white men who vote in the
majority democratic these days

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.220
are gays and Jews.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.140
Any other demographic
group votes no.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.510
Now, there are enough women,
and African Americans,

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:18.860
and Hispanics, Asians.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.600
Asians, interestingly, had
originally many of them

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.380
voted Republican, but
the anti-immigrant sense,

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.060
ever since Bill Clinton, they've
been in the majority Democrat

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.559
with the exception
of the Vietnamese

00:23:29.559 --> 00:23:30.770
for historical reasons.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:38.420
But the question is, why do
people who earlier would have

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.660
voted for Franklin Roosevelt,
Harry Truman, Johnson, Kennedy,

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:45.520
why do they now vote
for union busters

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:50.570
or for people who are
against the kind of things

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:52.500
that would be good for them?

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.080
There was an
initial view that it

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.030
was because they were angry
over the social issues.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.530
It was God, guns, and gays.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:00.960
Guns are a part of it
but I think that analysis

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.240
is basically wrong.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.710
I wasn't sure of it
at the time but I've

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.710
become convinced that it is.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.850
For people who think
that the reason we don't

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:12.080
get these white
working class votes

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.630
is their opposition
to social issues,

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.280
how do you explain the fact
that same sex marriage is now

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.030
overwhelmingly popular,
including with many of them?

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.120
I think it's the economy.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.100
It's what James Carville said
in '92 during the Clinton

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.720
campaign, it's the
economy, stupid.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.290
Here's what's happened--
from 1945 to 1975,

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.060
America ruled the
world economically

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.730
as a result of World War II.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.680
Actually it even began in 1940.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.870
Every developed
economy in the world

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.450
was devastated by
World War II except us.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.460
Ours grew because
we were the place.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.500
We were physically
undamaged and we

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.380
had this enormous production.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.340
And until the mid '70s, if you
were a white man not subject

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.740
to racism or gender
prejudice and you

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.820
were willing to
work, you didn't have

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.030
to have a high degree
of specialized skill,

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.540
you didn't have to have a
college education or even

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.642
high school education, you
could go into a factory

00:25:04.642 --> 00:25:06.100
and make a very
good living as long

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.440
as you were willing to work.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.100
And that was in
fact the exception,

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.497
but people took it as the norm.

00:25:12.497 --> 00:25:14.330
Beginning in the '70s,
the rest of the world

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.010
was catching up to America.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.870
And now increasingly it
wasn't possible for America

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:19.950
to make everything.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.740
And Americans working in basic
commodities and manufacturing

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.590
were losing out
to other countries

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.050
where people could
work more cheaply.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:30.980
The result is, and
frankly what's happened

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.670
is we're in a place
where it's the case,

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.640
increasingly America's
comparative edge

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.210
over the rest of the
world was in the high end

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:42.780
area in high technology
and intellectual property.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.090
And we've done very well there.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:49.740
So we have a situation
where working class

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:54.870
men are angry that their
relative economic position has

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.490
eroded.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.600
And that's led them
to be anti-government.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.440
I do not believe that these are
people who are philosophically

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.106
anti-government.

00:26:02.106 --> 00:26:03.750
I think the paradox
is that they're too

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.970
pro-government in some ways.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:08.450
That is that they are convinced
that if the people running

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.500
the government, particularly
the Democrats who

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.390
are the party of government,
really cared about them,

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:15.430
we would have done
more to respond

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.110
to their economic
situation, which leads us

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.140
into a vicious
cycle because they

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.140
get angry at the Democrats who
they say, oh, you're too busy.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.180
And here's where the
other issues come in.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.270
Their view is that we only care
about women and blacks and gays

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.430
and we're neglecting them.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.080
It's not that they're
objectively against them

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.330
in the first place, but
they're like jealous siblings.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.020
And so their frustration
is that the government

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:43.120
hasn't done enough to respond
to their economic plight.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.620
And so then they
vote for people who

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.860
will make it less likely
the government will do that.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.380
And then they make
it even less likely.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.960
And you get this
anti-government vicious cycle.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.120
I believe if we had the
resources to improve

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.876
government's performance--
put more people

00:26:58.876 --> 00:27:00.500
to work in the
construction area fixing

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.830
our infrastructure,
good economically

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:08.460
as well as in terms of serving
the [INAUDIBLE] economy--

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.660
to return to the point
where a kid could

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.030
graduate from high school from
a lower working class family

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:17.480
and go to the State University
without going deeply in hock.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.300
Return to the
situation where states

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.330
subsidize higher education.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.550
Pick up some of the healthcare
cost that they need.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.610
There are a lot of things we can
do but most of them cost money.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.430
And the vicious cycle is
we don't have the money

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:33.800
to do these things.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.732
So my solution is two things--
people say, how do you have

00:27:36.732 --> 00:27:37.940
a strong faith in government?

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.240
Well, it's beyond faith.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.440
It's reality.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.010
The only way for
us to do this is

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.130
to do what I would like to
anyway-- promulgate programs

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:47.500
within the market structure.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.130
No way interfering with our
ability and our capacity

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.900
to run a very effective
capitalist system.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:58.242
But provide programs that
reduce this inequality.

00:27:58.242 --> 00:27:59.866
And then the question
is, OK, but where

00:27:59.866 --> 00:28:01.157
are you going to get the money?

00:28:01.157 --> 00:28:03.510
We can't even raise
gasoline taxes now

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.850
to fix the roads because the
current Republican Party thinks

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.030
Dwight Eisenhower was a
dangerous radical when

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.060
he promulgated this
interstate highway program.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.610
So I have two
proposals in the books.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:15.910
First of all, I think
it is time substantially

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:19.310
to reduce America's
military budget.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.520
We are the strongest
nation in the world.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.590
But we are the strongest
nation in the world

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.740
by an excessive margin.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.220
I think it is a good
thing that the largest Air

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.890
Force in the world
is the US Air Force.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:32.840
I do not think it
has to be the case

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.910
that the second largest
Air Force in the world

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:37.600
is the US Navy,
which is the case.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.740
Now, since it seems
to be unlikely

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.270
that the Navy and the
Air Force will go to war,

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:47.110
we could probably
reduce their total.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:48.820
And I know there are
bad guys out there.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.990
I don't like the terrorists.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:51.670
I cheer when they're killed.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:54.530
But nuclear submarines
don't stop terrorism.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:55.790
If they did, it would be over.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:56.890
They don't have any.

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:59.600
I mean, here's what I
think happened to us.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.810
Briefly.

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:04.550
Before 1940, America had
a very small military

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.860
because we had the best defense
in the world, two of them--

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.400
the Atlantic Ocean
and the Pacific Ocean.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.950
And given the technology
then, that was pretty safe.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:15.500
Pearl Harbor made
us sort of nervous.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.610
But even that was
way out in the ocean.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.880
And then we built
up because Hitler

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.860
was an existential
threat to our society.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:26.770
And when Hitler was
through, Joseph Stalin--

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:31.340
a terrible, vicious gangster--
has the Soviet Union.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:34.320
And for many years they are
a threat to our existence.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.490
Although I think
that began to wane.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:40.640
When the Soviet Union
collapses in 1990,

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.020
for the first time
since Hitler, there

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.031
is no threat to America's
existence as a free society.

00:29:47.031 --> 00:29:49.030
There are bad guy's that
are going to harass us,

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.670
but literally our
existence is not in doubt.

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.610
And so George H.W. Bush
and then Bill Clinton

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:58.220
began substantially
reducing the military.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.710
And that's where 2001 comes in.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:05.110
We are then attacked
by the terrorists.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.860
Americans murdered.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:10.390
A terrible thing, but not a
threat to our existence as

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.980
a society.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.470
What you get are people
in the Bush administration

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:19.510
who philosophically believe
that it is Americas role

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.990
to be the world's leader.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:23.550
They believe that it is
America's moral obligation

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.190
to enforce order in the world.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.275
They have been frustrated
by their inability

00:30:27.275 --> 00:30:28.900
to sell that to the
American people who

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.280
don't feel threatened.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.740
So there was a successful effort
to build the terrorists up

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.160
to the level of
threat represented

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.110
by the communists and the Nazis.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:42.640
They are morally no better than
Joseph Stalin or Adolf Hitler,

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.730
but fortunately they
don't have one hundredth

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:46.590
of the devastation power.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.280
The fact is that, yeah, we
need to fight terrorists,

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.410
but it is a different order
of magnitude of fight compared

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:53.850
to what we had to do before.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.760
And we have been persuaded
that's not the case.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.700
Instead what we have is
massive American intervention.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.210
I mentioned the Air Force.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.920
Here's what we're up against.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.750
In the Wednesday Wall
Street Journal the day

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:11.170
after the election in 2012, two
guys in the Bush administration

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:12.980
wrote an article saying,
we're very worried

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.010
now that Obama's
won because he's not

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.350
going to expand the Air
Force the way we need to.

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.970
And they say, now, it is
true that no American has

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:24.050
been killed by enemy
air power since 1953.

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:25.770
This is 2012.

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:28.740
And it is also true
that American air power

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.740
has dominated every battlefield
entirely since then.

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.310
And they go on to say but
because of this, some people

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:40.430
don't realize that we need
to expand the Air Force.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.360
And they say we need
to be able to respond

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.154
anywhere, anytime, anyplace.

00:31:44.154 --> 00:31:45.570
There were two
objections to that.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.040
One, it's enormously expensive.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.051
Two, it's not workable
because they want

00:31:49.051 --> 00:31:50.300
to do it through the military.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.720
I wish we could make people
in Iraq get along better.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.490
I wish we could get shiite
and sunni to cooperate.

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:58.980
I wish we could diminish
corruption in Afghanistan.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:03.650
I wish we could bring about
a coherent society in Yemen

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:05.510
or Lybia.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:06.102
We can't.

00:32:06.102 --> 00:32:08.060
And we certainly can't
do it with the military.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.309
We have the best military
in the history of the world.

00:32:10.309 --> 00:32:12.470
They can do very well
what a military can do.

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.700
They can stop bad
things from happening.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.250
But militaries can't
make good things happen.

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:19.280
So I believe we
could substantially

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.350
reduce the military by $100
billion a year, in no way

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:25.450
endanger our safety, nor
diminish our capacity

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:27.530
to intervene when it
will do some good.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:30.090
The other area, and I'll
make this one quick,

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.590
how do you get money for the
states and cities to do things?

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:33.770
Very simple.

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:35.900
You stop putting people
in prison because

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.880
of the use of recreational
drugs that they don't otherwise

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.780
hurt people.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.635
The War on Drugs has been
a much bigger failure

00:32:42.635 --> 00:32:43.767
than anything else.

00:32:43.767 --> 00:32:45.350
And it can't be done
more efficiently.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:48.030
People say, well, we just
got to run this better.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.040
I mean, why should it
cost more to send someone

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.890
to prison than to send them
to the State University?

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.150
Very simple answer.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.250
Very few people try to escape
from the State University.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.000
I mean, that costs them money.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.146
So and I think the American
people are ready for both.

00:33:02.146 --> 00:33:03.520
I think the American
people, they

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.470
don't want to send troops back
into Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:08.470
They don't want to lock
people up for marijuana.

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.670
I mean, you know one of the
great hypocrisies in America

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:11.170
today?

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:13.350
Cocaine.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:17.060
Many people know that there
are a lot of high functioning

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:22.460
people in various places in this
society who are cocaine users.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.750
But if they come in the wrong
social class they go to jail.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.616
It's part of the racial problem.

00:33:27.616 --> 00:33:29.240
There was a statistic
in New York City,

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:33.590
86% of the arrests for marijuana
use were black and Hispanic.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:35.660
And you people have
been in Manhattan.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.130
Do you really think that
86% of the marijuana users

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:39.500
are black and Hispanic?

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.030
It must mean that
your white friends are

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:44.840
an unusually high
percentage of users,

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.590
because you know they do.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.020
So that's my solution.

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:51.705
I am pretty satisfied with
our progress in LGBT rights.

00:33:51.705 --> 00:33:53.580
I want to reverse this
anti-government trend.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.420
I think it's bad for us.

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.210
It's bad for dealing
with climate change.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.560
It's bad for enhancing
the quality of life.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.500
I think the private
sector is very important,

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.958
but there are some
things important

00:34:01.958 --> 00:34:04.090
to our quality of life
that the private sector

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:05.290
isn't supposed to do.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:07.150
And we have to
pool our resources.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:08.880
And there's this obstacle.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.232
So my mission for
the next few years

00:34:12.232 --> 00:34:13.690
that I have a chance
to do anything

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:15.908
is to argue for reduced
military spending--

00:34:15.908 --> 00:34:17.949
and you can't reduce
military spending unless you

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:19.000
reduce the objectives.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.050
You can't just make
it more efficient.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:22.860
That's wishful thinking.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.159
And to take criminal penalties--
the principle I would have

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:31.070
is this-- it should not be
illegal to ingest any substance

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:34.134
unless that substance is
going to clearly cause you

00:34:34.134 --> 00:34:36.050
the kind of long term
harm that the rest of us

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:37.674
are going to have to
pay for medically,

00:34:37.674 --> 00:34:43.330
or if it makes you
likelier hurt other people.

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:46.540
Taking heroin doesn't make
you a violent criminal,

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.659
trying to get the money
to take heroin does.

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:49.944
And so we can deal with that.

00:34:49.944 --> 00:34:51.110
And so that's the principle.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.600
You outlaw only those
substances which

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.020
make people more likely
to be a social menace.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.980
You can't apply that
principle entirely

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.380
because it's too late
to ban alcohol again,

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.530
which is clearly the
substance that makes people

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:06.110
the most dangerous to others.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:08.800
But there's no reason
to ban these others.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.040
I believe if we could free
up that money we could

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.415
do a lot of things that would
improve the quality of life

00:35:13.415 --> 00:35:14.980
in this society,
diminish inequality

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.800
without in any way hurting
our productive capacity,

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.380
and we'd all live less
unhappily ever after.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.712
I'll take questions
at this point.

00:35:24.712 --> 00:35:26.648
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:30.104 --> 00:35:31.520
AUDIENCE: How do
you guys balance,

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.110
or how did you
balance-- it seems like,

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:36.400
so small businesses are
the engine of our economy.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.110
They're the biggest employers
of people in this country.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:43.650
But as you guys
balanced that need

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:45.065
to regulate-- so
one thing that's

00:35:45.065 --> 00:35:46.690
kind of popping into
mind, for example,

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:47.700
would be Sarbanes-Oxley.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.616
We did it because of
Enron and all those guys.

00:35:49.616 --> 00:35:51.900
But the burden for
that regulation

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.560
really fell on the
smaller companies

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:57.300
who just kind of couldn't afford
to do that in a meaningful way.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.300
So how did you guys go--

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:04.320
BARNEY FRANK: Well, in my
area, we used a $10 billion

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.940
asset figure for banks.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.100
And, for example, the
Consumer Financial Protection

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:14.310
Bureau [INAUDIBLE] bank job,
which I'm very proud of,

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:17.130
they send out bank examiners
to see if the banks are

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:18.450
doing the right thing.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:21.960
But we exempted banks that have
less than $10 billion in assets

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.920
from being examined by them
because that takes up time.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.540
And I know some of
the community banks

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.122
object to the regulations.

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:33.080
I tell you, part of the
problem is the lawyers.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.740
And I've said to some
community banks, well,

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:35.630
what's your problem?

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.700
Well, we have to spend
a lot of money complying

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:38.720
with the Volcker Rule.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.300
The Volcker Rule applies to
JP Morgan, Chase, and Bank

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.040
of America.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.780
It has to do with very complex,
derivative transactions, which

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.380
these smaller banks don't do.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.190
Oh, but my lawyer said
I got to make sure

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.490
that I demonstrate this.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:53.270
So I complained to some
lawyers, and they said, well,

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:54.603
we're worried about malpractice.

00:36:54.603 --> 00:36:57.840
I do favor writing into
the financial formula

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.197
some explicit exemptions.

00:36:59.197 --> 00:37:00.780
There are things
that we never thought

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.850
were going to effect
the small banks,

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:05.350
but lawyers make them nervous.

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:10.110
So I think we could do
more in that regard.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:12.560
And with Sarbanes-Oxley,
over the last few years--

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.520
that's the bill that deals
with accounting practices--

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.770
and it cam because of Enron
and other great scandals.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:19.186
And it didn't come
out of the air.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.650
The level at which you have
to kick in now in terms

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:29.202
of your capitalization is up
to, I don't know, $500 million

00:37:29.202 --> 00:37:30.160
or something like that.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.270
And so that is one where
experientially people

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:37.080
did decide to exempt
smaller businesses.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:37.900
Yeah?

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.580
AUDIENCE: It's great
to have you here.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.959
I wanted to ask about Dodd-Frank
and the Affordable Care Act.

00:37:42.959 --> 00:37:44.500
One thing they seem
to have in common

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.730
is people are trying
to dismantle them.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.969
And I wonder how Dodd-Frank is
doing from your perspective,

00:37:49.969 --> 00:37:50.510
first of all.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.960
And second of all, whether this
attempt to dismantle things

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.940
that were pretty big
initiatives that were voted for

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.850
is something that's always
happened in our world,

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:01.750
or it's something
new and different?

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.833
BARNEY FRANK: Let me take
the last question first.

00:38:03.833 --> 00:38:06.930
No, this is not
typical for things

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:10.860
to be contested this far, a
whole presidential election

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:11.450
after.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:17.540
And it is in the manifestation
of the Tea Party.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.494
The reason is this.

00:38:18.494 --> 00:38:19.410
You know this is true.

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.990
In the Supreme Court there's a
decision in Latin called stare

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:25.560
decisis, "let the
decision stand."

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.820
You're dealing with a case if
you're on the Supreme Court,

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.400
even if you think it should
be decided one way, if it had

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.390
previously been decided for
many years the other way,

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:36.220
it should take a
lot to unsettle it.

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.570
And the reason is you need
some stability in society.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:42.510
If every time a new party
comes in, they undo everything

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.490
the old party did,
you have an awful lot

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:48.060
of irregularity in this system.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:55.120
And ordinarily after stuff
gets passed in 2009 and '10,

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.980
by 2016 people would not
be trying to repeal it.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:04.300
It is a mark of, I think, of
the extremism of the Tea Party

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.910
people that they are
still doing that.

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:09.920
As to what's happening,
by now, neither one

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.970
is going to be legislatively
tampered with because

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:15.610
the president doesn't want to.

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:17.250
And many of the
Republicans don't like,

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:18.947
for instance, financial reform.

00:39:18.947 --> 00:39:20.030
They know the public does.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:22.410
And people say, well, the
public doesn't understand it.

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.076
No, they don't
understand the specifics.

00:39:24.076 --> 00:39:26.910
They do think it is better
to have those rules than not.

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:29.090
But in both cases,
well, particularly

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:31.840
in financial reform,
these are going

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.390
to be issues now in the
2016 presidential election.

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:38.230
People sometimes say, oh,
the parties are the same.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.207
The 2016 presidential
election will

00:39:40.207 --> 00:39:41.576
have clearly defined issues.

00:39:41.576 --> 00:39:42.950
If the Republicans
win, that will

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:44.320
be the end of financial reform.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.736
They will go back
to where we are.

00:39:45.736 --> 00:39:47.629
I think that will be a mistake.

00:39:47.629 --> 00:39:49.170
There was some effort
to kind of chip

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:50.980
away at the financial reform.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.100
The president actually signed
a bill that began that.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.930
The outcry against
that persuaded him not

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:57.280
to do that again.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.570
Nancy Pelosi took the lead.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.130
Elizabeth Warren did.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:02.350
I get more calls from
the press about an issue

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.060
than I had since I'd retired.

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:06.300
So at this point
both of them are

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.450
going to stay where they
are unless the Supreme

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:13.530
Court decides that a sloppy
drafting on the healthcare bill

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:17.690
means that people in states
that don't have an exchange,

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.760
which is most of them
with Republican governors,

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.884
will lose their healthcare.

00:40:20.884 --> 00:40:22.830
God knows what will
happen with that.

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:28.660
But both of them will
be on the table in 2016.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.725
And, as I said, that's unusual.

00:40:30.725 --> 00:40:32.850
Ordinarily if something
has survived for two years,

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.100
it's gone through a
presidential election,

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.522
it's not back into
the mix because it's

00:40:38.522 --> 00:40:39.980
very hard for
society to run things

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.480
if it's always going
back and forth.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.830
Yeah?

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:45.050
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:47.830
AUDIENCE: So hyper
partisanship and gridlock sort

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:49.300
of characterize
the government now.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.180
Why do you suppose that's
happening now over the past 5,

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.144
10 years?

00:40:54.144 --> 00:40:55.310
BARNEY FRANK: Good question.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:41:00.640
And it's the past six
years-- very precisely.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.860
The reason it's
happening is this.

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.920
The Republican Party, which
has traditionally in America

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.050
been the conservative
party which

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.680
recognizes the
importance of government

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.346
and the importance
of the private sector

00:41:11.346 --> 00:41:15.550
but feels the private sector
should be given more room,

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:21.380
has transmogrified
into a party consists

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.810
of a lot of people
who don't think

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:24.800
we need much of a
government at all

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.700
and who are very angry about it
and who do not regard politics

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.940
as disagreements between people
of good will-- Newt Gingrich

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:35.890
started this-- but of a
need to defend basic values

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.760
against immoral people.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:44.666
In 2008 in January, George Bush
went to Nancy Pelosi and Harry

00:41:44.666 --> 00:41:46.290
Reid, the leaders of
the Congress-- two

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:48.550
pretty partisan
Democrats-- and said,

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.380
we are in an economic slump.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.600
The Democrats had
taken over in 2007.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.250
We need a stimulus to
keep the economy going.

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:56.500
They said, yeah, you're right.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.480
But how can we do this?

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.430
And here's the deal, when
a Republican is president,

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:04.330
the Democrats have
conflicting incentives.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:07.960
One, to harass him because
he's the other party.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.650
But two, to help him because
we believe in government.

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:12.280
And if the government
is dysfunctional

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.690
that's bad for us.

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:17.720
We want things to work.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.760
That used to be the case
with the Republicans.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.060
Yeah, they don't
like Bill Clinton,

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.184
but they don't want to see
the government collapse.

00:42:23.184 --> 00:42:24.890
You have now,
particularly in the House

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:28.580
and some in the Senate, but not
a majority of the Republicans,

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:30.470
they have no incentive
to be cooperative.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.980
First of all, they want to
embarrass and harass Obama.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:36.170
And two, they want the
government to look bad, too.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:40.872
So in 2008 when Bush
asked for a stimulus,

00:42:40.872 --> 00:42:42.080
Reid and Pelosi gave him one.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.210
By the way, if they
were being partisan,

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:45.870
they would have said, hey,
2008, presidential election

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:46.710
this year.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:48.770
Bush says the economy
is going to look bad.

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:51.570
Oh, isn't that terrible because
that would help the Democrats

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:52.950
presidents get blamed.

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:54.890
Instead they gave
him a stimulus.

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.729
Just about a year
later, Obama comes

00:42:56.729 --> 00:42:58.270
to office after the
recession that he

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:00.930
inherits-- a terrible
recession-- and says,

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:02.410
I need a stimulus.

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:04.460
Aside-- he didn't say
he needed a stimulus.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.090
He was seeing the signs and
they say the American Recovery

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:08.140
Program.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.120
Here's the reason.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.180
For some reason, Nancy
Pelosi-- a wonderful woman

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:15.540
and very able-- but she
believes in focus groups.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:20.240
Focus groups you get people
that don't have strong opinions

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.210
and you give them these
issues and you ask them

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:22.876
what they think.

00:43:22.876 --> 00:43:27.210
Well, the problem is there is a
correlation between not having

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:31.960
a strong opinion on an important
issue and being an airhead.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.940
They have focus groups
in September, October

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.380
of the presidential
election year.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.530
Who is undecided about Bush
versus Kerry, or McCain

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:41.359
versus Obama.

00:43:41.359 --> 00:43:43.400
If you have any views at
all you almost certainly

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.560
have one over the other.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.940
Well, the focus groups told them
that the economic stimulus was

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.110
a bad word, so they
decided to call

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:54.090
our plan, the Democratic plan,
the Economic Recovery Act.

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:54.980
I was not in that.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.063
That wasn't in my committee,
so I wasn't in on it.

00:43:57.063 --> 00:43:58.844
But I did say, you
know, that's counter

00:43:58.844 --> 00:44:00.260
intuitive because
in my experience

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.806
you don't want to call it
stimulus, you want to recovery.

00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:05.180
Everybody I know would rather
be stimulated than recover.

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:08.640
So I don't understand why
you think that's better.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:12.630
But the Republicans
almost unanimously voted

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:14.810
against the stimulus
under Obama.

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:17.960
When Bush came to us in
September of 2008, two months

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.880
before the presidential
election and said,

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.436
geez, you've got to do
these things that lend money

00:44:22.436 --> 00:44:25.355
to the banks, we gave him more
support than the Republicans

00:44:25.355 --> 00:44:27.480
because we believed that
we had to save government.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:31.160
What happened has been that
people like Bob Dole or George

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.390
W. Bush are seen as too soft.

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:37.030
For a variety of reasons,
including the reaction

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:41.930
to the interventions we
needed to help the banks,

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:44.430
the Republican Party
has been taken over now

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:46.680
by very angry people,
particularly in the House.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.850
And that's the cause of
the hyper partisanship.

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:52.281
Gridlock started--
in 2009 and 2010

00:44:52.281 --> 00:44:54.280
we had a democratic House,
Senate and President,

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.220
we got a lot done.

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:59.110
By the way, when George Bush
became president in 2001,

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:02.530
he had a Republican Congress,
but his biggest issue that year

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:04.264
was called No Child Left Behind.

00:45:04.264 --> 00:45:06.430
You know who was his biggest
collaborator in passing

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:07.700
No Child Left Behind?

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.910
Ted Kennedy.

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:12.240
I mean, George Bush had a lot
of Democratic cooperation.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:17.260
And just as historical
fact, that bipartisanship

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.990
ended when Obama won,
senator McConnell

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:22.280
said his number one goal
was to defeat Obama.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.910
And he has never gotten
from the Republicans

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:26.530
the cooperation
we got from Bush.

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:29.140
Now that leads me
to the last point.

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.740
The most interesting
political struggle

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.700
going on in America
today, the one that's

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.529
going to have those
most long term impact

00:45:36.529 --> 00:45:38.070
is the struggle
within the Republican

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:40.780
Party between
mainstream conservatives

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.840
and the more radical elements.

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:46.610
And that's going to determine I
think a lot about what happens.

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.220
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming and your speech

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:54.260
and for all the work that you've
done over the years for good

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.636
in the world.

00:45:55.636 --> 00:45:59.180
And thank you for Dodd-Frank.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:02.236
I have my 401k and my IRAs
and all that sort of thing,

00:46:02.236 --> 00:46:04.300
and I put my money into
these things feeling

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:08.720
like the game is rigged but
it's the only game in town.

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.569
How certain can I
be that Fidelity is

00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:12.860
more honest than Bernie Madoff?

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:20.200
BARNEY FRANK: Very certain
because the mistake was people

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.380
didn't-- Well, one, they
are different entities.

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:27.300
Fidelity as a mutual fund is
much more highly regulated.

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:32.240
Bernie Madoff was an individual
sort of fly-by-night operation.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:36.300
Part of it is Sarbanes-Oxley,
which has some value.

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.410
And they're just
regularly audited.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:44.550
Also Madoff played
on friends, Fidelity

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:48.530
has a much more anonymous
base of people who

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:50.340
check it much more carefully.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.930
So there are some
problems of self dealing.

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:54.800
Madoff was obviously
the exception.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.140
And part of it was the Security
and Exchange Commission

00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.990
was clearly culpable.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:02.820
And we have beefed
them up much more.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.780
Yeah?

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:08.380
AUDIENCE: Thank you again for
your talk and all of your work.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.950
It seems to me that a lot of
the issues that you've discussed

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:15.090
come down to widespread
perceptual issues

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:16.720
in the public.

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.610
I mean, it certainly
was the case

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:21.380
for a lot of the
LGBT issues, but now

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.260
it's the case that
a lot of the public

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:28.390
seems convinced that these
angry, incoherent Tea

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:31.010
Partiers are the way to
go and that government

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:32.844
should be dismantled.

00:47:32.844 --> 00:47:34.510
And there are threats
of that going back

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:39.470
to smearing sort of
the unions in the '80s

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:43.510
and going forward and
decreasing their power by sort

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.780
of selling this story in
the public consciousness

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:47.889
that they're this force
for evil and so on.

00:47:47.889 --> 00:47:50.430
And now the story is that the
government as a force for evil,

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.360
and so on.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:56.450
And with the floods of money
into advertising and politics,

00:47:56.450 --> 00:48:00.280
that sort of allows certain
people to sell that story.

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.740
So I wonder what
your thoughts are

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:04.820
on how to shape that
public opinion better

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.990
and how to work
against those forces?

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:08.240
BARNEY FRANK: Well, it's hard.

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.260
We try.

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:14.570
I do think that reality matters.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:16.530
That's why I do believe
there are people

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:19.160
who vote against their own
economic self interests,

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.390
but I don't think I can
talk them out of it.

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:22.880
They have a real problem.

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.860
There relative economic
position has eroded.

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:29.200
They can't send that kid to
the University of Massachusetts

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.430
the way the previous
generation could

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:36.300
because the state has
stopped putting the money in.

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.582
And that's why I seriously
believe the only way

00:48:39.582 --> 00:48:41.290
we're going to break
this vicious cycle--

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:42.831
by the way, part of
the thing, and it

00:48:42.831 --> 00:48:45.160
has to do with the question
about when things went off

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.160
the rails.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:49.639
The public anger over the
events of 2008 and 2009

00:48:49.639 --> 00:48:50.680
clearly had a big impact.

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.120
And it's a paradox to me.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.450
We Democrats were responsible
and responded to George Bush

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:56.950
telling us we had
to do these things

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:58.075
and we get blamed for them.

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:00.340
And it's partly because we're
the party of government,

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:01.964
so when the government
does bad things,

00:49:01.964 --> 00:49:03.970
even when the Republicans
do unpopular things,

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:04.930
we get blamed.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.846
You'll hear people denouncing
the bailouts of the Democrats

00:49:07.846 --> 00:49:09.220
that we're always
doing bailouts.

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.160
There were five bailouts
in American recent history.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.530
Bear Stearns merging
with JPMorgan Chase,

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:24.890
AIG, the automobile,
TARP-- I just named four,

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:28.740
so I'll get back to the fifth--
oh, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:33.430
Every one of those bailouts was
initiated by George W. Bush.

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:34.800
Every one of them.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:38.550
Democrats participated in three,
he did two all by himself.

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:41.180
But people still
identify them with us.

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:45.220
Given that, I don't think we
can argue our way out of this.

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:53.740
Part of it is this, and this is
one thing the Democrats can do.

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.510
There's something we
can do by not doing.

00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:56.927
I don't know,
there's an old joke.

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:59.093
A guy goes to the doctor,
he says, doctor, it really

00:49:59.093 --> 00:50:00.200
hurts when I go like this.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.320
The doctor said, good,
don't go like this.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.030
That was his answer.

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:06.172
We denounce government too much.

00:50:06.172 --> 00:50:07.880
There are too many
people on the left who

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:11.470
don't like the specific acts
that government is taking

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:13.867
and instead generalize it
to, oh, they're all no good.

00:50:13.867 --> 00:50:14.950
The government is no good.

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:16.850
Why would anybody vote
if they believe that?

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:23.570
Well, part of it is
Bill Clinton made

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:26.120
this mistake of saying
the era of big government

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.990
is over and then trying to
expand particular government

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:29.994
programs.

00:50:29.994 --> 00:50:32.160
Some liberals have decided
to accommodate themselves

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.590
in the anti-government feeling.

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:34.990
Oh, yeah, I don't like
government either,

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.990
but let's do more here.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:37.160
Let's do more there.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.570
The whole cannot be smaller
than the sum of the parts

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:41.512
politically anymore
than physically.

00:50:41.512 --> 00:50:42.220
Well, I say that.

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:44.660
For all I know, I don't keep
up, maybe physically you guys

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.410
have figured out a
way there can be,

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:49.335
but I can tell you that
it's not true politically.

00:50:49.335 --> 00:50:52.360
And what we need to do first
of all is to connect the dots.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.220
Tell people, the Department
of Veterans Affairs,

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:58.050
that's not only government,
that's socialized medicine.

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:00.180
If you go into a
VA hospital, you

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:01.869
drive into a
government parking lot,

00:51:01.869 --> 00:51:03.410
and you go into a
government building

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:04.900
and a government doctor
tells a government

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:06.858
nurse to stick a government
needle in your ass.

00:51:06.858 --> 00:51:08.220
It could not be more government.

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.340
Oh, I love the VA.

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:11.050
We don't like the government.

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:12.570
All kinds of things
are government.

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:17.590
Medicare, cleaning up the
streets, snow removal.

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:19.180
We need to make that clear.

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:23.260
But beyond that, we've got to
increase government's capacity

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.470
to expand to deliver.

00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:29.300
We cannot change this as long as
there is a serious gap between

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.640
people's expectations of what
government should be doing

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.740
in their lives and
what it actually does.

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:38.280
And that's why I believe instead
of stationing troops forever

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.930
in Western Europe where I have
no idea what they're doing,

00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:44.820
it's time to take that
money and spend it at home.

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:47.605
And instead of locking people
up for smoking marijuana

00:51:47.605 --> 00:51:51.500
or sniffing cocaine and
sending the cops after them

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.220
and trying them and
putting them in prison,

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:55.340
then it's time again--

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:57.660
If we had that money
and government could

00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.070
perform better and live up
to people's expectations then

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:01.994
it would solve itself.

00:52:01.994 --> 00:52:02.494
Yes, ma'am.

00:52:05.339 --> 00:52:05.880
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.700
Again, all this to say thank
you so much for coming.

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:11.360
I grew up in a
generation that kind of

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.720
had this weird flip
where I was taught

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.720
all through elementary
school and high school

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.070
that activism was the way to go.

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:20.510
I helped collect petitions for
the 2004 Marriage Equality Act,

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:22.530
so, yay, thank you for that.

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:24.220
But then suddenly
around the age where

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.470
I could vote and
actually participate,

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:27.640
the government kind of went

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.884
[EXPLOSION SOUND]

00:52:29.659 --> 00:52:31.700
And suddenly things just
kind of stopped working.

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:34.050
And I think that
I'm concerned that,

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:36.640
especially in my generation
and the generations coming up,

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.931
there's a lack of trust that
the government is actually

00:52:38.931 --> 00:52:42.390
going to be able to do
anything to help us especially

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:44.510
when it comes to stuff
like student loans,

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:48.180
paying for college,
military spending,

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:51.700
education for our future
children, social security.

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:53.507
Do you have any
recommendations for how

00:52:53.507 --> 00:52:54.590
the government can go up--

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:54.997
BARNEY FRANK: Yes!

00:52:54.997 --> 00:52:56.015
Just what I said.

00:52:56.015 --> 00:52:59.010
Cut military spending and stop
locking up people for drugs.

00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:01.930
And to you arguing
about the people

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:03.722
are mad at the government.

00:53:03.722 --> 00:53:04.930
You know what the problem is?

00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:07.450
The people picked
the government.

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:10.140
Why has the Tea Party
been so dominant?

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.620
Because they win Republican
primaries and then people

00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:14.300
vote for them.

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.926
Congress is not in
some bubble down there.

00:53:16.926 --> 00:53:18.800
Nobody serves in the
House of Representatives

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.383
who didn't get more
votes than anybody

00:53:20.383 --> 00:53:22.240
else in the last
election for that job.

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.050
And I understand
the vicious cycle.

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:24.800
People get angry.

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.660
Well, here's the
problem we have though.

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:28.951
People on the right, when
they get angry at government,

00:53:28.951 --> 00:53:29.740
they vote.

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:32.447
People on the left get angry
with government and they march.

00:53:32.447 --> 00:53:33.030
You know what?

00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:35.740
Voting beats marching if you're
trying to influence government.

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.950
I mean Occupy and the Tea Party.

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:40.110
Now, I didn't agree with
a lot of what Occupy did.

00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:43.390
I certainly was more in sympathy
with them than the Tea Party,

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:45.860
but Occupy was a lot
of wasted effort.

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:48.880
The Tea Party was a disciplined
get our people registered

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.220
and vote.

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:53.410
Now, I understand that people
get angry and they don't vote

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:55.860
and it becomes worse.

00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.410
But the answer is clear with
the things you said-- improve

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:00.530
college education,
accessibility,

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:06.340
et cetera-- cut military
spending at the federal level.

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:11.760
In every state the most serious
problem in the last 10 years

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.689
has been the increase
in prison budgets.

00:54:15.689 --> 00:54:17.230
Look, you hit somebody
over the head,

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:19.530
I would like there to be
a wall between you and me.

00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:21.590
I don't want violent
people hanging out.

00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:25.180
But people who are using drugs,
no reason to lock them up.

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:27.790
And so those are the answers.

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:29.910
Now, I understand
people are frustrated,

00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:31.740
but they need to go vote for
candidates that will do that.

00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:32.740
How much time do we got?

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:34.260
I don't want to go over.

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.570
What's our time here?

00:54:37.909 --> 00:54:39.450
Because I'm going
to sign some books,

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:40.533
we got a few more minutes.

00:54:40.533 --> 00:54:41.620
Go ahead.

00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:44.660
AUDIENCE: The other thing that
happened around 2010, 2012

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:49.380
is the Republican redistricting
that you alluded to earlier.

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:53.930
We're coming up on 2020
and the census there

00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:55.800
and the redistricting there.

00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:59.970
Do you see a path forward
to not just continue

00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:02.620
fighting about who
gets to draw the lines

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.740
to their own partisan advantage,
but to get to some system that

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:08.069
is less volatile, less--

00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:10.110
BARNEY FRANK: Theoretically,
I thought there was.

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:13.160
And there's a very disturbing
case now being argued

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:15.030
before the Supreme Court.

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:18.950
People in Arizona got a
petition to create a commission

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:21.640
to take redistricting out of
the hands of the legislature

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:25.890
where it almost inevitably
that kind of partisan fight

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:27.930
and give it to a
nonpartisan commission.

00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:31.590
They did that in California and
they avoided gerrymandering.

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:35.300
Unfortunately, the Constitution
says in far more specific terms

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:38.970
than I wish it did-- and
this is for Congress--

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:42.550
that the method of choosing
the members of Congress

00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:46.680
shall be decided by the
legislature in each state.

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:51.880
And the legislators in Arizona
have gone to court and said,

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.864
these people can't
have this referendum.

00:55:53.864 --> 00:55:55.280
We're the only
ones who can do it.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.200
And it sounded like
at the oral argument

00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.510
the court was going to do that.

00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:59.610
So that's the problem.

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:01.110
There is a way and
there was this movement

00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:02.984
to do more of these
redistricting commissions

00:56:02.984 --> 00:56:05.235
in foreign and
elsewhere and I don't

00:56:05.235 --> 00:56:07.360
know what we can do about
that if the Supreme Court

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.375
decides that because
there is an alternative

00:56:09.375 --> 00:56:11.500
and we may not get to it.

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:12.000
OK.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.624
I think I'm going to sign books
now for anybody who wants them.

00:56:14.624 --> 00:56:16.680
Thank you for listening to me.

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:19.430
[APPLAUSE]
