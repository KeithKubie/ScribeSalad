[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.570
MALE SPEAKER: Shaun, hi, GDG
is a very interesting

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.530
developer community.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.892
has asked this question.

00:00:10.892 --> 00:00:12.505
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:12.505 --> 00:00:13.920
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.720
answer show.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.110
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions--

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.990
JJ BEHRENS: This JJ Behrens
along with Jarek Wilkiewicz.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.100
And we have two guests today,
Kieran Farr and

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.990
Jiang Li from VidCaster.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.720
And this is YouTube
Developers Live.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.750
Jarek, how are you
doing today?

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.914
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Doing good.

00:00:36.914 --> 00:00:37.040
How are you?

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.830
JJ BEHRENS: Pretty good.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.790
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So you've
been quite busy lately.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.780
I haven't seen you around.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.370
What have you been up to, JJ?

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.940
JJ BEHRENS: Well, I was
talking to my wife.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.140
And she says, you're not
a real developer.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.670
You just play one on TV.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.380
And so I figured I should
do something about that.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.840
And so I started releasing the
backlog of Open Source

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.500
projects that I have.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.400
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
So tell me more.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.730
What have you released lately?

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.380
JJ BEHRENS: So I released
three projects.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.300
The first one I worked with
Jeffrey Posnick on.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.390
And it's called Party
Playlist Picker.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.130
It's a Google App engine
application written in Python

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.090
that allows you to

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.470
collaboratively edit a playlist.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.370
So it's pretty neat.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.350
You have a bunch of people.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.920
They're going to
go to a party.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.830
And they're logged in on
separate computers.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.530
And they're editing the
same play list.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.190
And you can see updates in real
time from each of them.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.280
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.080
Did you use client libraries
or straight through

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.290
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.830
JJ BEHRENS: I did.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.260
I used Python Client Library,
which is unfortunately still

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.720
using version one of the API.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.470
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Old school.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.900
JJ BEHRENS: It'd be nice
to update that.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.430
And so the next one I built
a PHP project called

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.860
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.210
And it takes a lot of
concentration to even

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.810
pronounce that.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.260
It is not the best name
in the world.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.210
It is just a proof of concept of
how to use PHP, OAuth2, the

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.510
newest client library from the
newer Google APIs along with

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.080
CodeIgniter and the YouTube
CodeIgniter client library.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.055
And so the way I came up with
the name is I took all of

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:04.010
those words.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.000
And then I just randomly pulled
letters, and shoved

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.770
them together, and threw
in a few vowels.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:09.259
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Wow.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.530
So let's see, Python, PHP.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.673
So what will be your next
programming language that

00:02:13.673 --> 00:02:14.620
you're going to write in.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.610
JJ BEHRENS: So the next project
that we released is

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.700
Quizzimoto.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.680
Of course, we had a tutorial
about that before Google I/O.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.920
And that's written
in Ruby on Rails.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.210
And then finally, we have a
project that I haven't yet

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.860
released, but I'm going to
release, built in Android

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.310
using the new YouTube player
API for Android.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.820
And I'm excited about that.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.500
We announced that at Google I/O.
And I'm hoping to release

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.160
that code as soon as I can.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.320
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.880
So it sounds like every week,
you use a different

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.930
programming language?

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.560
JJ BEHRENS: Well, yeah, I didn't
mention the other one

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.640
that was written in Dart.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.980
But I'm a Dart guy.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh wow, let's
see, there are 52 weeks

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.860
in the year.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.340
Are there enough programming
languages for you?

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.640
Or are you going to have
to repeat yourself, JJ?

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.570
JJ BEHRENS: Well, actually
Haskell takes two weeks

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.600
because I have to
work up to it.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.730
Haskell's not so easy.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.870
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh I see.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.530
What about Lisp.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.330
There's a lot of parenthesis,
so maybe

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.210
that'll take even longer.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.430
JJ BEHRENS: Lisp works for
me or at least Scheme.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.670
JUANG LI: Got an SDK or API
for Scheme or LISP?

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.470
JJ BEHRENS: No, but if you're
a Lisp programmer, you don't

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.690
need a client library.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.630
That's just the way they role.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.720
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: We'll accept
change requests.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.880
So if you're willing to submit
something else, then this is

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.110
Open Source library.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.190
JJ BEHRENS: I keep joking about
the fact that the only

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.550
reason why we can't get a
COBOL client library is

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.670
because we can't find
an intern who

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.380
could code in COBOL.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.050
And I refuse to code in COBOL.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.620
I just have my limits.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.890
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: We'll
fix that, JJ.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.860
JJ BEHRENS: Maybe next time.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.080
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Wow, so that's
pretty exciting, JJ.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.200
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah,
it's pretty fun.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.360
So I'm kind of sad that Jeffrey
Posnick couldn't make

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.480
it here today.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.880
Why couldn't he make it?

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.470
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So apparently,
the cold season

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.440
has officially started already
on the East Coast.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.300
JJ BEHRENS: I thought the people
at Google were like

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.100
immune to viruses.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.420
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Well, they're
immune to computer

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.380
viruses apparently but
not real viruses.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.250
JJ BEHRENS: Oh, I see.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.480
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, so we
have lost Jeff for this week.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.810
He'll be back next week.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.890
And this is when we're going
to discuss the very

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.339
interesting issue
a API quotas.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.040
So for those of you that are
expecting this coverage today,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.310
unfortunately we have
to disappoint you.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.700
A virus got in the way.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.270
I know Jeff is watching
us this morning.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.926
So hi, Jeff.

00:04:26.926 --> 00:04:29.020
JJ BEHRENS: Is he still
answering email?

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.870
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Probably
predicting what people are

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.920
going to ask, answering them
proactively next to a box of

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.990
Kleenex, I suppose.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.520
So we'll cover that next week.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.760
Instead, we'll chat a little
bit about our brand new

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.950
branding guidelines.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.390
So we have a bunch of resources
for developers that

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.140
would like to use our branding
in their applications.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.940
And this question comes up
every once in awhile.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.880
So now I think we have a much
better set of tools and

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.960
guidelines.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.440
But first, I think we'll talk
to our guests here.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.480
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, tell
us about VidCaster.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.400
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Right,
so maybe we'll

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.920
start with you, Kieran.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.680
Kieran is the founder and
CEO of VidCaster.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.810
And I have a tricky question
for you to start.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.300
KIERAN FARR: Go for it.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.180
Yeah.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.320
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So I read in
New York Times that you have

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.000
actually bootstrapped the
company while driving a cab in

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.350
San Francisco.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.910
KIERAN FARR: That's correct.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.770
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Is that true?

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.700
KIERAN FARR: That's
absolutely true.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.370
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So what
kind of driver are you?

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.650
Are you a laid back cab driver,
or are you one of

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.090
those fast--

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.730
KIERAN FARR: It's funny because
when I first started

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.000
driving taxi, my girlfriend at
the time, she told me Kieran,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.480
you drive way too slow.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.840
You're too good of a driver.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.640
You should not be
a taxi driver.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.510
And over the three years of
bootstrapping the company and

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.920
driving a taxi, I eventually
got to the point-- and I'm

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.240
sure Jiang can testify here--
where I drive like a madman.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.590
So there's something in the
occupation itself that

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.660
inspires you to adapt these
driving habits that aren't

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.470
necessarily the safest.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.440
JJ BEHRENS: San Francisco is
the only place in the world

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.620
that I've ever been where I've
gotten Oracle DBA advice from

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.850
my cab driver.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.140
KIERAN FARR: That's
pretty remarkable.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.130
The sort of characters that you
see driving taxis in San

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.590
Francisco can be very wide.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.270
JJ BEHRENS: Apparently.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.550
KIERAN FARR: But it was
a good experience.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.360
And that's probably a
good segue to how

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.370
we started the company.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.580
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah,
tell me more.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.710
KIERAN FARR: Yeah, so we
actually started VidCaster as

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.060
a completely different
project.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.600
And I think this is the sort
of theme that you see a

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.460
lot in start ups.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.880
And around 2008, we wanted to
create a local TV station.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.850
And we actually partnered with
the San Francisco Chronicle,

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.210
other top blogs, such as the
SFist and SF Appeal, other

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.420
local TV stations,
like Coffee TV.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.960
And we brought in a consortium
of students who are recent

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.940
graduates of videography
programs at different

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.990
universities.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.630
And essentially, we partnered
with the traditional reporters

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.310
of these outlets to create
video content with them.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.880
And so as we did this, we
realized that most of the

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.970
problems with our workflow were
not around the production

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:56.570
of the content.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.310
I have a lot of experience
producing local TV.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.140
I knew how to make that
a templatized process.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.410
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How so?

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.560
Did you do that in school?

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.530
Or where did you pick that up?

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.880
KIERAN FARR: Actually, as young
as middle school, I

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.360
started doing live
TV broadcast.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.690
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
From your house?

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.090
KIERAN FARR: From our
middle school.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.590
We did the announcements
in the morning

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.970
at our middle school.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.510
And in high school, we had a
nice TV studio where we did a

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.200
live sports show
every morning.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.880
We had one of the best
basketball teams in the state.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.150
So there was a lot
to report on.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.950
So anyway, I had all this
production experience and I

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.930
said, well, we can make
our own TV station.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.100
I think that local TV in
America, especially, has a lot

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.770
of problems.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.440
It's just all about violence,
and politics, and this

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.300
investigation about why Lysol is
going to kill your children

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.410
tonight at 11.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.480
And I thought there's a better
way we could do this.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.040
So anyway, so we had a great
process for creating content.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.510
But it was much more difficult
to then streamline this

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.920
process to make it easy for
these reporters and producers,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.100
who have limited time, to be
able to upload this content,

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.050
have-- what was most important
at the time was a destination

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.290
video site, in other words,
to have a location

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.610
where viewers can go.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.050
This property was called
vidsf.com.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.850
And this is the concept that
we like to call video site.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.560
In other words, it's a website
around which all of the

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.550
content is oriented
around video.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:19.390
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Like YouTube.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.230
KIERAN FARR: Like YouTube.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.570
YouTube, of course,
is a good example.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.470
But if we kind of look a little
bit wider, Netflix is a

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.080
video site.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.470
That concept is something
that exists already.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.384
And a lot of humans, viewers,
don't necessarily categorize

00:08:33.384 --> 00:08:34.350
it in their brain.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.150
But when we look at what these
elements are, at the end of

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.190
the day, they're templatizable
structures

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.380
that are video sites.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.030
So you have an index
page where you

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.110
have featured content.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.150
You have playback pages where
you play back the video.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:51.580
You have, for example, episode
or show landing pages, where

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.950
it organizes all that content.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.270
Anyway getting back to the story
here, we had to create

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.150
all of this infrastructure
from scratch.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.480
And we tried calling up some of
the paid OVPs at the time.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.350
These are Brightcove, Viala,
some of the larger names.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.790
And we said, here's what
we want to do.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.050
Can you help us with this?

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.510
And they said to us, well,
we'll give you a

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.880
video player object.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.850
But you guys are responsible
for the rest of the show.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.400
Well, the rest of the show is
the meat of this technical

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.060
development.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.160
And so we just started writing
our own solutions.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.170
After about a year, this brings
us to around 2010, we

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.490
had so much interest in the
actual software tools that we

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.130
had written that it was clear to
us that we would be able to

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.410
make a much better business by
selling this software instead

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.920
of trying to continue to
create this content.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.810
So that was around 2010.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.590
And that's what led the initial

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.460
developments of VidCaster.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.900
And we got our first beta
clients, which was Airbnb and

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.600
Indiana University.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.820
And we helped build that
out with them.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.630
And then that eventually brought
us to the point where

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.400
we were able to join an
accelerator, called 500 Start

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.610
Ups, that really started the
development of this as a

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.540
company around the
software as well.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.460
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: What was
your number in 500?

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.020
KIERAN FARR: What
number were we?

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.500
I would just guess like maybe
160 or something like this.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.913
I know they're getting
close to--

00:10:08.913 --> 00:10:10.145
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK,
is that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:10:10.145 --> 00:10:12.490
KIERAN FARR: Hopefully.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.800
That was a good experience
as well.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.590
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So you've been
working on the product

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.340
for a couple of years now.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.310
KIERAN FARR: Now comes to about
four and 1/2 years.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.460
I was driving a taxi all
the way through a

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.330
year and 1/2 ago.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.540
And once we were able to join
500 Start Ups, they gave a

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.705
little bit of investment, which
was enough to get me

00:10:28.705 --> 00:10:29.970
outside of the taxi.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.270
And really then, that
was the beginning of

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.300
building a true company.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.560
In other words, Jiang joined our
company at the same time.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.210
We are very technology
focused.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.610
So as you can tell by the way
I described this, we were

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.130
really trying to solve all these
technology problems.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.180
And what we learned in the
real world of startups is

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.730
that, you can build
a great product.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:49.850
And you can solve all
these problems.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.250
And they'll show you all the
cool things that we do.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.570
But the next step as a company
is sales and marketing and

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.320
creating a repeatable sales
process around this product.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.890
And that's, what I joke, is my
MBA trial by fire that I

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.330
received over the past year and
1/2 of running a company.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:05.550
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Right.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:09.460
But you had some experience
dealing with cash, and doing

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.240
basic accounting, and
things like that--

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.665
KIERAN FARR: Yeah, I think
I had a little bit of

00:11:12.665 --> 00:11:12.860
experience.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.060
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: --in your
Crown Vic or whatever it was

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.370
you were driving?

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:15.490
KIERAN FARR: Good question.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.530
So the cool part is that I
worked for a taxi company that

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:19.840
had tons of hybrids
on the fleet.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.760
So I got to drive everything
from, of course, the Toyota

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.745
Prius to Nissan Altima hybrid,
all sorts of fun stuff.

00:11:27.745 --> 00:11:28.010
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.600
So how about a little demo.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.090
And then maybe we'll talk about
some of the technical

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.470
challenges.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.280
I know JJ is dying to ask Jiang
some tricky questions.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.900
KIERAN FARR: Yeah, so I'll
turn the computer

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.690
over here to Jiang.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.630
While Jiang is working on this,
I'll give a little bit

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:47.350
of a description of kind of what
we're looking at here.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.400
So what this is VidCaster
powered by YouTube.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.210
At its core, what VidCaster
lets you do is

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.440
create a video site.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.390
So what Jiang is doing here is
logging in and granting access

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.870
through OAuth, and I'm sure
that JJ will have some

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.570
questions about how we
implemented this.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:02.700
Now what it's doing is actually

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.200
connecting to YouTube.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.750
And it's retrieving a list
of that video content.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:10.150
And what we do at VidCaster is
abstract that metadata into a

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.190
unified format.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.810
And what we'll talk about in a
second is that this allows us

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.170
to work with any number of third
party video platforms.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.960
Of course, YouTube is
one of the most

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.880
popular ones on the planet.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.570
So that's one of the
first ones that we

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.030
started to work with.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.280
And so what this will do then
is create, for example,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.530
thumbnails, total running time,
all the sorts of video

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.590
related metadata that you
would want when you're

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.060
organizing a video site.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.770
And we try to do this as
quickly as possible.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.520
And Jiang can talk at length
about how we've been

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.100
optimizing our process
for this.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.280
And so then what this brings you
to, this is what we call

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.630
our onboarding process.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.360
And this is a live preview
of what your videos

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.040
site would look like.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.400
And now we have close to a
dozen designers themes.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.120
We work with designers on a
regular basis, creating more

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:52.710
and more of these.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.240
In fact, we'll talk a little
bit later about we have a

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.810
whole templating language around
VidCaster very similar

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.370
to a Wordpress but made
specifically for multimedia.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.380
And we're actually holding a
theming contest that we'll

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.940
start in a few weeks with some
cash prizes to get developers

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.840
to join the fun here.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.310
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So the use
case here is say, I am a bed

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.070
and breakfast.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.700
And I want to have an awesome
site because I am right on the

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.180
beach, and I have beautiful
bedrooms.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.690
So I will basically do what?

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.610
KIERAN FARR: So then you could,
if you have existing

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.690
videos in your YouTube account,
you can instantly

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:29.760
start this process, choose
a theme that's from our

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.940
pre-built theme garden, and then
customize that logo, and

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.850
choose a URL.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.070
And there's two different ways
that people use this.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.290
They either use it one, as their
entire website or two,

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.180
they use this what we call a
video sub site, very similar

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.450
in spirit to a blog-- how a blog
lives in a sub domain.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.580
We suggest to our users to use
either TV, .domainname.com, or

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.420
video.domainname.com.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.800
And this is a practice that
we've been seeing--

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.630
not just VidCaster pushing for
this but companies like Adobe,

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.310
for example, have really used
video on a branded sub site.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.660
So TV.adobe.com is
a great example.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.510
And they put literally dozens
of hours of content.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.240
A lot of it is around support,
how to use their products.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.250
And this serves both as
marketing and sales material

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:16.400
but, of course, also support and
training material, which

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.140
both really kind of serve
the same purpose.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.200
And I think at the end of the
day they're trying to get more

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.440
people to use Adobe.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.820
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool
So I interrupted

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.810
your demo flow here.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.680
Apologies for that.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.230
Let's go ahead and continue.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.050
KIERAN FARR: Yeah, so
then this dumps you

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.040
out into our dashboard.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.930
And this dashboard again is
meant to abstract, regardless

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.200
of the video player system
you're using, to have a

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.890
unified set of analytics,
content management control,

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.040
and we've been doing
implementations lately that

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.980
combine as many as
five different

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.700
online video platforms.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.770
And I can show you an example
in a few minutes.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.450
We worked on a project with
MIT where we combined the

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.340
YouTube player with Brightcove's
player, and

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.820
Kaltura's player, and the Vimeo
player, and our own

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.170
white label player into one
cohesive interface for both

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.390
their content managers but then
also for their viewers so

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.260
that they don't have to worry
about the complexities of

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.120
these different APIs.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.710
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Do you find
that this is a pretty common

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.970
use case where people have
content all over the place?

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:11.500
KIERAN FARR: Yeah.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.980
This is something we're finding
more and more with

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:14.960
larger companies.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.490
And to be clear, anybody can
sign up for a VidCaster

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.870
account for free.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.150
Our free plan is powered
by the YouTube player.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.740
And then for larger companies
with more complex needs,

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:24.970
that's when we help them--

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.860
because we have all these
integrations already existing.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.220
And it helps them get to market
very quickly with

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.640
whatever solution they're
looking for.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.100
And what we find typically is
that companies all around the

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.300
planet have videos all
over the place, but

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.200
they don't know it.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.320
So a really common problem is
that let's say, the tech team

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.710
put up a bunch of tutorial
videos, and they

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.910
really liked Vimeo.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.780
Their marketing team put up a
bunch of videos up on YouTube

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:47.910
on the YouTube channel.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:49.700
Other folks took videos
at a party.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.210
They put it up on Facebook.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.470
This other department has a
contract, let's say the

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.530
internal training department,
has a contract with Kaltura

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:57.590
because they've been good about

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.060
marketing about education.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.150
And then, at the end of the day
you have this nightmare

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.110
from a management perspective
of what do you do with all

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.780
these assets?

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.720
And are these assets actually
driving business or

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.930
accomplishing the objectives
that we have, whether it's

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.600
reducing support queries,
whether it's increasing our

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.890
number of leads, increasing
revenue?

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.830
And the reality is that
nobody knows.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.140
And this is something that
almost every single

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.830
organization has this problem.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.170
And when we look at how do we
solve this problem, it's not

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:26.160
about a video player.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.640
The video player is part
of this problem.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.940
But that is kind of one
of these tools.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.480
And really it's about collecting
all the stuff into

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.560
one solution to then, at the
end of the day, give

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.070
management the sense of yes,
these videos across our

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.180
YouTube channel, on Facebook,
and on Vimeo are indeed

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.480
driving people to have this
behavior, or this post viewing

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.130
behavior, that we value.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.250
And that's what we believe is
what we call closing that loop

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.490
and finally helping companies
realize that what we believed

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.890
all this time is that video has
a huge amount of value for

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:56.650
the enterprise.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.220
But it's hard to
quantify that.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.020
And it's often very difficult
for them and the accounting

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.660
team to say, it's worth it for
us to be spending all this

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.869
money on producing
tutorial videos.

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:06.970
It's worth it for us to be
producing this sales and

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.159
marketing material and customer
testimonials.

00:17:09.159 --> 00:17:12.369
But connecting those dots has
been a very big challenge.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:13.670
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Speaking
of which, can they track

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.319
conversion?

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:20.180
Like say, I go to one of these
video sites, and watch the

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.810
video, and click on a buy now
link or something like that.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.970
Is that reflected in
your analytics?

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:27.310
Like how do they actually know
that what you just said is

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.800
actually true that they should
invest in content.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.150
KIERAN FARR: When we work with
our larger clients, what we'll

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.700
do is we'll usually interface
with their customer

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.730
relationship management
software or CRM.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:41.130
So common ones, of course, are
Sales Force or Marketo.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:41.980
There's--

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.200
I'm trying to think of
a couple other ones--

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.880
HubSpot is another common one.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.060
And a lot of what this is really
turning viewers into

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.440
leads and tracking OK, once that
viewer has supplied their

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.730
email address, then how do they
fall into that funnel?

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.770
So that's where our philosophy
is that we don't want to build

00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:59.900
every single tool.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.610
And we try to combine all these
things together into one

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:04.330
easy package.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.210
And that's kind of our eco.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:09.280
So then we'll leverage the Sales
Force, or the Marketo,

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.470
or Hub Spot installation that
enterprise has to do that

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.180
reporting and analytics.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.470
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So finally,
a very tricky question.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.440
So do you think that video
improves the conversion?

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.720
KIERAN FARR: Hmmm.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.760
I have to think about this.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.380
Well, the obvious
answer is yes.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.500
If we want to be kind of high
level hippie about this, video

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.270
is moving pictures.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.940
And it's one of the most
effective mediums that humans

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:34.930
have invented.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.880
And it's undeniable that
it's a powerful medium.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.390
And I think that what's really
been missing is connecting the

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.080
loop or closing the loop.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.010
And finally, we're going to
the point where we can see

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.530
that, and we can actually
quantify that.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.860
And that's what gets us really
excited because we can finally

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.800
say, hey this is working.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.320
And even if it's small percents
in the single digits

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.880
of traffic that's coming through
their main property,

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.210
that traffic still converts
at a very high level.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.150
It's very relevant.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.550
If you're looking for tutorial
videos on how to use an arcane

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.370
server product, there's a very
high chance that you're going

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.360
to want to purchase
that product.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.890
So I think what we're really
seeing now is finally, after

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.860
all this time, the data and
evidence that's supporting our

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.680
intuition that we've had
for a long time.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.612
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So shall
we look under the hood?

00:19:19.612 --> 00:19:19.950
KIERAN FARR: Yeah.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:20.900
JJ BEHRENS: Sure.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.210
Well, first of all you were
talking about some of the

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:26.590
companies that you've
integrated with.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:31.970
And I know some people out there
might not know the video

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:35.190
landscape as well
as you guys do.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.580
So can you tell us all the
companies you've integrated

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.300
with, and what each
of those companies

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.220
provides for the users?

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.160
KIERAN FARR: Yeah, I don't know
if we'll have time to go

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:43.790
over all of them.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.760
But I can give you a sense
of the big categories.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.510
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, categories
would be fantastic.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.620
KIERAN FARR: So one of the main
categories is what we

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.850
call the player object.

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.830
And this kind of goes back to
my belief that a player

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.830
object, whether we're talking
about the YouTube player.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.630
That's what I would define
as a player object

00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:59.820
or other third parties.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.026
And there's now on the market
I'd say roughly 60 to 100

00:20:04.026 --> 00:20:07.890
different player only video
platforms out there.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.690
And what they usually provide
is a white label, brandable,

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.230
video player object.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:16.560
And so we've done integrations
now, I'd say, with about 10

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.550
total of these.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.200
And that number keeps
growing as we do

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.190
more and more projects.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.890
So that's one category.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.770
Another big category would be
third party social network

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:27.390
distributions.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:31.590
So this is taking this content
and then pushing it out to the

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:35.760
common folks you hear about,
Facebook, Twitter, other third

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.280
party platforms like that.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.810
Analytics is another really
big category.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.250
Of course, there's the standard
players in there like

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.140
Google Analytics or Omniture.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.080
What we're seeing more and
more is, like I mentioned

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.630
before, analytics plug-ins that
have a relation to the

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:52.160
customer relationship
database.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.150
So this is Sales Force,
Hub Spot, et cetera.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.370
And we see things like Mix
Panel, or Kiss Metrics, or

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.550
other sort of third party
tracking systems that our

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:01.990
clients are using.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.540
And then there's this really new
category of what I would

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.410
call interactivity layers
on top of video.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.220
And there's a number of
startups around this.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.650
I'd say there's at least a
dozen, or two dozen, startups

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.845
that have varying types of
interactive video technology.

00:21:19.722 --> 00:21:22.070
And for our customers, it's
exciting to be able to have

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.490
all these different options to
be able to say OK, I want to

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.330
be able to click on this dress
and buy this dress, or I want

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.610
to be able to have social
comments in the timeline and

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:31.370
link out to that.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.560
So we've done a couple
integrations on that end.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.780
It's a little bit difficult to
be honest because there are so

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.160
many startups out there
that are doing this.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.920
It's hard to find a standard.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.800
And we've been looking at
there for a standard.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.440
I know that Mozilla is working
with Popcorn.js is one sort of

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.340
standard that's kind of somewhat
seeming to gain

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.610
traction in the sense that
it's timeline based

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.130
interactivity for generic
player objects.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.370
Another category we've been
doing integrations with is

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.190
open source video players.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.680
So we've had an integration
with the

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.400
JWPlayer for quite a while.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.900
We've been working with the
team over at Video JS.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.720
That's been an interesting
player because it actually

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.390
supports, for example,
YouTube is a playback

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.160
layer beneath it.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.780
That's also very interesting
because VidCaster, at that

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.970
point, serves as this cloud
based player that has an

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.420
updating open source player.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.370
And then our customers can
choose to use their own CDN.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.340
So that would be another
category where a lot of our

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.260
customers will have existing
CDN relationships.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.400
They'll want to plug-in, for
example, they have existing

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.800
contract with Akamai.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.350
Or they have literally a server
on Premise that they

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.260
want to serve this
video content.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:42.250
So then we connect all these
dots and help them connect all

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.100
these things together
in one place.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.520
JJ BEHRENS: That's really
interesting that you're

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.740
serving video from so many
places, including the big guys

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.700
as well as local.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.450
So integrating all of those
is kind of interesting.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:58.180
So my favorite question is what
did you guys write it in?

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.650
JIANG LI: We wrote everything
in Django.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:01.720
JJ BEHRENS: Django, wow.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.170
Crazy.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.880
KIERAN FARR: Yeah, we've enjoyed
Python and Django as a

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.480
great framework and language
combination.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.000
I started writing, of course,
this code back in 2008 when I

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.190
was driving the taxi.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.980
We have a joke around the
office that is taxi code

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.430
because it was very utilitarian
and functioned.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.740
But now poor Jiang and the
rest of the dev team are

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.960
dealing with that technical debt
and bringing that code

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.620
base up to speed.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.900
So for example, I know you're
going to ask some questions

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.680
about our API integrations.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.970
And this is something I did
like two years ago, for

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.020
example, for our initial
YouTube integrations.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.210
And it's definitely time
for an update.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.050
I want to say that we were
using, for example, in the

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:45.110
Python library side, it
was a 1.0 library.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:49.830
But we were kind of hacking it
to access some 2.0 features

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:53.290
because not all of them were
built into that class,

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:53.890
necessarily.

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.070
But you could still
kind of access it.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.910
JJ BEHRENS: Thankfully, that
situation's going to get a lot

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:01.460
better with version 3 of the API
with completely up to date

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.660
client libraries.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.080
Life is going to
be much better.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.550
KIERAN FARR: Yeah, that'll
be really helpful.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.660
JJ BEHRENS: But I
feel your pain.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.050
JIANG LI: Another problem we
had was we tried to get all

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.330
that viewership data from
YouTube, and one of the big

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.120
things is the viewership.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.800
So we had to use the insight API
and download a lot of zip

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.020
files [INAUDIBLE] client.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.400
And that generally
takes a while.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.930
So when I heard about the
new analytics API,

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:24.880
I was pretty excited.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.830
JJ BEHRENS: That's going to
solve a big pain point.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:31.070
Now, I'm really hung up on
this idea of you writing

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:35.165
Python while driving a cab and
the fact that you said your

00:24:35.165 --> 00:24:38.490
cab driving skills were
originally very orthodox and

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:39.770
then went towards the sloppy.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.200
And I'm thinking of Python
indentation.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.140
I'm just imagining at the
beginning of the project,

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.870
everything was force
base indents.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.490
And then towards the end of the
project, it's like three

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:52.060
space indents. and two
space indents.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.020
KIERAN FARR: It's funny
you mentioned that.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.430
That is something that Jiang has
brought up as we need to

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.520
go back to the code base and
make sure that we have unified

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.820
indentation.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.942
JIANG LI: And especially when
people start using tabs.

00:25:01.942 --> 00:25:05.550
And you're just like
what's a tab.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:06.680
JJ BEHRENS: That's
pretty funny.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.680
So do you guys have
plans to switch to

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.540
version 3 of the API?

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.340
Have you thought about it?

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.490
I mean of course, we have to
wait for it to fully come out,

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:21.520
but will you guys make the
switch to save a lot of pain?

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.760
KIERAN FARR: Definitely
on the analytics side.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.700
We're getting close now to about
7,000 video sites that

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.200
are powered by YouTube.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.740
And for each of those sites, you
can imagine that there's a

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.050
lot of synchronization that
happens on a regular basis.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.240
So one of those synchronizations
is, of

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.420
course, analytics data.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.440
Another important
synchronization is, of course,

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.700
based around the
actual content.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.680
Has somebody uploaded
new content?

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.510
And what I can show you here is
a demo of how some of our

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.420
customers use this.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.590
And maybe that'll be helpful.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:51.060
In fact, if we can
switch to this.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.790
This is a great example of how
one of our customers, who was

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:56.880
also one of our investors, 500
Startups, integrates VidCaster

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.880
into their website.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.440
So this is their main
website at 500.co.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.770
And when you click on the video
tab, this actually leads

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.780
to a website that is hosted
by the VidCaster system.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.360
So it's really important to
understand that part of

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.690
VidCaster's value is actually
hosting the website itself

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.880
that has all this video
content embedded.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.000
Now all of the stuff, of course,
matches the branding

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:17.960
of the main site.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.920
The only reason you know it's
another server is it's on a

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.630
sub-domain, which
we've see named.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.010
And then, this provides all of
the navigation elements,

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:29.260
things, inconveniences, such as
most viewed this week, all

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.360
sorts of preview things.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.150
And what I'd like to do now
is kind of show you--

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:33.770
we'll press play.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:35.170
And you can look at one
of these play pages.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.200
These are all customizable.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.950
I'm going to pause this
for a second.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:40.780
And so you can customize
everything here.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.140
For example, you can work with
all sorts of third party

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:43.900
commenting systems.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.580
This is another category
to add to that list.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:49.410
So there's Facebook comments,
LiveWire comments, Discuss.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:50.150
Exactly.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.475
JJ BEHRENS: Another Django
app by the way.

00:26:51.475 --> 00:26:52.240
KIERAN FARR: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.400
Our friends over there
at Discuss.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.620
So I wanted to show you is
how they made this site.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.890
And so what they did is it they
started with a very basic

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.920
layout, the basic rotater.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.220
And we have close now to about
a dozen different themes.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.690
A lot of them are
mobile friendly.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.070
They uploaded a logo, they
uploaded a fabric con, did a

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.970
little bit of CSS.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:10.040
But one of the most powerful
things that we're excited to

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.390
show off is what we
call custom HTML.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.220
And what this is the ability
that within the cloud, we have

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:19.350
a cloud based code editor to
actually edit the templates

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.770
for these themes.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:23.340
And this is where you get very
powerful customization.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.620
And what we built this on is on
top of the Django built in

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.240
templating system, we've
introduced a series of

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.590
convenience functions for
dealing specifically with

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:32.780
multimedia content.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.720
So one of the best examples
I'd like to show is, for

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.140
example, this function right
here, fetch thumbnail URL for

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.060
a given object, which is in
this case, a lead item.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.930
And you can specify the width
and height of that image.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:48.180
The reason why this starts to
become so powerful is that you

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.590
can imagine if you're a larger
company, and you have five

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.780
different video players systems,
each one of those

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.390
actually has a completely
different API

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:56.640
for fetching a thumbnail.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.780
And as small as this task
sounds, when that creative

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.450
agency is trying to create this
site that combines all

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.060
these things together, just that
one function of getting

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.970
these preview images turns out
to be a big pain in the butt.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.610
So this starts to put that layer
of abstraction on top of

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.760
this CMS made specifically for
video content so that this is

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.470
an easily repeated automatable
process for the organization.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.180
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:24.030
So you guys host
videos as well?

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.130
KIERAN FARR: We do.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:27.370
So we have what we
call our white

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.160
label, cloud based player.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.350
Now this is an interesting--

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.650
if we want to get into a little
bit about the world of

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:37.930
online video, my core belief,
frankly, is that video objects

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:40.480
are turning into a commodity.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.600
There are some that have great
infrastructure behind them.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.970
And I think YouTube
specifically, obviously, has a

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:47.660
great CDN infrastructure.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.655
JJ BEHRENS: We have
a couple servers.

00:28:49.655 --> 00:28:50.060
Two or three.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.570
KIERAN FARR: And when you start
talking about the video

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:55.840
objects ecosystem, really all
that you're talking about now

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:59.140
is the latency of play
to first byte.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.750
Everything else is easily
repeatable, whether we're

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.740
talking about the Chrome
controls over this plug-ins

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.660
for advertising.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.990
So anyway, I interrupted you.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.170
JJ BEHRENS: So you
have white label.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:14.720
So that makes a lot of sense.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:19.900
So one of the things about
using web API that can

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.880
sometimes be challenging
is doing testing.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.940
And so a lot of people decide
not to do testing.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.990
What approach did
you guys take?

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:32.710
JIANG LI: So we basically have
many servers that we do

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.050
developing on.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:36.250
It's actually station servers.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.420
So our developers have their
own developer server.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.070
Then, we put everything
into a staging server.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:44.970
We have basic tests that we
run on the staging server.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:46.570
We do pushes every Thursday.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.570
JJ BEHRENS: Every Thursday.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:51.930
The day after YouTube.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:52.260
KIERAN FARR: Yeah.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.030
Well essentially, this way, when
we're developing, we're

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.380
actually developing in that
same server environments

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.280
because like you're saying, we
do interact with so many third

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.170
party services.

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:02.500
And then, when we push things
to staging, that's an exact

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.220
replica of our production
environment.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.110
So we can see everything from
how do the load balancers

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.250
affect forwarding of IP
addresses for our analytic

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:13.410
system or whatever.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:14.770
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:21.790
So can you tell us anything kind
of interesting looking

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:25.360
back now that you've
spent so much time

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.050
developing this software?

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.070
What are the things that
kind of surprised you?

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.240
What are the things that you
wish you could tell yourself

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.570
and go back in time?

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:36.820
By the way, we have a project
x project for that, maybe.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.660
KIERAN FARR: I would say one
of the things that's very

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.620
surprising to me is not
necessarily about the

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.830
technology but about running a
company and having a software

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:46.420
product and that is that the
things that customers find

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.520
most valuable, sometimes have
no correlation with the

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.330
difficulty of programming it.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:56.340
So for example, very complicated
syncing technology

00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:00.130
in the back end that we have for
all the third party OBPs.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:03.010
That's cool and that's
necessary.

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:05.910
That's something that takes
some time to sell that.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.370
However, this sort of technology
that we've made for

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.630
letting people edit the template
structure, that

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.760
didn't take us a huge amount of
time to develop compared to

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.640
the syncing technology.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.720
But this is something that
people really value.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.590
And it's surprising to see that
just because you slave

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.510
away at this one thing or this
feature, it's not necessarily

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:25.630
that's going to be what
brings you forward.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:28.150
And for me, it's been a humbling
experience over the

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:31.860
past year to realize that we
really need to have an ongoing

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.330
dialogue with our user base
to understand what is most

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:35.620
valuable to them.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.490
JJ BEHRENS: That's that age old
thing where nondevelopers

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.990
only care about the things
that they could see.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.360
If they can't see it,
then they just

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.420
don't care that much.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.900
KIERAN FARR: And things like
having these custom themes for

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.810
people to be able to choose from
existing themes, that's

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.360
been really, really popular.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.050
And again, that's not
necessarily a coding thing.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:54.500
We're not sitting in the
basement writing all this

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:54.940
awesome new stuff.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.650
That's working with awesome
designers and contractors from

00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.990
around the globe creating
cool stuff.

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.860
Excellent.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.386
So Jarek--

00:32:02.386 --> 00:32:04.490
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I have one
more question for these guys

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:07.190
before we let them
off the hook.

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:10.080
What you have been
showing is web.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.970
Now what about the brave
new world of mobile?

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:16.480
What do you see your customers
doing in that space.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.050
KIERAN FARR: Great question.

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:19.890
So we have a couple different
ways that customers use us

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.030
with their mobile
applications.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.840
Probably the best way that we're
moving toward it is that

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.080
everything we do is HTML5
responsive design.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.590
So about half of our themes now
are true responsive design

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.380
where it actually can change the
look, and feel, and layout

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.790
of that themes as it's used
on different devices.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:39.560
And then we also have basic
API that works across

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:44.280
different players as well that
allows our clients to create

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.270
mobile applications that will
pull from this API and,

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.270
depending upon the player, then
can use, for example, the

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:54.540
YouTube SDK, and an iOS app,
or HLS if they want to be

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.870
delivering stuff directly from
one of their servers.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:00.070
Another really exciting thing
we've been working on now is

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:02.550
in partnership with the Google
TV team, we're working on a

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:05.250
couple apps for clients
using the new

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:07.530
YouTube SDK for Android.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:08.580
So we're excited to
get a couple of

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.140
those off the ground.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.500
And those should be coming out
in the next few weeks.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.350
And that's been an exciting
process because we're seeing a

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:18.670
lot higher adoption of users
by Google TV because it's

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:21.520
actually being embedded into new
televisions that are being

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.100
released by manufacturers.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.070
So instead of having this extra
box, it's something this

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.450
is literally built
into the TV.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:28.530
And at that point, everything's
ready to go.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.220
And you just navigate your
remote to these apps.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.028
And it's pretty exciting.

00:33:33.028 --> 00:33:33.466
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:33:33.466 --> 00:33:34.780
Great.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.852
Nice that you're
covering that.

00:33:36.852 --> 00:33:39.500
JJ BEHRENS: So I love this kind
of squirrelly question.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.880
And it's a little bit strange.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.170
But you guys think about
video a lot, right?

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:46.560
Like this is your life.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.590
So what do you think we're going
to see two years from

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:53.480
now, 10 years from now,
and 50 years from now?

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.750
KIERAN FARR: Well, I'm not sure
if we're all going to be

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.320
humans 50 years from
now, so maybe we'll

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:58.870
leave that one out.

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.770
But I think what's really
interesting coming

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:02.900
down the line are--

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.486
JJ BEHRENS: That's not
funny at Google.

00:34:05.486 --> 00:34:08.420
We get enough Borg
jokes as it is.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:12.050
KIERAN FARR: I think that, for
example, the whole concepts of

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:16.409
Google Glass and heads up
mounted displays really

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:18.980
continued to accelerate
the adoption of video.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.500
So for example, having cues
that I know that at this

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:27.239
intersection when I'm walking
down the street that this can

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:30.909
trigger a couple options for me
to see anything from well,

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:34.110
here's the cool place to
go for a cup of coffee.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.830
And because recording a video
is so easy now on all of our

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.060
mobile devices, this is
becoming so pervasive.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.190
So I think that the new mobile
in a few years will actually

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:45.610
be how do we interact with that
is our heads up displays.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.770
And that's again just
accelerating

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:48.690
this growth of video.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.940
It's not just incrementally.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:54.790
Like that's just a
whole new area.

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:55.889
JJ BEHRENS: Excellent.

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:58.430
So Jarek, I'm peeking
over at your laptop.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:00.000
It looks like we have
a lot of questions

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.990
lined up in the moderator.

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:02.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: We have
quite a few questions.

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:06.650
But maybe first we will chat
briefly about some of the new

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:08.110
branding resources we
have made available.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:08.830
JJ BEHRENS: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:10.340
Yes, let's talk branding.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.260
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Let
me just cover that.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:19.170
So for those of you that care,
we have been providing,

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:23.510
powered by YouTube, logos that
can be embedded in your

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:24.550
applications.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:27.590
Now the resources that we have
in place were created

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.970
several years ago.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:32.680
So that was really before
the explosion of mobile.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:35.030
On the previous page, we're
actually showing how to best

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:37.890
integrate the YouTube logo
into a DVD player.

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.510
So that was kind of state
of the art at the time.

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:44.570
I'm sure you guys have or used
to have one of those.

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:46.000
So the world has changed
significantly.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.070
So what we've done is we have
revamped the branding

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:51.150
resources so that if you are a
mobile application developer,

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.580
we actually have YouTube
branding that you can use in

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:55.810
your mobile application.

00:35:55.810 --> 00:36:00.160
We also made it a little more
clear about when you can use

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.390
which logo because that wasn't
really well covered in the

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.780
previous version of
the document.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:08.300
So maybe let's switch to the
page that has these resources,

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.950
and I will just quickly
walk you through it.

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:14.520
And again, if you have any
questions about this, feel

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.620
free to ping us or ask it
on the developer forum.

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:20.220
But what we have made available
is a set of

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.790
guidelines that help you
identify first of all which

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.270
logo you can use.

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:28.960
And there's actually two
different ones that we are

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:33.140
making available, the powered by
YouTube logo and the actual

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.860
YouTube logo.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.410
The way to understand the
difference when you can use

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:41.800
one versus the other is very
similar to what we have

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.120
previously captured in our
monetization guide.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:48.050
So if your application is
actually built entirely around

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:51.520
YouTube and really relies on
the YouTube content to the

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.480
point where if you remove
the YouTube content, the

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:57.810
application is no longer useful,
then we would like you

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:00.180
to use the powered
by YouTube logo.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.840
If YouTube is one of the
features of your application,

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.750
so you're integrating YouTube
content, but you're adding

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:09.880
additional content, additional
data sources, and so forth.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.100
So if you remove the YouTube
functionality, the app is

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:16.980
still largely functional, then
you can use the standard

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.260
YouTube logo.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.500
And we have a couple
of examples.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.890
For example, let's say you were
a game developer, and

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:24.280
you're integrating YouTube
apples capability.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.960
If you take it away, we would
obviously be sad.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.550
But the apples continue
working.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:31.940
And the gamers will continue
playing games.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:35.790
So it's OK in that case to use
the standard YouTube logo.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.150
We do have a couple of
things that we would

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:39.620
like you to not do.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.830
For example, build an app that
is just like YouTube and it

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.760
doesn't really add any
additional functionality.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.960
And then, on top of that, we
discourage you from actually

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.620
calling it YouTube because
then it will

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.060
just lead to confusion.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.210
So there are some of these
things that I think are very

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:57.300
straightforward, written
in plain language.

00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.530
So hopefully, you'll be able
to go through this and

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:00.360
understand.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.580
And then the part that we also
made a little more easy is if

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.490
you are actually looking
for the assets,

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:06.370
they are right here.

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:11.290
So we have the EPS AI files
that you can download and

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:15.280
scale to fit your application
needs.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.220
Another type of logo that we
also are providing is the

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:18.880
stock logo.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.120
So this is something that our
mobile developers have been

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.490
asking for quite awhile saying,
hey I'm building a

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:24.860
mobile application.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.690
The horizontal layout is really
not doing it for me

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:29.320
because of my user experience.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.770
So while we prefer that you use
the standard YouTube logo

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:35.450
because this is what the users
are familiar with, we are also

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:38.160
making the stack YouTube
logo available for you.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:41.550
And you can fetch that
from the site.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.127
So the URL is, as you can
see, developersgoogle

00:38:43.127 --> 00:38:44.600
.com/YouTube/branding.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:48.690
YouTube And if you have any
questions about these

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:52.076
guidelines, please
let us know.

00:38:52.076 --> 00:38:53.402
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:38:53.402 --> 00:38:53.850
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:56.740
And now we have received
a bunch of questions.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:01.180
So perhaps we should just switch
over to the moderator

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.100
and cover some of them.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.950
The first one is around
applications availability.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:09.940
When will we have annotations
available for mobile?

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:14.340
So no ETA right now.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.300
I think obviously mobile
is a big focus.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.840
And I wasn't able to ping our
product manager who is

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.470
actually flying in from
London this week.

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:28.480
If you would like to learn more
about what's the vision

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.360
for YouTube mobile, I would like
to encourage you to watch

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.300
our presentation from Google
I/O, where Andre who is our

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.300
product manager actually
covered his

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.850
goals for this year.

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:43.570
And the title of the session
is [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:47.240
API for Content Curators,
Creators, and Consumers.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.030
So you can look it up.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:53.380
And we will chat with him to see
if this is something that

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.130
they have any plans for.

00:39:55.130 --> 00:40:00.150
Typically, we don't actually
announce specific dates before

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.030
functionality becomes
available.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:05.480
But obviously mobile is
a big focus for us.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.870
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah it's a shame
that you weren't able to get

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:09.370
an answer to that because I
noticed that you were able to

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:13.370
email the PM during the talk
while we were focused in on

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.130
the screen.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.390
It wasn't for lack of trying.

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.830
I know that it was only the
PM that doesn't respond as

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.390
quickly as you do.

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:22.710
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: There is no
YouTube Live Developers show

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:26.280
without JJ making a joke
about me emailing.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.120
That's a [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:34.310
The second question we had was
around availability of some of

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:38.480
the YouTube features that we
make available for partners.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.980
So for example, the YouTube live
streaming, which is what

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.510
we're using right now, it's
currently not available for

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:45.340
everyone on YouTube.

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:48.870
So if you're a YouTube partner,
you can actually have

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:49.990
access to this functionality.

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:52.620
It's not rolled out to all the
partners as far as I know.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.520
So there are some restrictions,
some geographic

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.430
considerations, and so forth.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:59.440
So the way to approach that if
you are a YouTube partner,

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.530
just chat with your
partner manager.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:04.640
So typically, partners have
a resource that is made

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.630
available for them for any kind
of partner questions.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.910
And they should be able to
give you better guideline

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:13.700
about what is available,
or when it might become

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.660
available, or what needs to
happen for you to actually

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.880
have access to this
functionality.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.480
In the meantime, you're
welcome to

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.260
use Hangouts on Air.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:25.970
This is something that uses the
YouTube live streaming.

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:27.530
Infrastructure for the
live streaming

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:29.760
part works quite well.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.920
So beyond that, I think we can
probably defer you to your

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.790
department manager.

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:36.220
JJ BEHRENS: And of course,
Google plus Hangouts have an

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.890
API, which is really exciting.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.370
So you could do all kinds
of interesting things.

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:43.950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: The next
question is will we see an IOS

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:44.650
YouTube apps suit.

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:45.810
JJ BEHRENS: Ooh, ooh.

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:46.890
I want to answer this one.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:48.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, so what
I did this morning is I

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.305
was basically running around
trying to find somebody who

00:41:50.305 --> 00:41:51.920
would ask this question.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.190
And everybody basically
refused to talk to me.

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:57.900
So I couldn't get a straight
answer out of anyone.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.920
However, I did find one person--
his name is Matt--

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.070
and he works on YouTube PR.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:07.480
And he told me that-- and he was
keeping a straight face--

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.890
we are working with Apple to
offer the best possible

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:10.865
YouTube IOS experience.

00:42:10.865 --> 00:42:11.930
JJ BEHRENS: 100% true.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:15.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So this is as
far as I was able to get.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.810
So what do you think, JJ?

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:18.330
Did I do well, or is
it disappointing.

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:21.242
JJ BEHRENS: That is
100% the truth.

00:42:21.242 --> 00:42:21.700
JJ BEHRENS: All right.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.740
So unfortunately, that's
all we can cover today.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.400
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, sorry
about that.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:30.250
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Then there's a
question about video ratings

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:34.540
where someone can dislike a
video but like is not working

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.290
using the API.

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:39.610
What we would like this is maybe
some ideally some log in

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:42.970
information if you could just
post it on our forum.

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:44.020
It's strange.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:47.370
I don't think we are preventing
liking videos.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:49.380
JJ BEHRENS: It might be
interesting to see the HTTP

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:54.910
response coming back from the
servers to figure out what's

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:56.220
going on there.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.710
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Although we
just released a downer video

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:58.970
feature, and you can
only dislike it.

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:00.220
You can't like it.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:04.450
JJ BEHRENS: The world is
becoming more cynical on a

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:06.490
daily basis.

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:07.442
KIERAN FARR: It's a feature,
not a bug.

00:43:07.442 --> 00:43:10.480
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So please let
us know, give us a little

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:10.970
more information.

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:13.980
Ideally the video ID, we can
try it ourselves and see if

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.700
this is a bug or if there
something with the request

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:20.890
that is not quite right.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.210
There was a question about
that PlayStation

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:24.280
implementation.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.750
Can we add Like and Dislike
button on the YouTube

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:27.820
PlayStation app?

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.370
JJ BEHRENS: Can you get that
done before lunch, please?

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:31.340
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:35.570
So we just launched that
yesterday, I think.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:39.140
So it's nice that folks
are paying attention.

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:41.270
I have actually passed that
feedback to our product

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:43.850
manager for the PlayStation
app.

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:46.580
She has actually posted the
announcement on the

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.070
PlayStation site yesterday
and actually

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:51.130
showed it on my G+ stream.

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:53.200
So we'll definitely relay it.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.990
And if we have an update,
we'll cover that.

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:57.240
JJ BEHRENS: Thanks for
the suggestion.

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:02.540
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And then there
was a question about the

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:06.210
ability to add more than
19 playlists on the

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:07.510
main channel page.

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:10.170
JJ BEHRENS: This is because
we're using newer machine

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:12.583
architectures that are,
what is it, five bit?

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.990
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So that's
a good answer.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:22.080
OK, next question.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.750
JJ BEHRENS: We're sorry
about that.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:24.770
What's our real answer?

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:26.540
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Again, I
wasn't able to get an answer

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.150
out of our product manager who's
responsible for that.

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:32.610
I'm not sure if this is a user
experience design limitation

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.000
or just we thought that no one
would actually want to have

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.650
more than this many playlists.

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:39.590
Although even that actually
playlists have limited sizes.

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:42.520
I think we're still up
to only 200 entries.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.960
Then, it kind of makes sense for
channels that have a lot

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.130
of content.

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:47.670
We'll check that.

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:49.750
JJ BEHRENS: I definitely saw you
send an email to the PM.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:52.080
So hopefully, that's
good feedback.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.715
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Another
question is when would we be

00:44:53.715 --> 00:44:57.390
able to pin channels on the
new YouTube mobile app?

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:02.190
So if by pinning you mean the
same thing that is actually

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:05.790
available in Google Play, this
is something that to a certain

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:08.290
extent is available today.

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:09.700
It's not offline viewing.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:13.270
But you can, in fact, configure
your app to protect

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:14.780
some of your subscriptions.

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:15.620
There are some conditions.

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:20.110
I believe that the phone
has to be on wi-fi.

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:22.700
And you have to have your
power plugged in.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.440
The use case here is at night,
your phone synchronizes the

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.130
information that is needed
so that during your daily

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:30.650
commute, you can just play it
right off your SD disk.

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:34.950
Again, this is something that
Andre covered during our

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:36.400
Google I/O sessions.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.530
JJ BEHRENS: I seem to remember
this during the keynote maybe.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:39.950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: It was
mentioned during the keynote.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:41.740
And then, Andre actually went
into a little more detail

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:42.665
during our presentation.

00:45:42.665 --> 00:45:44.750
So I'll post that.

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:48.790
As far as complete offline
access, I'm not

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:49.620
aware of any plans.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.250
I think it would be rather
difficult to even implement

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:54.920
that because of some
of the ways in

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.170
which our player works.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:04.230
The next question is you could
see a live video on the

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.420
cellphone Android.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:12.230
I think if this is a question,
the way I understand this is

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:13.960
whether this is actually
possible.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:18.020
And the new YouTube Android
player API that we had

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:21.230
preannounced at Google I/O,
actually has this capability.

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:25.190
So if you were at Google I/O
and you actually downloaded

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:32.140
the Google I/O app to watch any
of the live streams, we

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:33.890
were in fact using the
YouTube player API.

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:37.360
So this is a little known
secret that the app

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.260
itslef was using it.

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:40.010
It was a very early version.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:41.980
But we were actually
using that API.

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.720
So we are actually hoping
that this is something

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:44.800
that will be supported.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.380
There are some restrictions
around which versions actually

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.520
have the capability.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:53.080
So I don't think it's going to
go back as far as the kind of

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.620
core version of the library.

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:59.560
But the capability should be
there when we release.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.210
Let's see.

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:02.150
JJ BEHRENS: So we had
some more questions

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:03.130
kind of scoot in.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:06.690
And we also had another page
full, four more on the next

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:07.420
page or something.

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:09.630
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK,
so we covered the--

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.130
let's see.

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:21.652
Let's just go over
to the next page.

00:47:25.077 --> 00:47:31.120
When will YouTube have high
quality content videos?

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.470
Now many contain low
quality content.

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:35.140
YouTube now mainly can see
low quality content.

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.830
So actually the way this works
is quite interesting.

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.520
A lot of people don't
necessarily realize it.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:45.020
So when we integrate--

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.960
when you upload your content
to YouTube, we actually ask

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.860
you to upload as high
resolution as

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.010
you possibly can.

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:55.290
In fact, we support
4K right now.

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:58.140
This is something that is not
quite there in your living

00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:59.410
room probably.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:02.850
But when it comes,
we'll be ready.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:04.790
On top of that, we actually
have search parameters.

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:08.070
So this is where if you're an
API user and so you only want

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:11.110
to have HD content in your
application, there's actually

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:13.960
a search parameter that narrows
down the list of

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.520
content to HD only.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.540
So if you don't like some of the
old [INAUDIBLE] of videos

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:21.390
that we have on YouTube, and
our know our PR is going to

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.530
kill me for that.

00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:23.700
JJ BEHRENS: Why you got
to be like that?

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.680
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Because
YouTube is more than

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:25.950
[INAUDIBLE] videos.

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:29.940
So if you want to restrict the
search results in your

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.380
application, you can
probably do that.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:34.800
And then again, if you upload
content produced content, we

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.130
actually like high resolution.

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:40.660
And we'll transcode it down to
resolutions that work on

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:43.640
various devices, mobile devices
for example, when you

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:46.555
guys are ready to pursue all the
different mobile platforms

00:48:46.555 --> 00:48:48.850
out there, we'll make sure
that it works correctly.

00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:52.130
But historically, not
all content was HD.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:54.090
YouTube has been around
for while.

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:56.690
But definitely, you can restrict
the search results

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:58.980
using the API to HD
content only.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.030
And then you will live
in an HD world.

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:02.738
You will never see a
[INAUDIBLE] video.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.850
JJ BEHRENS: I was a little bit
lost about this question

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:11.260
because there's actually like
three things going on.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.690
There's one, do we show
high quality videos

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:15.700
in the YouTube player?

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.560
And the answer is,
of course, yes.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:24.540
The second thing is does the
API return videos that are

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.480
high quality?

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.670
References to [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:28.590
answer is yes.

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:30.980
And the third is do we allow
raw access to the

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:32.000
high quality videos.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.810
And the answer is no because our
content partners wouldn't

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:38.140
like that so much.

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.310
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, as far
as the video playback, this is

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:43.660
something that comes up every
once in a while when folks

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:47.440
want to, say, force HD for
whatever reason on an embed

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:51.210
that is of a small size where
it doesn't really

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:52.680
make a lot of sense.

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:55.290
So this is where we--

00:49:55.290 --> 00:49:57.200
and I guess two player actually
we used to support an

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:02.675
HD param which would
attempt to play HD.

00:50:02.675 --> 00:50:07.980
And now, what we are actually
doing is something that is

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:11.160
slightly different where we
would like to be intelligent

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:15.340
about the play back and make the
best determination based

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.040
on the number of factors.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:20.200
If you really feel like you have
to have HD, and you don't

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:25.450
actually have an embed that
has the height of 720p, so

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:27.160
actually one video of HD.

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.390
But if you really have
to do that, you can

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:29.320
still use the API.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.430
So you can actually set this to
just a play back quality.

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:36.370
And this is something that we
support in our iFrame API,

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:39.350
which by the way is now
the supported API

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:41.140
for the YouTube player.

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:44.270
You can actually set it and
try to overwrite it there.

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:47.940
Yeah, so that's a
good question.

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:51.410
Any other questions, JJ,
that we should cover?

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:52.930
JJ BEHRENS: I'm looking.

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:54.545
Here's one that looks like--

00:50:54.545 --> 00:50:55.100
oh, geez.

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.510
It just disappeared--

00:50:57.510 --> 00:51:00.080
the link object of the movies
feed in the YouTube API

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.720
contains invalid links.

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.960
And it looks like some PHP--

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.830
so there's entries,
sub zero link self

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:10.220
leads to a 404 error.

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:11.910
Is there something
I'm missing?

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:13.150
Anyway, great API.

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:15.900
I love the second half
of that sentence.

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:17.980
I'm a total sucker
for flattery.

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.250
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, I think
it would be great to get

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:22.450
some more info on the forum,
ideally maybe the response,

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:23.290
the video ID.

00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:26.090
That always helps us so that
we can try to debug it.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.460
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, definitely the
video ID and posting it to

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.570
our forum, we could probably
debug that.

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:33.160
JJ, I have a question.

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.770
And I forgot to add it
to the moderator.

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:36.663
And my question is--

00:51:36.663 --> 00:51:37.350
you ready?

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:38.760
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah.

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.620
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: You
really ready?

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:42.830
OK, the question is YouTube
Developer Relations hiring?

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:46.660
JJ BEHRENS: That's
a great question.

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:50.110
And the answer is
absolutely yes.

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:52.480
So yes, YouTube Developer
Relations is hiring.

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.800
And so if you're as good looking
and fast with email as

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.120
Jarek is, we'll--

00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.550
or maybe even if you're not as
good at email as Jarek is,

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.560
we're definitely interested
in talking with you.

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.200
In fact, Developer Relations
across all

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.690
of Google is hiring.

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:11.250
And we're also hiring software
engineers like crazy.

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:13.830
Send me email directly.

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:16.100
We get referrals, bonuses
and stuff.

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.110
But yes.

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:23.020
And I would say that of all the
15 billion startups I've

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:24.470
worked for--

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:25.380
Google's not a startup--

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.210
but Google's the best company
I've ever worked for.

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:30.330
So I like it here.

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:31.750
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Good answer, JJ.

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:32.080
Thank you.

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:32.810
JJ BEHRENS: Thanks.

00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:33.120
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.550
I think we are out of time.

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:37.320
So we'll probably wrap
it up for today.

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.000
JJ BEHRENS: VidCaster,
thank you guys for

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.610
coming, Kieran and Jiang.

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:41.650
KIERAN FARR: Thanks a lot.

00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:42.700
JJ BEHRENS: It was awesome.

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.320
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And we'll
see you next week.

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.840
JJ BEHRENS: Thanks
for coming, guys.

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.088
Yeah, we'll see you next week.

00:52:48.088 --> 00:53:15.467
