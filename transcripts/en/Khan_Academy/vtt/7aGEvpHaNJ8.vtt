00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.780
So given this diagram,
we need to figure out

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.910
what the length of CF
right over here is.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.910
And you might already
guess that this

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.560
will have to do something
with similar triangles,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:18.190
because at least it looks that
triangle CFE is similar to ABE.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.119
And the intuition there is it's
kind of embedded inside of it,

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.910
and we're going to
prove that to ourselves.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.460
And it also looks
like triangle CFB

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.509
is going to be similar
to triangle DEB,

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.800
but once again, we're going
to prove that to ourselves.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.030
And then maybe we can
deal with all the ratios

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.340
of the different sides
to CF right over here

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.590
and then actually figure
out what CF is going to be.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.220
So first, let's prove to
ourselves that these definitely

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.600
are similar triangles.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.020
So you have this
90-degree angle in ABE,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.790
and then you have this
90-degree angle in CFE.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.620
If we can prove just one
other angle or one other set

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.430
of corresponding angles
is congruent in both,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.120
then we've proved
that they're similar.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.800
And there we can either show
that, look, they both share

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.420
this angle right over here.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.672
Angle CEF is the
same as angle AEB.

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:12.650
So we've shown two corresponding
angles in these triangles.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.650
This is an angle
in both triangles.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.510
They are congruent,
so the triangles

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.610
are going to be similar.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.190
You can also show that this
line is parallel to this line,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.330
because obviously these
two angles are the same.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.824
And so these angles
will also be the same.

00:01:24.824 --> 00:01:26.490
So they're definitely
similar triangles,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.860
so let's just write that down.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.090
Get that out of the way.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:38.150
We know that triangle ABE
is similar to triangle CFE.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.800
And you want to make sure you
get it in the right order.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.630
F is where the
90-degree angle is.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.260
B is where the
90-degree angle is,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.680
and then E is where
this orange angle is.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.090
So CFE.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.751
It's similar to triangle CFE.

00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:54.250
Now let's see if we can figure
out that same statement going

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.470
the other way, looking
at triangle DEB.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.147
So once again, you have
a 90-degree angle here.

00:02:02.147 --> 00:02:03.730
If this is 90, then
this is definitely

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.170
going to be 90, as well.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.870
You have a 90-degree
angle here at CFB.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.560
You have a 90-degree
angle at DEF or DEB,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.070
however you want to call it.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.615
So they have one set
of corresponding angles

00:02:15.615 --> 00:02:17.550
that are congruent,
and then you'll

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.930
also see that they both share
this angle right over here

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.270
on the smaller triangle.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.420
So I'm now looking at this
triangle right over here,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.120
as opposed to the
one on the right.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.510
So they both share this
angle right over here.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.710
Angle DBE is the
same as angle CBF.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.080
So I've shown you
already that we

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.080
have this angle is
congruent to this angle,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.420
and we have this angle
is a part of both.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.940
So it's obviously
congruent to itself.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.620
So we have two
corresponding angles

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.350
that are congruent
to each other.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.330
So we know that this
larger triangle over here

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.740
is similar to this smaller
triangle over there.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.260
So let me write this down.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.820
Scroll over to the
right a little bit.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:13.510
We also know that triangle DEB
is similar to triangle CFB.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.382
Now, what can we do from here?

00:03:20.382 --> 00:03:22.590
Well, we know that the ratios
of corresponding sides,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.960
for each of those
similar triangles,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.690
they're going to
have to be the same.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.840
But we only have one side
of one of the triangles.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.180
So in the case of ABE and CFE,
we've only been given one side.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.170
In the case of
DEB and CFB, we've

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.140
only been given one
side right over here,

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.176
so there doesn't seem to
be a lot to work with.

00:03:40.176 --> 00:03:42.300
And this is why this is a
slightly more challenging

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.930
problem here.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.635
Let's just go ahead and see if
we can assume one of the sides,

00:03:46.635 --> 00:03:48.010
and actually,
maybe a side that's

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.660
shared by both of
these larger triangles.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.320
And then maybe things
will work out from there.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.660
So let's just assume that
this length right over here--

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.300
let's just assume
that BE is equal to y.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.790
So let me just write this down.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.980
This whole length is
going to be equal to y,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.350
because this at least gives
us something to work with.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.080
And y is shared by both ABE
and DEB, so that seems useful.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.120
And then we're going to have
to think about the smaller

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.740
triangles right over there.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.690
So maybe we'll call BF x.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.490
Let's call BF x.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.635
And then let's
FE-- well, if this

00:04:26.635 --> 00:04:28.320
is x, then this is y minus x.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.320
So we've introduced a
bunch of variables here.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.800
But maybe with all the
proportionalities and things

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.654
maybe, just maybe,
things will work out.

00:04:36.654 --> 00:04:38.570
Or at least we'll have
a little bit more sense

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.750
of where we can go with
this actual problem.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.210
But now we can start dealing
with the similar triangles.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.590
For example, so we want
to figure out what CF is.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.130
We now know that for these
two triangles right here,

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.300
the ratio of the corresponding
sides are going to be constant.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.620
So for example, the
ratio between CF and 9,

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.140
their corresponding
sides, has got

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.220
to be equal to the
ratio between y

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.620
minus x-- that's that
side right there--

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.706
and the corresponding side
of the larger triangle.

00:05:15.706 --> 00:05:17.830
Well, the corresponding
side of the larger triangle

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.880
is this entire length.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.330
And that entire length
right over there is y.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.440
So it's equal to
y minus x over y.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.416
So we could simplify
this a little bit.

00:05:29.416 --> 00:05:30.790
Well, I'll hold
off for a second.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.456
Let's see if we can
do something similar

00:05:32.456 --> 00:05:33.910
with this thing on the right.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.320
So once again, we have CF,
its corresponding side on DEB.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.370
So now we're looking at
the triangle CFB, not

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.730
looking at triangle CFE anymore.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.530
So now when we're
looking at this triangle,

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.556
CF corresponds to DE.

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:59.940
So we have CF over DE is going
to be equal to x-- let me

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.670
do that in a different color.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.280
I'm using all my colors.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:12.490
It's going to be equal to
x over this entire base

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.680
right over here, so this entire
BE, which once again, we know

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.070
is y.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.681
So over y.

00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:20.430
And now this looks
interesting, because it

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.410
looks like we have
three unknowns.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.210
Sorry, we know
what DE is already.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.960
This is 12.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.980
I could have written CF over 12.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.730
The ratio between
CF and 12 is going

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.920
to be the ratio between x and y.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.160
So we have three unknowns
and only two equations,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.866
so it seems hard
to solve at first,

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:40.740
because there's one
unknown, another unknown,

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.860
another unknown, another
unknown, another unknown,

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.360
and another unknown.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.560
But it looks like I can
write this right here,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.010
this expression, in
terms of x over y,

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.510
and then we could
do a substitution.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.134
So that's why this
was a little tricky.

00:06:52.134 --> 00:06:56.900
So this one right here-- let me
do it in that same green color.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:03.650
We can rewrite it as CF over 9
is equal to y minus x over y.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.190
It's the same thing as
y over y minus x over y,

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.770
or 1 minus x over y.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.160
All I did is, I essentially,
I guess you could say,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.810
distributed the 1 over y
times both of these terms.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:21.310
So y over y minus x over
y, or 1 minus x minus y.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:26.770
And this is useful, because
we already know what x over y

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:27.670
is equal to.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.060
We already know that x over
y is equal to CF over 12.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.250
So this right over here, I can
replace with this, CF over 12.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.060
So then we get-- this is the
home stretch here-- CF, which

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:47.220
is what we care about, CF over 9
is equal to 1 minus CF over 12.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.550
And now we have one
equation with one unknown,

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.820
and we should be able to
solve this right over here.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.805
So we could add CF
over 12 to both sides,

00:07:53.805 --> 00:08:00.700
so you have CF over 9 plus
CF over 12 is equal to 1.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.360
We just have to find a
common denominator here,

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.450
and I think 36
will do the trick.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.490
So 9 times 4 is 36, so if you
have to multiply 9 times 4,

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.880
you have to multiply CF times 4.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.790
So you have 4CF.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.830
4CF over 36 is the same
thing as CF over 9,

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:25.060
and then plus CF over 12 is
the same thing as 3CF over 36.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.560
And this is going
to be equal to 1.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:34.460
And then we are left with
4CF plus 3CF is 7CF over 36

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.900
is equal to 1.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.760
And then to solve for
CF, we can multiply

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.539
both sides times the
reciprocal of 7 over 36.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:44.210
So 36 over 7.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.160
Multiply both sides
times that, 36 over 7.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.200
This side, things cancel out.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.350
And we are left with--
we get our drum roll now.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.880
So all of this
stuff cancels out.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:04.830
CF is equal to 1 times 36
over 7, or just 36 over 7.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.810
And this was a
pretty cool problem,

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.630
because what it shows you
is if you have two things--

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.350
let's say this thing is some
type of a pole or a stick

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.490
or maybe the wall of a building,
or who knows what it is--

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.630
if this is 9 feet tall or 9
yards tall or 9 meters tall,

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.180
and this over here,
this other one,

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.630
is 12 meters tall or 12 yards or
whatever units you want to use,

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.680
if you were to drape a string
from either of them to the base

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.230
of the other, from the top
of one of them to the base

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.880
of the other--

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.970
regardless of how far
apart these two things

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.060
are going to be-- we just
decided they're y apart.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.180
Regardless of how
far apart they are,

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.950
the place where those two
strings would intersect

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.990
are going to be 36/7
high, or 5 and 1/7

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.320
high, regardless of
how far they are.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.760
So I think that was a
pretty cool problem.
