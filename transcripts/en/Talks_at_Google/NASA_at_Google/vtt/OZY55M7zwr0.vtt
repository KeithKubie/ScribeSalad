00:00:01.205 --> 00:00:02.580
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thanks for coming

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.730
to one of the latest of our
talks for our NASA series.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.410
Today we have Dr.
Dave Korsmeyer.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.760
Am I saying it correctly?

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.330
He mentioned when we
walked in that he probably

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.730
used to work with 20
to 30 current Googlers.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.460
So you may know him already.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.790
Dave is the director of
engineering at NASA Ames.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.900
He was previously the chief of
NASA Ames Intelligent Systems

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.900
Division.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.070
He led the near-Earth object
mission concept studies

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.570
for NASA, directly supported
President Obama's 2009

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.640
human space flight review, and
was part of the human space

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.490
flight architecture
teams technology panel.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.940
Dave received his BS in
aerospace engineering

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.900
from Penn State,
his MS and Ph.D.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.300
in astrodynamics from the
University of Texas at Austin.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.056
We got some fans back here.

00:00:50.056 --> 00:00:52.160
That's a lot of schooling.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.881
DAVE KORSMEYER:
Couldn't get enough.

00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:56.910
FEMALE SPEAKER: Dave is also
a Sloan fellow with a master's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.210
in Business Management
from Stanford Graduate

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.980
School of Business.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.904
Without further ado,
here is Dave Korsmeyer.

00:01:04.904 --> 00:01:07.070
After, we're going to leave
some time for questions.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.660
And we do ask that you use
the microphone over here when

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.850
you ask the question, so people
on the live stream can hear.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.350
Thank you.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.683
DAVE KORSMEYER: Thank you, Mary.

00:01:14.683 --> 00:01:15.370
Appreciate it.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.850
Yeah, I am addicted
to schooling.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.726
So just that's my own personal
foible, with apologies.

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:22.100
Thanks everybody,
for showing up.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.130
I'm either your afternoon, after
lunch talk or your after lunch

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.090
nap.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.600
If you're going to
nap, do it quietly.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.862
Drool with the
best of intentions.

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:33.570
What I'm going to talk
to you about today

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.440
is these little
babies, to some degree.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.090
And let's start, because
I find hands-on stuff

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.840
gives you something to do.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.760
Take a look at these,
pass them around,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.470
and then occasionally
listen to what I'm saying.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.670
What's going on is actually
a disruption in my industry.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.580
My industry is aerospace, is
space missions in particular.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.210
And what we've got is
we've got a new-- not so

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.340
new, but new to NASA form
factor called CubeSats.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.660
And what exactly is it CubeSat?

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.229
We used to call them nanosats.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.170
And then that just
didn't sound cool enough,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.710
so everybody calls
them CubeSats.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.220
It actually came out as
a university concept.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.910
Stanford and Cal
Poly came up with it.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.160
1U is a 10 centimeter
by 10 centimeter

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.520
by 10 centimeter cube.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.130
Think four inches square, for
those of you still on imperial.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.430
And that qualifies
as a U, a unit.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.880
So if you look on
your left, you got 1U.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.590
That's what you're
holding right now.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.580
And 3U is linear, three
of them put together.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.020
6U is a 2 by 3 by 1 box.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.850
Think of a toaster oven.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.520
Those are the common
denominator sizes

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.150
for what we call
CubeSats these days.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.260
So even though a 6U is 6U,
we still call it a CubeSat.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.960
You see why I like
nanosat, but I'm not

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.877
the guy that gets
to set these things.

00:03:04.877 --> 00:03:06.460
You'll notice as you
pass these around

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.950
also, the weight the comparable
weight of these things--

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.180
the one over here on
the side is probably

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.230
about a full kilo and a half.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.810
That's probably about 500 grams.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.690
So the range of these is, we'll
pack them as dense as we can,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.510
because it is actually the
volume that is constraining us.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.310
And I'll tell you a little bit
why about that in a minute.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.400
So when you think of NASA and
you think of mission types,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.710
I came across this analogy
and I kind of like it.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.180
There's three types.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.730
There's the grandfather
clock, which is big and fancy,

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.045
elegant, expansive, handcrafted.

00:03:42.045 --> 00:03:46.280
You have to have a team of
experts, takes years to build,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.110
takes experts to repair.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.290
Think of the International
Space Station.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.640
Manned missions are like that.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.266
We can do them.

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:53.015
They're beautiful.

00:03:53.015 --> 00:03:53.820
They're phenomenal.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.510
Everyone wants them
in their house.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.710
Few people can afford it.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.050
Then we get Swiss clocks.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.050
Those are those cool things that
sit on your parents' mantle.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.740
They're nice.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.830
They're very expensive.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.590
They're handcrafted, built by
a bunch of really sharp people

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.770
off in Switzerland,
do great things.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.250
They also are very
expensive, but are

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.460
smaller and more efficient.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.020
Think of our robotic science.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.170
Think of the Mars
Rovers for that.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.600
Now that traditionally has been
what NASA has been able to do.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.850
That's what we do.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.940
There is again, this disruption.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.570
We're getting into
the point where

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.010
the available commercial-grade,
consumer-grade technologies are

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.090
able to fulfill space
missions for us, now

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.210
at a much greatly
reduced cost, which

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.940
means we can do a
lot more of them.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.500
And that's the quartz watches.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.260
Think the Swatch.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.990
If you guys are young or
old enough to remember that,

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.107
I do, unfortunately.

00:04:47.107 --> 00:04:47.690
Mass-produced.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.405
Now I know nobody has watches.

00:04:49.405 --> 00:04:50.780
I could have said
the cell phone.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.070
It would have been just fine.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.030
I probably will change it out.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.790
But they have actually much
more limited functionality,

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.420
where the functionality
is enabled

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.010
on software versus
actual hardware.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.900
And you can mass-produce
them to some degree,

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.210
or they are availably made out
of mass-produced components.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.800
And that's what CubeSats are.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.780
And that's what
they're supposed to be.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.370
And NASA is coming
to terms with,

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.450
what are we going
to do with that?

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.780
Because it's a different
model, a different perspective

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.450
for how we've done space
exploration in the past.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.020
One of the things
we have done is

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.478
we've created a thing called
the CubeSat Launch Initiative.

00:05:27.478 --> 00:05:31.750
This actually started as an
educational outreach model

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.610
where, as I said,
this form factor

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.240
came out of the
university basis.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.810
Sounds good.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.760
You're going to
build a satellite.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.500
Wonderful!

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.560
You put that together
in some senior design

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.070
class or graduate degree
class, or whatever you've done.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.736
Now what?

00:05:45.736 --> 00:05:47.452
How do you get it into space?

00:05:47.452 --> 00:05:49.410
Are you going to build
your own launch vehicle?

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.650
OK.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.160
That's still a little bit
harder than the average bear

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.360
can pull off.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.270
So what happens is, it
turns out that there's

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.110
a bunch of agencies,
DoD being one,

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.180
NASA being a huge one
are intelligent agencies

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.950
and commercial launch that
launch into space all the time.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.790
There's launches every
couple weeks, actually.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.480
If you go online, you
can just Google it

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.640
and you'll see that
there literally

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.131
are launches all the time.

00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:17.880
The interesting thing
about those launches

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.280
is they aren't full.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.840
Why?

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.610
Because you're designing
these big spacecraft,

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.150
either commercial
telecom bird that's

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.320
relaying the internet
around or dish or whatever,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.260
or exploration missions
that we've got on NASA,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.462
and you design with a 10%
or 15% percent margin.

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:38.670
Because you really don't
know what's going to happen.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.740
So what happens when you've
delivered to the pad,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.220
you end up and you've
got this big faring,

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.110
and you've got this
little teeny spacecraft.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.450
And you've got this
big launch rocket.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.340
And you've got this
little teeny spacecraft.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.080
And you probably got a
couple tens to hundreds

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.560
to thousands of
kilograms of extra mass

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.760
you could throw into space, and
several cubic meters of space

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.380
you could throw into
space-- of volume,

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.150
I mean, you could
throw up into space.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.180
So what they came up with was
the idea that by standardizing

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.250
on this form factor, you
could create little dispensers

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.880
that you would mount
in the launch vehicles

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.300
and they would be called
secondary payloads.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.540
And so you would just show up.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.280
The big launcher would
show up, the big spacecraft

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.620
would show up, and
the university student

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.020
would show up with
their small satellite

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.680
and say, OK-- not literally the
day of, but six months ahead,

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.900
say-- and say, OK,
I want to ride.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.080
I know mine is this
size, is this volume,

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.280
behaves in this way, and you
can stick it in your launcher.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.990
And after you deploy
the main satellite,

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.350
you can pop this off.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.110
So it's a free ride.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.850
That worked so well, this
CubeSat Launch Initiative

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:59.270
has basically started signing
up people started in 2009,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.870
and has been
progressively going.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.440
As I said, it's a simple matter
of, you design the spacecraft,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.600
you build it, this dispenser
here is called a peapod.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.300
It can handle up to
three-- this one right here

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.750
can handle up to
three 1U CubeSats.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.640
The 1U CubeSats are just that.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.680
They're kind of toys.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.730
By the time you put
in any instrumentation

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.280
or any actual tools that are
of value to the engineering

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.540
or science or
technological community,

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.900
you really need like
3U of volume, which is,

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.930
say, a small toaster.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.460
And we're getting to a
point where we're commonly

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.500
flying 6U of volume,
which is a toaster oven.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.860
So you put it in the known
dispenser, which has already

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.830
got all the mountings,
you launch it off.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.610
It deploys once in space.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.692
And then students
or a NASA center

00:08:48.692 --> 00:08:50.150
can communicate
with the spacecraft

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.000
and get the science or
technology demonstration

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.990
or engineering done.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.700
It became a very viable model.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.730
Now what happened is the
students and universities

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.250
started doing that and
were doing great stuff.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.970
They were getting really good
technical papers out of it.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.990
And frankly, the
NASA guys said, hey,

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.950
there's something going on here.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.520
Look at all these people
that are making use of it.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.250
We've got from 2009
to 2014, we did,

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.980
I think, six CLSI selections.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:25.000
And we made 114 selections for
114 different satellite systems

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.060
at universities that are going
to deploy, and lined them up

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.410
and told them when
they're going to fly.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.950
And so they're off and running.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.200
NASA decided, well, there's
something wrong with that.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.810
We're missing out.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.980
Because look at the numbers.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.330
There's a huge number
of proposals, 150,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.750
but we select over
2/3 of them, 109.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.980
We've only flown a fifth of
them right now, say, or a third

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.620
of those selected, 34, and
we've got another 14 manifested.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.680
So there's a lot coming online.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.920
There's a lot happening.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.810
And we realized that
we're not alone.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:03.970
This is a different view.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.370
Again, forgive.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.750
It's a NASA chart, so
there's acronyms everywhere.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.120
Take the following out of it.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.300
The rightmost column
here is the number

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:17.730
of CubeSats being deployed as
a secondary, as extra volume

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.690
on a mainline mission.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:24.820
The CLSI moniker here are the
ones that NASA helped sponsor.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:31.110
The other ones, like, say
International Space Station

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.090
which has got NanoRacks, a
commercial company that kind of

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.930
spun out of doing
some NASA business now

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.910
launches 28 CubeSats a pop.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.020
Actually, more than 28.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.710
48 CubeSats a pop
on their dispenser

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.050
up off of the International
Space Station.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.880
So there's a huge volume that
doesn't come through NASA.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.760
It goes up through other
means on other launch vehicles

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.560
and does excellent work.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.800
Now again, what
does this give you?

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.160
Why would NASA care about
something like this?

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.080
It's supposed to be an
educational activity.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.920
Something that trains up
engineers and scientists.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.210
It's STEM.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.790
Why does NASA care?

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.860
Well, turns out we
stumbled across,

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.350
there's really easy
frequent access to space--

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:18.770
a lot more than people think.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.390
Getting a launch,
I can get anybody

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.180
who wants to build a
CubeSat here launched

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.920
in six months to a year.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.620
Not a problem.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.430
I can get you a ride.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.960
Very easy, frequent
access to space.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.070
It gives you the ability to
basically rapidly respond

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.710
to a mission you want to do.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.060
Right now, if you
do a mainline NASA

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.990
mission, or a mainline
NOAA weather mission,

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.820
or a DoD something, you're
starting on a three to five

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.250
year journey.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.950
Hands down.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:47.450
Easy.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.820
And that's after you've
won the proposal.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.470
It's going to take you three
to five years to actually put

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.570
together the science,
the spacecraft,

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.920
do all your design, all your
engineering, all your analysis,

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.620
go through the long
paperwork process that

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.017
will pretty much guarantee
you a successful mission.

00:12:05.017 --> 00:12:06.600
But it's going to
take you five years.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.900
You're biting a big hunk of
your life on any given mission.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.760
If you just want to do some
quick and dirty analysis,

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.040
do some easy measurements,
do some rapid response-type

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.290
technology demonstrations,
this is tremendously much more

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:23.880
interesting.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.110
Because we're talking
a cycle time of

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.610
say 18 to 36 months,
maybe 1 and 1/2

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.670
to 3 years of the
whole life cycle,

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.600
of coming up with the
idea, of flying it,

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.620
and then getting
the analysis back.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.290
A lot quicker time cycle.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.380
If you want to re-fly
it, we've done re-flights

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.280
in six months, where we've
designed, built it, flown it,

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.170
went, it didn't
work quite right,

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.150
changed a piece on
backup hardware,

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.260
rebuilt it again,
flown it again.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.160
So we get a very rapid response.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.540
And frankly, these are
relatively low-cost missions.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.250
Now again, I work
for the government,

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:02.930
so relatively low cost
missions is just that.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.540
It's on the order
of a million or two.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.020
Sometimes $10 million for the
non-recurring engineering,

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.300
if you're designing
something for the first time.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.550
For a university, though, they
can build a $50K to $100K.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.740
Now that's a lot for
a university, I yield.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.910
But they can build that
class of a spacecraft,

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:23.790
get it launched in somebody's
masters degree program,

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.680
get the data back, and
allow them to graduate.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.820
That's pretty impressive.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.210
And then you actually get
a whole class of people

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.260
out to graduate.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.860
So what happened is,
NASA woke up to this.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.860
Aviation Week, which is
one of those great trade

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.570
magazines that is
particular to my genre,

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.250
came out and said,
whoa, look out,

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.690
small satellites
doing more with less.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.810
You notice this
small one right here

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.660
is one we built at NASA Ames.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.660
We actually deployed it.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.060
It was the first US
CubeSat deployed off

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.660
of the space station.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.440
And we just did
that back in 2012.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.000
October 4, 2012 we deployed it.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.930
So what NASA's
doing is realizing,

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:09.370
this is an opportunity
to do different things

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.560
and different form
factors for less.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.290
Now what's NASA's mission?

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.130
Just to rehash for
you people that

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.740
don't read our strategic
plan every day.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.290
We're here to do science.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.330
We're here to do
technology development.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.390
We're here to do exploration
of the solar system.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.030
And we're here to do, basically,
public outreach-- STEM, science

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.900
technology education,
engineering and math.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:36.890
That's part of what our--
your tax dollars are doing.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.100
That's why you're
paying me to do this.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.840
It turns out that NASA
Ames, fortuitously, we

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.070
were the first one to
jump on this bandwagon,

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.170
in part because we're one of
the smaller research centers,

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.050
in part because we
had some people that

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.340
worked with the Stanford
and Cal Poly groups

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.950
that came up with this
standard, and in part

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.130
because we were just lucky.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.110
Dumb luck.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:03.030
So right now, we actually
lead NASA as an agency

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.130
in doing small and
nanosat missions.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.790
And you'll see
that we're actually

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:12.090
getting into more and more
of it as time goes on.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.700
One of the things you
can see from this chart,

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.360
it was a slow start.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.720
And again, NASA
vernacular is, we all

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.360
have to come up
with a cool name.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.850
And CubeSat semantics
means you have

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.720
to have "Sat" at the end of
your name, with apologies.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.140
So we have GeneSat
and PharmaSat.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.670
NanoSail-- there's a
sale involved, right?

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:36.470
OK.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.840
You can kind of get all these,
TechEdSat, KickSat, EcAMSat.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.750
We started out slow.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:46.820
2006 was the first peer-reviewed
science publication satellite

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.039
that NASA did.

00:15:48.039 --> 00:15:49.080
Now why does that matter?

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.240
NASA is a science and
engineering organization.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.010
Our reason for existing is
promulgating good science

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.480
and engineering about
aerospace science,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.680
space technology, et cetera.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.950
What says that
something is of value

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:08.400
is having a published paper
in a peer-reviewed journal.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.720
That's what matters.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.030
For other people it's money.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.020
For NASA, our
currency is citations.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.240
Google Scholar's great.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.540
Go find your citations.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.950
That's what we live on.

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.700
So getting peer-reviewed,
publishable science

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:26.390
out of small CubeSats has
been a huge change for NASA.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.880
And it's been a huge change for
the rest of the US government

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.172
space industry.

00:16:31.172 --> 00:16:33.630
So we're doing a whole bunch--
you can see as time goes by,

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.310
we're paying out more
and more and more.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.790
My organization is the
engineering organization

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.700
at NASA Ames.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.370
And that's pretty much what
we spend our time doing.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.850
This and larger
small satellites,

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.190
like LADEE and LCROSS
and other things

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.050
that have recently
been around the moon.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.310
So let me tell you about
some of the different areas

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.920
of particular scientific
and engineering interests

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.980
that we're involved in, that are
making use of, again, this form

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.800
factor.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.920
One of the things we work
on specifically at NASA Ames

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.770
is space biology.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.609
Now what's the difference
between life sciences and space

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:15.020
biology?

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:15.520
OK.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.632
Let me tell you.

00:17:17.632 --> 00:17:20.720
When we say life
sciences, normally in NASA

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.220
we talk about how the astronauts
work and breathe and do

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.178
great stuff on the
International Space Station.

00:17:25.178 --> 00:17:25.847
That's great.

00:17:25.847 --> 00:17:27.430
That's kind of being
a medical doctor,

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.890
tracking them,
finding clinically

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.460
what makes them
good, how to manage

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.950
their allergies in
space, or whatever.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.560
Space biology is actually
understanding the function

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.900
of how a biological system
operates in microgravity, zero

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.950
gravity and a high
radiation environment.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.410
Again, why do we
care about that?

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:46.740
Well, guess what?

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.720
We are in the best
possible protective bubble

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.720
you could ever imagine
here on the planet Earth.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.330
We've got this great
big rock underneath us

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.020
that gives us the gravity.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:03.350
we've got this wonderful,
thick-- not that thick,

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.880
but relatively thick
atmospheric shell,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.480
and we've got a molten
core of a planet that

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.060
is spinning to give us
this huge magnetic bubble,

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.980
so that we are
protected from all

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.660
the alpha and beta particles--
most of them, anyway--

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.110
that come flying out
of the sun and coming

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.710
from the cosmic
background radiation.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.489
It turns out we're a great
place for life to exist.

00:18:25.489 --> 00:18:26.155
Go look outside.

00:18:26.155 --> 00:18:28.860
It's a beautiful
day, lots of life.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.230
Do we know-- this is a question.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.260
This is a quiz.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.490
You can know the answer, right?

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.900
Do we know whether life
can exist elsewhere?

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.790
Do we know?

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:40.330
Anybody?

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.290
Anybody?

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:42.850
All right.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:45.280
I'll leave it for the
people online to vote.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.230
No, we don't know.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.730
We suspect, absolutely.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.040
But we do not know.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.710
What we do know is that
we can do two things.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.250
We can send people to the
moon for about seven days

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.740
and they won't
croak immediately.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.420
And we can have six astronauts
live in orbit for about

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.850
a year long, and they
won't croak immediately.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:09.230
Do we know that you
can put up a plant

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.720
and have it actually grow,
flower, fertilize the flower,

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.020
drop a seed, germinate,
and grow another plant?

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:17.540
Guess what?

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.820
We don't know.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.640
We don't know that.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.900
Do we know that we can send
out brewer's yeast out past

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.640
the Earth's magnetic bubble
and the yeast will actually

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.050
propagate-- grow, live,
die, and create all

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.014
that lovely yeasty smell
you get when you make bread.

00:19:34.014 --> 00:19:34.680
Do we know that?

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.638
No, we don't know that.

00:19:35.638 --> 00:19:38.740
We know so incredibly little
about how life will actually

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.010
exist outside of our
protective bubble.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.090
This is why we do this.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.110
So it turns out nanosats
were made for this.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.640
CubeSats were made for this.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.200
These are perfect.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.940
We do these little
things, basically,

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.650
like, about this big.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:59.080
Little, micro-fluidic systems,
little pumps, little wells,

00:19:59.080 --> 00:19:59.857
little drip lines.

00:19:59.857 --> 00:20:01.440
Of course we have
to adapt to the fact

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.380
that you're in
zero g or micro g.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.330
And all of these systems are
custom-built to basically grow

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:11.110
different types of bacteria,
different types of yeast,

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.120
sea monkeys, you name it.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.090
We've done it, and
we're doing it all.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.590
Spores-- we have this little,
spinning, zero g, artificial

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.550
variable g disk that
does spore things.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.120
We do e. coli stuff.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.750
Great things,
fascinating science,

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.630
and because it's so
poorly understood,

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.490
a wonderful venue for us to
do exploration activities.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:35.520
And it works out really well
that the CubeSats, which--

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.380
please don't take them
home; give them back to me--

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.590
are really a good venue
and a good opportunity

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:43.920
to do this science in.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.220
One of the other
areas we work on

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.700
is we've got this really big,
expensive, fancy, multi-billion

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.910
dollar system up there
called Space Station.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:21:00.125
We just gave it the thumbs-up
for another five years.

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:02.250
Probably it will go another
eight years after that.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.390
So 2020 is the baseline.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.990
We'll probably go to 2028.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.900
And then what we do?

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.029
I don't know.

00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:10.820
But we've got a big
space station up there.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.900
Space station has
gone from being

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.330
the building you built
to now being the research

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.160
lab you're trying to stock.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.970
So lots and lots of different
science activities-- material

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.970
science, biological
science, some of the stuff I

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.550
talked about before, life
science, all sorts of things.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:30.860
Crystal growth, and then a whole
bunch of actual space science

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.230
are going on up there.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.020
It turns out one
of the things that

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.440
is very hard to do right
now is either a, getting up

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.761
to space station, or b, getting
back from space station.

00:21:40.761 --> 00:21:42.260
So when you get up
to space station,

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.060
everyone understands that.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:43.490
That's hard.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.300
You gotta get on a rocket.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.841
Right now we're
buying Russian stuff.

00:21:45.841 --> 00:21:48.450
We're hopefully going to
buy our own stuff soon.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.630
Getting back-- how do you get
something back from space?

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.610
Right now, you basically
can take something

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.680
that's about the size
of these three chairs,

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.770
you cram three people in
them, and you give them

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.601
each about 10 kilos they
can hold onto their chest.

00:22:02.601 --> 00:22:03.850
And that's how they come back.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.349
That's how the
astronauts come back.

00:22:05.349 --> 00:22:06.120
That's returned.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.850
Return's what they
held in their hands.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:12.080
So we're talking very
little volume returns.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.320
And how often do they return?

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.110
They return about once every
six months, three to six months.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.580
So if you want something
down from station,

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.844
you're not going to get it.

00:22:19.844 --> 00:22:20.510
What do they do?

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.010
They flash freeze it.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.892
They literally have
flash freezers up there.

00:22:23.892 --> 00:22:26.100
They flash freeze it, or
they just put it to the side

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.560
and they wait.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.909
So there's a driving need to
get what we call down mass.

00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:33.950
How to get something down
from the space station?

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:37.300
Well, it turns out again,
for the mysteriously now lost

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.762
CubeSats, they're a great
form factor for that.

00:22:41.762 --> 00:22:44.220
We've started doing deployments
off the International Space

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.100
Station, and doing what
we call an exobreak.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:52.360
An exobreak is a fancy way of
saying Mary Poppins' umbrella.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:52.860
Right?

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.990
You pop a shoot.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:59.590
You increase the area, and
the very tenuous atmosphere

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.310
up there slows you much
more rapidly than if you

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.810
were a small,
relatively dense box.

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:06.931
OK?

00:23:06.931 --> 00:23:08.930
So the idea is, we're
going through this process

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:12.930
to get what we call
down mass on demand.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.230
It's not that sexy sounding,
but that's what it is.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:19.510
So the idea is if astronaut
gets sick, something's going on,

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.060
they draw a vial of blood,
they pop it in the system,

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.910
they throw it overboard,
it falls down and lands

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:25.920
in your backyard.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.760
They run into the hospital
and they check it out.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.520
That's the vision.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.690
That's kind of the
nominal vision.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.164
It also goes for there's
different companies

00:23:34.164 --> 00:23:36.330
that we've been talking to
for a long period of time

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:41.430
about doing biological testing,
growing crystallography

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.270
et cetera.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.441
And one of the big
hangups has been, great.

00:23:44.441 --> 00:23:45.440
Now you've got my stuff.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.398
How do you get it down?

00:23:46.398 --> 00:23:48.570
There's no safe way
for me to get my stuff

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.850
that I did on
space station down.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.890
This is a way to address that.

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.340
Turns out there's some other
interesting applications

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.010
for that that I'll
talk about later.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:00.810
But that's another area that
Ames is deeply involved in,

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:02.670
and doing a lot of work in.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.860
This is a nice
picture, actually one

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:12.550
of my favorite pictures
of-- let's see, this one.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:16.264
This one is TechEdSat, which
is the first US satellite that

00:24:16.264 --> 00:24:18.430
was launched out of the
International Space Station.

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:19.955
We did it at Ames.

00:24:19.955 --> 00:24:22.020
And in the background,
what you see,

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.482
actually, is the largest
structure NASA's built,

00:24:26.482 --> 00:24:28.190
which is the International
Space Station.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.950
That is one quarter
of one fourth

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:37.270
of one array that powers that
International Space Station.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:41.937
So that's about a
football field square.

00:24:41.937 --> 00:24:43.020
And that's a real picture.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.420
It's not even good Photoshop.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.140
After they deploy, they have
to float in front of the array.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.510
So that's some of
NASA's smallest missions

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.530
with some of NASA's
largest missions.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.090
Pretty cool looking stuff.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:25:00.190
What we do, actually, is
there's a little airlock

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.660
on the Japanese side.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.864
It's called the JEM module.

00:25:03.864 --> 00:25:04.530
What a surprise.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.110
Japanese Environmental
Module, or something.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:12.690
And the Japanese allow
everybody to make use of it.

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:15.610
And so we load up
these deployers.

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.530
And the Japanese have
got a robotic arm,

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.420
grabs the deployer,
hangs it over the side

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.840
at a certain angle,
and then pops it out.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.490
This was TechEdSat 3,
3P, that we actually

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:32.980
launched just this past fall,
which was the first 3U volume

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.450
3U volume, deployed from the
International Space Station.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:44.540
And here I'm going to try-- OK.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.040
That's it.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.440
It's that exciting.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.010
But that's all it really is.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:53.240
There's not a gas canister,
there's not a rocket engine.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.140
It's spring loaded.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.680
They take the thing,
they cock it in,

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.490
it latches, they
put the lid down,

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.320
they put a deployment pin on it.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.290
And that's where you go.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:09.830
Here, there's two 3U dispensers.

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:13.360
What NanoRacks, the
company, has done

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:18.130
is they've taken 4 times 6.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.170
No, 8 times 6.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:26.030
They've taken 6U, linear-- so 3U
and then another 3U behind it.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.130
And they've got 8 tubes.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.340
And that actually is just
the right dimensions.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.200
It can also sneak through
the Japanese module

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.610
and hang over the side and
they deploy them all at once.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.980
The first deployment of that
was also this past fall.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.590
There's a company in the Bay
Area called Planet Labs-- which

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:46.040
happens to be, in part, a
spin out from NASA Ames-- that

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.080
is deploying a whole
bunch of spacecraft

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.170
off the International
Space Station.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:54.130
So we've already been
lapped, to some degree.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.190
AUDIENCE: Was that
at real speed?

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:57.890
DAVE KORSMEYER:
That was real speed.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:58.973
That's what it looks like.

00:26:58.973 --> 00:27:00.470
It's just, pop and go.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:03.490
And then, believe it or not,
you saw how fast it was going?

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.960
The rule for NASA is
you're not allowed

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.740
to turn on for 45
minutes after deployment

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.720
from station, because they
want you way the heck away

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.930
from station by the
time you turn on.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.950
So they're really giving
you a very clear field.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.500
But yeah, that's
as fast as it goes.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.480
And you'll get pretty
far in 45 minutes.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.850
So the other thing
we're doing is actually

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:30.140
the things in your hand.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.490
So the lighter one, which
is again roaming around

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.379
somewhere-- take a look inside.

00:27:34.379 --> 00:27:35.670
Some of you take a look inside.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.340
Who's got that one?

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.920
Somebody put it down?

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.200
Come on, somebody.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.041
Here.

00:27:41.041 --> 00:27:41.540
Yeah.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.170
I'm sorry?

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:43.910
AUDIENCE: Was there a Nexus One?

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:45.940
DAVE KORSMEYER: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.730
So I am here at Google, right?

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:56.072
So it turns out that one of our
guys had-- several of our guys,

00:27:56.072 --> 00:27:57.280
actually-- had a clever idea.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.990
And they said, you know, a
spacecraft isn't that complex.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:05.550
You need a little
bit of a computation,

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:11.680
you need some data handling,
you need some calm capability,

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.370
you need a good
long-lived battery.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:17.160
It needs to be compact
and good volume

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.770
constraints, be able to
handle good thermal regime,

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:20.920
and I don't know.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.920
What do you think?

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.750
And one of them went,
hey-- and, I'm sorry,

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.750
this was pre-these things.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.644
It was a BlackBerry.

00:28:27.644 --> 00:28:29.560
And they said, hey, we
could fly a BlackBerry.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.600
Why not just fly one of
these damn things, right?

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.440
And yes.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:33.980
So we did.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.580
We took it on.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:41.670
You can see and hear, literally
there is a Nexus S on its side.

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.630
Actually, diagonal, because
that was-- it just so

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:45.450
happens to fit.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:47.160
I don't know if you guys
did that deliberately.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.710
And then whopping
load of batteries.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.470
Because it turns out
International Space Station,

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.980
at the time, did not allow
us to fly lithium batteries.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.142
So we had to go with NiCad.

00:28:55.142 --> 00:28:56.600
So we had to strip
out the battery.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.950
But literally, the screen's
in here and everything else.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:03.900
And we've flown three
of these babies.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.331
And, yeah, they work.

00:29:05.331 --> 00:29:05.830
They work.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:06.788
And what was the point?

00:29:06.788 --> 00:29:09.110
It was a bit of a
technology stunt,

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:13.730
but it was to make the point
to the community and to NASA

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:17.780
that you really can make use of
consumer-grade, mass-produced

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.220
technologies and get a
decent behavior out of them.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.410
So what we did with--
after we did this one,

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.250
is we did-- where's
the other one?

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.770
We did the PhoneSat 2.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:29.990
So can you see a nexus in there?

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.205
No, you should not be able to.

00:29:32.205 --> 00:29:33.770
And b, you should
notice that they're

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:35.480
solar cells, all around it.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.210
What we actually did is, we
cracked the case on that one.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:39.180
Took the screen off.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.370
We don't need it.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:44.080
Got down to the small board.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:49.850
Actually had to float
the cell phone chip off,

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:51.580
because they really
didn't want that on

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.440
or connected in any
way, shape or form,

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.290
and then wired in the
rest of our avionics.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:58.720
That worked relatively well.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.540
Lessons learned?

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:04.440
There's a reason that a cell
phone board is in a cell phone

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:10.240
case, because those little
boards are the most fragile,

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.990
touchy things in the
friggin' world, right?

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.020
So that's a lesson learned.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.679
They were just a pain the ass.

00:30:16.679 --> 00:30:18.220
And where did we
get these Nexus S's?

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.420
Anybody have an idea?

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.200
We bought them
mass-produced from Google?

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.170
No.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:23.620
We went to Best Buy.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.680
And we got there early, and
when they're having a big sale.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.960
And we bought a bunch of boxes.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.610
That's exactly what we did.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:37.410
So we flew a whole
bunch of PhoneSat 1's

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:42.040
we flew 2 Beta, which was we
had it half-assed put together

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.990
and we had a launch, so
we just flew what we had.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:48.897
A 2.4 and a 2.5, don't ask
why we named them that way.

00:30:48.897 --> 00:30:49.980
Some of them just went up.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.370
The latest one just
went up in April.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:56.970
We cracked the Android kernel,
did a lot of good, fun stuff

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.380
to make it all work together.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:05.100
And we've used it also as the
core for some larger CubeSats.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.474
It was functional
enough that it was like,

00:31:07.474 --> 00:31:08.390
oh this kind of works.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:09.556
We can make use out of this.

00:31:09.556 --> 00:31:11.820
We started turning it
into additional CubeSats.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:17.420
One of them is, you think these
were disruptive, as we came up,

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.725
we didn't come up with in idea.

00:31:18.725 --> 00:31:23.450
A guy at Cornell came up with
these things called ChipSats.

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:29.080
So just when you think you're
safe, on the top is a PhoneSat.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:33.440
On the bottom is a 3D-printed
deployment mechanism

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.430
that we built at NASA Ames.

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:40.800
And it's going to deploy
104 of these ChipSats, which

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.520
are 2 and 1/2 centimeters
by 2 and 1/2 centimeters

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.515
square, which has got
a little magnetometer

00:31:47.515 --> 00:31:51.813
and a little gyroscope and a
little radio and a solar cell

00:31:51.813 --> 00:31:53.280
and a microcontroller.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.440
And it's going to
pop these babies out.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.480
To what end, you say?

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.190
Well, it turns out that one
of the interesting things

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:04.530
about space and
atmospheric sciences

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:06.589
and basically
everything we do is

00:32:06.589 --> 00:32:08.380
you don't want to take
a point measurement.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.050
A singular point
measurement at one instance

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:15.260
in time at one location
will tell you one point.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.430
What you want is you really
want a field measurement.

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:21.430
So if you watch geologists out
in the field or a biologist

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:22.030
or someone else,
they're are going

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.810
to take a point here,
note where they are,

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:25.637
go over here, take
a measurement,

00:32:25.637 --> 00:32:26.470
note where they are.

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:28.250
They're going to take
a field measurement

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:31.050
to get a distribution of
a bunch of measurements

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.500
across a region.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.600
How you do that in space?

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.500
Well, as you whip along in
a round orbit, that's great.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.780
Another way is to deploy
a whole bunch of sensors.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.470
This gives you as
a means to deploy

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.100
a bunch of very
interesting sensors.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.285
And let's see if I
can do this again.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:53.810
So when it's up there,
it'll get itself stabilized

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:55.460
after being deployed
from station.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.310
A spring will release,
and these babies

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:03.810
will just pop out and
drive all the space

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:06.740
tracking people crazy.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:07.720
And we really did.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.520
We showed this to the--
it's called JSpOC,

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:16.400
the Joint Strategic Program
for whatever that tracks stuff.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.110
They have no idea how they're
going to track stuff like that.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.990
I mean, it really is hard.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.490
Yes, sir?

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.550
AUDIENCE: What is the
altitude of those launches?

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:25.231
DAVE KORSMEYER: About
425 to 450 kilometers.

00:33:25.231 --> 00:33:26.606
AUDIENCE: Quite
a short lifetime.

00:33:26.606 --> 00:33:28.397
DAVE KORSMEYER: It's
a very short lifetime.

00:33:28.397 --> 00:33:29.750
So you've noted one thing.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.050
How do we stop these
beautiful little toys

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:35.570
from being really
annoying space junk?

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:37.710
Number one is we
launch them real low.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:42.490
So their lifetime is
measured sometimes in weeks,

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.790
at the longest maybe a year.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:46.440
We have launched
ones that are higher,

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.250
up 650, 700, 800 kilometers.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:51.960
They can last two,
three years up there.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.670
So you have to make
sure then that you've

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.660
got tracking capability,
because they really

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.660
are so small it's hard
for the radar systems that

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.150
do track the stuff
to actually see them.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.610
So we're actually putting little
transponders on them to squawk,

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.200
to tell you what's going on.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.340
But this is a great system.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:13.050
You can see, if you want to
measure the upper atmosphere,

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:16.900
these things literally flutter
down and squawk as they go.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.124
Yes, sir?

00:34:18.124 --> 00:34:18.978
AUDIENCE: So--

00:34:18.978 --> 00:34:22.230
DAVE KORSMEYER: You'd like to
say that it doesn't, but it

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.139
does.

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:24.630
It really does.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:27.070
We found out as an
example that the phones

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:31.389
are highly susceptible to
certain types of upsets.

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:33.900
And they're highly
susceptible to electrostatics

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.429
when they're out of their box.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:37.929
That's why, again, they're in
these lovely little boxes that

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:40.600
are nicely shielded and
grounded and everything's good.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.790
You take them out and they
become much more susceptible.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.250
The thermal regimes
we're talking about here

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:51.550
are we're talking minus 100
degrees centigrade to positive

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:53.040
100 degrees centigrade.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.120
These things are designed
really well, but not for that

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.730
every 90 minutes for the
entirety of their life.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.000
It wears on them.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.960
So while there's a lot
of good stuff out there,

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.920
I don't think you can
literally buy from Best Buy

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.490
and fly it and consider
that a functional model.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:14.260
However, you can, with
some minor tweaks,

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.240
do some selections
to the stuff you buy,

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.860
test to find the very
robust components that you

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.714
want to make use
of, and fly those.

00:35:21.714 --> 00:35:23.130
That's what we've
been able to do.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.300
So here's just a
picture version of it,

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.530
in case the video didn't work.

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:34.190
So another thing we're
doing-- and again, we actually

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:38.800
used the elements of
the PhoneSat stuff.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.400
We built a little
stability motor.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.830
It's called attitude
determination control system,

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.230
but these are
little teeny motors

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:49.520
that you think when
a motor turns on,

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.100
it gives you a
little bit of torque.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.000
You put three of
them perpendicular

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.720
and you get a torque that
control what position you're

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:56.620
in.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:00.850
Instead of going out and buying
expensive control motors,

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:02.970
we actually got dental
motors, the type

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:04.760
that you get when
you get a root canal.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.890
Those little motors
have a lot of torque,

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:10.320
and take a little bit of power
and spin up very, very quick.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.542
We actually built a
swarm of satellites.

00:36:13.542 --> 00:36:15.000
I'm a little bit
embarrassed to say

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.187
that this is the first actual
swarm that NASA's ever done.

00:36:19.187 --> 00:36:20.770
And what's the
difference, in my mind,

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:22.770
between a swarm and
a constellation?

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:25.476
A constellation's just
a number, n number

00:36:25.476 --> 00:36:26.850
of satellites that
are out there.

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:28.680
And they're all kind of
the same type of satellite.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.240
That's easy.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.890
It's a constellation.

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:32.480
You're a constellation
of people.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.390
A swarm is when I
talk to you and you

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:37.020
make damn sure you
talk to everybody

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.540
and then report back to me.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:39.180
That's a swarm.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:44.201
So I'm treating a set
as if it's a unit.

00:36:44.201 --> 00:36:45.950
What we're building
is-- what we've built,

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:47.900
actually, is a swarm.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:52.690
And we're doing a bunch of,
basically, radio physics

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:54.629
measurements at the
upper atmosphere.

00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:56.170
We've already built
them, and they're

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:58.770
launching later this fall.

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:03.390
Here's a picture in
our labs at Ames.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:05.830
These are the EDSN.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:07.830
Don't ask what it stands
for, but it's basically

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:12.070
the Edison Demonstration
of Space Networking.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:14.130
And we built 8 that
we're going to fly.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.080
We have four back-up units.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.080
And then we built another
two, just for giggles.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.080
We're going to throw off
the space station about

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:24.370
the same time just to
see how it all works.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:27.540
But this is again, kind
of like that ChipSat model

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.545
I told you about, or that you
just saw in the little video,

00:37:30.545 --> 00:37:31.670
except a little bit bigger.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.015
We can have more power, we
can have more functionality,

00:37:34.015 --> 00:37:35.390
we can have more
instrumentation.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:40.762
AUDIENCE: What is the
yellow measuring tape for?

00:37:40.762 --> 00:37:41.650
DAVE KORSMEYER: OK.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:46.170
So the yellow
measuring tape is--

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.620
this was discovered by
the first students that

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:52.060
actually did CubeSats.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.700
You need something
that is malleable,

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.160
because you want it to
fit in a finite box.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.700
But you want to have a
way to get, I don't know,

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.930
an antenna out there.

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.280
It turns out that if you look at
what that yellow piece of metal

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:11.910
is, it's actually
a tape measure.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:14.270
We went to Home Depot,
or OSH, take your pick,

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:16.270
or Lowe's, or whoever.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:18.620
You buy a bunch of tape
measures, you cut them up.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:21.530
They work phenomenally
well as antenna,

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:23.930
if you cut them
to the right size.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:28.100
And then they wrap very closely
to the body of the spacecraft.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.790
And they add a little bit of
extra twing when it pops out.

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.160
It imparts a little
torque as it goes.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.150
So even though
we've replaced a lot

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.090
of the other
consumer-grade stuff,

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:40.770
the Home Depot tape
measures are really

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:42.920
hard to beat when it
comes to antennas.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.760
They really are.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.290
I mean, for certain
types, not for everything.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.680
And so we just happened
to have, on this sat,

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.890
we have two antennas.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:55.150
And part of it is because
we want to have one always

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:57.780
pointing to ground,
and one is going

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.640
to be pointing,
hopefully, to another one

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.100
of the satellites in the swarm.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:03.600
OK.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.270
How do you launch these
swarms, as an example?

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:10.260
Well, I showed you and I
should have really given you

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.510
a better picture of it.

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:16.990
There's these 3UP pod, what
they called them, dispensers.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.840
I told you about that in
the NASA launch vehicles,

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.770
or any launch vehicle, you
tend to have a small satellite

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:25.500
on top of a big rocket,
with a lot of extra space.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.687
Because you've
designed with margin.

00:39:28.687 --> 00:39:29.520
We thought about it.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.770
We came up with this idea.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:33.670
We called it the nanosat
launch adapter system.

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:38.370
And really what it is, is it's
this fat disk that you can just

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:41.456
put underneath your satellite.

00:39:41.456 --> 00:39:43.580
And it sits on the disk
and then the launch vehicle

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.560
sits underneath it.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:49.760
And then within that disk,
you can kind of hollow it out,

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.869
and you can put these
dispensers, a whole bunch

00:39:51.869 --> 00:39:53.910
on this side and a whole
bunch on the other side.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:58.010
And I'll show you what
that actually looks like.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:01.094
We call that the wafer,
and then the blue box.

00:40:01.094 --> 00:40:02.010
That's the gold thing.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:03.827
The wafer's the gold thing.

00:40:03.827 --> 00:40:05.910
There's this little avionics
in the dispenser that

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:08.990
just fires a sequence
to open the doors when

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:10.710
it's appropriate.

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:13.850
And then the blue boxes
are the dispensers.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:15.600
And this is called
the NLAS system.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.090
We actually designed
this, and we released it,

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:21.570
open source so to
speak-- open design,

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:24.366
I guess is a better
model-- to any US vendor

00:40:24.366 --> 00:40:25.990
that wants to make
or use these things,

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.945
because that's going to
increase the number of launches

00:40:28.945 --> 00:40:31.370
that are available out there.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:34.114
And they can create
a whole economic unit

00:40:34.114 --> 00:40:35.780
of selling back and
forth to each other,

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.580
and we just benefit.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:38.730
Because now we can go out and
buy a whole bunch of these,

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:40.355
and don't have to
build them ourselves.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:47.200
So what we're doing is, for the
EDSN spacecraft in particular,

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:52.870
we get a launch on a new,
pseudo-commercial launch system

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:57.070
called Super Strypi that
AeroJet and Sandia National

00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:58.670
Laboratories are
putting together.

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.190
It's actually going
to launch from Kauai.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:05.480
Yes, I meant Hawaii but
the island of Kauai.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.350
It's going to launch this fall.

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:12.780
We can fit four EDSNs,
which are 1 and a half U's.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.710
So you've got the 1U
you passed around.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:17.900
One and a half U's is 15
centimeters by 10 by 10.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.260
So two one and a
halfs make three.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.130
You can put four of
them in a 6U dispenser.

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:26.120
And we could put two
dispensers full of our stuff

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.420
on one side of the wafer,
and then the other side

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.999
is being used by
other groups that

00:41:32.999 --> 00:41:34.540
are making use of
the launch vehicle.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.760
And then there's a
mainline Hawaii sat-- what

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.590
a surprise-- on the top.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:44.100
And that's going to launch
order November of this year.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.170
And yes, I will go.

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:50.510
So what are the next
steps for NASA CubeSats?

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:52.790
I've talked a lot
about, basically, just

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:57.140
demonstrating the capability
that kind of is being

00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:01.130
engendered by universities
and other groups already.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:04.460
I talked about how we're doing
it for space biology, how we're

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.400
doing it for down mass from
International Space Station,

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.440
how we're doing it for
technical demonstrations.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.480
Some of the other things--
I leave it to the community

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.060
to look at and just think
about-- but one of the things

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:21.570
we also do is we send
these lovely, deep space

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:23.440
interplanetary
spacecraft out there.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:28.000
We send the Mars science
lab, the Curiosity Rover,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.810
out to Mars a couple years ago.

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:34.770
Do you think we did the same
thing with that spacecraft

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:37.030
like we've done with every
other one, where we maybe

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:41.070
had a little extra volume and we
maybe had a little extra mass,

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.880
all held in Margin Yeah, we did.

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.240
And do you think on the
interplanetary transfer

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:51.890
stage that was throwing
Mars Rover at Mars

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:55.170
we also had additional
volume and additional mass?

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.630
Yeah, we did.

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:58.732
Do you think we sent
anything with it?

00:42:58.732 --> 00:43:00.420
No, we didn't.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.730
Why?

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:05.990
Politics, in large part, but
because people hadn't really

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.760
thought of it.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.860
The standard hadn't
advanced enough.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:11.110
The capabilities
hadn't advanced enough.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:14.870
Now what we're talking about
is as you send these spacecraft

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:17.410
out, very expensive
spacecraft with a lot of money

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:19.220
and a lot of
intellectual capability

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.090
that are pretty much guaranteed
to work as best NASA can make

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:24.910
them, you send those babies out.

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:28.700
And with the remainder mass
and the remainder volume,

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.910
you send a bunch of little
crappy CubeSats out.

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:31.710
Not that crappy.

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:33.850
You send stuff out that's
probably going to work,

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:36.920
but you don't have to spend
so much money to guarantee it.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.600
And you don't send one.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.540
You spread your risk.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.982
You send 10 or 15.

00:43:40.982 --> 00:43:42.190
And what do you have them do?

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:45.900
You have them do things that
are unique to deep space

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.880
that you can't do elsewhere.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:50.280
You have them measure the
space weather, which is really

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:54.260
how the sun behaves
outside of us,

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:57.850
our one viewpoint on the planet
Earth as we're moving around.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:59.832
You have it check
with another set

00:43:59.832 --> 00:44:01.290
of interesting
biological payloads.

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:02.970
How do they behave
in deep space?

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:03.690
We don't know.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.290
We have no flipping an idea.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.530
Lots of great
opportunities, and we're

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:13.880
launching stuff out
there every year or so.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.642
We're doing a
mission called ARM.

00:44:16.642 --> 00:44:18.600
I don't know if you guys
have heard about this.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.090
This in play right now.

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:23.480
It's called the Asteroid
Redirect Mission.

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.990
This is a NASA
mission that's going

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:30.380
to go look for potentially
hazardous objects, PHOs.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.510
We have to acronymize
everything,

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:38.030
which is code for a big
rock that may hit the earth.

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:40.140
And this is kind of
a cartoony version

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.390
of bag the asteroid and
move it somewhere else,

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:46.270
or give it a little
bit of a kick.

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:50.310
Again, you can spend a
couple billion dollars

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:52.656
on this baby to make
sure it damn near does

00:44:52.656 --> 00:44:54.030
exactly what it's
supposed to do,

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:56.660
and does it to the
99th percentile.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.790
And then you send a
small amount of money,

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:02.930
sending a fleet of smaller,
disposable but reliable

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:06.850
enough, very valuable
additional eyeballs

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:09.240
to see what else you're
doing from different venues

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.870
to measure the
broader environment

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:13.610
around this asteroid, perhaps
to measure who knows what

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:17.090
else you're doing in the area.

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.570
So this opens up a
whole different set

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:20.470
of characteristics.

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:24.630
For the down mass
device I talked about

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:26.639
from the International
Space Station,

00:45:26.639 --> 00:45:28.430
this works out to be
a very interesting way

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:30.263
to get something all
the way to the surface,

00:45:30.263 --> 00:45:32.690
maybe the surface
of Mars or Venus,

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:34.990
a bunch of very small things.

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:36.700
If you remember, we
spent a lot of money,

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.490
a lot of good money on
Curiosity, the big one,

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:43.130
and then on Spirit and
Opportunity back in 2003.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:44.600
That was two and one.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:49.090
Why don't we send 50, all
over the surface of Mars,

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:50.750
or all over the
surface of Venus?

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:53.300
Again, they're not
going to be as reliable.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:57.570
But we're going to-- if
you lose three of the 50,

00:45:57.570 --> 00:45:59.477
you still got 47, I hope.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:07.270
So just to sum
up, NASA is really

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:11.100
trying to make use of this
disruptive model, this CubeSat

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.150
engineering capability
that, if you

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:16.590
go to any university right
now, frankly, a bunch

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:18.240
of high schools and,
believe it or not,

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.610
one elementary
school-- I don't know

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:24.110
how they do that--
they're building CubeSats.

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:26.197
They really are.

00:46:26.197 --> 00:46:27.280
They're building CubeSats.

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.670
And we're going to fly them.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:32.870
Ames turns out to be one of
NASA's particular centers

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:35.140
that's spending a lot of
energy, time, money, effort,

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.710
and intellectual
capital to make use

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:40.140
of these-- demonstrating
what can be done,

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.360
developing the technologies
to make it happen,

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:46.880
and basically managing
some of the programs that

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.400
allow all the other NASA
centers and universities to make

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.444
use of this form factor.

00:46:51.444 --> 00:46:53.610
We're looking to partner
with a lot of universities,

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:56.890
non-profits, international
space agencies, and companies.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.030
And we've done so.

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:01.400
Google bought a
company recently,

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.310
I believe called SkyBox.

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:06.290
They're not CubeSats,
but they're small sats.

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:07.780
They're microsats.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.980
Same idea, that same
type of technology

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.580
but a little bit
larger form factor.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:17.160
There's a lot of business
going on in this area.

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.840
NASA needs to
figure out where we

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:23.407
fit in this new world because
of this disruptive change.

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:24.490
I'm very excited about it.

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:26.156
I think there's a lot
of capability that

00:47:26.156 --> 00:47:28.890
will be added by us
being able to do it.

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:31.900
I think software is
key here, because that

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.990
is what you can add is a
capability that weighs very,

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:39.130
very little but adds
great functionality.

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.330
But it's a whole
new world for us.

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:43.790
And Ames is on the
forefront of it.

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:45.650
Rest of NASA's coming along.

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:46.910
I thank you for your time.

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:48.566
Any questions?

00:47:48.566 --> 00:47:51.912
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.820
AUDIENCE: This is amazing.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.970
I've been really
interested in this area.

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:03.392
I'm not a rocket
scientist, but a hobbyist.

00:48:03.392 --> 00:48:04.725
Have you heard of Inner Orbital?

00:48:04.725 --> 00:48:06.005
DAVE KORSMEYER: No, I haven't.

00:48:06.005 --> 00:48:10.080
AUDIENCE: It's very similar
to what you presented today.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.570
There is a CubeSat that you
can buy for about $10,000

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:15.410
to launch.

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:16.580
There's a TubeSat.

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:19.622
That's the lighter version
of it for about $8,000.

00:48:19.622 --> 00:48:21.830
It's something that I'm
really interested in building

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:24.720
and launching in
January of 2015.

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:28.240
And I'm wondering, when
you said that someone could

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.700
get something like this
and get, essentially,

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:33.340
a quote unquote
"free ride," how free

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.240
and how cheap would
something like this be,

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.685
versus Inner Orbital?

00:48:37.685 --> 00:48:40.939
DAVE KORSMEYER: So I don't
know what Inner Orbital does.

00:48:40.939 --> 00:48:41.980
Do they provide launches?

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:42.640
Is that what they do?

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.860
AUDIENCE: Yes, a
kit and the launch.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.450
DAVE KORSMEYER: So there are
a number of groups out there.

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:49.540
There's Spaceflight,
there's ISI, I know.

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:50.780
There's NanoRacks.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:53.310
Sounds like there's
a whole bunch more.

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:57.060
And really, a lot of them are
using the same launch vehicles

00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:57.910
and stuff NASA does.

00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:00.800
All that we've done is we've
done a little bit of a bulk buy

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.940
idea, where we
know it's going up

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.800
and we put a dibs on
every launch vehicle

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.770
that some fraction
of that is ours.

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:14.080
And then we sponsor
groups to go up.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:17.860
They have to be non-profit,
so educational or non-profit

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.780
or something like that.

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:24.280
We're not looking to support
a profit-making capability.

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.480
But it's really just
a proposal process.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.330
You go to the NASA website, you
find CubeSat Launch Initiative.

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:32.980
Every six months
to nine months, we

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.240
release a call for proposals.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.570
You write up a
proposal, you tell us

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:39.070
what you're going
to do, convince us

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:41.540
you actually can build
something that's of value,

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:47.187
and you saw our acceptance
rates on the order of 2/3.

00:49:47.187 --> 00:49:49.770
AUDIENCE: So you're saying that
it's free if you get accepted?

00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:52.040
DAVE KORSMEYER: It's
free if you get accepted.

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.812
There's worse things.

00:49:54.812 --> 00:49:57.760
AUDIENCE: My question
is about the ARM mission

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.890
that you mentioned.

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:06.280
So we are also looking at using
6U CubeSats to actually impact

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.410
the asteroid as a
kinetic impactor.

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:12.240
So my question is that
much can we actually

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.870
deflect the asteroid
by using 6U CubeSats?

00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:17.120
DAVE KORSMEYER: That's a zero.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.700
But why would we do that?

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:25.679
Since I know where you work,
I can answer that question.

00:50:25.679 --> 00:50:28.220
It's the same reason-- I don't
know if you guys remember back

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.310
in 2009, NASA Ames
had another mission

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:34.250
called LCROSS, Lunar Crater
Observation Sensing System.

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:35.310
Lovely acronym.

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:38.840
We smacked into the
south pole of the moon

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:42.362
into a deeply shadowed crater,
and blew up a bunch of junk.

00:50:42.362 --> 00:50:43.820
Why did we blow up
a bunch of junk?

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:46.420
Because we couldn't see into
the permanently shadowed crater.

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.490
Permanent shadow.

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:50.440
So we had to pop
it out somewhere

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.710
where we could see it,
where it was illuminated,

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:54.400
and then we were able
to basically turn

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.980
our spectral analyzers
on it, and see what

00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:59.050
was the chemical
composition of it.

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:00.260
That's why we do it.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.060
We blast into it, so
something would pop off

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.782
that we could take a look at.

00:51:04.782 --> 00:51:07.850
AUDIENCE: So my
question is, what

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:13.369
frequency do they,
the antennas, use?

00:51:13.369 --> 00:51:14.160
DAVE KORSMEYER: OK.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.100
So right now-- and
that's a great question,

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:18.080
because that's getting tricky.

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.250
These were started as
university activities.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:24.200
So what we actually ended
up using was the ham band.

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.860
Anybody remember ham radio?

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:28.020
Ham radio operators
are all over the world

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:30.750
and are serious, their
own hacker community.

00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:34.230
Turns out, you put a ham
radio transponder in space,

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:36.990
and pretty much anywhere
in the world, somebody's

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:38.610
going to be listening
if you tell them

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:40.700
what particular
frequency to listen to.

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:43.360
And they will find you,
and we just squawk packets,

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:46.670
and then they email
the packets back to us,

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:48.030
and we get the data.

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:48.870
It's a great model.

00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:49.580
It's free.

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:50.560
It's a great model.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.950
The problem is, that
was specifically

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:57.540
only for amateur band,
amateur band operators.

00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:00.170
Now that so many of these
things are going on,

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:03.164
and now that NASA's actually
starting to play in this game,

00:52:03.164 --> 00:52:04.830
the amateur band
people are saying, hey,

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:07.400
it's getting too noisy
in our amateur band.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:11.800
Please get your own
band to play with.

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:16.210
NASA uses a couple
bands, S, X, and KA band.

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:19.990
If you're not an RF
person, and I'm not,

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:23.670
I'll point you to an RF person.

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:28.030
But it's like 480
megahertz is the ham band.

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:31.750
I couldn't really tell
you what S, X, and KA are.

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:34.350
But we're looking for different
actual downlink capabilities

00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:36.380
now, because of that.

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:39.110
AUDIENCE: There's an Open
Site glass on this thing.

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:41.230
Looks like there's a
little radical in there.

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:43.822
Is there a purpose for that?

00:52:43.822 --> 00:52:45.280
DAVE KORSMEYER: I
couldn't tell you

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.900
without seeing exactly
what you're talking about.

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.050
You can show me afterwards.

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:49.954
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:49.954 --> 00:52:51.520
DAVE KORSMEYER: Oh yeah.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.070
We did put corner reflectors.

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:55.815
You know what retro-reflectors
are, or corner reflectors?

00:52:55.815 --> 00:52:56.940
They left them on the moon.

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:00.440
They're basically--
it's a box of mirrors.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.490
And if you fire a light
at that box of mirrors,

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:06.040
it will bounce it
directly back to you.

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.180
Yeah.

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.420
And that is just a
mirror, is exactly right.

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:10.802
It's a little retro-reflector.

00:53:10.802 --> 00:53:12.760
It's the idea that one
of the things you can do

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.730
is we're working with a group
in Australia that's got a laser.

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:19.170
It's a commercial grade,
big, whopping laser.

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:22.740
And they're lasing our satellite
and getting the bounce back.

00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.284
That gives you
what's called range.

00:53:24.284 --> 00:53:26.450
And you can also get what's
called range rate, which

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:29.070
is the rate of
change of that range.

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:31.600
And from that, you can get your
position really accurately,

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.150
down to a couple centimeters.

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:35.580
So that's the type of
stuff we're playing with.

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:36.480
Yeah, go for it.

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.020
AUDIENCE: Is NASA
buying flights,

00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:43.330
suborbital commercial flights
to launch these CubeSats?

00:53:43.330 --> 00:53:45.440
DAVE KORSMEYER: Not solely
to launch the CubeSats.

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:50.030
So we have paid Space
X and Orbital Sciences

00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:52.820
and Boeing and Lockheed
and all these guys

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:55.670
to launch stuff for us,
the US government has.

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:57.230
But we're launching
the big sats.

00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:00.660
What we've done is we've--
as part of that contract,

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:04.480
we've claimed extra
volume and mass.

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.950
And with that, we're
launching the CubeSats.

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:08.650
Eventually, the launch
vehicle providers

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:10.880
are going to figure out
they can charge us for this.

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.200
They have not yet
figured that out.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.270
Don't tell them.

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:17.880
AUDIENCE: And what about
suborbital flights [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.100
Spain's planning to launch--

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:20.940
DAVE KORSMEYER: There's a thing
called the Flight Opportunities

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:23.370
Program, which we will
fly anybody's junk.

00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:26.240
Again, as long as you
propose, we fly our own junk

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.592
and we have to propose to that.

00:54:27.592 --> 00:54:29.050
And they're all
suborbital flights.

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:32.930
So we fly out of the Mojave
space port, which takes you up

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:35.250
rather high, but doesn't
get you in orbit.

00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:37.590
It's suborbital.

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:38.627
OK?

00:54:38.627 --> 00:54:39.460
Thank you very much.

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:40.480
Appreciate the time.

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:41.813
Let me know if you want to chat.

00:54:41.813 --> 00:54:44.620
[APPLAUSE]
