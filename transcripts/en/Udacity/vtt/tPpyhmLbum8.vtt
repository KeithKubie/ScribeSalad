00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.710
There are 16 pieces of pizza total.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.050
That's 8 per pizza.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.401
We can actually express
this as a fraction.

00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:14.210
We can write 16 over 8.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.193
That's because we have 16 pieces total,
but

00:00:17.193 --> 00:00:19.960
there is still 8 pieces
in one whole pizza.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.250
When we have a fraction like this,
where the numerator is

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.860
bigger than the denominator,
that's called an improper fraction.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.830
This is another important vocabulary
word that you might want to write down.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.460
A proper fraction might
be something like 7/8,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.600
where the numerator is still
smaller than the denominator.
