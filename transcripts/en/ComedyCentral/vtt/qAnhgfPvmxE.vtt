Last week, the Internet
was bombarded with pictures

00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:13.279
from Fashion Week, because
no one's a better fashion critic

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:16.015
than someone on Facebook at 3:00
a.m. who's not wearing pants.

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.683
In addition
to the beautiful people

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:20.153
who've been artfully warped
by Photoshop's stretch tool,

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.688
there were also some, uh,
pretty warped outfits.
