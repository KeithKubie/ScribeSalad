00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.110
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.550
&gt;&gt; Ragnar Almqvist:
Ireland is fortunate

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.410
to have a rich literary heritage.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.150
Over the centuries our writers
have enlarged our country's global

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
footprint and embedded images
of Ireland and its people

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.000
in the imaginations
of readers everywhere.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.570
Colm Toibin stands firmly
in this proud tradition.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.300
What I especially admire about
his work is its immense variety.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.370
He's renowned for his
Wexford novels,

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.340
which are set in the
county was birth,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.030
but his work has an immense range
with novels like The Master,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.910
The Testament of Mary,
and most recently House

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.490
of Names stretching his
imagination well beyond the bounds

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.520
of his own home place
and personal experience.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.940
He has made important
contributions to literary criticism

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.910
through his writings on Elizabeth
Bishop and Augusta Gregory,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.220
and as any reader of
the New York Review

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.080
of Books will attest is
amongst the best essayist

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.380
in the English language.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.570
Finally, Colm has contributed
to the public life of Ireland

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.770
as a journalist and critic with
his perceptive analyses off.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.270
for example, the Easter rising
and it's centenary last year.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.940
He is an artist of profound gifts.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.660
To the ambassadors words I
might add in the four years

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.250
since I last met him,
Colm has also found time

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.050
to write a Tony nominated play for
Broadway, see his work translated

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.750
to the silver screen, and nominated
for best picture at the Oscars

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.820
and in the past few months
co-curated an exhibition

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.720
of American painting
at the Morgan Library.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.730
He is a virtuoso and celebrated
as such the world over.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.100
Translated into more than 30
languages he has won almost

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.320
as many major literary
prizes and being shortlisted

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.270
for countless more including
three times the Booker Prize.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.610
And later this year, the Dayton
Literary Peace Prize will present

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.120
him with their lifetime
achievement award named

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.020
after the US diplomats
Richard C. Holbrooke.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.770
In recognition of Colm's
writings, social impact,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.180
and that impact has been
profound, ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.900
because as well as being one of
our nation's greatest writers

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.330
as our ambassador noted,
Colm has also been one

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.110
of its sharpest critics, and indeed
a catalyst for its social change.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.690
Bad Blood is akin [phonetic]
to walking the border

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.740
between Northern Ireland
and the Republic in 1986,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.060
capture attentions,
contradictions, personal tragedies

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.250 position:56%
of a troubled time in Irish history.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.680
And The Blackwater Lightship

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.430 position:56%
and other writings his unsentimental
depiction of what it then meant

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.810
to be gay in Ireland
contributed in no small way

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.590
to changing what it now
means to be gay in Ireland.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.370 position:56%
In May 2015 days before the Irish
people became the first in the world

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.920
to embrace marriage
equality by popular vote,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.370
Colm gave a public
lecture at Trinity College,

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.920
titled The Embrace of Love.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.500
On the grounds were
Oscar Wilde was educated,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.450 position:56%
there could've been no more eloquent
or impactful case for equality.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.020
But in case I misrepresent
them, let me correct myself.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.320
Though he has written
from the perspective

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.340
of the Virgin Mary,
Colm is no saint.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.770
A piece in the Telegraph some
years ago described him as austere

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.900
in writing, wicked in person.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.180
As a reader of his work, as
an admirer of his sentences,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.410
I would dispute the former,
but having been lucky enough

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.180
to spend some evenings
in his company,

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.580
I can confirm that the latter
is true in the very best sense.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.880
Our ambassadors had the pleasure

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.380
of interviewing Colm several
times before and asked me

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.100
to finish this afternoon
by telling you all

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.680
that you have a great
treat in store.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.970 position:56%
I believe that at the end of Com's
remarks there will be an opportunity

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.170
for you to pose questions,
and I want to remind you

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.300
at 2:30 you can do yourself a
very great favor and have one

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.780
of not only Ireland's

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.750
but the world's great writers
sign your copy of House of Names.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.110
So with that please join
me in welcoming Colm Toibin

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.910
to the National Book Festival.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:04:09.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Colm Toibin: Thank you very much.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.950
If only he would say that
at home, it would be great.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.810
The problem began when I finished
the novel called The Blackwater

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:28.050
Lightship which was set in Ireland
in 1993 over six or seven days

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.450
with only six or seven characters.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.200
There was a lot of rain, there
was a lot of making of tea,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:42.080
there was just a lot of the
inner workings of an Irish family

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.540 position:56%
which meant a lot of things that had
never been said were still not being

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.160
said, but everyone was sort of
sitting there brooding about them.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.270
And every so often the grandmother,
who was no help, would try

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.380
and introduce the most dangerous
topic into the conversation

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.470
to see what trouble, more
trouble she could now cause

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.290
and since it was her house as she
said herself in the book, I'm old

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.010
and I'll say what I like.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.160
The problem was what to do now

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.930
because I felt I had written
myself out of the Irish family.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.230
I felt I had written myself out
of rain, of cups of tea you,

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.350
of days like that, and I had
a choice and the choice was

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.000
between writing another such novel

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.600
or writing a novel
about Henry James.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.260
And then if I wrote a novel
about Henry James it would be,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.340
the research would involve
going to Venice, you know,

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.630
going to Rome trying to
research the inner lives,

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.350
and indeed the outer apparel
of duchesses and lords

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.010
and ladies and grand parties.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.330
And on the other hand if
I went back to Ireland,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.650
I'll be back in the small house,
the rain outside and the tea inside

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:08.480
and one of the things I discovered,
which I didn't almost know

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.730
when I was, when I started
The Blackwater Lightship was

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:17.390
that whole idea of what women's
voices in a country like Ireland

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.000
where there has been so much
repression of various sorts,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.060
what women's voices do when
there is an opening for them.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.270
And I am, when I went on to
finally write a novel after that

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.900
which was set in Ireland which is
called Nora Webster and a novel

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.510 position:56%
in between which is called Brooklyn,

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.250
I realized I had written three
novels which were written

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.880
about women and about women
speaking, about women silences

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.320
and in Ireland in the
years from the 1950s

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.470
into the 1990s I suppose
the memory would be

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.750 position:56%
that if upstairs there were three
or four women in my mother's bedroom

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.530
and downstairs were three or
four men in the room below

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.380
and I'm a little boy moving
between the two spaces,

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.990 position:56%
upstairs no matter what the women
are talking about and usually it was

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:18.460
about a coat that Auntie Harriet
almost bought in Dublin and didn't

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.320
in the end even though it under
sale in clearies [phonetic]

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.720
and she went back twice to fit it
on and that Auntie Maeve would say,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.520
well, was it the buttons?

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.970 position:56%
And she would say, no, I don't know
what it was and my mother might say,

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.270
oh, well you could go back again.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.570
She said, no, it is gone.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.720
I went back another time it
had gone and they would go on,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.990
and I would look from one
to the other about the coat

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.380
that was almost bought by Auntie
Harriett, and I would know also

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.840
from because I was
very good at listening

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.370
to what they were really saying
was that there was an argument.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:08:00.230 position:56%
My mother was in a rage with one or
other or both or all of her sisters,

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.430
but they were not mentioning
the rage.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:07.670 position:56%
I was wondering at what moment was
my mother going to say well, but no,

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.880
it was going to be about a
blouse that my mother had,

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.280
but it didn't really
fit her anymore.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.020
She wondered if she could swap that
for something that Auntie Maeve had

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.080
and it would go, and then
I would go downstairs

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.930
and there would be the four me
sitting and one of them would say

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:29.950
to the other that second
goal on Sunday was good.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.710
It was a good goal.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:37.180
And there would be general silence
and they all smoked cigarettes

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.240
as they consider the goal
and a man would say that,

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.650 position:56%
but wasn't the second goal was good?

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:48.000 position:56%
And the others would say it was good
that second goal, and you'd look

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.910
at the four of them and
think are they going to say,

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:54.450
is there anything more going
to occur as these people,

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.280
I mean in other words,
Beckett was a social realist.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.620
One of them could he's
a good player all right

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:09.580
and they would nod
solemnly, silently daring you

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.010
to say anything else and then
someone would say but his brother,

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.230
his brother he had it in him as
well, and they'd say, ah, he did,

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.770
but he didn't do, and then there
be a big discussion the brother

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.070
and the difference between
the brother and him.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.900
And you go back upstairs
to find that my mother had,

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:33.010
Auntie got her entire wardrobe
and had arranged a swap

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:37.310
of everything she didn't like
for stuff that Auntie Maeve had,

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:42.160
and you'd realize that that
whole idea of if the difference

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.860
if a woman came to the
house who wasn't one

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:49.100
of the aunts she could sit
for the whole evening talking

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.270
about something and if
a man came he could sit

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.710
for the whole evening just looking
straight ahead of him saying

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:01.480
that no, he wouldn't have more
tea, he didn't he would, he might,

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.200
and that might be the nearest
thing to drama the difference

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.690
between the fact that he
would, he wouldn't or he might.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.930
And that's the world
we lived in and so

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.420
that you could put
it into the books.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.360
So the problem then
was that I wrote,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.210
it's like what Alice
McDermott has been saying

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:29.240
that you always feel you're
constantly despite the best help

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:34.320 position:56%
of Irish diplomats that you're about
to be found out and that phone call

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.260
of the encounter with the
editor will be the end of you

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:42.320
or they will say it, you know,
this book really, really no,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.900
and you'd say, well,
it's fine, don't worry.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.920
I wonder if it's about,
and I'm not going to say,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.290 position:56%
I'm not going to use the C word, the
colonized word, but I wonder if it's

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.660
about poverty or some
sort of strange sense

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.400
of no matter what you do you
going to be fired from your job

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.450
on your house is going to burn
or the English are going to come

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.860
or something is going
to happen to you

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.470
or worst the English
are not going to come,

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.960
you're going to have to go to them.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.820
You know in other words
emigration that you think

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.940
if you did anything
really wrong at home,

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:21.290
someone did something very wrong
that say, ah, he went to England.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.720
Or in the case of a woman it
would even be more telling.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.300
Ah, she had to go to
England you know what I mean?

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:32.090
And so that whole sense that at
any moment something could occur

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:37.120
that you always need to have
a second book almost finished.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:43.310 position:56%
So if the editor says look give this
up, this Henry James nonsense is not

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.030
for you, and who do
you think you are?

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.600
You say, oh, actually I have
another little Irish book waiting

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.110
so that sense that you
almost, you always need

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.800
to be working on two books.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.710
I mean what Alice McDermott said
about Jonathan Galassi you live

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.630
in fear of the phone call and
you always know what to do,

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.020
oh no, it's fine, don't worry.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:10.260
I don't like it either and that
in fact I have another book,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.860
I think the other book
would be, you know.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:23.810
And so in the spring 2000
I began, I began two novels

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:28.940
and with the opening of the
Henry James novel I was able

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.570
to describe a moment in
the life of Henry James

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.430
but he has an absolute
disaster in the theatre.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.520
We know a great deal about him
because he who wrote great numbers

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.890
of letters about how he hoped to
have a huge success in the theatre

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.070
and many of his friends who were
in the audience they left reports

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.460
of what the opening night was like.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.010 position:56%
And he went to a play by Oscar Wilde
while his own play was going on.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.920 position:56%
He didn't like the Oscar Wilde play
and then he walked across the square

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.300
to his own play, which
is coming to an end.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.230
He heard the applause,
he heard shouting,

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.770
but he thought it was
shutting of approval.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.620
He didn't know that towards the
end of his play there was a line

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.760
which he put so much thought into,
they're always the worst lines,

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.850 position:56%
the ones that you think there was a
line where one of the characters has

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:21.150 position:56%
to say I am the last, My Lord, of
the Domvilles [phonetic] and a woman

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.020
from the back from the [inaudible]
shouted it's a bloody good thing

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.910
you are.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:31.810
And the audience started
to yell, cat call

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:36.360
and every possible sort
of insult at the actors.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.480
And the main actor who had
paid all the money for this

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.120
and decided what he would do

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.600
in retaliation was bring
Henry James onto the stage.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.910
Just let him feel what they been
feeling for the last 10 minutes.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.060
James thought he was coming on for
a curtain quality author and even

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:58.100
at the beginning he didn't
know what to do but he bowed

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.610
and the audience didn't
like the way he bowed.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:05.720
There was a sort of pride, sort of
insolence in it so they cat called

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:10.750
and yelled further, all friends
you know in the nonpaying part

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:15.800
of the place they applauded, the
others just yelled abuse at him.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.690
And I have no problem writing this

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:24.830
because as Ragnar mentioned I
have been shortlisted three times

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:29.920
for the theater of cruelty
known as the Man Booker Prize.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:35.970
And so just before I began to
write this sequence I found myself

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:41.620
shortlisted for the first time and
that is very exciting because I was

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.170
in London when it happened and
didn't know until I went back

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.110
to Ireland that, when I went back

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.910 position:56%
to Ireland the first Saturday
people would stop their cars and get

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.330 position:56%
out of their cars and go, yeah, like
I was sort of running for Ireland

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:53.830
or I was an athlete of some sort.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.710
I mean I had just written a book.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:15:01.610
Then when the main thing, my mother
always said the main thing to do

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.360
but before you go out ever
is to wash under your arms.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.620
And so before I went to London
for the Booker Prize I washed

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:14.040 position:56%
under my arms, and I got a suit
and, you know, I did wash more than,

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.200
I mean I washed all of myself
really to be to be true,

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.680
and I put on a monkey suit.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.750
It was going to be great and
the funny thing is about us

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.330
as humans no matter what
happens we continue hoping.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:32.060
It should have been clear to me
that a novel about six Irish people

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.380
over six days, you know,
where they would just make tea

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.810
and tell stories was never
going to win anything.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:44.130 position:56%
I think they just put it the short
list because they felt sorry for it,

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:49.470 position:56%
but anyway as the moment came up
where I was actually sure that I had

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.980
and I had a speech ready
thanking everyone and, you know,

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.410
going on about the importance
of reading, and I was going

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:59.730
to be really earnest about the
world then someone else won.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:03.820 position:56%
The thing is just before, when I say
just before I mean an hour before

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:08.890
as you're eating your dinner six TV
crews go to six shortlisted writers

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.450
and they put a camera in your face
and the closer the camera comes

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.190
to your face the more sure
you are you won the prize

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.350
and you keep saying to
everyone beside you look, look,

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.480
it's coming right in on me.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:24.080
And then, of course, the minute you
don't win they just turn the lights

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.630
off on you complete.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.970
So it's almost as though
the light had been on you

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.410
for so long you think
you're now in the dark

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:34.690
and people are literally
afraid to be seen with you.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.880
If you go to the men's bathroom,

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.870
men will not do what
they must do besides you.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.210
You have to go into the place
where you lock the door and just,

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:48.270
you know, doing that and then
as you're walking out people

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:52.160
who you know well just slip by you
and you then go out on the street

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.300
and you think, oh,
God, it's too late

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.900
to get the last flight
back to Dublin.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.480
I have to be in London.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.400
What was I ever doing here?

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.180
So I gave all those
emotions to Henry James

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.400
on it was very, very
useful experience.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.520
If I had won, I would've known what
to do whereas losing was just great

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.180
because I could make Henry,
you know, give that disaster

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.370
that occurred to me to I
could give it to Henry James.

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.720
But the other novel that
I started became the novel

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:24.950
which was called Nora Webster, and
I started it in the spring of 2000.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:30.480 position:56%
I keep promising myself to add to it
and every summer I would add a bit,

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.320
I would erase a bit, it was
really the story of what happened

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.930
in our house in the three or
four years after my father died

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:45.500
between 1967 and 1972 when I was
12 and my younger brother was 8

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.620
and my mother was there and so the
three of us were there in the house

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:54.510
as we attempted to rebuild our
world in the absence of my father

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.400
as my mother found a job, as myself
and my younger brother worked

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.420
out what we could and couldn't say
or what the silence was really like

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.250
or the fact that the silences
were so filled with things.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:10.500
And every year as I
said I would add to it,

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.340
but also every year I would
do anything not to add to it.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.240
So if anyone invited
me anywhere I would go.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.540
So I was anybody.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:22.300
So I went to Texas, and I went
to Austin [phonetic] to teach

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:27.670
for a semester instead of writing
my book and Austin is great.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.640
I mean people really
in Austin love Austin.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.690
There are big stickers
of Keep Austin Weird

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.560
and they're really proud of
Austin and it's changed a lot.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.850
I mean this was in 2006
2007, so it's changed a bit,

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:42.460
but felt about it like Brendan
[inaudible] felt about Toronto,

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.280
you know, they arrested
Brendan in Toronto.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.670
So he took against the place

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.580
and when he was leaving they asked
him what he thought of Toronto.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.600
He said, ah, it will be
lovely when you finish it.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.750
So I mean I felt the same a
bit about Austin, you know,

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.690
the one side of the
street was there but the

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.710
where was the other
side of the street?

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.470
I felt homesick.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.520
I wanted to go home.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.870
I think that I don't even like in
Ireland, you know, Irish bread,

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.280
Irish weather, the
Irish news, Irish radio.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.440
Things that I despise
in Ireland really.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.140
I would lie in bed in the morning
in Austin and wish I was at home

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.460
in Ireland or at least
had the choice

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.920
where at least I had
some Irish bread nearby.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.830
So the idea, here was I, you
know, 50 or something years old,

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:33.610
feeling homesick and the idea
of, you know, missing things

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.420
and crossing off the days

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.090
and realizing December
I'll be going home, home.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.890
Suddenly I knew what home was.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:44.000 position:56%
When I went home, I thought I
really have to go back to this book.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.830
And so I went back
to work on the novel,

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.430 position:56%
which became the novel Nora Webster,

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:55.100
and am in the first few
pages I found the story.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:00.520
I needed to put in something
about visitors coming to the house

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.040
that in the aftermath of my
father's death, which would happen

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.660
at home it was very common, the
house would be filled with people

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.760
and be filled with people
talking and they would obviously

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.830
at the beginning express sympathy
and they would be very soft,

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:17.330
but then the conversation could
go on about any other topic.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.160
It was an amazing gift
to a novelist.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.050
This little 12-year-old sat
and listened to all of them

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.400
and one evening a woman
came and she talked

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.330
about her daughter in Brooklyn.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.180
Brooklyn wasn't America,
it wasn't Manhattan,

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.960 position:56%
it wasn't New York, it was Brooklyn.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.390
And she had letters from
her and things from her

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.080
and often the most interesting part
of the evening was when the person,

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.400
someone left the house and
the others would start talking

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:47.610 position:56%
about them and you'd find out
something really interesting usually

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.190
if you listened carefully.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.190
Often you'd be put out of the room
eventually when something very,

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:54.450
very private was being told,

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.530
but if you just sat there quietly
you'd hear, and I heard the story

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.950
that the woman's daughter
had come back from Brooklyn

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.510
and that she had been
married in Brooklyn,

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:07.400
but she taken her wedding ring off
because she really didn't want them

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.120
to know she was married
because then they would know

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.330
that she was going back
to America forever.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.780 position:56%
It was just there so I needed to put
a story like that to give a sense

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.540
of what was happening in the house.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.030
I used that story.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.460
I took it precisely from memory.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.250
I remember the woman coming, her
scarves, her hat, she had not been

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.680
in the house before , I
knew what her name was,

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.190
I knew where her she lived, I
just put it in as a small detail

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.490
at the beginning of the story.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:38.020
And then I found myself
rereading the first chapter

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:44.340
and when I saw those four or five
sentences about her daughter,

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:50.400
I realized that was a story and
that I said I would do anything

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.070
to stop Nora Webster.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:57.150 position:56%
So I stopped and thought this little
story about a young girl going

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.510
to Brooklyn and coming home.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:03.100
And of course once more
the emotion that has been

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:07.910
with me just before I started to
write the idea of homesickness,

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.110
the idea of what morning
sounds are like in a country

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.980
that is not a familiar country.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:19.470
The idea of never being sure and,
for example, am you know if you go

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.930 position:56%
to Ireland I mean it's changing now,
but if you would go in the morning

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:26.080
to get a cup of coffee and
the man might say to you

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.490
or the woman behind the counter are
you going to have the coffee here

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.530
or are you going to
take away with you?

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:36.580
And you'd say, oh, oh, I think
I'll take it away with me,

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:42.420
but in America, in Austin,
it to go or to stay.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.810
I didn't know what that
meant at beginning.

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:48.870
I would say, oh, and then I'd have

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.670
to make a quick decision
you mean the coffee?

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.810
Coffee. Oh, I don't know.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:00.430
And they'd look at you
what you don't know?

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.310 position:56%
Almost every day and, you know, also
that you drive on the wrong side

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:08.310
of the road here, which is very
disturbing for somebody you know,

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:13.830
and these are just two small
examples of the ways in which,

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.650
you know, it takes you a
long time to become familiar.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:20.510
But I think it's the
things you can't name almost

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:21.810
that make you homesick.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:26.180
I mean I named bread, I named radio
but just a feeling in the air,

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.130
a sense of familiarity,
a sense for you're away

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:34.510
that every day is a challenge
and there is no ease in the air.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.950
That was with me as something

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.730
that I had been living
with for one semester.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.720
I started to put that into the book
and I started to make the character

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.210
as I'd made the Henry James
failure from my own failure

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:51.610
or from the judge's failure to
recognize the sheer importance

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:55.810
and worldwide implications
of my novel.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:24:03.300
And that so to my own homesickness
made its way into that book,

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:07.940
and so I stopped writing
Nora Webster and when

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.100
that book was finished, I
thought that's the end of Ireland.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.280
I thought one more time about
emigration, missing home,

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:20.050
mothers you know, farewells
all the sadnesses of Ireland,

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:23.270 position:56%
and I thought I, and also people
were complaining to me that the girl

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:27.660
in my novel, Brooklyn, was really
passive whereas she was just my

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.960
Auntie Harriet.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.760
In other words, my auntie Maeve
would bully my Auntie Harriet

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.060
in exactly the same way

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.030
as Rose would bully Alesh
[phonetic] in the novel.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:37.600
She was the younger sister of two

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.790
who just the older
sister controls everything

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:43.400
and the younger sister did what she
was told this is what would happen

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.900
to the younger sister if you
moved her away from that control

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.460
that she would still seem
somebody was easy to control,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:25:01.830
who was easy to manage, but I begun
to think I better not do that again

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:06.370
and also I was really one more
mention of Enniscorthy where I'm

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:08.450
from and where the
novels had been set,

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.060
I thought I need to
leave all that now.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.300
Maybe I'll just to stop altogether
and then suddenly it occurred

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:19.410
to me just like the Henry
James after the other book

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:24.380
that if the Virgin Mary as
an old woman got to speak,

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:28.590
she might have something
very interesting to say.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.980
Once that occurred to me
I just started writing

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.440
that down what she would say.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.910 position:56%
And of course, and that became a
novel which was called the Testament

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.720
of Mary, but all the
time I was meant

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.050
to be writing a novel
called Nora Webster.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:45.380
And I always had it there,
you know, in another words,

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.860
if the publisher had said no
one wants a novel at the moment

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:53.150 position:56%
about the Virgin Mary, I mean there
really isn't a need for such a book.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:57.570
I would've said well, I have
another novel just ready.

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:06.280
And eventually I thought I should
finish the book and because it was

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.060
such a personal story, and I
was putting everything into it

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:15.880
that had happened and sometimes
I was using the smallest detail

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.340
of that we came back one
night from being away,

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.820
from being at my Auntie
Maeve's house

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:27.020
and my mother said there's one
film on, there was only one channel

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.510
on television there's a
film on tonight and, boys,

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:33.080
maybe you can stay up late
and watch it called Gaslight.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.140
I'll never forget it because
the three of us, my mother,

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.610
my younger brother and myself
got so frightened by the film.

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:42.850
My mother had remembered it as
Ingrid Bergman and something

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:46.980
about glamour and with
Charles Boyer and it was, well,

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.160
we thought it was about us.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.350
We thought it was about a
frightened woman in a house

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:57.220 position:56%
because you know often my mother
would get up in the night and myself

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.200
and my younger brother
would hear her

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:06.940
and so those things I was putting
into the book which were, you know,

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.450
absolutely from memory coming.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:13.430
I wasn't transforming and
giving it to Henry James,

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:14.930
I wasn't transforming
and giving them

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.410
to an Irish woman whose
was emigrating,

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:20.870
I was actually recording
them all as they occurred

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.840
as though I had taken a photograph

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.410
or as though I could take a
photograph still as though black

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:32.100 position:56%
and white photography if I could get
that moment and film it and show it

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.220
to you exactly what
it was like as myself

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.810
and my younger brother just moved
closer and closer and closer

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:39.590
to my mother as Ingrid
Bergman got more

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.550
and more nervous on the television.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:45.850
I bet if you look back at
the listings for probably

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:50.150
like February 1968 you'd
find that one Sunday night

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:54.300
at about 9 o'clock they showed
Gaslight on Irish television

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.780
because we certainly watched it.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.410
And then the problem arose once
more when that book was finished

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:06.750
as to what to do, as to, I felt I
had drained myself out of books,

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:11.310
that by writing that story I had
written in a way my own story

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.170
and that in a way what's
strange about childhood

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:18.460
and maybe what stranger even still
about childhood trauma is nothing

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.920
as important ever happens
again it is

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.260
as though nothing ever
happens again.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:28.300
So as you dealt with that it is as
though there's nothing else to deal

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:34.290
with and then as usual
something occurred to me.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:38.090 position:56%
There was, I just need to say
something first about the whole idea

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:42.160
of what has happened with religion
in Ireland that when I was growing

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:47.660
up I mean there were some
Protestants in Enniscorthy,

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.160
but we were mainly
Catholic and everybody,

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.510
people were always
going to confession.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:55.960
You go over on a Saturday and
the whole town will be waiting

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.990
at various confession boxes
on two sides and people would,

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.910
one priest could be very difficult.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:06.030 position:56%
My mother went once and told the
priest that she couldn't think that,

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.550
she said she didn't commit
any sin and she couldn't think

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.190
of any sin she committed, but
she had to go to confession

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:12.490
because that's what you had to do.

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:14.550
So she couldn't think
so she just said, well,

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.910
one night I forgot to
say my night prayers.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:21.900
And there was a very stern
silence on the other side

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.820
and the priest said, you forgot
to say your night prayers?

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.450
Are you a mother?

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:32.520
A nice mother he said
as though somehow

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.910
or other she must be
a very bad mother,

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.070 position:56%
a nice mother he said sarcastically,

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.530
meaning that she couldn't
be a good mother

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.720
because she had forgotten
once to say her night prayers.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.740 position:56%
But people told those sort of
stories about confessions, you know,

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:48.370
some priests were hard,
but that began to disappear

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:52.370
and suddenly it was penance, you
know, everyone's sins were forgiven

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:54.270 position:56%
by a priest in the top of the altar.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:57.590 position:56%
You didn't have to go to the priest,
sit in the confessional or kneel

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:02.760
in the confession box and tell him,
you know, I told a lie, Father,

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.240
and he said what sort of lie.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.270
That was over.

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:09.500
They also abolished limbo,

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.540
which I thought was quite
a nice thing at the time.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.090
I mean there was, you know,
there was heaven, there was hell,

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:17.380
there was purgatory, but
then there was just limbo

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.130
where nothing much happened.

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:20.500 position:56%
I thought that might be a nice place

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.120
because you wouldn't have all the
pressures of all the other places

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.230
and they actually abolished
it, it didn't happen anymore.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:32.720
But there was something
interesting that I discovered

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:39.020
that also disappeared, which was a
whole idea of animism or paganism

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.250
that had survived within
Irish Catholicism.

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:46.150
For example, it was said that
if someone in a family was going

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:50.180
to die a knock would come
to the door, just a knock,

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.700
and you would hear
it and it would be

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.180
at a strange time and
you would know.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.080 position:56%
And recently I went to see the
house where my grandmother was born,

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.440
and I realized it was away from the
main road, it was way down a lane.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.710
Of course, a knock in the
night, a knock on the door

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.740
in the night would be the
most astonishing idea.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:12.580
But then I remembered
asking when did that stop?

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:18.120
I mean that, no one, moving
into the 1980s no one talked

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:23.940
about that anymore and so just,
I'm going to read a small bit

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:26.960
from this novel, House of
Names, where I'm going to,

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:37.690
with Clytemnestra, and whose
husband and Agamemnon has,

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:42.070
he has invoked the gods because
he wants the winds to change

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:45.130
for the beginning of the Trojan
war and the gods have said

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.680
if you sacrifice your own
daughter the winds will change.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.150
So he invites his wife and
his daughter to come yours

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:54.700
and he lures them there,
he sacrifices the daughter.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.370
This is the mother in the
aftermath of this where she thinks

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:02.930
about the idea of asking
the gods for things.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:06.690
I had spies to tell me
when he would come back.

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:09.720
Men lit each fire that gave
the news to further hills

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.360
where other man lit
fires to alert me.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.950
It was the fire that brought
the news, not the gods.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.960
Among the gods now there's no
one who offers me assistance

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.850
or overseas my actions
or knows my mind,

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:24.230
there is no one among the
gods to whom I appeal.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.800
I live alone in the
shivering solitary knowledge

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.420
that the time of the
gods has passed.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.900
I am praying to no gods.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:37.660 position:56%
I'm alone among those here because I
do not pray, I will not pray again.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:41.100
Instead I will speak
in ordinary whispers.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.520
The gods have their
own unearthly concerns,

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:49.170
they barely know we are alive for
them if they were to hear of us,

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:52.830
we would be like the mild sound
of wind in the trees, a distant

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.420
and persistent rustling sound.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.780
I know that it was not always thus.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.740
There was a time when the gods
came in the morning to wake us

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.840
and they combed our hair and filled
our mouths with the sweetness

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.420
of speech and listened
to our desires

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.490
and tried to fulfill them for us.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:13.210
When in your minds and when
they could send us signs.

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:16.550
Not long ago within our memories
the crying women could be heard

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:20.040
in the night and the time
before death came as a way

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.460
of calling the dying home
hastening their flight,

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.660
softening their wavering
journey to the place of rest.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.560
My husband was with me in the
days before my mother died,

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.710
and we both heard it and my mother
heard it too and it comforted her

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:37.640
that death was ready
to lure with its prize.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.330
That noise has stopped.

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:41.730
There's no more crying
like the wind.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.070
The dead fade in their own time.

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:45.610
No one helps them.

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:48.600
No one notices except
those who have been close

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.650
to them during their
short spell in the world.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:54.120
As they fade from the
earth, the gods do not hover

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.790
over with their haunting
whistling sound.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:59.500
I noticed that here the
silence around death.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.920
They have departed the
ones who oversaw death.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.140
They have gone and
they will not be back.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.530
And this is another illustration
of the idea that I've talked

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:15.760
about before of the, of using
things, whatever is on your mind

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:19.960
in the case of the Henry James, in
the case of the going to Brooklyn,

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:24.400
in the case of exile, but
also in this time where a time

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.570
of faith clashes with
the time where faith is,

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:33.200
or at least where certain sorts of
rituals are beginning to change.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.450
And so, although this
novel is ostensibly set

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:40.760
in ancient Greece it's also set in
Ireland in which I was brought up

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.760
and the Ireland in which I live.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.780
I think we have might have time
now for one or two questions

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.510
if anyone has anything to ask me
I will try and tell the truth.

00:34:50.510 --> 00:35:03.040
[ Applause ]

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.130
&gt;&gt; I have just returned from
Enniscorthy and all the people

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:08.780
at Wilton Garden send
their best to you.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.360
It was a wonderful visit
and a wonderful place

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.780
and your influence
is there in big form.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:18.250
And if we take another 10
or 15 years in Ireland,

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:22.300
which certainly seems robust,
appears robust in its economy,

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:27.900 position:56%
its literature, what do you see over
the next few decades for Ireland?

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.130
&gt;&gt; Colm Toibin: I'm going suppose
the big issue that's facing us now

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.390
is [audible] where people
talk about a hard border.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.570
Well, I wrote a book
about the border.

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:40.280
There are 200 ways of
crossing the Irish border.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.320
There are 50 good ways
for a truck to cross.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:48.540
So if anyone in Brussels or London
thinks that there's just one road

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:52.030
and they can build a wall,
I have news for them.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.420
And also there are plenty of
people around who really would

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.680
like to start smuggling again

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.880
because there's plenty
of money in smuggling.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.900
So, I suppose that's one area,
but also I think the other area is

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.590
that an Ireland or the Republic

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:11.890
of Ireland I think really does feel
a closeness to the European Union

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:17.060
and that there is no appetite
whatsoever in Ireland for us

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:21.590
to join the British in moving
away and becoming an independent,

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:24.850
angry archipelago at
the very edge of things.

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:30.080
So many Irishmen have traveled
in Europe and so many benefitted

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.830
from membership with
European Union that I think

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:36.370
that that will become a
stronger bond in the future.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:39.950
I really love flying over England
and waving at it and saying,

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.500
you know, hard luck, guys.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:48.470
You made a bad deal that time
and also we're really nice.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:52.680
I mean even Leo Varadkar, our
Prime Minister, said if you want

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:59.120
to come back any time, we'll
help you come back in, you know.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.650
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.150
Thanks for the great talk.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:07.310
You talked a lot about the changes
in Ireland that have happened.

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:12.220
What continuities to Irish
history have been important

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:16.410
and are important to you as
a writer and as an Irishman.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:17.710
&gt;&gt; Colm Toibin: Oh,
I think that some

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.010
of the continuity would
be interesting

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.350
if you could ask the
right questions.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:27.560
I mean I think the idea of family
is very important, and when we,

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.300
when I was involved in the
referendum over gay marriage,

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:34.400
this became a very interesting
business where you probably realize

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.570
if you could stop talking
about gay people

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:42.500
as an angry marginalized group who
were different from you but instead

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.910
as somebody who could be your
own daughter, your own son,

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:49.170
your own uncle, your own sister,
your own brother, people would go,

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:53.560
oh, well, they're certainly getting
the same rights as everybody else.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:59.010
And so in that referendum you saw
that sort of loyalty coming where,

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:05.030
I mean you were advised not to go
to the door with your boyfriend

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.680
but to bring your aunt,
your mother, your sister,

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.950
three of the great talkers of
the family with you and just shut

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:13.720
up just for once if
you're gay shut up.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.340
Let them talk and this
is my son, and he's gay,

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.450 position:56%
his brother is straight, we were all

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:20.860
at his brother's wedding,
it was great.

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.580
We'd love to go to his wedding.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.460
Just lend us your vote.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.320
And people say, oh,
and he's your son?

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.470
Look at the two of you and
everyone talked about at the door.

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:36.430
People who were going to vote no
saying, oh, if that's the case,

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:39.650
you know, I'll think about
it because I wouldn't

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:42.620
like you to feel left out.

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:48.480
And that intense loyalty around
family I think has still remained,

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.090
and I think it's very important.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:54.630
It's something you see at
Christmas, when, for example,

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:57.340
people come in from America
or come in from Poland,

00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:01.180
or I think that's why the Poles
have, the Polish people have come

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.660
to live in Ireland have
functions they want

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.580
to go home for Christmas too.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:11.240
We understand that about them
and so that, the whole idea

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:16.400
of belonging not just to Ireland
but to a place in Ireland.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.700
In other words, that you're from.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.000
Where are you from?

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.300
Oh, you're from Enniscorthy.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.450
That sort of says something
about you.

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:26.130
So all of that sense of belonging

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:29.890
and family I think has
absolutely remained intact

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:34.550
and despite all the other changes
and, in fact, may even be stronger.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:40.880 position:56%
So I mean that's one good thing
that has happened despite, you know,

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.900
some of the things that I could.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:46.490
Also, the roads are better, you
know, and so it's much easier

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:50.580
to get home and sometimes
it's much easier to get away.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.880
Thank you very much.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.180
Thank you very much everybody.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.980
Thank you.
