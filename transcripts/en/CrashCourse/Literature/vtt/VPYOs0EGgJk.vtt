00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.799
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature and today we’ll be discussing

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:04.799
Macbeth.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.560
Some people...
...call it the Scottish play or the Bard’s

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.530
play because allegedly, back in the 17th century
a coven of witches cursed the play to punish

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.440
Shakespeare for including their spells.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.799
But that’s just not credible.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.300
So I’m going to call it by it’s real name.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.660
While acknowledging that there have been maybe
a lot of riots, deaths and accidents associated

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.190
with Macbeth in performance.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.780
But this is a YouTube ch...You know what?

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.470
Maybe we should call it the Scottish play.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.140
For the record, I did my own stunts in that
bit.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.890
Anyway, today we’ll discuss the historical
background for the play, the political and

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.710
religious context in which it was written,
the play as a likely collaboration, and Macbeth’s

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.710
famous dilemma.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.510
All right, time to find out just what all
that sound and fury signifies.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:55.480
INTRO
Let’s just go straight to the Thoughtbubble.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.450
As the play begins, the Scottish generals
Macbeth and Banquo have defeated the invading

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.900
armies of Ireland and Norway.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.960
Great work, Scotland!

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.110
They meet three witches who tell Macbeth,
the Thane of Glamis, that he’s going to

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.700
become Thane of Cawdor and then king.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.350
They tell Banquo that while he won’t become
king, his sons will.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.451
Macbeth calls these witches “imperfect speakers”
and says that all this talk “stands not

00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:25.030
within the prospect of belief,” but then
Macbeth almost immediately does become Thane

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.040
of Cawdor, so he writes to his wife, and she’s
like, we’re going to be royalty!

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.330
There’s just the small matter of killing
the king.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.470
The king, Duncan, comes to stay at Macbeth’s
castle, and the Macbeths plan his murder.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.770
They kill the king, but the second half of
the plan, killing Duncan’s sons, goes Shakespearenly

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.770
awry.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.670
So Macbeth has to worry about those sons;
he also has to worry about Banquo’s son,

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.090
so he hires some murderers.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.590
Banquo is killed, but his son escapes.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.060
Macbeth starts hallucinating at dinner parties,
so he goes to visit the witches and they tell

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.700
him: stay away from Macduff (another Thane),
no man born of woman can hurt you, and you’ll

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.200
be fine as long as Birnam Wood, the forest
outside Macbeth’s castle, stays put.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.200
And Macbeth is like, trees can’t travel,
I got this.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.220
Still he becomes crueler and more paranoid,
executing Macduff’s family and trying to

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.310
quash a growing resistance.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.010
Lady Macbeth, haunted by her part in the king’s
murder, can’t get an invisible spot of blood

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.900
out of her dress, begins to sleepwalk and
then dies, a probable suicide.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.400
Macduff, in league with Duncan’s son Malcolm,
brings an army to fight Macbeth.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.330
The army uses branches from Birnam Wood as
camouflage.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.190
Macbeth holds out until he and Macduff meet
on the battlefield.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.960
He says no one of woman born can hurt me and
Macduff’s like, “I was a C-section baby!”

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.030
Then he lops off Macbeth’s head.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.030
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.390
So Macbeth is a tragedy, but it’s also a
history play.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.390
Kind of.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.300
Like Cymbeline or King Lear, it’s based
on historical sources.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.250
But these sources have their own problems
and Shakespeare takes plenty of liberties,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.629
some of them artistic, some of them having
more to do with the politics of his day and

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.500
the preferences of his patron.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.709
Most of what we know about the real Macbeth
comes to us from Holinshed’s Chronicles,

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.520
published in 1577 and a source for a lot of
Shakespeare.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.920
The Chronicles tell us that Macbeth and Duncan
were kinsmen in medieval Scotland, and that

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.650
Macbeth was a great general, although maybe
too cruel and Duncan was a compassionate king,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.030
although maybe too nice.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.739
The chronicles tell us that he was so nice
that the country went to the dogs because

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.250
Duncan couldn’t enforce the rule of law.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.260
Also after a battle, Macbeth and Banquo meet
“thrée women in strange and wild apparell.”

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.709
So far, so Macbeth.

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.680
But then Shakespeare makes some pretty substantial
changes: In Holinshed, Banquo helps Macbeth

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.909
slay the king and Macbeth actually becomes
a pretty good ruler, at least for a while.

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.190
In the Chronicles, “he set his whole intention
to mainteine iustice, and to punish all enormities

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.409
and abuses, which had chanced through the
féeble and slouthfull administration of Duncane.”

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.470
/
And Macbeth maintains this justice and punishes

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.610
enormities for ten years--before become eventually
becoming paranoid and cruel.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.409
So Shakespeare probably made some of his changes
out of narrative necessity--murder and tyranny

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.670
make for a better story than boringly effective
kingships.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.799
He also, of course, wanted to explore how
ambition and prophecy and heirs shape human

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:16.799
experience.

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.199
But he probably left Banquo out of the murderous
plotting for one very specific reason:

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.860
King James I was Shakespeare’s patron at
the time, and King James I just happened to

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.270
trace his lineage back to Banquo, who by the
way, is probably a made-up figure.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.699
So obviously, Macbeth the king killer had
to be bad, and Banquo the king’s ancestor

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.020
had to be good, unless you’re the kind of
playwright who’d rather live out the rest

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.689
of his career in a dungeon.

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:47.439
Also King James I’s men had just foiled
a pretty serious assassination plot, the Gunpowder

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:51.729
Plot, which you may remember because it involved
Guy Fawkes and Remember Remember the Fifth

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.639
of November and that massively overrated movie
V for Vendetta.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.800
Macbeth was probably first performed the following
year, so the killing of kings was a touchy

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.629
subject, even touchier for James because his
mother, Mary Queen of Scots, was killed by

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:08.600
Queen Elizabeth and his father was assassinated.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.680
So in this context, it makes sense that Shakespeare
would highlight the dire consequences on offer

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.590
when someone assassinates a divinely crowned
king.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.379
James I as a patron also may help to explain
the text’s emphasis on the supernatural,

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:24.949
because James I was super into the supernatural.

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:30.479
So into it that in 1597 he published a book
on witchcraft, called “Daemonologie.”

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:36.439
The book really caught on; after it, people
in England became a lot more willing to believe

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:39.379
in witches, and fairies, and ghosts, and demons.

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:42.759
Daemonologie also helped perpetuate witch
hunts all over Europe.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.800
James, in fact participated in witch hunts
himself, most of which targeted vulnerable

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.240
women, particularly the poor and the elderly.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.199
So taking the witches seriously is another
way to flatter and interest his patron.

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:58.749
Although it should also be noted that Macbeth
taking the witches seriously leads to disaster.

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:00.309
Oh, it’s time for the open letter?

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:02.560
An open letter to witch hunts.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.240
But first, let’s see what’s in the secret
compartment today.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.469
Oh my gosh!

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:10.039
It’s Yoda, who almost certainly would have
been prosecuted as a witch in 17th century

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.039
England.

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.059
I mean aside from the magic and the cryptic
speech patterns, there’s just something

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:17.219
to his look that I suspect wouldn’t have
gone over well.

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:21.669
Dear witch hunts, I’m gonna take the controversial
opinion that I am opposed to the social order

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.749
blindly attacking the weak.

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:25.000
That’s what a witch hunt is.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.550
The power structure looking to defame and/or
murder people who cannot defend themselves.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.779
the publication of direct and accurate quotations,
even if they’re unflattering?

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.309
Not an example of a witch hunt.

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:39.939
Legal investigations into actual non-supernatural
crimes?

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:40.939
Not a witch hunt.

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:44.779
And lastly, if you travel to a bunch of different
locations to find certain items, that is not

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:45.779
a witch hunt.

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:46.779
That’s a scavenger hunt.

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:51.360
In short, witch hunts, I am opposed to you,
but I am also opposed to wrongful characterizations

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.360
of you.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.459
Best wishes, John Green.

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:54.459
All right.

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:55.459
Let’s turn to a moment to authorship.

00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:57.999
All of Shakespeare’s plays were written
by Queen Elizabeth.

00:06:57.999 --> 00:07:01.199
And yes, that includes the ones that were
written after she died.

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.199
What’s that?

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:06.389
Oh, Stan informs me that most scholars agree
that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare’s plays.

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:10.490
But it’s possible that Macbeth was written
in part by someone else, too.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.339
For a while scholars have been arguing about
whether another Jacobean playwright, Thomas

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:18.209
Middleton, contributed to a later revision
of the play.

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:20.710
This wouldn’t have been unusual.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.580
Collaboration was common at the time and some
of Shakespeare’s early and late plays were

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.580
collaborations.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.110
Middleton almost certainly contributed to
Timon of Athens, for instance, a Shakespeare

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:35.659
play that is famously not as … what is the
adjective I’m looking for … finished as

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:36.659
Macbeth.

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:40.459
Evidence for Middleton’s collaboration includes
the fact that the witches’ songs show up

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:42.129
in his own play The Witches.

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:45.989
Also, a couple of the stage directions sound
like Middleton’s, as do the diction and

00:07:45.989 --> 00:07:47.389
the meter in a few cases.

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:52.569
But even the most enthusiastic Middleton cheerleader
only credits him with at most a hundred or

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:54.489
so lines.

00:07:54.489 --> 00:07:59.319
But of course who wrote the play is only tangentially
related to what’s in it--and Macbeth has

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:04.209
survived through the centuries not primarily
because it was written largely by Shakespeare

00:08:04.209 --> 00:08:06.590
but because it is, you know, great.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.379
So as the play begins, Macbeth has just won
an important battle.

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:13.289
He’s the hero of the day—a day still steaming
in blood.

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:17.939
And then he meets the witches, who have been
laying in wait for him and they give him the

00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:18.939
prophecy.

00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:23.179
Now we might wonder if the witches are real,
actual witches or just some embodiment of

00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:28.589
Macbeth’s own ambitions and desires, though
the fact that Banquo sees them argues for

00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:29.589
reality.

00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:32.180
But maybe they’re both real and metaphorically
resonant.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.029
We should also wonder if their prophecy is
true.

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:40.409
Can they really see into the future or are
their words a way to mess with Macbeth and

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.380
tempt him to do something terrible?

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:47.360
Is Macbeth’s fall inevitable or could he
have avoided it if he’d ignored the witches’

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.360
pronouncements?

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.480
Now I’d argue that this is not just a problem
for Macbeth--all of us would like to know

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.920
if our future is fated or our will is free.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.750
In some way, Macbeth learning his future seems
to change his future--

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.870
Like was he going to be King before he found
out he was going to be king?

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:09.680
Well that gets into the question of predestination,
which was one of the central religious debates

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.170
of the era in Europe--
are you predestined to go either to heaven

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.829
or to hell, or do we have free will to choose
our eternal fates?

00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:20.170
Shakespeare’s England was at the center
of these conversations--it was officially

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.459
newly Protestant but deeply religiously divided.

00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:28.649
And one of the geniuses of Macbeth is that
it explores how difficult it can be to tell

00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:31.670
fate from choice--
I mean Macbeth and his wife make a lot of

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.230
choices, but they also fulfill every single
prophecy

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.810
Macbeth knows he shouldn’t kill the king.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:42.680
This is a very important idea in both Game
of Thrones and 17th Century England.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:48.529
James I believed in a divine right of kings,
the idea that kings are ordained by god to

00:09:48.529 --> 00:09:49.529
rule

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:53.769
Undercutting that idea was very dangerous
for political stability, because then anybody

00:09:53.769 --> 00:09:56.750
could be king, or maybe we don’t even need
kings.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.399
and Shakespeare basically upholds this idea.

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:05.050
So on the one hand then you have moral prohibition,
the risk of earthly punishment, and eternal

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.050
damnation.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:11.230
And on the other side you have the opportunity
to become the king of scotland, the 732nd

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.170
most important kingdom at the time.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.560
Deciding between doing what you should do
and doing what you want to do shouldn’t

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:23.240
be that difficult--but it is, as anyone who
has ever lived an actual human life can tell

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.240
you.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.240
In the end, Macbeth cannot resist his ambition.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.839
But once he’s made the decision, he sees
a dagger hovering in the air in front of him:

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:36.019
“A dagger of the mind, a false creation,/
Proceeding from the heat-oppressèd brain.”

00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:41.339
Now, is Macbeth insane and hallucinating things
or is this another supernatural goad?

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:45.471
I mean, Macbeth feels conflicted about his
choice and the appearance of a dagger both

00:10:45.471 --> 00:10:51.000
shows his distress, but he interprets it as
legitimizing his choice to kill the king.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.050
Not for the first time, the supernatural being
open to human interpretation.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.689
A dagger hovering in the air seems like a
pretty good sign to go ahead with a murder

00:10:59.689 --> 00:11:03.089
that Macbeth both desires and is horrified
by.

00:11:03.089 --> 00:11:07.010
Reading Macbeth, you have to get used to that
push/pull of attraction and repulsion.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:11.800
From the time the witches say, “Fair is
foul and foul is fair,” this is a play full

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.820
of contradictions and double meanings.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:18.010
A lot of scholars link this linguistic ambivalence
to the issue of equivocation, which means

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.709
answering in ways that are deliberately unclear.

00:11:20.709 --> 00:11:25.350
It’s a method that Catholics, who were persecuted
in England in Shakespeare’s day, were encouraged

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:29.410
to adopt, chiefly via Henry Garnet’s “A
Treatise on Equivocation.”

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:33.519
Shakespeare’s father was likely a Catholic,
but the play suggests that there’s something

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:38.149
evil in ambiguous speech, like the kind the
witches, who speak in half-truths, use.

00:11:38.149 --> 00:11:43.699
And it suggests the same about conflicted
or ambiguous morality, like the kind Macbeth

00:11:43.699 --> 00:11:44.699
initially practices.

00:11:44.699 --> 00:11:49.060
But I don’t think this linguistic ambivalence
is just reflective of a 17th century religious

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.060
debate.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.940
I also think it’s reflective of Macbeth’s
psychological ambivalence,

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.810
He is both excited and afraid at the thought
of becoming king via murder and that gives

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:04.069
us a little bit of insight into a man who
begins the play as a decorated war hero and

00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:05.939
ends it as a decapitated butcher.

00:12:05.939 --> 00:12:10.440
We’ll pick up next time with a further discussion
of Macbeth’s complicated and fascinating

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.440
character.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:17.040
Until then, if any weird sisters approach
you on a blasted heath, do not listen to them.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.519
After all, it’s not the prophesying that
did the damage.

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:40.730
It’s the believing 

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.959
the prophecy.

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:49.259
Thanks for watching.
