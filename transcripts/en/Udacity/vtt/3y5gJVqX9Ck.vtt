00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.430
Welcome to lesson five. You've come a long way, and

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.240
most of the legwork is done already. If you think

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.180
back to lesson one, and there was that green button

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.820
that said Create an app, lots of things have happened since

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.510
then. But what we didn't tell you is when you

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.490
created that app, you also created a mobile app. In fact,

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.700
everything that youâ€™ve done so far is available already on

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.220
a mobile device. When you added work flow rules and approvals.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.340
When you added charts and dashboards. All of

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.720
that now is instantly mobile. Samantha and Andy

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.320
are going to show you that mobile app and

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.080
how to add even more cool features to it.
