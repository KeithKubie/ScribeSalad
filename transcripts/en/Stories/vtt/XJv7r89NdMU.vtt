00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.039
NARRATOR: Over the past decade,
record sales in on the rise.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.490
So in the age music
streaming and downloading,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.170
who's still listening to vinyl?

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.106
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.680
ADIA DOUGLAS: After school,
my parents come get me.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.770
And then they take the right
here, and I open the store.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.270
I do my little routine.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.380
I put on record.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.880
I am 16 years old.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.900
I am in the 11th grade.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.560
I started collecting when
I was about 10 years old.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.530
My dad gave me a couple
problems to start out with.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.770
My top finger out what
is my collection right

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.590
now are Oracular
Spectacular by MGMT,

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.710
Deja Vu by Crosby,
Stills, Nash, and Young,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.494
and Warpaint by Warpaint.

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:57.368
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:57.368 --> 00:01:01.010
When I'm listening to
my music on my stereo,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.030
it just sounds better.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.290
It sounds more alive.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.730
There's like a totally different
vibe then we put in my laptop

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.870
on and playing
something from YouTube,

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.330
or Pandora, or Spotify.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.246
JASON DOUGLAS: There's
nothing tangible to it.

00:01:12.246 --> 00:01:14.150
You have these binary
ones and zeroes,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.300
and that's what you have.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.510
So I think everyone sacrificed
sonic quality for convenience.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.400
ADIA DOUGLAS: My dad has
been such a great influence

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.380
on me loving vinyl, so much
that I had to open this place.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.570
He's just always collected
records way before I was born.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.770
I got the idea that we could
open a record store, because I

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.920
remembered we have
a bunch of boxes

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.701
full at the house of records
that were just sitting there.

00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:47.156
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:53.797 --> 00:01:55.630
JASON DOUGLAS: One of
the biggest influences

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.870
over the past, I think,
five or six years

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.270
has been Record Store Day.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.520
This is what got
Adia into wanting

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.540
to be a part of this generation
of new kids collecting vinyl.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.449
You also have other
outlets selling more now.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.310
Amazon, it's much more
tangible through them.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.640
The internet has made the
world a much smaller place.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.770
So you have much
more access to music

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.815
than I did when
I was a teenager.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.400
ADIA DOUGLAS: Many teenagers
are definitely getting back

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.790
into listening to vinyl.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.760
I have 13-year-old coming in,
saving their allowance just

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.065
by a bunch records,
which is really cool.

00:02:31.065 --> 00:02:33.190
When their parents are
pulling out their old vinyl,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.280
they're really getting into the
bands they're playing for them.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.270
It's really great because
I've been into that,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.108
so now I can relate to
all the kids my age.

00:02:41.108 --> 00:02:43.016
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:47.707 --> 00:02:50.040
NARRATOR: Has the internet
renewed your interested vinyl

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.710
records?

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.290

and how they've evolved,

check out this video here.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.790
SUBJECT 1: One of the earliest
instances is "Kilroy was Here."

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.000
It's this piece of graffiti that
was popularized in World War II

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.280
by American soldiers.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.319
So when new soldiers
came through,

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.110
they knew that their
people had been there.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.651
