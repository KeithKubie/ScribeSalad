00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.410
SUZANNE FREY: I am so excited
to welcome you here today

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.830
to connect, to celebrate,
and even to do some creating.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.470
AVNI SHAH: Engaging with
other professional women,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.450
getting together and
building a community where

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.340
we support and celebrate
each other-- this

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.460
is important to me.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.890
ALAINA PERCIVAL: Making
sure that the world knows

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.260
that there are actually a
ton of smart, ambitious,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.220
and qualified women
in the tech industry.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.720
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Women in general

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.940
don't sell themselves enough.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.440
Right?

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.330
Like, you have so
many strengths.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.900
You do such incredible work.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.826
TELLE WHITNEY: Yes, you
need to have the best

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:44.860
career you can possibly
have, but what can

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.960
you do to help others?

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.190
PAVNI DIWANJI: It doesn't
take very long or very much

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.120
effort to help
another woman in need.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.840
It doesn't take very
much to help someone

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.980
with their coding problem.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.630
KATE STIRR: What I
would really like

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.410
to solve for is creating a
global culture that supports

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.000
building confidence
in young women

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.980
so that they can
choose whether they

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.680
want to be artists, or
scientists, or some combination

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.460
thereof.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.110
TELLE WHITNEY: We want
you to be at the table,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.250
creating the technology that
will change all of our lives.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.690
And each one of you
can help make that so.
