another lazy plotless farted-out
comedy, that America will

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.080
inexplicably pay to see...

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.420
VOICE (CONT'D)
Grown Ups.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.680

families.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.830
VOICE (CONT'D)
Seriously. This movie cost 80

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.020
million dollars, and they shot it
at a lake!

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.120
VOICE (CONT'D)
It's lowest common denominator

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.550
comedy at it's laziest,
substituting plot, wit, and

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.079
character with guys getting hit in
the faces...

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.239

hot.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.830

you've come to expect:

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.159
VOICE (CONT'D)
Product placement

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.619
VOICE (CONT'D)
Adam Sandler's friends

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.640
VOICE (CONT'D)
And jokes so devoid of humor,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.640
creativity, or effort you won't
know when to laugh...but don't
