MALE SPEAKER: The
first time I read

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.160
Salman Rushdie was in Spanish.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.200
It was "The Moor's Last Sigh."

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.650
I like it so much that
I reread it in English,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.630
but first I had to get
a bigger dictionary.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.410
His first book,
"Midnight Children,"

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.790
he talks about the independence
of India from Britain,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.330
and also, he talks about how
the people moved from Pakistan

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.620
to India and how colonial
India divided itself.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.950
His books, even though
they talk about fantasy,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.090
they reflect a lot of
the world we live in.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.830
His latest book, "Joseph
Anton, A Memoir,"

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.270
he not only talks about
the reality of the world,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.330
but also the reality
of his life when

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.240
a writer has to go into hiding.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.790
Without more further ado, I
want to introduce and welcome

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.471
Salman Rushdie.

00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:08.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.730
SALMAN RUSHDIE:
Hello, everybody.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.870
I'm just saying, that's quite
a high percentage of the people

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.124
here that I'm keeping
from work, so that's good.

00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:23.290
Well, what I'm going to do
is talk for a little bit,

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.290
and read a little bit,
and then hopefully answer

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.090
your questions.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.761
Can you all hear fine?

00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:28.260
Yes?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.790
OK.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.290
You know, most writers don't
have interesting lives.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.710
Most writers-- some of them
go to the south of France,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.080
some of them go to bullfights.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.600
Mostly they sit in small,
poorly lighted rooms and work.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.509
I acquired the problem
of an interesting life.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.870
And, I mean, this book is
about that problem, really.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.460
But the writing mentality
is a very bizarre one,

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.940
because even at the worst
moment of your life,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.720
which, essentially,
this was, there's

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.100
a little voice of yourself
sitting on your shoulder

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.655
whispering in your ear
saying, good story.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.300
And encouraging you to do
your best to remember it.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.860
And so if somebody was asking
me about keeping journals,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.460
I've never been
the kind of writer

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.830
who really kept
detailed journals.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.260
Some of my friends
do, but I never really

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.100
had that temperament
or patience.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.230
But when this episode began,
when I was about 41 years old,

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.900
so much was happening so fast
that was so complex that I

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.320
realize that no matter how
good my memory might be,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.400
there was no way to remember it.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.160
There was no way to remember
the dailiness of it-- the step

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.450
by step-ness of it, you know.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.490
What happened as it happened.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.810
And so I thought, because of
this little voice in my head

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.960
saying, good story, I thought
I better write it down.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.030
I'd better start
keeping a record.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.879
And so for about 12 years, I did
keep a quite detailed journal,

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.670
and then put it aside
and didn't look at it

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.910
again for many years,
until I started

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.434
writing this book
only a few years ago.

00:03:34.434 --> 00:03:36.850
And when I went back to look
at the journal, first of all,

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.225
there's thousands
of pages of it.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.650
I found it to be useful, but
not in the way that I expected.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.780
That's to say, I thought there
might be, you know, stuff

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.730
there that I could just more or
less lift and put in the book.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.720
There was surprisingly
little of that.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.770
Surprisingly little
material that I could just,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.650
you know, cut and paste.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.650
Because for much of
the time, the pressure

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.290
on the person writing the
book-- the burden of the event

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.530
was so great that, you
know, the younger me

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.700
that was writing the book
was clearly not always

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.820
in the best shape.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.430
And so what the
journal became valuable

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.530
for was as a record of my
mental state, you know?

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.070
About how I was feeling,
how I was dealing with it,

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.810
how I was failing
to deal with it.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.400
And so it became an insight into
the life of a character called

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.225
with my name, but it
needed to be rewritten.

00:04:38.225 --> 00:04:42.370
It needed to be rewritten from
this point in my life looking

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.220
back.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.280
So I couldn't have done
it without the journal,

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.810
but oddly, it has
very little to do

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.295
with the journal in terms
of the actual sentences

00:04:53.295 --> 00:04:55.620
and the way it's written.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.750
The title comes out
of the fact that I

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.040
was asked at a certain point
by the British Special Branch,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.820
which is the secret
police, essentially--

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.430
there's a particular department
of the Special Branch which

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.790
does personal protection.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.470
It's called A Squad.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.970
And they protect the prime
minister and other government

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.550
ministers and other people
who are thought to need it.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.180
They wanted me to
have a pseudonym,

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.790
mostly so that they could
train themselves not

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.920
to use my real name by accident
when they were in public.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.680
If they were around
the corner from where

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.880
I was staying at a supermarket,
and accidentally said,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.940
oh, Salman asked us to buy a
packet of crisps or some candy,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.400
and then that would blow
the whole protection.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.310
So they had to train
themselves to use

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.210
a name that wasn't my name.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.970
And so they said,
think of something.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.510
And I didn't know
what name to choose.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.350
Again, I've never been
the kind of writer

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.020
who was interested in pen names.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.610
There are writers who
very successfully spend

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.020
their careers writing
under names not their own.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.360
John le Carre, for example, was
really called David Cornwell.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.220
And Anthony Burgess,
whose real name

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.350
was John Anthony Burgess Wilson
and used his middle names

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.700
as his writing name.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.870
But I never was at all
interested in having

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.790
any name on my books
other than mine.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.630
And then suddenly, I had
to have a name in real life

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.740
that wasn't mine.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.670
And in the end, I
just decided to start

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.584
fooling around with names
of writers that I admired

00:06:35.584 --> 00:06:37.750
and putting them together
and seeing if they worked.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.590
And in the end, I mean,
there were some kind

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.610
of comically bad attempts,
like Marcel Beckett.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.200
Nobody's called Marcel Beckett.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.910
But Joseph Anton, which came
from Joseph Conrad and Anton

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.010
Chekhov, seemed
to have the merit

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.950
of sounding like a name
somebody might actually have.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.800
And that was the main
reason for choosing

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.220
it was that it
sounded convincing.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:11.020
But in the end, I came to feel
that both Conrad and Chekhov

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.900
had something to do with
the condition that I was in.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.560
You know, Chekhov,
particularly in his plays,

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.930
is a great master of
writing about people

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.520
in a state of isolation and
loneliness and people wanting

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.800
to be somewhere other
than where they're stuck.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.480
His three sisters
yearning to return

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.400
to a Moscow to which
they can't return.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.110
And I thought, well,
I know how that feels.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.070
And so I felt there
was a part to me that

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.050
had fallen into a kind
of Chekhovian atmosphere.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.780
And Conrad-- well,
Conrad, first of all,

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.600
wrote a lot about spies
and secret agents,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.130
and, you know, about this kind
of underworld of intelligence

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:00.570
and espionage and
sabotage and so on.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:05.270
And so I thought somehow I was
in this bizarre world which

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.030
was both Conradian
and Chekhovian.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.230
You can imagine these two
writers couldn't be more

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.000
unlike each other,
and that suggests

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.670
how surrealist the reality was.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.410
One of the characteristics it
had is it took about 12 years.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.220
Everybody thought it would
take a few weeks, a few days.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.330
When this began-- when
the attack on "The Satanic

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.480
Verses" and its authors and
publishers and so on first

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:35.440
began, it was so outrageous that
the head of a foreign country

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.780
should order the assassination
of a citizen of Britain

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.490
in his own country
who had committed

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.340
no crime in that
country, and to threaten

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.609
to send killers to carry it out.

00:08:45.609 --> 00:08:47.400
Everybody thought--
politicians thought it,

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.120
the police thought
it-- this can't stand.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.420
This has to be stopped.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.160
And I remember the police
saying to me when they first

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.445
came to offer protection--
they said, look,

00:08:56.445 --> 00:08:58.070
we just have to go
away for a few days.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.120
You just have to lie
low for a few days.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.645
Find a hotel in the countryside.

00:09:01.645 --> 00:09:04.210
We'll just go there and
just keep your head down.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.920
Stay out of the papers and let
the politicians do their work.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.790
Let the diplomats do their work.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.260
This is going to get fixed,
because it has to get fixed.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.070
It's outrageous.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.630
So everybody went
into this thinking

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.730
it was going to take a few days.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.920
And when I left my house
on that basis, I thought,

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.670
OK, it's going to
take a while, and then

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.070
everything's going to quiet
down and I'll be home.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.270
Well, it took 12 years.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.745
And this is really the
story of those 12 years.

00:09:31.745 --> 00:09:35.470
And one of the characteristics
this period had

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.300
of living with police
officers and worrying

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.960
about all these larger
issues in the world

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.890
is that there were
many moments where

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.562
it was ridiculously funny.

00:09:46.562 --> 00:09:48.270
And that's something
you wouldn't expect.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.090
But it had the
characteristic of being

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.130
simultaneously
funny and not funny.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.240
The thing that was
not funny was funny.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:02.520
And, I mean, I remember
being taken at one point

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.720
to have dinner at the
house of my friend

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.720
the British Pakistani
writer Hanif Kureishi,

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.170
and when we left at
the end of the evening,

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.830
one of the policemen
forgot his gun.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.610
And of course, Hanif
was overjoyed by this

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.300
and came running
out into the street

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.170
holding the gun by
the barrel, waving it

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.890
like this, shouting, "Here!

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.790
You forgot your shooter!"

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:40.470
So this was ridiculously
farcical comedy.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.360
There was a moment when
my then very young son--

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.420
he's now grown up-- and I
were taken by the police

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.120
to a kind of fun fair.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.420
A kind of holiday fun fair.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.700
And there was one of those
shooting gallery places.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.830
And my little boy decided
there was a particular soft toy

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.080
on the top shelf that
he particularly liked.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.500
And I tried to
explain to him that

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.750
to get the one on the
top shelf, you basically

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.370
have to get all the ducks.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.040
And it's kind of impossible,
because these guns that they

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.690
give you are all
bent out of shape,

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.386
and the sights don't work,
and it's sort of a scam.

00:11:15.386 --> 00:11:21.710
And one of the police officers,
who we used to call Fat Jack--

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.250
is because his name
was Jack and he

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:31.560
was fat-- he overheard me
talking to Zafar about this.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.972
And he came over and he said,
which toy does he fancy, then?

00:11:36.972 --> 00:11:38.680
And I said, well, it's
that one up there.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.330
And he said, oh, all right.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.880
And he went over and
put down his pound coin

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.907
and was given his terrible
little shooting weapon,

00:11:46.907 --> 00:11:47.740
and he looked at it.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.090
He kind of went, hm.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.996
OK.

00:11:50.996 --> 00:11:54.270
And he went, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.350
Knocked everything down.

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.470
And there's the
poor fairground guy

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:03.960
going-- He's never seen
anybody shoot like this.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.357
And he got all of them.

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:07.190
And he turned to the
guy, and he said, yeah.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.356
We'll have that one, please.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.220
So there were these
sort of moments

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.750
which were ridiculous, in a way.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.120
I want to read you--
for a long time,

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.850
it was more or less
impossible for me

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:27.560
to go anywhere, except be in
England in this strange cocoon.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.592
But gradually, I knew
that I had to fight back.

00:12:31.592 --> 00:12:33.050
And there was the
beginning of what

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.850
became quite a large political
campaign around the world

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.330
to get political support to get
this thing removed, which did,

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.550
in the end, work.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.070
The whole traveling thing
was often very difficult.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.120
But the first time I was able
to come to the United States

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.650
was about two years in.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.430
And I'd been invited to
address a free speech

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.156
conference at
Columbia University.

00:12:57.156 --> 00:12:59.680
And I managed to get
over to New York.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.620
And the NYPD got a
little overexcited.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.830
So I just wanted to read
you-- it'll show you

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.520
what I mean about
funny and not funny.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.670
Oh, the book is written
in the third person.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.110
So I'm not I. I'm he.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.440
And that's, in a way, just
to make a slight distinction

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.330
between the author writing
the book and the author being

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.830
written about as being not
exactly the same person, not

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.350
at the same point in
their lives, et cetera.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.020
Anyway, he.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:51.510
So this is just
arriving in New York.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.060
He was met on the tarmac
at Teterboro Airport in New

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:59.560
Jersey by a nine car motorcade
with motorcycle outriders.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.410
The central car was an
armored white stretch limo.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.420
That was his car.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.050
In charge of the
very large number

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:11.640
of NYPD officers involved
was Lieutenant Bob Kennedy,

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.190
known for the day
as Hudson Commander.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.920
Lieutenant Bob
introduced himself

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.180
and explained the scenario,
often breaking off

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.600
to speak into his sleeve.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.010
"Roger, Hudson Lookout.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.310
This is Hudson Commander.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.270
Out.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.750
Roger that."

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.950
Policemen nowadays
spoke the way they

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.725
had seen policemen speak on TV.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.840
Lieutenant Bob, it
was clear, thought

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.230
he was in a major movie.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:48.760
"We'll be moving
you through the city

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.620
to the hotel in this
vehicle right here,"

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.590
he said redundantly as
the motorcade set off.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.360
"Lieutenant Bob," he
said, "this is a lot.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.000
The nine vehicles, the
motorbikes, the sirens,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.650
the flashing lights,
all of these officers.

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.080
Wouldn't it actually
be safer just

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.260
to drive me through the back
streets in a used Buick?"

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.050
Lieutenant Bob looked at him
with the pitying look people

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.780
reserve for the chronically
stupid or insane.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.630
"No, sir, it would
not," he replied.

00:15:21.927 --> 00:15:24.510
"Who else would you do something
on this scale for, Lieutenant

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:25.800
Bob?"

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:33.260
"Sir, this right here is
what we do for Arafat."

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.216
It was something of a
shock to be bracketed

00:15:35.216 --> 00:15:37.090
with the leader of the
Palestinian Liberation

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:37.631
Organization.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.710
"Lieutenant Bob, if I was the
president, how much more would

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.250
you do?"

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.860
"Sir, if you're with the
president of these United

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.330
States, we'd close down a whole
bunch of these side streets

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.360
here, sir, and sir,
we'd have snipers

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.222
on the rooftops along the route.

00:15:55.222 --> 00:15:57.430
But in your case, we didn't
think that was necessary,

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:04.859
because it would look
too conspicuous."

00:16:04.859 --> 00:16:08.760
The inconspicuous
nine vehicle motorcade

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.860
rolled towards Manhattan with
motorcycle sirens blaring

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.120
and lights flashing,
attracting no attention at all.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:22.880
And Andrew's my agent.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.689
Andrew Wiley was waiting
for him at the hotel.

00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:27.230
In the presidential
suite, there were

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.330
bulletproof padded mattresses
covering all the windows,

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.420
even though they were
on the top floor.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.850
And there were perhaps two dozen
men holding gigantic science

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.290
fiction weapons scattered
through the rooms.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.940
So there's a brief
episode there where

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.040
I'm visited by Susan
Sontag and Allen Ginsberg.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.097
Allen Ginsberg made
us sit on the floor

00:16:48.097 --> 00:16:49.180
cross legged and meditate.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.910
A little while later,
Elizabeth-- Elizabeth

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:55.960
was my girlfriend then.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.770
She became my wife.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.480
She's the mother
of my youngest son.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.250
A little while later,
Elizabeth arrived unannounced,

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.090
and Lieutenant
Bob brought her in

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.670
to see him surrounded
by armed men.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.440
"It's OK, Lieutenant Bob,"
he said. "Elizabeth's cool.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.410
Elizabeth's with me."

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.030
Kennedy narrowed his eyes.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.290
"If I wanted to kill you,
sir," he said insanely,

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.010
wearing his best crazy
Jack Nicholson look,

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:27.099
"she's exactly who I'd send."

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:30.290
He said, "How so,
Lieutenant Bob?"

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.069
Kennedy gestured
towards the table

00:17:32.069 --> 00:17:33.860
on which there was an
arrangement of fruits

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.610
and cheeses, as well
as cutlery and plates.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.510
"Sir, if she were to take
one of those folks there,

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:46.325
sir, and stab you in the
neck, I'd lose my job, sir."

00:17:46.325 --> 00:17:48.200
Andrew Wiley was finding
it difficult to keep

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.616
a straight face,
and Elizabeth was

00:17:49.616 --> 00:17:54.900
known as the mad forkist
for the rest of the trip.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.280
That evening, they were in
the armored white stretch

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.890
limo in the middle
of the nine vehicle

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.000
motorcade with the
motorcycle outriders

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.850
and the sirens and
the flashing lights,

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.710
zooming down 125th Street
towards the Columbia

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.240
campus at 60 miles an hour
with the whole of Harlem

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.930
out on the sidewalk watching
the low profile operation

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.810
ghost almost imperceptibly by.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.470
And Andrew was
screaming with delight

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.170
at the outrageousness
of it all, "This

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.830
is the best day of my life!"

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.750
Then the fun, the slightly
hysterical black comedy fun,

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.700
was over.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.005
He was concealed behind a
curtain at the [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:33.005 --> 00:18:34.910
library, and when his
name was announced,

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.915
there was a shocked
gasp as he moved forward

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:39.619
out of invisibility
into the light.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:40.410
Then there's pause.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.160
Then I had to make my speech.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:48.140
And, as I say here, the
moment the speech was over,

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:52.980
America unceremoniously
threw him out.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.890
I literally wasn't even
allowed to spend the night.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.390
But you see what I mean?

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:01.380
That it's simultaneously
ridiculously funny

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.150
and not funny at all.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.680
And this surreal
real characteristic

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.554
persisted through
all those years.

00:19:08.554 --> 00:19:10.720
I mean, of course, there
were moments which were not

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.815
at all funny, which were very
dark and serious and difficult.

00:19:15.815 --> 00:19:17.980
But anyway, I wanted
to say that one

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.320
of the reasons I think
that I'm standing here

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.480
and one of the reasons why
this story ended the way it did

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:32.060
is because there was a colossal
collective act of support which

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.870
was not from governments
and politicians and so on.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:41.140
I mean, as usual, they were
somewhat late to the party.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.150
It was from ordinary people.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.930
It was from people running.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.620
I've always felt
that the bookstores

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.160
were the front
line of this thing.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.490
The bookstores were where
there was physical danger

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.230
to people working there
and to the property.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.030
There were-- Cody's
Bookstore in Berkeley,

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:02.400
California was pipe bombed, and
there were fire bomb attacks

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.550
elsewhere in this country
and in many other countries.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.780
There were physical threats
to the staff of bookstores

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.450
and so on.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:15.240
And yet, the booksellers
of America and the world

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.600
just simply refused
to be defeated,

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.470
and put the book
in their windows,

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.840
and recommended it, and sold
it, and kept it in print.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.660
And the combination of that
effort with that of publishers

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:33.120
and around the world translators
and just ordinary people

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:38.850
not wanting their rights
as readers to be determined

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:44.210
for them by the
Ayatollah of Iran

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.010
meant that we were able
to resist this threat.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:50.360
And in the end, we did
get politicians involved,

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.210
and they did negotiate
an ending to it

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.670
with the Iranian government.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.555
But I've always felt very
proud and grateful to have

00:20:59.555 --> 00:21:05.330
been part of that collective
act of principle, if you like.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:08.982
And I hope that if
somebody else were

00:21:08.982 --> 00:21:11.190
in such a situation, that
we would all do that again.

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:16.120
But I also hope that nobody
else is in such a situation.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.500
And one of the things that's
interesting about time

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.310
having passed-- it's
now actually just

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.830
over 25 years since the first
publication of "The Satanic

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:29.371
Verses," which came out of
England in September 1988.

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:30.870
One of the things
that's interesting

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.780
about the intervening years
is how many of the people

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:37.550
who were involved in protests
against the book at that time

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.660
now say that they regret it.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.530
Some of them regret it
for tactical reasons.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.540
That's to say, they
felt it didn't work.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.680
They say, he just sold more
copies and became more famous,

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.920
and it didn't help
the community.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.400
It backfired.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.500
Which is true.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.510
Other people have actually
internalized free speech

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:04.060
arguments and believe that
if they have the right

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.124
to talk about their
opinions, then other people

00:22:06.124 --> 00:22:07.540
have the right to
say things which

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.400
conflict with those opinions.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:14.010
And so it's been an
interesting exercise,

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:19.460
because I hope that that whole
arc of a quarter of a century

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.810
reduces the likelihood that
these tactics would be used

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:28.730
again against a writer
or artist, at least

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:29.610
in the Western world.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:33.370
I mean, there are many writers
and artists in other countries

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.420
who are under attack,
and not by any means only

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.700
in the Islamic world.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.830
I mean, in fact, one of
the big areas of problems

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.080
now, as you probably
know, is China,

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.470
where attacks on literary
and journalistic freedom

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.420
are very, very severe.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.660
Anyway, so it's an
exemplary tale, if you like.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.910
I mean, I also feel-- well,
I try to say in the book

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:04.340
that when this began, it felt
like a bizarre, small, isolated

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.640
episode.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.560
And I think now
that we know what

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.280
we know about what has
happened in the last 25 years,

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:19.350
we can see it as part of the arc
of the rise of radical Islam.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.490
And you can draw the
lines of connection

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.000
from these initial attacks
on individual writers

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.910
and journalists and so on
to the much larger attacks

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:31.710
that we all know about.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.140
And at the beginning
of the book,

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.900
I use the metaphor of Alfred
Hitchcock's movie, "The Birds."

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.580
That when, in that famous scene
in the school playground when

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.120
the first bird comes and
settles on the climbing

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.650
frame outside the school
room, it's just a bird.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.490
It's just a bird sitting
on a climbing frame.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.880
It's only in
retrospect, when the sky

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.200
is full of hostile birds, that
you begin to think, oh, yeah,

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.396
there was that first bird.

00:23:58.396 --> 00:24:01.800
And I think it became, in a
way, the fate of "The Satanic

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.310
Verses" and its
author and publishers

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.360
to be the first bird.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.325
That was the beginning
of what became a storm.

00:24:12.226 --> 00:24:15.510
And that's why I think
the story of what

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:18.990
happened to me and the people
around me has, if you like,

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:20.150
a kind of larger resonance.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:24.500
And I hope if you read the book,
that you may feel that, too.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.450
I want to, just before I stop
and answer your questions-- one

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:32.270
of the things-- if you're
by nature a satirist,

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:41.250
if your default setting is
to send up people in power

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:45.850
and to take things
apart and so on,

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:50.720
it's much easier for
somebody of that tendency

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.260
to know what they're
against than to know

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.030
what they are in favor of.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:58.850
Because satire by its
nature is against things.

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.660
It deflates pomposity.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.910
It exposes tyranny, and so on.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:09.290
It became very clear to me
very early on in this business

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:10.830
that that wasn't enough.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.250
It wasn't going to be enough.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.420
That not just for
me to argue my case,

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.920
but also, actually, for me to
survive the event, to come out

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.950
the other end, I would
have to know not only

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.210
what I was against,
but what I was for.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.305
And in this case,
what I was against

00:25:26.305 --> 00:25:27.430
was pretty straightforward.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.680
I mean, killing writers
because of books they wrote.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.590
I was against that.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:38.280
That was kind of
an easy question.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.880
But what are you in favor of?

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.900
To ask yourself the
question, is there anything

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.680
that you be willing to
sacrifice your life for?

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.190
What is it?

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.650
Is it worth your life
being in danger for this,

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:52.478
and if so, why?

00:25:52.478 --> 00:25:55.250
And these are tough
questions to ask yourself

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:59.360
when, in fact, you're
really in that situation.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.800
And I think I came out of
it with just first of all,

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:07.400
a very much clearer, stronger
understanding of the value

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.010
of free speech, of the
principles enshrined

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:15.760
in the First Amendment, and
also a clearer and deeper

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.025
understanding of what literature
could bring to that narrative.

00:26:20.025 --> 00:26:22.400
And I just want to read you
a few pages from near the end

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.900
of the book which
talk about that.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:30.210
What do books have to do
with this insane world

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:31.540
that we now inhabit?

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:43.110
This deals with a
passage-- a moment in time

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:49.100
which is just after the
9/11 attacks, really.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.980
In New York, which is
where I was living by then.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:57.600
The story of his little
battle was coming to an end.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.350
The prologue was passed,
and now the world

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.620
was grappling with
the main event.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.300
It would've been
easy, after everything

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.450
that had happened to him, and
after the enormity of the crime

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:12.910
against this city, to succumb to
hatred of the religion in whose

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:17.220
name these things were done,
and of its adherents, too.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.030
Anyone who looked
even vaguely Arab

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.540
experienced some
of that backlash

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.780
in those weeks and
months of aftermath.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.910
Young men wore t-shirts
reading, "Don't blame me.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.720
I'm Hindu."

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.870
Drivers of yellow cabs, many
of whom had Muslim names,

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:36.440
decked out their taxis with
flags and patriotic decals

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.130
to ward off their
passengers' rage.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:43.100
But in this matter of wrath,
too, the city, on the whole,

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.060
showed restraint.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:49.120
The many were not held guilty
of the crimes of the few.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.150
And he, too, refused anger.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:55.900
Rage made you the creature
of those who enraged you.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.220
It gave them too much power.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.140
Rage killed the mind.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.200
And now, more than
ever, the mind

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:08.640
needed to live to find a way of
rising above the mindlessness.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.100
He chose to believe
in human nature,

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.810
and in the universality of its
rights and ethics and freedoms,

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:20.350
and to stand against the
fallacies of relativism that

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.080
were at the heart
of the invective

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.940
of the armies of the religious.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.280
"We hate you because
we're not like you."

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.440
And of their fellow travelers
in the West, too, many of whom,

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.290
disappointingly,
were on the left.

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:35.160
If the art of the novel
revealed anything,

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.190
it was that human nature was the
great constant in any culture,

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.690
in any place, in any time.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:45.400
And that, as Heraclitus had
said 2000 years earlier,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.770
a man's ethos, his way
of being in the world,

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:52.830
was his daimon, the guiding
principle that shaped his life.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.700
Or, in the pithier, more
familiar formulation

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.190
of the idea, that
character was destiny.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:02.680
It was hard to hold onto that
idea while the smoke of death

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.450
stood in the sky
over ground zero,

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:08.170
and the murders of
thousands of men and women

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:10.930
whose characters had not
determined their fates

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.720
were on everyone's mind.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.620
It hadn't mattered if
they were hard workers

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:18.000
or generous friends or loving
parents or great romantics.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.420
The planes hadn't cared
about their ethos.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.080
And yes, now terrorism
could be destiny.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.185
War could be destiny.

00:29:25.185 --> 00:29:29.240
Our lives were no longer
wholly ours to control.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.830
But still, our sovereign natures
needed to be insisted on.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.470
Perhaps more than
ever amid the horror,

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:38.020
it was important to speak
up for individual human

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.400
responsibility.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.790
To say that the murderers
were morally responsible

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.960
for their crimes, and
neither their faith

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.200
nor their rage at
America was any excuse.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.830
It was important at a time of
gargantuan inflated ideologies

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.620
not to forget the human
scale, to continue

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.600
to insist on our essential
humanity, to go on making love,

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:02.280
so to speak, in a combat zone.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.060
In the pages of a
novel, it was clear

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.020
that the human self was
heterogeneous and not

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.360
homogeneous.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.310
Not one thing, but many.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.410
Multiple, fractured,
and contradictory.

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.150
The person you were
for your parents

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:18.710
was not the person you
were with your children.

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:22.040
Your working self was other
than yourself as a lover.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.450
And depending on the time
of day and your mood,

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:30.080
you might think of yourself
as tall or skinny or unwell

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:35.530
or a sports fan or
conservative or fearful or hot.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.000
All writers and readers
knew that human beings

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.180
had broad identities,
not narrow ones.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.230
And it was the breadth
of human nature

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.820
that allowed readers
to find common ground

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:50.410
and points of identification
with Madame Bovary, Leopold

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:55.470
Bloom, Colonel [INAUDIBLE],
Raskolnikov, Gandalf the Grey,

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:58.750
Oskar Matzerath, the Makioka
sisters, the continental

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.400
[INAUDIBLE], the Earl of
Emsworth, Miss Marple,

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.010
the Baron in the Trees, and
Salo, the mechanical messenger

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:08.600
from the planet Tralfamadore
in Kurt Vonnegut's "The Sirens

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.370
of Titans"

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:13.010
Readers and writers
could take that knowledge

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:16.680
of broad based identity out
into the world beyond the pages

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.370
of books, and use the
knowledge to find common ground

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:22.910
with their fellow human beings.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:25.240
You could support
different football teams,

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.400
but vote the same way.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.370
You could vote for
different parties,

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:32.530
but agree about the best
way to raise your children.

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:34.800
You could disagree
about child rearing,

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.010
but share a fear of the dark.

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:40.652
You could be afraid
of different things,

00:31:40.652 --> 00:31:42.890
but like the same music.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.230
You could detest each
other's musical taste,

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:47.360
but worship the same god.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.130
You could differ strongly
on the question of religion,

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.850
but support the
same football team.

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.860
This was what literature
had always known.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.510
Literature tried to
open the universe.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.970
To increase, even if only
slightly, the sum total of what

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:05.120
it was possible for human
beings to perceive, understand,

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.250
and so finally, to be.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.950
Great literature went to
the edges of the known

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:12.475
and pushed against the
boundaries of language, form,

00:32:12.475 --> 00:32:16.500
and possibility to make the
world feel larger, wider

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.010
than before.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.450
Yet this was an age in which
men and women were being pushed

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.400
towards ever narrower
definitions of themselves,

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.490
encouraged to call
themselves just one thing.

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:30.425
Serb or Croat or Israeli
or Palestinian or Hindu

00:32:30.425 --> 00:32:33.750
or Muslim or Christian
or Bahai or Jew.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.900
And the narrow their
identities became,

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.550
the greater was the likelihood
of conflict between them.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.510
Literature's view
of human nature

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:44.530
encouraged understanding,
sympathy, and identification

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:46.460
with people not like oneself.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.340
But the world was
pushing everyone

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.970
in the opposite direction--
towards narrowness, bigotry,

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.790
tribalism, cultism, and war.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.450
There were plenty of
people who did not

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.905
want the universe opened,
who would in fact prefer

00:32:58.905 --> 00:33:00.890
it to be shut down quite a bit.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.850
And so when artists went
to the frontier and pushed,

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:07.270
they often found powerful
forces pushing back.

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:09.180
And yet they did
what they had to do,

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.100
even at the price
of their own ease,

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.790
and sometimes, of their lives.

00:33:15.329 --> 00:33:15.828
All right.

00:33:15.828 --> 00:33:20.285
I'll stop there and see
what you have to talk about.

00:33:20.285 --> 00:33:20.785
Thanks.

00:33:20.785 --> 00:33:26.677
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.930
MALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.002
Does anybody have a
question for Sir Rushdie?

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:52.690
AUDIENCE: How concerned are you
that even though the fatwa was

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.720
officially withdrawn
about 20 years ago,

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.180
that someone will take
it upon themselves

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.512
to nevertheless threaten
your life again?

00:34:01.512 --> 00:34:03.220
SALMAN RUSHDIE: I
don't know, none of you

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.460
look very dangerous to me.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.480
I think I'm probably OK.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.984
No, I mean, truthfully, it's
been over now for longer

00:34:11.984 --> 00:34:12.650
than it went on.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:16.520
I mean, it really
is a long time ago.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.239
And one of the things we all
know about the world we now

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:22.860
live in is that the
subject changes very fast.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.760
And last week's subject
is irrelevant this week.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.650
And something that
somebody really last

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:36.620
thought about in 2002, you
know, is ancient history.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:40.030
And remember that a lot of
the people who were the most--

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.219
well, first of all, the
biggest danger, actually,

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:44.750
was state sponsored.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.210
The biggest danger
was the danger

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:49.520
emanating from the intelligence
department, ministries

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.920
of the government of Iran.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.989
That was the real threat.

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:55.750
Because up to a point, you
can look after yourself

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:58.660
if there's somebody in the
street who doesn't like you.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.840
What is very
difficult is to deal

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.300
with the apparatus
of a state when

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.010
it's aimed against
an individual.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:08.760
And that, we really--
I mean, I can't really,

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.640
without breaking all kinds
of intelligence codes,

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.060
tell you why I know
this, but there basically

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:22.500
was an agreement which
seems to have been upheld,

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.670
where the Iranians essentially
called the dogs off.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.910
And the rest of it has
been-- the worst thing

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:32.960
that's ever happened
to me is walking down

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.980
a street in New York.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.790
A gentleman of
Indian origin like

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:42.440
myself came up to me
wagging his finger,

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.120
and he said, "I just
want to tell you

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:53.090
that V.S. Naipaul is 10 times
as good a writer as you."

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.085
And I said, "Well, you
must feel pleased now,

00:35:55.085 --> 00:35:56.882
because now you've told me."

00:35:56.882 --> 00:35:58.510
And he said, "Yes.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.772
I just wanted you to know."

00:36:00.772 --> 00:36:03.948
And then he walked off.

00:36:03.948 --> 00:36:07.490
And I thought, well, if that's
the worst I have to deal with,

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:10.430
I can handle that.

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:12.840
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned bookstores

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.970
as a rallying place
for a reaction

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:20.350
to what was done to you.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.380
Obviously, independent
bookstores and bookstores

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.916
generally are not faring
terribly well in this economy.

00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:26.290
On the other hand,
a lot of books

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.500
are delivered by
means like Amazon

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.370
that are basically
impossible or very, very

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:32.369
difficult to attack in a
way that a neighborhood

00:36:32.369 --> 00:36:33.840
bookstore is not.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.020
Do you think things would
have unfolded differently?

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:41.470
Are you concerned about what's
happening to bookstores as they

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.269
are suffering more
competition online?

00:36:43.269 --> 00:36:45.060
Do you think things
would play differently?

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.940
Are you concerned
about those things?

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.731
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Well,
I mean, clearly, this

00:36:48.731 --> 00:36:51.410
is a time of extraordinary
transformation

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.440
in the publishing industry.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.585
And a lot of that
is because of, first

00:36:56.585 --> 00:37:00.260
of all, the Amazon
model for delivery,

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:05.150
and then the arrival of
e-books in a big way.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:08.290
Those two things
have transformed

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:10.950
and are transforming
the industry.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:14.510
And I think there's
a lot to be said.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:17.076
I don't think it's a simple
yes no thing, you know?

00:37:17.076 --> 00:37:20.770
I mean, for example, the
existence of something

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:26.630
like Amazon makes it almost
impossible to ban a book.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:29.265
I mean, I know, for
instance, in India,

00:37:29.265 --> 00:37:32.120
there's still restrictions
on the import of The Satanic

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.220
Verses.

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:37.920
But if you want to
download it to your Kindle,

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.246
it will show up in an instant.

00:37:41.246 --> 00:37:42.620
And it makes it
kind of ludicrous

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.530
that that official ban
on the hard copy book

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:48.720
survives, when, in fact, it's
very, very easy for anybody

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.950
who wants to to have
access to the book.

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:52.200
So that's a good thing.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.890
I think with many--
and I'm not alone

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:57.280
in saying that the problem
with the Amazon model

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.500
is the endless
driving of the price

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.470
downwards to the point
at which everybody's

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:04.890
bankrupt except Amazon.

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.110
And that's, I think,
a big war that's

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:11.710
being fought in publishing
now about fair pricing.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:16.660
And in many ways, the antagonist
in that war is Amazon.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.815
So Amazon is sort of on
both sides of the fence.

00:38:19.815 --> 00:38:21.220
You know what I mean?

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.360
And similarly,
ebooks-- you know,

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.230
my view is I don't
care how people

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:28.450
read as long as they read.

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:31.630
I have no particular-- I
mean, I actually, myself,

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:34.560
I'm old school enough to like
having a book in my hand.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.180
But if people want to read
it on an iPad-- I mean,

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.240
I read on an iPad, too.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.180
If I'm traveling, I
tend to read on an iPad,

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.490
because I don't want to
carry 20 books with me.

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:46.450
And I think that's
completely cool.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.680
And there's also some
interesting evidence

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.165
which shows ebook
sales plateauing.

00:38:51.165 --> 00:38:54.460
I mean, everybody thought it
was just going to go like that,

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.930
and real books were
going to go like that.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:58.700
And that doesn't
seem to be happening.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.180
It seems to be plateauing
at somewhere around 30%

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.770
of the industry.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:06.404
And a lot of
independent booksellers

00:39:06.404 --> 00:39:08.820
will say to me that they're
actually not doing that badly.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.390
That they're actually
still-- the book

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:14.160
is an incredibly
persistent object.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.270
People like it.

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:21.000
It's in many ways a
very high tech object.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.600
You can drop it in the water,
and it does not lose its data.

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:30.710
You can do all sorts of things.

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:32.720
It's a very resilient object.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.990
I once destroyed a computer by
spilling a can of Coke on it.

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:40.180
And ever since then,
I've been a little

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:46.850
contemptuous of computers and
how easily destroyed they are.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:49.740
Also, I noticed, for
instance, when my archive

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:54.072
was being looked after
at every university,

00:39:54.072 --> 00:39:55.530
they had some of
the old computers.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:58.170
Here's supposed to be this most
modern technology, you know?

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:01.880
But much of it is
already obsolete.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.856
What's a floppy disk?

00:40:04.856 --> 00:40:08.330
And was actually very
hard for them at Emery

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.210
to retrieve information
from these old computers

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:12.870
in a way that was usable.

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:14.890
Well, you can retrieve
information from a book

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.810
even if it's several
hundred years old.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:21.080
The technology doesn't date.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.410
So there's all sorts of
reasons why people just

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:24.680
like the feeling of books.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.290
And I think, actually, they can
coexist with ebooks quite well,

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:29.450
I think.

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:32.740
There's also some evidence
that ebooks bring people

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:39.016
into the world of reading who
would not go to bookshops.

00:40:39.016 --> 00:40:40.740
And the kind of
instantaneousness

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.675
of being able to--
you see a book.

00:40:42.675 --> 00:40:44.300
You think, oh, that
sounds interesting.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.050
You push a button.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:46.520
You've got the book.

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.640
That's very attractive.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.710
There is evidence that people
buy in more than one format.

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:55.545
That people like me will
have the hard copy book,

00:40:55.545 --> 00:40:56.920
and then if you're
traveling, you

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.480
don't want to carry
the thing around

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.260
with you, so you download it.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.610
Sometimes vice versa.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:05.640
People will download a book,
and if they really like it,

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.280
they will want to have the book.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:12.870
So this is just the
next revolution.

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:15.280
Everything was
supposed to kill books.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.330
Everything.

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:18.180
Movies were supposed
to kill books,

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.660
television was
supposed to kill books.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.610
Every new technology
that's emerged

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:26.930
is supposed to spell the death
of books, and none of it has.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:30.980
So I think it may
outlast all of this.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.460
When Apple is a
thing of the past,

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.170
people will still be
reading paperbacks.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:39.325
So I'm OK about it.

00:41:39.325 --> 00:41:41.660
I mean, the thing
I most worry about

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:45.700
is this price battle,
because there's

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:50.230
a level at which publishers
can be profitable,

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:54.020
writers could make a
living, and distributors--

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:59.090
whether it's Amazon or a
bookstore-- can also do well.

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:02.490
And if you go below
that level, then yes.

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.080
Amazon will be
fine, because it has

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.290
the enormous gift of volume.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.780
Everything's going
through Amazon.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:10.790
So even if they're
making a dime on a book,

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:13.560
they've got so many books
that it's going to be fine.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.360
But publishers will go bust and
writers won't be able to live.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.514
And so that's the
fight right now.

00:42:20.514 --> 00:42:22.180
And I hope it comes
out in a fair place.

00:42:24.295 --> 00:42:25.670
AUDIENCE: I have
a question here.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:26.545
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yeah.

00:42:26.545 --> 00:42:29.120
AUDIENCE: Hypothetically
speaking, if you knew then

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.880
what you know now about the
divided reaction to your work,

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.595
what would you have
done differently?

00:42:34.595 --> 00:42:36.220
SALMAN RUSHDIE: OK
this is the question

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:40.221
I've been asked most often in my
life, once a week for 25 years,

00:42:40.221 --> 00:42:40.720
at least.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.080
And at the answer
is, I would have

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.250
written the same damn book.

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:52.570
Because actually, I'm very
proud of The Satanic Verses.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:56.490
I don't know what it means to
say it's the best book I wrote,

00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:00.230
but I think it's, for me, a
very important book of mine.

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:06.070
And I can't imagine my body
of work without it there.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:08.340
And also, you know,
writing books is a journey.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:11.820
Each book is a step on a road.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.590
I couldn't have written
the book after it

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.020
without having written it.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.530
So it's difficult to say
there's five years of your life

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.860
that somehow shouldn't
have happened.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:28.860
I also think what is nice now,
given that the storm has died

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:33.500
down, is that people are finally
able to read it just as a book.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.380
Not as a kind of hot
potato or something.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:41.090
And we discover that lots
of people seem to like it.

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:42.890
And also, a lot of
people realize--

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:44.430
which you wouldn't
know from what

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:47.350
you read about it--
that it's funny.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:49.942
A lot of people read it and
say, who knew that it was funny?

00:43:49.942 --> 00:43:51.400
And the answer is
the reason nobody

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.015
knew is that nobody told them.

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.850
It's not a kind of gag
line kind of funny,

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:02.490
but it's a comic
satirical novel.

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.660
And what I think is
that, in my view,

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.920
the opinion of
people who like it

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.307
is at least as important
as the opinion of people

00:44:14.307 --> 00:44:16.390
who don't like it, especially
since the people who

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:17.710
like it tend to have read it.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:26.440
And the truth is that if
you're a writer of my kind,

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.500
you're trying to write
books that will last.

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.150
You're trying to write books
that will endure, and hopefully

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:35.780
endure longer than the author.

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:41.390
And the only way that
books last-- the only way

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:44.400
that books last is if
enough people like them.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.510
Books don't last
because of scandal,

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:48.910
because scandal always fades.

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:51.160
And if the only the
merit of the book

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.120
was that it was
part of a scandal,

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.950
then the book fades
when the scandal fades.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:01.500
Every book that's
lasted, say, 100 years

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.640
has lasted because a
lot of people loved it.

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.385
That's it.

00:45:04.385 --> 00:45:06.820
That's The only thing.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:10.280
And so my view is that in
the end, the people who

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.680
like the book are the ones
who have the last word.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:18.257
It's because of their fondness
for the book that it survives.

00:45:18.257 --> 00:45:20.340
And so my view is, you
know, we had all the people

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.839
who didn't like the book making
their noise for long enough.

00:45:22.839 --> 00:45:23.710
They had their turn.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:27.170
And now, maybe it's the turn
of people who do like it,

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:29.707
and don't have to
make a noise about it.

00:45:29.707 --> 00:45:31.790
You don't have to march
down the streets of cities

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:33.680
in order to say,
we love this novel.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.680
That tends not to
happen, regrettably.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.990
I mean, I'd rather see those
demonstrations, truthfully,

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:43.660
but that tends to not happen.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:48.150
But I'm just happy that finally,
the book can be read as a book.

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:50.515
It can have the
ordinary life of a book.

00:45:50.515 --> 00:45:53.320
And it took a long time to get
there, but I think we're there.

00:46:00.875 --> 00:46:02.250
AUDIENCE: Do you
feel that Google

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:05.060
has had a positive or
negative impact on free speech

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.339
around the world, or
perhaps no impact at all?

00:46:07.339 --> 00:46:08.880
And is there anything
that you'd like

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:13.570
to see us do that could further
the cause of free speech?

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:18.870
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Well, the
question of freedom of speech

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:23.040
is that it's something that
has to be constantly defended,

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:28.030
because it is, I'm sorry to
say, constantly under attack.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:31.120
And so there's never a moment
at which you think, OK,

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.630
that's taken care of, you know?

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:37.720
Because new attacks
bubble up all

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:42.430
over the place with
many different hats on.

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:44.290
I think it's very
hard-- and there's

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:46.790
a question I try to
answer the book is that,

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:50.050
was this a victory or a defeat?

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:54.110
And I think that if you
look at the narrow focus

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:58.770
of the particular attack on this
particular work and its author,

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:00.642
then I think we
didn't do so badly.

00:47:00.642 --> 00:47:02.100
I mean, the book
is still in print.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:06.980
It's in print in whatever
it is, four dozen languages.

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:11.410
And the author's still around.

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:15.430
And so I think if you
look at the narrow focus,

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:19.330
it doesn't feel like a calamity.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:20.950
I think we did OK.

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:24.070
But if you look at
the broader spectrum,

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:28.210
then it's much more difficult
to see this as a success,

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:32.620
because I think there's no doubt
that it had a chilling effect.

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:37.650
That people are
scared of approaching

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:40.700
this kind of
material, because they

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:43.530
are afraid of violent reprisal.

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:45.980
And of course, there
have been other episodes

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.970
in which there have
been violent reprisals.

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.800
And so I think the
larger spectrum

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.290
is much more problematic.

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:58.160
That we seem to have entered
a very intolerant age.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.800
And again, yes, I think
Islam, or at least

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.060
this particular
interpretation of Islam,

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.810
is very much at the
forefront of that.

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:08.330
But it's not by any
means only Islam.

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:10.510
For instance, in
India now, there's

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:13.870
a very intolerant
extremist Hindu right

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:18.860
wing that is at
least as violent,

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:25.640
at least as prone to mob law,
as anything that happened to me.

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.962
So it's eternal
vigilance, you know?

00:48:27.962 --> 00:48:28.670
That's the thing.

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:29.961
You have to fight every battle.

00:48:29.961 --> 00:48:30.875
That's the problem.

00:48:30.875 --> 00:48:33.010
And the problem of
fighting every battle

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:35.810
is that very often, you
find yourself defending work

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:37.730
that you don't like.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:39.690
You know, like
that idiotic video

00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:46.630
that was made somewhere on
this side of America which

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:49.120
was done to provoke
a response, and I

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:53.280
think got a much bigger response
than the maker expected.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.414
And it's a piece
of crap, you know?

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:01.780
And there was a colossal,
very violent response

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:02.870
around the world.

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:06.360
Now, you find yourself
saying, on the one hand,

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.430
it's a detestable little thing.

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:12.360
But on the other hand, you have
to defend the rights of people

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.340
to make detestable
little things, you know?

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:22.170
And unfortunately, the free
speech battle often hinges

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:25.720
on issues like that,
which-- you're not

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.950
defending great work, you know?

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:30.689
You're defending garbage.

00:49:30.689 --> 00:49:32.230
But there should be
freedom of speech

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.500
for the makers of garbage, too.

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:37.170
That's the problem.

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:41.440
And it's just that it
seems to me the best

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:45.750
way to respond to a piece of
garbage on YouTube is to say,

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:47.390
there's a lot of
that about, you know?

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:50.000
I mean, if you want
to find something

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.530
on YouTube that will really
annoy you, it's there.

00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:59.900
And the way to deal
with it is just

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.520
to say, well, that's
what there is on YouTube

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.680
and get on with your day.

00:50:07.247 --> 00:50:09.330
Going about burning the
world down because there's

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:12.240
a video on YouTube
you don't like

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.920
seems to me to be
kind of not grown up.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:20.010
I mean, to give you a
parallel example, when

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:25.110
the musical "The Book of
Mormon" opened on Broadway,

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:27.230
the show's producers
invited some

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:29.620
of the elders of
the Mormon church

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:32.780
to come and see the show
right at the beginning.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.900
And they said that they
thought it was very funny,

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:40.370
and they took ads in the program
saying, you've seen the show.

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:43.350
Now read the real
Book of Mormon.

00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:45.030
And end of story.

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:48.120
And that seems to
me to be-- I mean,

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.140
sorry to be defending
the Mormon church,

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:54.855
but that seems like
a grown up response.

00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:00.410
When there are all these fusses
about this or that cartoon

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:04.570
that somebody doesn't like,
because it's disrespectful,

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:07.120
I would say, what does a
respectful political cartoon

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:07.620
look like?

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:11.880
I mean, there's no such thing.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:15.780
The form itself
requires disrespect.

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:19.017
So again, if you're going
to live in an open society,

00:51:19.017 --> 00:51:20.725
we just have to deal
with that, you know?

00:51:20.725 --> 00:51:23.300
I remember last year
in I can't remember

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.830
which paper here--
some American paper--

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:29.420
there was a cartoon of the pope.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.060
Not this pope.

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:31.840
The previous pope.

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:34.030
The one who is now
called ex-Benedict.

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.630
But when he was
still Pope Benedict,

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:46.560
there was a cartoon of
him sitting at his desk

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.550
in front of a desktop computer
with a few cardinals gathered

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:51.900
around him, and on
the computer screen,

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.010
there were pictures
of little boys.

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:55.540
And the caption
said, "Yes, and then

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:59.266
you just have to click on
the boy that you like best."

00:51:59.266 --> 00:52:04.790
Now, American newspaper,
pretty rude about the Pope.

00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:07.330
I mean, you may say,
reasonably rude about the Pope,

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:11.020
but pretty rude.

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:13.290
Did anybody run around
burning cities down?

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:14.740
They did not.

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:19.370
Because the nature of liberty
is that people must say things

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:21.040
you don't like.

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.060
It's very easy to defend the
freedom of speech of people

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:28.330
you agree with-- of all people
whose opinions don't really

00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:30.730
bother you one way or the other.

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:33.260
It's when people are saying
things that you really

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:36.310
don't like that you discover
if you believe in free speech

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:38.135
or not.

00:52:38.135 --> 00:52:40.910
And a lot of people
don't, it turns out,

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:42.820
when it comes to that crunch.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.600
But it means that the
battle is very often

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.260
about defending
the right of people

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:50.570
to speak who are saying
things you don't like,

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:53.674
because otherwise, other people
can say that you shouldn't have

00:52:53.674 --> 00:52:55.090
the right to speak,
because you're

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:56.880
saying something
they don't like.

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.430
And in the end, who
makes those judgments?

00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:00.690
Where do you draw those lines?

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:02.550
It's impossible to do it.

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:05.600
What is best is to
say let it all out.

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.870
Let it all out, and
we'll deal with it.

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:10.540
So I would say that's
the nature of the battle,

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:11.940
and it never ends.

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:12.720
Thank you.

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:17.570
[APPLAUSE]
