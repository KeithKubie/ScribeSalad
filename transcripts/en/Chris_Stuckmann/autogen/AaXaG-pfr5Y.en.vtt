00:10:00.259 --> 00:10:00.269 align:start position:0%
so I think that was really my only issue
 

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:02.179 align:start position:0%
so I think that was really my only issue
with<00:10:00.420><c> the</c><00:10:00.629><c> entire</c><00:10:00.870><c> film</c><00:10:01.139><c> that</c><00:10:01.470><c> was</c><00:10:01.649><c> probably</c>

00:10:02.179 --> 00:10:02.189 align:start position:0%
with the entire film that was probably
 

00:10:02.189 --> 00:10:03.949 align:start position:0%
with the entire film that was probably
my<00:10:02.399><c> only</c><00:10:02.579><c> complaint</c><00:10:02.819><c> is</c><00:10:03.120><c> that</c><00:10:03.240><c> there's</c><00:10:03.480><c> maybe</c>

00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
my only complaint is that there's maybe
 

00:10:03.959 --> 00:10:06.499 align:start position:0%
my only complaint is that there's maybe
not<00:10:04.319><c> enough</c><00:10:04.649><c> of</c><00:10:04.920><c> her</c><00:10:05.430><c> kids</c><00:10:05.699><c> and</c><00:10:05.879><c> her</c><00:10:06.029><c> husband</c>

00:10:06.499 --> 00:10:06.509 align:start position:0%
not enough of her kids and her husband
 

00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:09.290 align:start position:0%
not enough of her kids and her husband
which<00:10:07.110><c> I</c><00:10:07.470><c> guess</c><00:10:08.100><c> isn't</c><00:10:08.309><c> too</c><00:10:08.759><c> big</c><00:10:08.939><c> of</c><00:10:09.029><c> it</c><00:10:09.149><c> from</c>

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
which I guess isn't too big of it from
 

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.579 align:start position:0%

00:10:10.589 --> 00:10:12.230 align:start position:0%
but it's still one of those things where
it's<00:10:10.709><c> like</c><00:10:10.740><c> and</c><00:10:11.189><c> it's</c><00:10:11.399><c> a</c><00:10:11.639><c> little</c><00:10:11.910><c> bit</c><00:10:12.089><c> more</c>

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's like and it's a little bit more
