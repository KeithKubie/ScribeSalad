00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.150
<v 1>joining me today as a writer and activist and the founder of theory of</v>

00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:12.870
enchantment.com Chloe,
Valerie,
welcome to the Rubin report.

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.950
Thank you for having me.
I'm very happy to have you here because you are one of,

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.750
I don't know,
I'd say 12 people online that don't make me completely insane.

6
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:24.210
Like I look at your Twitter feed and I'm like,
oh,

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.430
there's someone with a brain that's actually not completely insane.
Thanks.
Yeah.

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.260
That's the highest compliment I can give.
Anyway.

9
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.870
So actually we met a couple of months ago in September at a Jordan Peterson

10
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:37.704
event.

11
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.570
Would you say that was the best white supremacist event you were ever at all?

12
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.080
<v 2>Excellent.
Yeah.
That was terrifying.</v>

13
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.710
<v 1>Yeah.
Before we get into your history and everything else and you're doing,</v>

14
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.390
you're doing truly so much great work.

15
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.690
What do you make of the Peterson phenomenon?

16
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.710
Because so many of my guests I'm finding are coming to shows and it's like,

17
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.783
it's pretty cool.

18
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.390
<v 2>I understand Jordan Peterson,
like fundamentally I understand what he's doing.
Um,</v>

19
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.290
I think that,

20
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.220
I think that he is compelling to many people because in many cases he's a

21
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:12.810
storyteller.
He's a great storyteller.

22
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:15.960
And what he can do is he can distill lessons from stories,

23
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.530
stories found in pop culture stories that are history and,

24
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.730
and derive lessons that you can apply to your life.

25
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:27.390
And I think that anyone who can do that will be compelling because they can

26
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:28.440
actually better your life.

27
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.710
And I think that's the secret as to why he's so popular.

28
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:34.990
And also I've noticed that he's,
I think he's becoming more mainstream.

29
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.850
It's like he's becoming more acceptable into,
in mainstream society.
Which is it,

30
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.320
which is a positive trend.
Like seeing him being interviewed on Doctor Oz,

31
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:44.760
for example.
It was like a moment,

32
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.210
I think of him inching closer and closer to the mainstream.

33
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.930
<v 1>What's that phrase?
First they ignore you,
then they mock you right?</v>

34
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:55.270
Then they want to be you in that version of it.
All right.

35
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:59.140
We'll speak in the stories.
Tell me a little bit about your story.

36
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.003
Who the hell are you?

37
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.690
<v 2>Oh,
yes,
I am Chloe.</v>

38
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.660
I'm from New Orleans originally born and raised.
Um,
my story,

39
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.040
I guess it's an interesting one.

40
00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:13.160
I was born and raised in a very atypical Christian family.

41
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.290
Atypical in the sense that I grew up as a Christian observing Shabbat.

42
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.280
<v 1>Yeah.
So what is that?
What is that?</v>

43
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.970
<v 2>So the way I like to tell him is,
you know,
have you heard of seven day Adventist?</v>

44
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.930
So it's like seven day Adventist,
but on steroids essentially.

45
00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:31.960
That's how I grew up.
Um,
so seven day Adventists,
to my understanding,

46
00:02:31.961 --> 00:02:34.030
they keep Shabbat,
that's why they call them the seventh day.

47
00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:38.080
So they'd go to church on Saturday instead of Sunday.
So we did that also,

48
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.170
but we also did things like we observed Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah and all the

49
00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:48.010
Jewish holy days.
And we also kept kosher style.
So I don't eat pork or shellfish.

50
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.510
And that was an interesting upbringing.
I have two funny stories to tell you.
Um,

51
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.650
the first is about Yom Kippor.
Yeah.
So as I'm sure you know,

52
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.690
and the Jews in the Jewish tradition once or twice,
right?
Right.
Yeah.

53
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.010
So can you tell me what age one begins?
Fasting for Yom Kippor.

54
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.330
Okay.

55
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.420
<v 1>Well there's an obvious answer here that obviously can't be the right answer,</v>

56
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.340
but I would assume 13.
Oh,
okay.
Y'All,

57
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.360
<v 2>yeah,
you're pulling the trigger.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Um,</v>

58
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.620
well my parents didn't have their binnacle text to advise them on like what age

59
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.500
they should make their kids start fasting and soul.

60
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:30.220
For some reason they decided that five years old was a good time to,

61
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.650
so I've been fast and free Yom Kippor since I was five,
so yeah.

62
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.310
You're an old pro now.
Yes,
yes.
Um,

63
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.660
so that's like one quick story of how I grew up in the,

64
00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:46.661
my father introduced me to the writings of Leon Uris when I was 15 years old.

65
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.140
So he was a really same as Jewish author who wrote a lot about the

66
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:51.610
reestablishment of the state of Israel.

67
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:56.611
He wrote books like exodus and Qbe seven and millet 18 and I read all these

68
00:03:56.831 --> 00:04:00.670
books throughout high school and was part of the Hebrew Culture Club in high

69
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:04.360
school.
Went to a very egalitarian high school in New Orleans.
Um,

70
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.260
so this is sort of my introduction to the world of Jewish culture,

71
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:10.420
but also Israel in a contemporary sense.

72
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.160
And then I attended the University of New Orleans where I initially majored in

73
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:15.994
film,

74
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.590
but then switch majors to international studies in 2012

75
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.460
<v 1>graduated magna cum laude.</v>

76
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.690
<v 2>Yes.
I had to think about it.
Yes.
Um,</v>

77
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.400
but the reason why I switched majors with,

78
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:33.550
because antisemitism was resurfacing in Europe,

79
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.590
in France in particular.

80
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.420
<v 1>Yeah.
So this is about what,
seven,
eight years?</v>

81
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.830
<v 2>This is 2012.
Yeah.
So,</v>

82
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.220
and I wanted to get involved in the Israel space,

83
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.600
so that's why I switched majors.

84
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:50.980
And then I started a student Pro Israel organization on campus.
Um,

85
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.530
did Israel advocacy for three and a half years.

86
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.630
Realize that we didn't know what we were doing,

87
00:04:55.631 --> 00:05:00.400
but I learned a lot from that experience.
Um,
and that was my college experience.

88
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.981
<v 1>Yeah.
Okay.</v>

89
00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:03.920
So we're going to get to obviously a lot of the advocacy work that you do and

90
00:05:03.921 --> 00:05:05.420
some of the things that you've written and all that,

91
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.190
but just a little bit more on the,

92
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.740
on the growing up part because there's something really fascinating there.

93
00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:12.590
It's like it's sort of for you it's like,
oh well this is how I grew up.

94
00:05:12.591 --> 00:05:15.350
You kind of [inaudible] but it sounds for other people it's like,
wait a minute.

95
00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:19.680
So she's Christian,
but with celebrating all these Jewish holidays,
like how,

96
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.970
how was that explained to you as a child or was it explained?

97
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.950
<v 2>Yeah,
that's your choice.</v>

98
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.960
Like it was like the explanation was this is how Jesus and the disciples

99
00:05:29.301 --> 00:05:32.150
observed,
so we're going to observe in this way.

100
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.130
That was like the basic explanation and then like just growing up,
you know,

101
00:05:37.131 --> 00:05:41.030
you're conditioned to do these things and so it just becomes rote and becomes

102
00:05:41.031 --> 00:05:42.460
like basic.
But like you were saying,

103
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.280
it doesn't make sense to a lot of people looking from the outside in.
So yeah.

104
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.570
<v 1>Okay.
So college you started realizing that,</v>

105
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.030
that the things that you had grown up around,

106
00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:52.850
that something was sort of under assault?

107
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.620
<v 2>Yeah.
Is that fair to say?
Yeah,
I think,
yeah,
and I think that because,</v>

108
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.570
um,
you know,

109
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:03.140
antisemitism is fundamentally like dehumanization of Jews.

110
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:04.970
And because I had grown up with such a,

111
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.380
not just like a love for the Jewish people,
but in awareness of Jewish culture,

112
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:11.270
like to a certain extent,
I've,

113
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.800
my identity was defined by Jewish culture or adjacent to Jewish culture.

114
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:18.950
So I think in that sense it did feel like something,

115
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.450
a part of me was under attack.

116
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:22.910
So that was probably a huge catalyst for getting involved.

117
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.120
<v 1>What did the,</v>

118
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.200
like your Jewish friends about this girl that you know,

119
00:06:28.201 --> 00:06:31.500
doesn't stereotypically looked Jewish,
which is a ridiculous thing to say,

120
00:06:31.501 --> 00:06:31.861
of course,

121
00:06:31.861 --> 00:06:36.030
because there are black Jews and Tino Jews and Chinese Jews and everything else.

122
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.120
Um,
did your friends think like,
what is this

123
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.030
<v 2>in college or in college growing up,
whatever it is,
growing up,
I don't,</v>

124
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:48.080
I don't know if they,
if they thought any different,
I don't remember.

125
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:53.070
I just remember that the Jewish kids and myself were not in school during Rosh

126
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.800
Hashana.
We're just out of,
we were just acting at the same time.

127
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.520
I'm in college.
I just made all my Friday.
Good.

128
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:05.000
If you want a couple extra days off,
it's very good.
They're good.
I mean,

129
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:07.220
I didn't even talk about,
so you could,
that's a whole nother story.

130
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.940
But in college,
my friend,

131
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:14.930
I just made my friends join my club so they,
like,

132
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:17.570
I just made them like there was no like,
oh,
this is,

133
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.390
it was just who I was and like a part of,
you know,
my life.

134
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.850
<v 1>Yeah.
So it seems to me that right now,</v>

135
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.420
I guess campus antisemitism is sort of running rampant.

136
00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:29.660
I think it has a lot to do with bds and we can talk about that and more.

137
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.450
But what,
what were you actually seeing back then that were the marker?

138
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.270
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean back then,
so there wasn't a lot of,</v>

139
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.010
there wasn't like systemic antisemitism at the University of New Orleans.

140
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.570
Um,
or for example at Tulane where I did a lot of,
uh,

141
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.400
pro Israel stuff also.
Um,

142
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:53.270
but actually what I discovered was though there was antisemitism on certain

143
00:07:53.371 --> 00:07:56.730
campuses or in hotbed campuses like Columbia and UC Irvine.

144
00:07:56.731 --> 00:07:59.710
And we've heard about all of these different campuses where there,
you know,

145
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:00.803
problems.

146
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.990
The larger issue was that we in the community were confusing two different

147
00:08:06.331 --> 00:08:10.590
things.
We were confusing two very important questions with each other.

148
00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:14.940
The first question was,
how do you combat antisemitism?
Which is a novel question,

149
00:08:14.941 --> 00:08:17.460
a good question,
a question that got me involved,
uh,

150
00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:19.950
with the question of how do you actually get people to fall in love with

151
00:08:19.951 --> 00:08:23.910
Israelis?
And we were confusing those two questions.

152
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.970
And as a result,
we were coming.
We were,

153
00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:31.110
we were shaping the basis of our advocacy around,
uh,
the wrong assumption.

154
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.160
So like the first question,

155
00:08:32.161 --> 00:08:35.400
how do you fight antisemitism is essentially a question of how do you get people

156
00:08:35.401 --> 00:08:37.770
to stop hating?
But the second question,

157
00:08:37.771 --> 00:08:40.080
how do you get people to fall in love with Israelis?
There's really,

158
00:08:40.081 --> 00:08:43.050
society is a question of how do you get people to start loving,

159
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:47.850
which is a totally different question.
And we,
we,
and I say like collectively,
we,

160
00:08:47.851 --> 00:08:52.470
the peripheral community in America hadn't figured that out.
And so as a result,

161
00:08:52.471 --> 00:08:55.170
we were doing pro Israel advocacy.

162
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.920
We were putting together projects within the realm of pro Israel advocacy.

163
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:00.540
That didn't make sense.
Yeah.

164
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.500
And that was the larger trend that I observed that I witnessed when I was in

165
00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:05.020
college.

166
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.160
<v 1>All right.
So let's do both of those.
So first,</v>

167
00:09:07.161 --> 00:09:11.250
how do you deal with disassembling antisemitism?
We're just hatred.
Yeah.

168
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.220
<v 2>Yeah.
Well I think so.
I think they're interconnected,
connected on some level.</v>

169
00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:19.090
I think,
um,
it's not just enough to,

170
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:24.160
to continue to tell people to stop painting.
Obviously that's important,

171
00:09:24.161 --> 00:09:29.160
but you also have to create a framework and create,
um,
sort of like a,

172
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:34.390
uh,
a collection of lessons,
if you will,
on how to start loving on how to love,

173
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.460
if you will.
Um,
and I,
so,

174
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.600
so I think that that actually ends up combating antisemitism and combating all

175
00:09:40.601 --> 00:09:41.351
forms of hatred.

176
00:09:41.351 --> 00:09:44.590
If you actually build out a framework or try to teach people how to love,

177
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.200
<v 1>do you think there's something unique about hating Jews that's a little bit</v>

178
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:52.380
different than hating other people?
Like sort of partly of a history,

179
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:57.510
a historical reason?
Yeah,
because it's goes back forever basically.
Okay.

180
00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.100
But also that I find right now,

181
00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:02.740
I mean most of the people that hate me or are on the left,
let's say.
Right.
Um,

182
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.670
so I get a relentless amount of hate from them and I don't,

183
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:06.960
I don't get a lot of hate from the right,

184
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:10.250
but every now and again when I get a hate hatred from the right,
it's,
Oh,

185
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.010
you do blah,
blah,
blah,
that kind of thing.
Yeah.
It's,
in my case,

186
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:16.890
it's very disproportionate on one side that probably has more to do with my

187
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:19.920
politics right now.
But I do think it's interesting that it sort of,

188
00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:24.120
it is that horseshoe theory where the people on the fringes both end up hating

189
00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:25.170
you for identity.

190
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.050
<v 2>Right.
Uh,
that's a good question.</v>

191
00:10:27.051 --> 00:10:31.370
Do I think antisemitism is like uniquely a problem or uniquely different?
I mean,

192
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.310
if you were to look at intersectionality,
for example,
which is this,

193
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.330
<v 1>I was hoping we'd get to it.
Yeah.
My favorite talk.
Yeah,
let's do it.
Um,</v>

194
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.490
can you explain?
Let's,
let's,
let's steal man,
intersectionality.
Give me,

195
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.200
give me what the,
the person out there that's the believer in intersectionality.

196
00:10:47.201 --> 00:10:47.801
What,
how,
what,

197
00:10:47.801 --> 00:10:50.840
what would they tell you intersectionality is before we knock it down,

198
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.060
<v 2>right?
I think I can still man it,
I mean,
I,</v>

199
00:10:53.061 --> 00:10:58.030
I'd say that intersectionality makes three claims,
one of which is true.
Um,

200
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.580
the first claim that it makes is that you can,

201
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.630
you can experience intersecting forms of oppression.
So I,

202
00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:09.070
as both a woman and a person of color can experience forms of oppression by

203
00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:12.070
virtues of those categories to which I belong.
And they can interest,

204
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.410
intersect and interact with each other in new ways.

205
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.580
<v 1>And I think that's the record.</v>

206
00:11:15.581 --> 00:11:18.670
I'd been conducting this interview as if you were a white man.
Oh,
thank you.

207
00:11:18.671 --> 00:11:20.260
I just want to be clear clinical sign out there.

208
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.840
<v 2>Thank you so much.
It's such a relief.</v>

209
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.690
<v 1>Okay.
But you've got these,
you've got these two immutable characteristics.</v>

210
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:32.691
Basically that right could intertwine based in their outsider characteristics.

211
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.300
That's it.

212
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.330
<v 2>So like a person,</v>

213
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:41.250
a man could be sexist toward me or a white person can be racist to me.
Right.

214
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:42.030
And then,

215
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:47.030
and then both of those types of discriminations or prejudices can interact in

216
00:11:47.251 --> 00:11:51.330
different ways,
which I think is a basically true statement.
Right.
Okay.
Um,

217
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.040
so that is the extent to which

218
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.990
<v 1>I can still manage the sectionality.
Okay.
Now give me now give me the nod.
Right.</v>

219
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.150
Um,
the not so true.

220
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.360
<v 2>Actually I would say dangerously false claims of intersectionality.</v>

221
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:10.140
One is that the primary motivator a bit behind all human interaction is power.

222
00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:16.010
And by power they mean like that power in order to oppress.

223
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.620
Um,
so I could be having a disagreement,

224
00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:23.230
political disagreement with you in good faith.
Um,

225
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.150
but according to the intersection of lists,

226
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.590
it doesn't matter because you have white skin and I have brown skin.
And so you,

227
00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:33.730
by virtue of the category that you exist and you are trying to impress me.

228
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.200
<v 1>Right?
And in this case,</v>

229
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:40.201
my gayness would fall below the importance of say my white skin is actually an

230
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:43.020
intersection on the scale of intersectionality,
right?

231
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.340
Jewishness is completely sort of thrown out,

232
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.460
which I think is related to the Israel thing.
Which one?

233
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.280
<v 2>Definitely like hierarchies of what know,</v>

234
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.990
like virtues and stuff like that or lack thereof in your case.

235
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.570
<v 1>Yeah.
Uh,
I'm just me,
but can I tell you?
So that's the,</v>

236
00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.710
<v 2>that's the first,
uh,
dangerous claim that it makes.</v>

237
00:13:00.711 --> 00:13:03.590
And then the second conclusion,

238
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.640
I guess you would say to which it comes is a conclusion of ratio.
Essential Ism.

239
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:12.260
So what that means is you could take any human basic human behavior,

240
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.840
let's say feeling entitled,
right?

241
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:20.020
So my friend could have a new iPhone x and for some reason like I don't have the

242
00:13:21.111 --> 00:13:24.950
money to buy the iPhone x,
but I want the iPhone x,
whatever I'm coveting,
right?

243
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.340
Yeah.
This iPhone x if you will.
So I feel a sense of entitlement to it,
right?

244
00:13:28.341 --> 00:13:30.920
So any human being can feel the sense of entitlement,
right?
That's my point.

245
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.720
But the intersectionalists will,
will claim that entitlement,

246
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:39.230
like a priori is the white man's thing.

247
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:44.590
So they will refer to entitlements as white male entitlement as if the only type

248
00:13:45.411 --> 00:13:47.150
of human being,
um,

249
00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.530
that can feel or express a behavior of entitlement is a white male.

250
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.600
Um,
and so in doing that,
they are,
uh,
racially essentially rising people.

251
00:13:56.601 --> 00:14:00.440
They are taking human behaviors and turning them into essential characteristics

252
00:14:00.441 --> 00:14:01.850
of people that belong to one category.

253
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.670
<v 1>So as somebody that comes from a unique religious perspective,
yeah.</v>

254
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:10.370
What do you make of the religious nature of the people that buy into this

255
00:14:10.371 --> 00:14:11.204
ideology?

256
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.990
<v 2>That's a good question.
I mean it's,
it's like,
like many religions,</v>

257
00:14:14.991 --> 00:14:17.210
it is all encompassing.
Um,

258
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.300
like money will certainly like certain,

259
00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.300
let's say a mainstream forms of Christianity.

260
00:14:23.301 --> 00:14:28.100
It sort of preaches this born again type mentality where you become woke.

261
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.050
Right?
Which is just another word for enlighten.

262
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.940
<v 1>That's what they do by knowing
no,
but like there's the parallel.
Well,</v>

263
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.870
<v 2>they're like,
you've become,
well,
you got born again,
you become,
um,</v>

264
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.060
um,
the problem,

265
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.110
one of the many problems is that there is no salvation.

266
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.920
There's no redemption in this religion.
Um,

267
00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.170
you get Brownie points,

268
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.760
virtue points if you are a,
if you belong to certain categories,

269
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:58.340
like if you're a person of color,
if you're a woman,
et Cetera,

270
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.290
and you get less points if you're white,
if you're male,
if you're straight,

271
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.920
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Um,

272
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:09.590
and what this does is it has a caricaturing effect on,
on human beings,

273
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.880
um,
where people are reduced to characatures.
Uh,

274
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.970
it creates this effect where the people who are intersectionalists and Hobo who

275
00:15:16.971 --> 00:15:19.160
believe in this theory,
um,

276
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.930
are sort of incapable of dealing with nuance and dealing with depth and human

277
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:28.010
complexity,
which is sad,
not just for the people that they're attacking,

278
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:29.000
but for themselves.

279
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.630
<v 1>Do you think it's an overstep to call it the new type of racism?</v>

280
00:15:33.631 --> 00:15:36.810
Because I'm really coming around to that really hedging.
Yeah.

281
00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:39.570
Like I'm like right there on that.
I've said it once or twice.

282
00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:41.970
I don't really like saying it cause I don't,

283
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.380
I don't want to start using the tactics,
which I hate so much.
Right.
Of course.

284
00:15:46.381 --> 00:15:48.990
I don't want to do that.
But,
uh,
I don't know if you saw my,

285
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:52.740
my episode with her in August,
I had Catherine verbal Singh,

286
00:15:52.741 --> 00:15:56.800
who's a wonderful teacher at mckayla school in the UK.
Okay.

287
00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:01.800
And she flat out and she's a brown skin and you know the whole thing.

288
00:16:01.801 --> 00:16:04.080
Yeah.
But she doesn't buy into any of this nonsense.

289
00:16:04.081 --> 00:16:09.081
And she was adamant in saying this is the new racism and we must call it that.

290
00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.760
And I agree with the heart of the center man.
And I just adore her.
And that was,

291
00:16:14.761 --> 00:16:16.200
I spoke in school a couple weeks ago,
but,

292
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.080
but I'm a little leery of why are you leery of it?

293
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.010
Because I don't want to fall into the same trap that they've come in where every

294
00:16:23.011 --> 00:16:24.510
time I hear one of their arguments,

295
00:16:24.511 --> 00:16:26.790
the idea would be that I could just turn to them and be like,
well,

296
00:16:26.791 --> 00:16:28.650
you're the new racist.
You know what I mean?

297
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.140
Where cause it's just right and shut it down.

298
00:16:31.141 --> 00:16:34.800
It's so easy and lazy and the rest of it.
So I don't see,
I don't want to do that.

299
00:16:34.801 --> 00:16:38.900
And yet if I see the way the world is now,

300
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.080
where I see real,
true racism coming from,

301
00:16:42.081 --> 00:16:44.720
it's almost exclusively coming from these people.

302
00:16:44.721 --> 00:16:47.690
I'm not saying that there aren't some white nationalists.
There are some,

303
00:16:47.691 --> 00:16:51.160
they have no power.
Nobody cares about them.
They're mocked and they're,

304
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.440
they're actually propped up by the media to make it seem like they're running

305
00:16:54.441 --> 00:16:55.220
the world.
Yeah.

306
00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:00.170
But where I see true racism coming from these days and a true hatred based on

307
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:04.430
immutable characteristics is this set of intersectional woke people.
Yeah.

308
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.320
I just don't want to be,
I just don't want to be

309
00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.170
<v 2>that.
Right,
right.
That's a very good and deep question.</v>

310
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.260
I think that for my purposes,

311
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:19.200
I don't just want to like,
I want to criticize in a,
in a meaningful way.

312
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.390
So I would have to ask the question while I get people who believe in

313
00:17:24.391 --> 00:17:28.680
intersectionalists theory to change or convinced them to change simply by

314
00:17:28.681 --> 00:17:30.450
calling them racist.
Probably not.

315
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.800
<v 1>Probably not.
They,
it's not,
when they call all these people on the right,</v>

316
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.110
they call basic conservatives or libertarians races.

317
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.080
It's not like they're coming around.
So it's only been like,
Oh yes,
you're right.

318
00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:43.170
I should just be an intersectional.
I am woke born

319
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.760
<v 2>again.
No,
it doesn't work.
There's work though.
Yeah.
So,</v>

320
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.880
so I think I would rather challenge people who believe in this theory on their

321
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.160
own terms.
Um,
okay.

322
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.080
<v 1>Do you get a unique credit to do that because of your,
so how does that,</v>

323
00:17:58.081 --> 00:17:58.620
how does that,

324
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:03.420
how does that work that you could almost use their own crappy thing against him

325
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:05.280
in a bizarre way,
even though you don't believe in it?

326
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.010
That there's a unique power there I suppose.
But I think

327
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.250
<v 2>what I do is I couldn't say depth,</v>

328
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.230
meaning I think I am an example of human complexity.
So on the surface level,

329
00:18:16.231 --> 00:18:19.440
I am using their own hierarchy.

330
00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:22.500
A virtuous people are virtuous types against them.

331
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.790
But at the same time I think I'm,

332
00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:27.660
I'm showing them what that human complexity actually exists because I disagree

333
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:28.350
with them.

334
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:32.130
So it's like a cognitive dissonance thing that they have to figure out.
Um,

335
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:36.630
but I'm more interested in peep in and trying to challenge people who believe in

336
00:18:36.631 --> 00:18:36.811
this,

337
00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:41.811
especially young people would say this is on the college campuses and such to

338
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.900
become better people.
Um,
and I have to,
in order to do that,

339
00:18:45.901 --> 00:18:49.050
I have to criticize them in a way that actually speaks to their potential to be

340
00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:50.850
better people.
Um,
and um,
like I said,

341
00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:52.830
I'm not going to accomplish that by calling them racist.

342
00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:56.670
But what I can do is try to,
I can try to,
for example,
point them to,

343
00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.020
I think authors and people in literature for example,

344
00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:03.900
who they highly esteem,
um,

345
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:08.420
whose work they don't quite yet realize is not intersection.
Yeah.

346
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:09.980
<v 1>So who,
who might that be?</v>

347
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.680
<v 2>Right.
Maya Angelo for example.
Um,</v>

348
00:19:12.681 --> 00:19:16.950
I think that there is a very stark contrast between like Ta-nehisi coats and my

349
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.793
Angelo,

350
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:23.120
the very first poets I was forced to memorize as a child was my Angelo.

351
00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.260
And so like I feel like I,
I carry her spirit with me.
Um,

352
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:32.290
and the way she talks about human complexity and the way she talks about how no

353
00:19:33.741 --> 00:19:38.741
bling the human spirit is at is in many ways a contrast to intersectionalists

354
00:19:39.531 --> 00:19:40.480
theory.
Um,

355
00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:45.110
she famously one time said that Shakespeare must've been a black woman because

356
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:48.620
the,
and the,
because it's like one of his sonnets.
She,

357
00:19:48.621 --> 00:19:53.621
she felt so closely and intimately connected to in the struggles that she was

358
00:19:53.631 --> 00:19:57.590
going,
going through as a child.
And her point was that,
um,

359
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.180
all of this literature,
uh,
if it,
even if it comes from like,

360
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:05.750
let's say the dead white male,
right,
um,
was written for all of you,

361
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.480
for each of you,
and you can see yourself in that,

362
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:13.340
in the stories that these great writers create it.
And that's the point.

363
00:20:13.341 --> 00:20:14.690
That's what makes them great writers,

364
00:20:14.691 --> 00:20:18.140
is the fact that you can see yourself in them.
So I would point people toward,

365
00:20:18.141 --> 00:20:22.130
especially her work because they typically and generally esteem her and they

366
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.960
consider her to be,
um,
an icon.
And I think she was an icon.
Um,

367
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.180
but other than that,
I can use that to actually teach them,
well,

368
00:20:29.181 --> 00:20:30.920
here's an alternative way of thinking actually,

369
00:20:30.921 --> 00:20:35.030
and what you're learning in your poststructuralist class about like human life

370
00:20:35.031 --> 00:20:39.020
and human affairs isn't necessarily,
um,
true when it isn't.

371
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.280
It isn't the only thing out there.

372
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.150
<v 1>What do you make of the fact that it seems like so many young people are going</v>

373
00:20:44.151 --> 00:20:49.151
to college so ill to deal with the world as it is that they become so religious

374
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:54.520
in nature when it comes to this stuff?
Like if they had been given better tools,

375
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.450
perhaps some of the things that Jordan Peterson's talking about that they could

376
00:20:58.451 --> 00:21:02.620
go into school and be challenged and be okay with it as opposed to going in and

377
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:06.100
converting ca,
I guess that's a parent problem.

378
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.760
It's the parents and the parents.
Yeah.

379
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.200
<v 2>Um,
yeah.
I mean I think,</v>

380
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.610
I think it's a question of upbringing,
obviously.
Um,

381
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.170
but I also think,

382
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.630
I think that maybe it signifies that students are searching for meaning.

383
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.950
I mean,
students are searching for meaning.

384
00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:28.560
I was searching for meaning in college,
you know,
um,

385
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.420
we're searching for meaning all of our lives.
Right.

386
00:21:30.421 --> 00:21:35.421
And then what does it say that that the only thing that seeming seemingly off

387
00:21:36.331 --> 00:21:39.300
there that's giving them meaning at least within the college context is

388
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.250
intersectionalists theory.

389
00:21:41.251 --> 00:21:43.830
I mean like surely we as a society can do better than that,

390
00:21:43.831 --> 00:21:48.240
but I think that Jordan Peterson represents is this contrast because he is

391
00:21:48.241 --> 00:21:51.030
getting a lot of fame and popular.

392
00:21:51.031 --> 00:21:53.070
He is considered to be popular amongst some people,

393
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.480
many people in college probably.
So I think that in that sense,
um,

394
00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.300
maybe they're not being as converted as,
as much as,

395
00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.510
as much as a it seems they are.
Yeah.
Maybe there is a,

396
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.240
there is a battle of ideas of the hearts and minds of these students.

397
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.570
<v 1>So that's a good thing.
Well,
there's,</v>

398
00:22:07.571 --> 00:22:10.120
I mean there's definitely statistical evidence that that's true,
right?

399
00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:13.960
There was that study that came out a couple of months ago that basically only 8%

400
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:18.710
of young people actually are these hysterical shrieking intersection list.

401
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.910
But because they're so loud,
they're just silencing and majority.

402
00:22:21.911 --> 00:22:25.960
So that's encouraging.
Well,
the sun,
that means it's our fault because,
right.

403
00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:27.780
Well that's what I always say.
If people,

404
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.890
every event I go to and not being loud enough really.

405
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.660
Well that's the funny thing is like every,

406
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.420
literally every event I go to from the Peterson event that you were out in long

407
00:22:34.421 --> 00:22:36.820
island to all it too.
When I do standup gigs,
whatever it is,

408
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.970
people come up to me everywhere they go,
what can I do?
What can I do?
Right?

409
00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.030
And the only thing that I can come up with that has any meaning whatsoever is

410
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.890
start speaking,
right?

411
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.080
Like you live in the freest society in the history of the world and you're

412
00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:53.140
afraid to say what you think,
how would you be one of the bad plays?
Yeah.
Yeah.

413
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.880
<v 2>And also like with social media,
we all have our own media companies now.</v>

414
00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.900
Like anything is possible.
Yeah.
So yeah,
I think,

415
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.690
I think we need to start speaking more,
but I also think we need to,

416
00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.011
like I said earlier,

417
00:23:05.011 --> 00:23:08.310
we need to emphasize like it's not enough to tell people how to stop hating.

418
00:23:08.311 --> 00:23:10.020
We also have to teach them how to start loving.

419
00:23:10.021 --> 00:23:13.590
And I think that that's something that needs to be developed further also.

420
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.410
<v 1>All right,
so let's put the start loving part on hold for a minute.</v>

421
00:23:17.411 --> 00:23:20.410
Cause that seems like a good ending point for me.
So let's put that to the end.

422
00:23:20.411 --> 00:23:22.320
Okay.
Yeah,
I've noticed you,

423
00:23:22.321 --> 00:23:26.080
you've been pretty critical about what's going on in the women's March and
we're,

424
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.850
I think we're starting to see,

425
00:23:27.851 --> 00:23:32.680
which I think is positive that this intersectional sort of hierarchy or my

426
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:35.810
monster I think is a better word.
They can't hold very long.

427
00:23:35.811 --> 00:23:38.440
And I think we're seeing the evidence of that now.

428
00:23:38.441 --> 00:23:40.660
Can you explain a little bit of why that is?

429
00:23:40.661 --> 00:23:44.290
Have you seen the article that came out yesterday and tablet about the women's

430
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:47.590
March?
I've had a crazy couple of days here,
so,
yeah.

431
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.590
<v 2>So all this time,
you know,</v>

432
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:57.310
we had this suspicion that the leaders in the women's march,

433
00:23:57.321 --> 00:24:00.650
including Tamika Mallory,
Linda Sarsour and Carmen Perez,

434
00:24:00.651 --> 00:24:05.651
we're sort of like pretty like anti-semite antisemetic like Hob knobbing with

435
00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:09.230
Farah Khan and uh,

436
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:13.730
posting very positive remarks about Farah Khan on their social media platforms.

437
00:24:13.731 --> 00:24:14.230
And right

438
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:19.210
<v 1>when you say we,
you mean like us and the other,
sorry.</v>

439
00:24:19.211 --> 00:24:22.000
Yes,
I should click whatever you want to call that subset of people,
not,

440
00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.250
not what mainstream portrays them to.
Sure.

441
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:29.120
<v 2>So I say that this has been a concern in the Jewish community by and large for a</v>

442
00:24:29.121 --> 00:24:33.530
very long time.
Like the majority of Jews in this country are pro Israel,
right?

443
00:24:33.531 --> 00:24:37.940
And so the w so collectively the pro Israel community has had a creeping

444
00:24:37.941 --> 00:24:41.720
suspicion about these women's intentions when it count,

445
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.730
when they came to allowing Jews to march or like telling you to have a safe

446
00:24:46.731 --> 00:24:50.420
place to march or even a space to march and the women's March.
And I'm,

447
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.500
I'm actually part of a organization called Zionists,

448
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:57.500
which tries to give us space to progressive Jewish women to March in these
women,

449
00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:00.740
in these women's marches.
Even though Linda Sarsour was shouting at them,
you,

450
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:04.250
there's no room for you here,
right?
Yeah.
Um,
so the idea is like,
oh,

451
00:25:04.251 --> 00:25:06.710
you're not going to give us a table.
We'll build our own table.

452
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:12.430
And what boards interesting is that yesterday this bombshell report came out and

453
00:25:13.911 --> 00:25:18.911
tell the magazine and our worst suspicions were confirmed.

454
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.470
Um,

455
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.340
<v 1>I did see a little bit,
it's actually about the security and everything.
Yeah.</v>

456
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.840
So go ahead.

457
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.870
<v 2>So apparently I'll say allegedly,</v>

458
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.540
allegedly at the very first meeting with these women,
um,

459
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.810
who were being added to as,
I guess it's cold tears to the women's march,

460
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.810
there was,
there were antisemitic statements made about Jews.
Um,
um,

461
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.680
and consistently throughout their time as cochairs.
Um,
there was a legend,

462
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:49.710
they have allegedly been hiring a security folks from the nation of Islam,

463
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:51.620
fair constellations,
nation of Islam.

464
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:56.410
For those of you who may be watching who don't know,
Farah Khan has famously,
uh,

465
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:59.480
referred to or infamously referred to Jews as termites.
I mean,

466
00:25:59.481 --> 00:26:00.790
he's a notorious anti Semite.

467
00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.270
<v 1>Yeah.
So it turns out things on Twitter.
No problem.
Yeah.
You can check them out.</v>

468
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.250
Yeah.
Twitter right down below.
Right,

469
00:26:09.251 --> 00:26:11.590
exactly.
Yeah.
So these women have been hiring

470
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:16.640
<v 2>security guards and nation of Islam to do their security detail at the women's</v>

471
00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:21.500
March.
And so it's a really bombshell report.
I encourage your viewers to read it,

472
00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:21.970
but

473
00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:25.440
<v 1>yeah,
we actually will link to it.
Okay.
Not to far.
Again,</v>

474
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:26.843
we'll put a link to the art.

475
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:31.350
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
And it is like a,
it,</v>

476
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.660
it's,
it's a,
it's a crazy moment.
So,

477
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:38.440
<v 1>so does this seem like it's obvious to you in a way?
Like,</v>

478
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.740
it sort of seems obvious to me that two,

479
00:26:41.741 --> 00:26:45.540
three years ago there were bunch of us,
I think sort of old school,

480
00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:47.910
decent liberals that were like this thing,

481
00:26:47.911 --> 00:26:51.990
this marriage in held between the women's March and Sarsour like right,

482
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.440
this thing can't hold,
of course this is going to happen.
Right?

483
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:59.390
So like I think there's a little bit of,
like I told you,
so there,
for some of us,

484
00:26:59.391 --> 00:27:00.130
you know,

485
00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:00.380
<v 2>I'm going,</v>

486
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:05.120
I posted this on my Facebook yesterday and I definitely got some of that.
So,
so

487
00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.660
<v 1>what did,
that doesn't make me feel any better.
Right though.</v>

488
00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.770
It's not like you're like,
all right,
Haha.
See those predominantly.

489
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.170
<v 2>Right,
right,
right.
I mean,</v>

490
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:17.150
I guess one just hope that people who are leaders would have the integrity and

491
00:27:17.151 --> 00:27:20.270
responsibility and introspection to not do this.

492
00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:23.800
<v 1>So,
so what do you think has to happen then for the woman's march to move forward</v>

493
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.200
with whatever the goodness of that is?
Yeah,

494
00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.650
<v 2>right.
I think,
well,
we,
for example,</v>

495
00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.720
I decided I'm not marching in the women in the,

496
00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:34.000
in any march affiliated with the women's March Inc,
which is,

497
00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:37.900
which is the organization that those women sit on the board of.
Um,

498
00:27:37.901 --> 00:27:40.540
so I'm just not going to,
and there are other marches there,

499
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:44.500
there are other individual marches that have actually cut ties with women's

500
00:27:44.501 --> 00:27:47.890
march ink that people can still march with if they feel so inclined.

501
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:51.610
But as far as that particular organization a is considered,

502
00:27:51.611 --> 00:27:53.470
I'm that I'm not marching with them anymore.

503
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:56.760
<v 1>So is the inherent problem of sort of just collectivism as a,</v>

504
00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:01.820
as a ideology that to see a woman's march is inherently sort of ridiculous

505
00:28:03.931 --> 00:28:08.610
because,
well,
because everyone's for when it's a very,
as Jordan would say,

506
00:28:08.611 --> 00:28:12.510
it's a low resolution argument.
Everyone would say that you're for women,
right?

507
00:28:12.511 --> 00:28:16.770
Like no one's not for women or for women to be equal,
not nobody,

508
00:28:16.771 --> 00:28:17.541
but by and large,

509
00:28:17.541 --> 00:28:21.540
any sane member of society is not for women to be equal in a Western society at

510
00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:24.030
least.
Yeah.
Um,
but when you say you're for women,

511
00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:27.810
what you're always going to do is exclude the minority women.
So in this case,

512
00:28:27.811 --> 00:28:31.770
forget,
forget skin color even,
although this is a,
this is a minority skin color,

513
00:28:31.771 --> 00:28:35.850
I suppose the women's march organizers,
they're not for Nikki Haley,

514
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.320
there not for a strong conservative woman who happens to have brown skin,

515
00:28:40.321 --> 00:28:41.910
but we've been forgetting her skin color.

516
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.420
They're not for Sarah Huckabee Sanders there.

517
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:48.690
They're not for any woman that doesn't believe in the ideology.

518
00:28:48.691 --> 00:28:51.300
So you're saying you're for women,
you mean that women who behave

519
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:55.170
<v 2>right.
That's an interesting retort.
Um,
I think,</v>

520
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.960
I think I slightly disagree with,
with the,

521
00:28:57.961 --> 00:29:02.760
if you specify the demographics that you are marching on behalf than you are,

522
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:07.170
um,
necessarily not including other,

523
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.140
other people in that category.
It happens to be the case.

524
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:10.791
<v 1>Well,</v>

525
00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:14.690
I will tell you maybe it's de facto and maybe not intended like the function of

526
00:29:14.691 --> 00:29:15.950
it.
Ultimately,
I think,
yeah,
I

527
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.590
<v 2>think,
I don't think there's anything wrong with,</v>

528
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:23.480
with outlining like on whose behalf you're marching.

529
00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.950
Um,
I do take your point that,
that,
uh,
but I think that this,

530
00:29:27.951 --> 00:29:32.420
this has been true of women's marches,
if you will,
throughout,

531
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.390
throughout the,
like since the suffrage movement,
like even within the stuff,
the,

532
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.650
the women's suffrage movement,
there was,
there was a lot of,

533
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:44.440
there were a lot of tensions because for example,
um,
who was the thing?

534
00:29:44.441 --> 00:29:49.300
Who's the most famous one?
Uh,
Susan VSA.
Yes.
Okay.

535
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.690
So there was a dispute between Susan B.
Anthony,

536
00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:56.200
if I have my facts correct fact check me on this one.
There's a dispute.

537
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:59.400
<v 1>Oh,
don't worry.
This is youtube bell.
Factcheck yeah.</v>

538
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.160
<v 2>There a dispute between Susan B.</v>

539
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.830
Anthony and another woman whose name of course I forget at this moment.
Um,

540
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.650
and the reason was that Susan B.

541
00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:12.300
Anthony was actually willing to Hob knob with people who are racist,
um,

542
00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:16.200
in order to,
to get the vote passed.
Um,

543
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.910
and this other woman who had,

544
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:21.390
who was one of the founders of the suffragists moment had this falling out with

545
00:30:21.391 --> 00:30:24.600
her because she was like,
you cannot associate with,
you know,

546
00:30:24.601 --> 00:30:27.840
these people who are trying to to undermine on,

547
00:30:27.841 --> 00:30:29.250
I'll go demographic in the country.

548
00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:34.020
And so I say all that to say that I think that there will always be these

549
00:30:34.021 --> 00:30:35.970
tensions within these mass movements,

550
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.690
especially if if you read this article that came out and tell the magazine,

551
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.090
especially if from the,

552
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.980
especially if you are a rooted in a intersectionalists framework,

553
00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.170
I think that that's the issue.
I think that you,

554
00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:54.180
you might be able to see Nikki Haley and um,

555
00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.560
some of the other women you mentioned,

556
00:30:55.561 --> 00:31:00.180
if it wasn't actually rooted in intersectionality.
On the other hand,

557
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:04.920
the woman's march is a progressive,
is a self proclaimed,
progressive,
progressive,

558
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:09.360
um,
organization,
progressive movement.
And so by virtue of that,

559
00:31:09.361 --> 00:31:10.530
they're not going to include Republican.

560
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.240
<v 1>Right?
So I guess that's it.
So the name is a bit of a misnomer.</v>

561
00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:15.520
So that's what it is,
I think.
Right.

562
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:20.590
I would argue that being for progressivism as it stands in 2018 is not being for

563
00:31:20.601 --> 00:31:22.390
women.
So I guess it's a little bit of that.

564
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:23.840
<v 2>And so I think that if you were to,</v>

565
00:31:23.841 --> 00:31:28.630
if you were to come across the progressive march like a decade ago,

566
00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.310
<v 1>yeah,
sure.
Look very different from how it looks now.</v>

567
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.620
So that's actually a perfect segue.

568
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:36.110
How is this all connected to whatever is going on with feminism right now?

569
00:31:36.111 --> 00:31:39.830
Do you think,
Oh,
do you consider yourself a feminist?
I know it's a,

570
00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:42.530
it's a label that people are sort of scared of now.

571
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:45.650
They either embrace it and they're not sure why are they're very scared of it
or,

572
00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:46.021
<v 2>yeah,</v>

573
00:31:46.021 --> 00:31:51.021
I don't really have this like knee jerk viscerally like self discussed where the

574
00:31:52.291 --> 00:31:54.310
term feminism as I,
as I,

575
00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:57.750
I feel like maybe people certainly on the right are increasingly having that,

576
00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.770
that reaction.
And I think I understand why,
like if,
if you,

577
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:06.900
if third wave feminism is rooted in intersectionality than like blegh I believe

578
00:32:06.901 --> 00:32:11.760
in feminism as a basic like idea,
you know,
um,
I love the,

579
00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:16.560
I love the work of Camille Paglia so,
so to that extent,
I'm deaf.

580
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:19.480
<v 1>She's been fighting this for a long time.</v>

581
00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.160
<v 2>Uh,
but I think like basic,</v>

582
00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.610
if you believe in like equality for women and basic egalitarianism,

583
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:27.760
to the extent that that is feminism,
I'm a feminist.
I don't,

584
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:32.380
I don't need to like adopt all the other frameworks at their way.

585
00:32:32.381 --> 00:32:36.430
Feminism is adopting now to consider myself a feminist,
I'd say.

586
00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:36.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

587
00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.970
So let's just back up slightly to what you were saying about these competing

588
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.210
sort of methods and how people do things.
So Susan B,

589
00:32:44.211 --> 00:32:47.240
Anthony was willing to talk to some people.
This other woman was,

590
00:32:47.241 --> 00:32:50.730
and I mean we've seen this in all sorts of movements.
Martin Luther King,
yeah.

591
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:53.120
Behaved a certain way.
Talk to certain people.

592
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:57.950
Malcolm X had a different view of it.
So you view that as sort of a necessary,
uh,

593
00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.050
sort of push and pull on how a movement is built?

594
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.360
<v 2>Well,
I,
yeah,
I mean I think,
I think that,
that whether I believe in it or not,</v>

595
00:33:04.361 --> 00:33:06.940
that is what that is.
How movements are bill.
Um,

596
00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:09.820
I think especially if you look at the Martin Luther King versus Malcolm x

597
00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:11.740
dichotomy,
um,

598
00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:17.260
it's much more interesting because I was actually just talking to a friend of

599
00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:17.740
bosses.

600
00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:22.740
I don't think people realize how difficult it was in the 60s to buy into and

601
00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:28.110
practice Dr King's philosophy.
Like we take it for granted in 2018

602
00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:31.320
<v 1>even though a lot of people don't do it now in a warm way.
Right?</v>

603
00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.870
<v 2>Yes.
But I think that makes sense.
Cause we're ironically privileged.</v>

604
00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:40.630
I'm exposed to it.
Um,
that's a good title for a book.

605
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:45.880
Ironically privileged.
Yeah.
Um,
but people don't realize that these,

606
00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:46.241
these,

607
00:33:46.241 --> 00:33:50.520
these guys were training themselves not to fight back when they were being,
when,

608
00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.610
when they were having,
you know,

609
00:33:51.611 --> 00:33:56.100
like condiments poured on them and diners like that.
It's hard.
It's a to,

610
00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:01.160
to route your belief in the idea that I'm not going to fight back because these

611
00:34:01.751 --> 00:34:05.980
white people were made in the image of God is a profoundly crazy belief.

612
00:34:05.981 --> 00:34:09.760
And my crazy,
I mean like groundbreaking,

613
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:14.650
incredibly difficult to actually put into practice,
right?
Novel,
beautiful.

614
00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:15.851
And I so I,

615
00:34:15.851 --> 00:34:20.851
so I think that has to be understood when we contrast or juxtapose Malcolm x

616
00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:25.780
with Dr. King.
I think that if you were to read Malcolm x's autobiography,

617
00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.280
um,
and what happened to him and,

618
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.510
and this is important because people need to understand why the nation of Islam

619
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:35.980
has a cert to a certain extent and to a certain degree of hold in the black

620
00:34:35.981 --> 00:34:36.814
community,

621
00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:41.260
the nation of Islam at the time that Malcolm x was alive was literally taking

622
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:44.890
young black men who at this point,
for example in Harlem,

623
00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:49.990
we're addicts were junkies and turning them into men of upstanding society,

624
00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:53.350
right?
And so in order to,

625
00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.760
in order to counter the toxic and deleterious effects of the nation of Islam,

626
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.530
we have to reckon and we'd have to be willing to accept and acknowledge that

627
00:35:02.531 --> 00:35:03.364
fact,
right?

628
00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:08.610
The problem is that that process of empowerment was also deeply rooted in a very

629
00:35:10.091 --> 00:35:12.520
toxic ideology.
Um,

630
00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.970
namely hating white people and by hating white people,

631
00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:21.160
let me be very clear because I feel like people don't know the extent to which

632
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:26.150
the nation of Islam is crazy when it comes to this issue.
Bring it,

633
00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:31.120
the nation of Islam believes that white people are actually like,

634
00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:36.070
like not fully evolved like that they are actually,

635
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:39.370
um,
subhuman and that during the day

636
00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.610
<v 1>time or you're talking to a termite over here.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Yeah.</v>

637
00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:47.270
<v 2>Like,
but like actually and,
and that during the time of the,
I don't know,</v>

638
00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:49.340
what would you call it?
Messianic age.

639
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.620
That's like why people will be destroyed and people of color will take their

640
00:35:54.621 --> 00:35:59.510
proper place,
um,
in the hierarchy of,
I don't know,
the great circle of life.

641
00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:03.710
So it's not,
it's not some,
like,
it's not just simply,

642
00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.670
oh,
you,
you were very,
like,

643
00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:12.470
people who were white were historically very harmful toward black people.

644
00:36:12.471 --> 00:36:16.070
And so that's why we don't like them.
No,
no,
no,
no.
It's an entire like,

645
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:18.740
like ideology rooted in.

646
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.230
I'm literally thinking why people are subhuman and it's interesting cause
people,

647
00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.200
people will on the one hand,
but like in the,

648
00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:32.450
in on the scene at the same time people will praise Malcolm x and presentation

649
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:37.480
of Islam without even recognizing that Malcolm x was killed by the nation of

650
00:36:38.631 --> 00:36:42.650
Islam,
um,
disavowed the nation of Islam.
But at the time he went to Mecca,

651
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:46.280
right and came back.
Um,
and they're not willing to wrestle with,

652
00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.360
with the nuances of,

653
00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:53.380
of that particular movement seriously.
But I still have that

654
00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:56.290
<v 1>where you recognize the power of that obviously.
Right?
Sure.
Hour of,</v>

655
00:36:56.291 --> 00:36:58.960
sort of just as an easy answer.
Yes.
Yes.
That's what it is.

656
00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.740
<v 2>This is easy.
It's certain,
right.</v>

657
00:37:00.741 --> 00:37:04.760
And it's very difficult for people to live with uncertainty,

658
00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:10.060
which I think is something that the right needs to recognize any scrapple with

659
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.810
when it is rightfully criticizing things like intersectionality,
right.

660
00:37:14.811 --> 00:37:18.200
There is an attraction in being certain,
right?

661
00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.630
Because if you have to deal with uncertainty,

662
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:25.310
if you have to accept uncertainty as a factor of life,
as very difficult,

663
00:37:25.311 --> 00:37:28.940
we have like fight or flight brains.
Yeah.
Right.
We're not,

664
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:33.170
we're not evolved to deal with uncertainty on some level or to be comfortable

665
00:37:33.171 --> 00:37:34.004
with uncertainty.

666
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.730
<v 1>And yet it's almost the only certainty.
Right,
right.
Paradoxically.
Yeah.</v>

667
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.770
<v 2>Yes,
yes.
But that is,</v>

668
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.800
that I think also speaks to why intersectionality is so attractive because it

669
00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:51.021
gives people a way to anchor their insecurities into something that is

670
00:37:51.301 --> 00:37:52.170
steadfast.

671
00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:57.330
<v 1>So when you see people using some of the language that the intersection lists or</v>

672
00:37:57.731 --> 00:38:00.670
the woe crew buy into.
So for example,
a couple of weeks ago,

673
00:38:00.671 --> 00:38:03.440
GML Hill formula of ESPN,
now the Atlantic.
Yeah.

674
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:07.320
She tweeted out the Jordan Peterson's a white supremacist and massaging it.

675
00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:11.280
So why do you know it gets 20,000 retweets or sounding right?
Wasn't he just,

676
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:14.360
<v 2>uh,
speaking to the Seattle Seahawks?
Yeah.
Okay.</v>

677
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:18.480
<v 1>This is what I meant by the way when I said mainstream,
like that's awesome.
Okay.</v>

678
00:38:18.481 --> 00:38:19.780
Continuous.
Yeah.
Oh Buddy,

679
00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.280
I'm glad you brought that up because that was the genesis of the tweet,
right?

680
00:38:23.281 --> 00:38:26.250
Cause it was the bout that Pete Carroll,
the coach of the Seahawks,

681
00:38:26.251 --> 00:38:30.960
had let white supremacist,
misogynist Jordan Peterson talk to the team.

682
00:38:30.961 --> 00:38:33.300
Then another ESPN guy picks it up,
then she tweets it out.

683
00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:36.940
So of course I just invited her.
I,
you know what,
I'm on tour with the guy.
Yeah,

684
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.740
you're welcome to.
Yeah.
I said,
you're welcome.

685
00:38:38.741 --> 00:38:41.080
I didn't even say you want to debate him.
Nothing.
I just said,

686
00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.600
I would love to have you as a guest to the show.
Right.

687
00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.150
And of course she doesn't respond.
Right.
Right.

688
00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:49.870
But what do you make of the fact that they can lay those claims so easily and

689
00:38:49.871 --> 00:38:52.210
they're rewarded for it?
So in other words,

690
00:38:52.211 --> 00:38:53.680
if you were to do this on the other side,

691
00:38:53.681 --> 00:38:56.530
if someone on the right was to say something like,

692
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.960
if you call someone that's not a white supremacist,
the whites renaissance,

693
00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:03.610
that's almost as damaging socially and politically and in every other way as

694
00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:06.130
possible.
Right?
Right.
But if you were someone on the right,

695
00:39:06.131 --> 00:39:10.540
and you said something that sounded off slightly racially,

696
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:15.340
you get called a racist,
you get fired.
And that's it.
But,
uh,

697
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:18.910
Gml Hill,
you know,
she works at a,
the Atlantic,

698
00:39:18.911 --> 00:39:21.850
no problem under David Frum who sat in that very chair and,
right.

699
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.530
And I think Geoffrey Goldberg's the other guy.

700
00:39:23.531 --> 00:39:26.420
And it's like you can say whatever you want.
Now again,
you know,

701
00:39:26.421 --> 00:39:29.080
my policy on free speech,
so I'm not denying her ability to say it.

702
00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:31.420
I'm just saying you got the social PR.
Yeah,
exactly.

703
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:35.430
<v 2>Social capital.
Yeah.
Um,
so what do I make it?
The social care?</v>

704
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:39.020
<v 1>Yeah.
The way that we can use it depending on,
yeah.</v>

705
00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.470
<v 2>So I,
but I actually,
so I get what you're saying.
I think,
I think it's true,</v>

706
00:39:43.471 --> 00:39:44.520
but only to a certain extent.

707
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.360
And I think that the fame and rise of Jordan Peterson proves that it's only true

708
00:39:48.361 --> 00:39:52.620
to a certain extent,
meaning?
Sure.
Um,
from a social perspective,

709
00:39:52.621 --> 00:39:57.621
she has the freedom to make statements which are not completely thought out,

710
00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:05.100
um,
which are pejorative in a way and disparaging in a way,
um,

711
00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:09.750
toward a person.
Um,
and she can do so with out,

712
00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:13.080
I mean,
she obviously gets criticism,
but she can do so without consequence.

713
00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.120
Basically,
I want a certain level,

714
00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:21.110
but I would say that Jordan Peterson has a greater reach than she does.

715
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:28.150
Um,
Jordan Peterson has a greater,
um,
uh,

716
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:31.500
I would say growing fan base than she does.

717
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:36.540
And so I would question who has the more social capital,

718
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:37.370
um,

719
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:41.930
<v 1>but is his social capital or it's the capital of,
of ideas.</v>

720
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:44.790
It's the capital of good ideas.
Sure.
Sordo

721
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:47.140
<v 2>yeah,
but I think that's the same thing.
So yeah,
I think that,</v>

722
00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:50.040
I think that his social capital,
um,

723
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:55.230
is accruing greater interest to continue with his metaphor and hers is and will

724
00:40:56.351 --> 00:41:01.330
continue to do an impression.
Yes,
yes,
yes.
The stocks are increasing.

725
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.213
Yeah.
Um,

726
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:07.390
and I think that that will continue to play out.

727
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.320
And I think that that actually speaks to the fact that the right is partially

728
00:41:11.321 --> 00:41:15.850
wrong when it talks about,
at least within the context of Jordan Peterson,

729
00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:18.160
when it talks about the less social capital,

730
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:22.840
because Jordan Peterson is pumping up the Seattle Seahawks.

731
00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.380
Right.
That's,
I don't think that's,
I mean,

732
00:41:26.381 --> 00:41:29.330
I don't know if he would consider himself to be right wing,
but I don't,

733
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:32.920
I don't know if that's happened on the right in a very long time where I don't

734
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:34.210
even,
I've been traveling

735
00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:35.660
<v 1>with a guy for the last year,
like a hundred shows.</v>

736
00:41:35.661 --> 00:41:37.940
I don't even know that he considers himself part of the right.

737
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:41.810
I think he's vaguely right,
cause he's vaguely conservative.

738
00:41:41.811 --> 00:41:45.860
But I would say he's really an old school liberal that's been smacked around by

739
00:41:45.861 --> 00:41:46.694
reality.

740
00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:50.810
<v 2>No,
he,
but,
but in all seriousness,
he also transcends these labels.</v>

741
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:55.310
And I think that that's his power and that his social power and I,

742
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:57.050
and that's what I,
that's what I meant when I said earlier,

743
00:41:57.051 --> 00:42:02.051
I get what he's doing because he is distilling things down to their essence.

744
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:03.463
And,

745
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:08.590
and regardless of how a seemingly compelling the rhetoric of,

746
00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:12.290
I don't like this guy,
Jordan Peterson,
so I'm gonna call him up.
Oh,

747
00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:15.680
a white nationalist,
um,
goals far on Twitter.

748
00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:20.570
His distillation and breakdown of ideas and transforming those ideas into

749
00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:24.920
lessons to live your life by will almost inevitably always go,

750
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.280
go farther.
So I would disagree with the premise.

751
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:29.610
<v 1>Yeah.
All right,
I'll take that.</v>

752
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.870
I like the little silver lining that I will gladly take that.
All right,

753
00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.750
so let's spend a little time on where you're doing most of your work now,

754
00:42:36.751 --> 00:42:41.250
which is advocacy for Israel now is one of the things that as a a guy that voted

755
00:42:41.251 --> 00:42:44.240
Democrat my whole life,
I can't really say I'm part of the left anymore,
but,

756
00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.650
but a lefty my whole life until these last couple of years,

757
00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:50.790
I would say one of the things I'm most disappointed by by the modern left is the

758
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:55.830
just sort of unabandoned hatred of Israel,
this six mile wide,

759
00:42:55.831 --> 00:43:00.360
absurdly tiny country with no natural resources,
um,
in,

760
00:43:00.361 --> 00:43:02.990
in the toughest neighborhood on earth.
Right.
Um,

761
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:06.330
that's just trying to survive basically.
Right.
Um,
but there is,

762
00:43:06.331 --> 00:43:09.870
but it makes sense within the prism of everything else you've said here related

763
00:43:09.871 --> 00:43:14.490
to intersectionality.
Yeah,
they sorted don't like success and Jews,

764
00:43:14.491 --> 00:43:17.600
so they like minorities,
but they like minorities.
When they're oppressed,

765
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.220
Jews are now thought of,
is no longer oppressed.

766
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:23.370
So you automatically put them in the oppressor category.

767
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.540
Right now you've got a country of these people that have survived and not only

768
00:43:27.541 --> 00:43:29.450
survived,
but actually thrive.
Yeah.

769
00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.630
Although there's Arab Muslim members of the Supreme Court and everything else,

770
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.570
but no,
they don't really care about that.

771
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:36.503
<v 2>Right.</v>

772
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.590
<v 1>So I don't even know what my question is other than other than like,</v>

773
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.230
what is that?
It cause you all in some way,

774
00:43:42.231 --> 00:43:47.231
it all just boils down to that they just hate this tiny little place that dares

775
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.420
survive.
Like I sort of view it that way.
Right.
That's

776
00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:49.991
<v 2>interesting.</v>

777
00:43:49.991 --> 00:43:54.991
I think whenever you combine the two processes of caricaturing things,

778
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:04.900
and I had another one,
it's like when you cannot occur tonight,
caricature thing,

779
00:44:04.901 --> 00:44:07.480
when you turn things into a caricature,
um,

780
00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:11.530
and when you,
oh,
we'll just go with that.

781
00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:16.030
If your fundamental philosophy,
which I,
and I think intersectionality is,

782
00:44:16.031 --> 00:44:19.690
this is Steve's caricaturing things,

783
00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:25.840
then inevitably,
oh,
this is the other thing.
Caricaturing and conspiracy theories.

784
00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:29.010
You put that together,
you'll get an anti to yeah.

785
00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:34.080
And Inter sectionality means yes,
yes.

786
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:38.230
And it's a sectionality is,
yeah,
conspiracy theory.
Um,
and,

787
00:44:38.231 --> 00:44:41.840
and also characters,
people and account cultures,
communities and characters,

788
00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.230
societies.
And once you buy into that,

789
00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:48.570
I think that you will see of course Israel was this white colonialists the

790
00:44:48.571 --> 00:44:52.300
presser and Palestinians is this brown oppressed,
right?

791
00:44:52.301 --> 00:44:55.390
Which is both a caricaturing and a conspiracy.
Serious.
And,

792
00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.690
and in conspiracy theories,
you caricature people,
right?

793
00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:01.630
Like that's sort of the process of how conspiracy theories work can't deal with

794
00:45:01.631 --> 00:45:06.310
depth and nuance or complexity.
And so once this is your guy,

795
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:09.310
this wants,
this is your blueprint for understanding society,

796
00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:14.460
then you will gravitate toward antisemitism.
Someone needs to tell him,

797
00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:17.690
my brown Israeli brother-in-law.
Right?
Right,
right.
Well,

798
00:45:17.691 --> 00:45:22.660
this is the great irony when you don't understand,
um,
history and,
and,

799
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:27.610
and you also see everything through the prism of your own misunderstood,

800
00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:29.900
um,
or your,

801
00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.300
when you understand everything or you see everything through the prism of your

802
00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:37.330
very small American Lens.

803
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.460
Meaning these people grew up in America and they know that America's,
um,

804
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:44.890
problems have historically been between black and white people,
for example,

805
00:45:44.891 --> 00:45:48.070
until they think that everywhere else in the world,

806
00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:52.690
all of the conflicts that are going on are obviously also can something to be

807
00:45:52.691 --> 00:45:54.340
divided along those racial lines.

808
00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:58.630
It's ironically jingoistic on some level,

809
00:45:58.900 --> 00:45:59.733
um,

810
00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:04.860
or imperialistic to use there to use their terms to see everything through the

811
00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.310
Lens Lens and through the vantage point of your own reality,
uh,

812
00:46:08.311 --> 00:46:09.490
or historic reality,

813
00:46:09.491 --> 00:46:12.610
which is what they're projecting onto their understanding of Israel,

814
00:46:12.611 --> 00:46:15.310
Israeli society.
Not Knowing,
for example,

815
00:46:15.311 --> 00:46:19.390
that the majority of Jews in Israel are people of color,

816
00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:20.590
not knowing,

817
00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:25.030
just to really get down to details that Likud party,

818
00:46:25.031 --> 00:46:29.890
which is baby's party,
um,
rose to power because of its,

819
00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:34.720
uh,
taking on the challenges and the,
and the,
um,

820
00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:39.310
and the interests of the Ms Community is road.

821
00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:43.660
The Jews from,
from,
from North Africa right there.

822
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:44.660
There is no,

823
00:46:44.661 --> 00:46:49.110
like there is no understanding of this reality because this reality can not

824
00:46:49.111 --> 00:46:52.670
possibly exist with him and intersection list view of society.
Yeah.

825
00:46:52.671 --> 00:46:56.980
So in that way it becomes the perfect test case for there.

826
00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:02.090
I would say basic struggle for what reality is in a way or something like that.

827
00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.710
Well,
struggle,
reality,
inability again to deal with depth.

828
00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.080
Like I think that that's what this boils down to.

829
00:47:08.081 --> 00:47:12.040
Ultimate ultimately inability to deal with nuance and inability to do with
humor,

830
00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:13.990
to deal with human complexity,

831
00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:18.790
the very complexity that they themselves have and possess.
Um,

832
00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.850
and that's a skillset to be able to do that.
Right.

833
00:47:21.851 --> 00:47:23.830
That's a virtue I think to be able to do that.

834
00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:28.960
And so it's not just the fact that these to go back to students are promoting,

835
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.340
which is toxic and bad.
It's also bad for them,
right?

836
00:47:33.341 --> 00:47:37.720
Like they're not going to have a healthy holistic life if they are unable to

837
00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:40.150
deal with depth and human complexity.

838
00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:43.490
<v 1>Do you think it is also something I'm not totally sure about this but saying to</v>

839
00:47:43.491 --> 00:47:45.930
do is just the geographic size of Israel,

840
00:47:45.931 --> 00:47:50.931
like the absurdly tiny nature of the borders that you could literally drive both

841
00:47:51.621 --> 00:47:55.010
ways up north,
south,
east,
west,
easily in a day.

842
00:47:55.011 --> 00:47:57.970
You could drive all the way north all the way back,
I'm sure in one day.
Yeah.

843
00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:00.290
I think it's about six hour drive up north down south.

844
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.430
This way you could drive like,
I dunno,
15 times in a day or something like that,

845
00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.870
but that it's so small that they're focused on that can become like even more of

846
00:48:08.871 --> 00:48:12.530
a laser even though they make it seem like it's just this my monstrous ever

847
00:48:12.531 --> 00:48:15.950
growing,
um,
blob or something like that.

848
00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:17.790
<v 2>I mean,
I don't know.
Honestly,</v>

849
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:21.840
I haven't quite figured out the geographical piece to this.

850
00:48:21.841 --> 00:48:26.050
I don't know if it's relevant in their level of analysis.
I think right.

851
00:48:26.051 --> 00:48:28.400
That's probably,
it's probably a little too high level or something.

852
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.560
I don't think that really crosses their mind.
Um,
I think that,

853
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:35.770
I think just once you see the world through caricature and once you see,

854
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:41.860
see yourself as living in this space where everyone's against you,
um,

855
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:46.950
then it's easy to fall into this trap of either antisemitism or being very early

856
00:48:48.041 --> 00:48:50.150
clue,
coming in very early,
close to antisemitism.

857
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:54.780
<v 1>So what are some of the things that people say about you as you have fought this</v>

858
00:48:54.781 --> 00:48:58.340
battle?
Because,
uh,
you know,
look,
I can look at some of my,
uh,

859
00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:02.610
some of my other friends and former guests that are black that I've taken

860
00:49:02.611 --> 00:49:07.090
unpopular positions related to the way black people are supposed to things,

861
00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:12.200
which is of course inherently racist,
but the things that is awesome.
Right?

862
00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:14.800
Exactly.
Yeah.
So the things that get said about Larry Elder,

863
00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.530
let's say you were tying to solve for the last 50 years or,

864
00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.060
or my friend David Webb,
plenty of other people.
Um,

865
00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.960
I know you get a certain percentage of that is when I was doing a little Google

866
00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:27.420
and idea people,
people say not nice things.

867
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.811
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

868
00:49:27.811 --> 00:49:31.020
I mean it could be that I just turned off my Twitter mentions and so I don't

869
00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:35.920
know,
figured out the meaning of life.
I don't really like come on,

870
00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.810
it's a contact with,
I mean honestly I,

871
00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:44.700
if it is happening,
I think I have a filter and it is happening.
Right.

872
00:49:44.701 --> 00:49:45.800
But I think I have a feel too,

873
00:49:45.801 --> 00:49:50.790
I feel too is put in place and turned on that limit my seeing them,

874
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:54.600
I hate to sound like callous,
but I just don't care.

875
00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.980
Meaning I think,
I think that under use used to let me,

876
00:49:58.981 --> 00:50:00.540
like in college,

877
00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:04.440
like someone was very pejorative toward and someone was very racist toward me

878
00:50:04.441 --> 00:50:05.310
because of my,

879
00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:09.570
my like calling me like a slave and all of these various things.

880
00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:12.900
Um,
and there have been other,
like I had a death threat.

881
00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:16.350
I suspect this was a tolerant left Dee saying that because of your views.
Right.

882
00:50:16.351 --> 00:50:16.920
You know what,

883
00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.220
I don't want to caricature Dave according to what I'm talking about.

884
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:23.430
Good Person Am I think I'm right.
Sure.
Yeah.

885
00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:27.650
I'm just saying I don't want to caricature the left as this sort.
Like

886
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.540
<v 1>I know mom,
but that's what we call an educated guess.
That's fair.
Yes.</v>

887
00:50:32.541 --> 00:50:34.310
He himself particularly,
yeah.

888
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:38.240
<v 2>Happened to belong to it.
Yes.
Um,
but,</v>

889
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:42.680
but what was I gonna say?
Oh,
I had a death threat and also in college,
which was,

890
00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:44.700
it wasn't funny,
but I dunno,

891
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:48.860
it's kind of funny that someone would take such time to like focus his energy on

892
00:50:48.861 --> 00:50:53.690
me,
um,
which is a little weird.
But beside that,
um,

893
00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:54.080
I,

894
00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:59.080
I just spend my time and my energy just trying to put out good things into the

895
00:50:59.631 --> 00:51:02.990
world.
And I think that because I focus on that more than what the haters to the

896
00:51:02.991 --> 00:51:05.960
speaker saying,
I just don't notice them anymore.

897
00:51:05.961 --> 00:51:09.230
And I'm just trying to put good energy out into the world.

898
00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:13.700
<v 1>To that end.
You wrote your first piece in the New York Times.
How long ago?</v>

899
00:51:13.701 --> 00:51:17.750
About five,
six months ago.
Something like that.
Not that,
something like that.
Yeah.

900
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:21.200
I think in July or something.
Why I refuse was it,

901
00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:24.260
why refuse to hate white people?
Why I want to get this right?
I'm sorry.

902
00:51:24.261 --> 00:51:26.690
Why I refuse to avoid white people.

903
00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:30.520
I'm pretty sure you're supposed to remember this.

904
00:51:30.521 --> 00:51:33.710
I don't see your first New York Times.
Oh,
right.
They get the title.

905
00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:36.290
What do you make of that title then let's,
let's start that way.
Cause,

906
00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:39.680
but a lot of people don't know that that often you can write an op Ed for a

907
00:51:39.681 --> 00:51:42.650
major paper and that you don't pick the title because often people don't get

908
00:51:42.651 --> 00:51:43.350
past the title.

909
00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:45.510
<v 2>Right,
right.
I mean,
I didn't have a problem with it.</v>

910
00:51:45.511 --> 00:51:47.790
I think it was true to the essence of what I was saying.

911
00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:52.070
<v 1>So what was happening that I suspect it has a lot to do with everything we've</v>

912
00:51:52.071 --> 00:51:52.831
talked about here,
but what,

913
00:51:52.831 --> 00:51:55.220
what was going on that you thought that you had to write this?
I mean this,

914
00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:57.200
this should be pretty obvious stuff.

915
00:51:57.870 --> 00:52:00.620
<v 2>Actual pieces in the New York Times where other people,</v>

916
00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:02.630
people of color were saying like,

917
00:52:02.631 --> 00:52:05.690
I'm not going to have my child speak to white people.
And I was like,
what

918
00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:07.450
<v 1>there,
there was one,
I mean,
you're not making this up.</v>

919
00:52:07.451 --> 00:52:10.060
There was one just a little bit before that that literally was saying,
yeah,

920
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.980
literally said that.

921
00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:12.200
<v 2>I think that I was also,</v>

922
00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:17.860
I was also having this intellectual fight within myself against Ta-nehisi coats

923
00:52:18.711 --> 00:52:23.000
and sort of everything he stands for and like I have a very strong reaction to

924
00:52:23.001 --> 00:52:26.090
that.
And I think that this piece was the product of all of those things and a

925
00:52:26.091 --> 00:52:27.950
response to all of those things.
Um,

926
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:33.640
and the gist of it was just that I grew up around all types of people,

927
00:52:35.331 --> 00:52:37.970
white people,
black people,
Muslims,
Asians.

928
00:52:37.971 --> 00:52:42.710
Like I went to a very egalitarian high school,
extremely got Sarian.
So,
um,

929
00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:47.270
so the process by which people again caricature,

930
00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:51.110
caricature each other and caricature white people is something that is a very

931
00:52:51.111 --> 00:52:52.550
foreign thing to me.
Like,
I don't,

932
00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:57.180
I can't quite wrap my head around that sort of language that's used,
um,

933
00:52:57.410 --> 00:53:01.400
by people who believe in intersectionality and quite frankly by people who

934
00:53:01.401 --> 00:53:03.200
probably have good intent.

935
00:53:03.201 --> 00:53:06.530
Like I'm sure the guy who wrote that piece about having his child,

936
00:53:06.531 --> 00:53:10.910
of what white people was coming from,
a place of genuine,

937
00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:13.490
sincere place of concern.
Um,

938
00:53:13.491 --> 00:53:17.420
so I don't want to like disparate him in any way,
but I just don't think

939
00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:22.090
<v 1>you would say his answers are confused.
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.</v>

940
00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:25.950
<v 2>Um,
but,
but I would,</v>

941
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:30.660
I would say that his fear was probably real.
Right.
And so,
um,

942
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:34.470
I think that there's just a better way in a more healthier way of going about

943
00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:36.520
these things.
Yeah.

944
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:42.170
<v 1>What do you think a Martin Luther King would think about our society right now?</v>

945
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:44.850
There's a good one.
[inaudible] my tweet yesterday

946
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:49.610
I saw your tweet.
Tell the good people

947
00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:55.030
<v 2>I said I was preparing for taping and I was doing so by watching Dr King's</v>

948
00:53:55.031 --> 00:53:58.450
speeches.
And that's so funny.
Well,
you're good at your job.

949
00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:01.220
<v 1>No,
I'm alright.
I'm all right.
Well,
what do you,</v>

950
00:54:01.221 --> 00:54:04.760
what do you think he would think of things these days?
The state of the way we,

951
00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.350
we talk about race,

952
00:54:06.351 --> 00:54:10.220
the people that I think think they're his natural allies are often using

953
00:54:10.221 --> 00:54:13.550
arguments that are what I would say or 180 degrees.

954
00:54:13.551 --> 00:54:15.440
The reverse of what his arguments were.

955
00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.260
<v 2>Yeah.
Dr. King,</v>

956
00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:20.810
<v 1>I know this is almost an impossible question.
Okay.</v>

957
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:23.840
<v 2>Yeah.
So I mean,
Dr. King wrote a book called strength to love.</v>

958
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:27.110
What is the collection of his sermons?
Um,

959
00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:30.010
and I think in one of the first or second like sermons slash SAS,

960
00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:35.020
he talks about like why he routed his nonviolent movement in this belief in

961
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:41.990
concept of love or God pay Love,
love,
love for love's sake,
essentially.

962
00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:47.200
Um,
and I think that given the fact that,

963
00:54:47.201 --> 00:54:48.440
that he wrote that he wrote that,

964
00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:53.500
I think that he would definitely issue this new impulse within society to reduce

965
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:57.530
each other to immutable characteristics.
I mean,

966
00:54:57.531 --> 00:55:02.320
this is what he was fighting against,
right?
But,
or I should say and write,

967
00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:07.330
he would also have devised a rhetoric that was strong enough and compelling

968
00:55:08.481 --> 00:55:13.190
enough to inspire people to aspire to loving each other.

969
00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.460
And I think that's,
that's actually what's missing.
Um,

970
00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:21.920
aside from a few different commentators here in there who might be,

971
00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:26.230
who sort of exists in the,
I think the Ted talk circuit.
Um,

972
00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:31.220
I don't think that there's this movement with an America trying to teach people

973
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:34.790
how to love.
And I think that that's something we've lost.

974
00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:39.170
And that was something that was very central to Dr King's writings of Dr King's

975
00:55:39.171 --> 00:55:40.460
work.
Again,
as I said earlier,

976
00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:44.420
to devise a blueprint where you say,

977
00:55:44.421 --> 00:55:47.660
I am not going to fight back against this white person.

978
00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:51.230
Not just because nonviolence is a very strategic tactic,

979
00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:54.890
but because this man was made in the image of God,

980
00:55:55.490 --> 00:56:00.490
like that is existential and there is no profoundly,

981
00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.090
um,

982
00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:07.090
existential movement rooted in love in the same way that it was a,

983
00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.000
when he devised it in the 60s.

984
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:12.660
<v 1>Is that partly because we've just made everything political?</v>

985
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:16.530
<v 2>Yes,
yes.
Uh,
yes.
I mean the,</v>

986
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:21.390
it's become like our identity,
right?
Which is,
by the way,
it why I'm just like,

987
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:25.450
when you say like the left than the right,
like I don't know these,

988
00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:29.080
these categories to have to a certain extent lost meaning for me

989
00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.180
<v 1>and I,
I would say that all the time.
And I think you can,</v>

990
00:56:31.181 --> 00:56:33.930
even when I'm saying them,
there's a certain exhaustion,
right?

991
00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:37.060
Sometimes you just have to frame that you,
we just need words.
You know?

992
00:56:37.061 --> 00:56:37.894
It's funny you said,
yeah,

993
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:40.560
we've sort of lost the language to talk about some of this stuff.
Okay.
So lives,

994
00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:44.950
you just need some labels loosely to talk about these things.

995
00:56:44.951 --> 00:56:45.630
Otherwise,

996
00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:50.630
<v 2>the people who can handle complexity and the people who cannot,</v>

997
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:52.341
<v 1>I'll go with that.</v>

998
00:56:52.341 --> 00:56:55.160
But can you give me something snappy or can we get words to make out a little

999
00:56:55.161 --> 00:56:57.690
snappier and you get that in one bumper sticker,
but that,

1000
00:56:57.790 --> 00:56:59.180
that really is what it is.
I mean,

1001
00:56:59.181 --> 00:57:03.220
that also explains the explosion of these conversations online,
right?

1002
00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:05.210
Because we're not getting them through the mainstream media.

1003
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:09.200
<v 2>I would say friends and potential friends.
Okay.</v>

1004
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:11.590
<v 1>I told you we were going to end this with love.</v>

1005
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.920
Do you have anything else in the love department?
I think you nailed it there.

1006
00:57:14.921 --> 00:57:16.480
And then I want to talk about your website real quick.

1007
00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.930
<v 2>Oh,
I was going to talk about that,
but yeah.</v>

1008
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:21.280
<v 1>Oh,
all right.
So then let's roll.
Let's roll them together right into that.
Yeah.</v>

1009
00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:24.570
<v 2>Okay.
So one of the reasons why,
um,</v>

1010
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:28.240
there are negative conversations being had about various topics,

1011
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:32.260
various political topics on college campuses and even in our political discourse

1012
00:57:32.261 --> 00:57:33.650
in general,
um,

1013
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:37.930
is because of the framework in which that conversation is had the framework,

1014
00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:41.590
we've talked about it as intersectionality to a certain extent.
Um,

1015
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:46.620
intersectionality essentially encourages people to make assumptions about each

1016
00:57:46.751 --> 00:57:49.910
other,
whether it's assumptions based upon skin color,

1017
00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:54.490
based upon financial status or lack thereof based upon gender,
et Cetera.

1018
00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:58.270
So in order to challenge the conversation or change the conversation,

1019
00:57:58.271 --> 00:58:01.300
you have to challenge the framework and the framework,
the challenges.

1020
00:58:01.301 --> 00:58:03.970
Intersectionality is the theory of in champ.

1021
00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:08.710
<v 1>And somebody here has a website called theory of enchantment.com.</v>

1022
00:58:08.711 --> 00:58:10.000
What the hell is going on over there?

1023
00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:14.380
<v 2>So a little bit of context.
I was at the Wall Street Journal for a year,
2015.</v>

1024
00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:18.700
I was mentored by Bret Stephens and part of my assignment was to develop a

1025
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:21.100
paper.
Uh,

1026
00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:23.620
and in this paper I was essentially trying to figure out what the psychology of

1027
00:58:23.621 --> 00:58:24.820
connection was.
What,

1028
00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:27.490
why do people gravitate toward with what they gravitate toward.

1029
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:30.670
And if I can figure out the psychology of connection or the science of

1030
00:58:30.671 --> 00:58:34.810
connection and can I use that science of connection to heal disconnection.

1031
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:38.860
And that is what ended up being the theory of enchantment and the theory of

1032
00:58:38.861 --> 00:58:42.910
enchantment.
Um,
draw drives or um,

1033
00:58:42.911 --> 00:58:44.470
depends heavily upon pop culture,

1034
00:58:44.471 --> 00:58:48.400
studying pop culture because pop culture shows us what we gravitate toward.
Um,

1035
00:58:48.401 --> 00:58:51.610
so I began to ask myself questions during the course of writing this research

1036
00:58:51.611 --> 00:58:55.750
paper.
Like why do we gravitate to are companies like Nike?
What is it?

1037
00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:59.200
What is it you love Nike.
I love Nike.

1038
00:58:59.201 --> 00:59:01.000
But like for some people Nike as a religion,

1039
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:03.490
like it's like on that level and like,

1040
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.480
why do we gravitate towards singer songwriters and influencers like Beyonce?

1041
00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:11.020
And people would say,
well,
it's Beyonce.
It's very obvious quotes.
But I'm like,
no,

1042
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:13.210
it's not sign off.
Yes,
there's something happening now.

1043
00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:17.740
And it turns out that all of these influencers and always these companies,

1044
00:59:17.741 --> 00:59:20.110
et Cetera,
are doing one simple thing.

1045
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:24.320
They're creating content where the audience sees themselves and their potential

1046
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.870
reflecting on the content and that's how they're generating connection.

1047
00:59:27.871 --> 00:59:31.550
So you wear that Nike shoe because you think to yourself,
I wear this Nike Shoe,

1048
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:35.140
I'll be able to just do it right is this little one goes.
Um,

1049
00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:38.750
when Beyonce says who run the world,
girls,

1050
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.260
women see themselves and their potential reflected in that song.

1051
00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:43.550
So they gravitate to where her.

1052
00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:48.940
So how do we use that basic idea to bring together people who have been

1053
00:59:50.031 --> 00:59:54.140
disconnected?
Um,
so the theory even Shama has three rules,

1054
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:59.300
three principles of trying to bring connection in previously polarized spaces.

1055
00:59:59.301 --> 01:00:02.710
And this can be used in interpersonal conflict or conflicts of other nature's.

1056
01:00:02.711 --> 01:00:07.050
So the first rule is to remember that we are human beings and not political

1057
01:00:07.051 --> 01:00:10.830
abstractions.
Cause the first thing that happens in these spaces,
we have these,

1058
01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:12.260
we abstract about each other.

1059
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:16.670
We think that we're talking to political objects or entities and on a per a full

1060
01:00:16.671 --> 01:00:17.504
person.

1061
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:21.740
And what I will do in a presentation is I will point to a pop culture reference

1062
01:00:21.741 --> 01:00:22.670
that illustrates this.

1063
01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:26.390
And I'm usually point to Kendrick Lamar because Kendrick Lamar has a song called

1064
01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:31.220
DNA and he says in the song I got power,
poison and pain and joy inside my DNA.

1065
01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.600
And what he's doing when he says that is he is articulating an illustrating what

1066
01:00:35.601 --> 01:00:38.570
it means to be a human being.
We have all of these things within us,

1067
01:00:38.571 --> 01:00:41.330
we have the capacity to do good,
we have the capacity to destroy,

1068
01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:45.740
have the capacity to build up right?
And we have the capacity to tear down.

1069
01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:48.920
And just as this,
this impulse exists within the person.

1070
01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:53.870
While I disagree with I'm having a problem with,
it also exists within me.
Right?

1071
01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.260
And realizing this is sort of the beginning I think for empathy and mutual

1072
01:00:57.261 --> 01:01:00.200
understanding.
So that's the first rule.
Remember we are human beings,

1073
01:01:00.201 --> 01:01:03.440
not political abstractions.
And as a corollary,
we will knock,
dehumanize,

1074
01:01:03.441 --> 01:01:07.580
or stereotype or objectify any of the human beings or any of the communities

1075
01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:10.130
involved in this conflict,
whatever that conflict is.

1076
01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.360
The second principle is if you want to criticize,
criticize,

1077
01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:18.590
in order to uplift and empower,
never to tear down,
never to destroy.

1078
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:20.070
So if that person who believes in him,

1079
01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.470
intersectionality is being very mean to me and aggressive to me,

1080
01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:29.630
um,
I could criticize him by cursing him out,
right?

1081
01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:34.760
And,
but by,
you know,
speaking down to him,

1082
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:38.480
or I can criticize him in a way that makes it very clear that I actually believe

1083
01:01:38.481 --> 01:01:42.350
in his potential and actually believe that he's better than the content or the

1084
01:01:42.351 --> 01:01:44.480
rhetoric,
the empty rhetoric that he's putting out.

1085
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:48.830
And by speaking in the manner that suggests that I'm more likely to change him.

1086
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:52.940
So a quick story.
My Angelo told this story about how she,
uh,

1087
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:58.010
she was on set with Tupac at a movie set and Tupac was in the corner somewhere,

1088
01:01:58.011 --> 01:01:59.750
cursing out this guy,
uh,

1089
01:01:59.751 --> 01:02:01.730
who he didn't like and they were like about to get into a fight.

1090
01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:04.640
And then Maya Angelo says,
come here,
come here,
let me talk to you.

1091
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:08.030
And he's two POCs.
So he's like,
here,
he's like still mumbling under his breath.

1092
01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:12.050
And then she says,
come over here,
let me talk to you.
And then she tells him,

1093
01:02:12.051 --> 01:02:14.330
don't you know that we are counting on you.

1094
01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.400
Don't you know that you were the next generation and,

1095
01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:19.800
and that we're looking toward you to pave the way for us.

1096
01:02:19.801 --> 01:02:24.150
Don't you know that you have been loved and we're looking towards you as the

1097
01:02:24.151 --> 01:02:28.620
next,
as the next person to uphold us.
And so the story goes that in that moment,

1098
01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:34.220
Tupac starts crying because she had rooted her criticism and her fundamental

1099
01:02:34.411 --> 01:02:38.550
belief in him,
you know?
And then the next day he's like,

1100
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:42.330
he's sort of like kind of still being aggressive toward that guy.

1101
01:02:42.331 --> 01:02:46.470
And then Maya Maya passes and he goes,
he likes up.
He goes,
good morning,

1102
01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:48.260
Miss Angelo.
Right?
So he changed it.

1103
01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:52.620
He modified his behavior in front of someone because she believes in him.
Um,

1104
01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:54.510
so that's the second.
And then the third principle,

1105
01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.970
the third and final principle is everything we do,

1106
01:02:57.270 --> 01:03:00.510
we try to route and love and compassion.
What sounds,
what sounds very like,

1107
01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.380
you know,
fake.

1108
01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:05.220
But what it means is if someone is being aggressive towards you or mean towards

1109
01:03:05.221 --> 01:03:09.150
you or whatever,
you call that out as inappropriate to say,
you know,

1110
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:11.760
I don't know you from Adam.
I don't know why you're prejudging me,

1111
01:03:11.761 --> 01:03:13.320
which is the definition of prejudice,

1112
01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:16.800
right on board I'm not going to do is I'm not going to prejudge you even though

1113
01:03:16.801 --> 01:03:19.950
you have prejudged me.
I'm instead if you want,

1114
01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:25.050
let's go to this coffee shop and let's actually talk about this topic to topic x

1115
01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:27.120
topic.
Why whenever we're having a disagreement over,

1116
01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:30.330
because what's happening in that moment is they're probably seen you as a

1117
01:03:30.331 --> 01:03:31.290
political distraction,

1118
01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:35.970
none as a full human being and you have to rehumanize that space and you end up,

1119
01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:36.990
the purpose by the way,

1120
01:03:36.991 --> 01:03:41.850
is not to get that person to agree with every single viewpoint you have the

1121
01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:42.180
Ppar.

1122
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:46.620
The purpose of that is to bring back compassionate empathy even in the midst of

1123
01:03:46.621 --> 01:03:50.970
profound disagreement.
What do something weird,
we are not doing so well here,

1124
01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:54.180
uh,
in America.
So that's the theory.
Even chairman,

1125
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.460
<v 1>it's been a pleasure.
Can you run for president or something?
Yeah,
absolutely not.</v>

1126
01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:04.050
That would not work with any of those three pillars.
No,
no,
it would,
I just,

1127
01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.990
I prefer a pop culture to a political culture.
Yeah,
that's,

1128
01:04:06.991 --> 01:04:10.530
that's the honest truth,
but I appreciate that.
Yeah.
All right.
Well,
