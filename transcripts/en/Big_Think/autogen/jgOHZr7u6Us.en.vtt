hey Justin you ask really need question

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730
hey Justin you ask really need question
 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.160
hey Justin you ask really need question
about Elon Musk you know there have been

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170
about Elon Musk you know there have been
 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.539
about Elon Musk you know there have been
wonderful things that he's been talking

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549
wonderful things that he's been talking
 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.850
wonderful things that he's been talking
about colonizing Mars obviously putting

about colonizing Mars obviously putting
 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.040

Bowie which I love he's a really
wonderful person and an inspiration to a

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:23.829
wonderful person and an inspiration to a
 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.830
wonderful person and an inspiration to a
lot of us and one of the misconceptions

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840
lot of us and one of the misconceptions
 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.749
lot of us and one of the misconceptions
that a lot of people have is that

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759
that a lot of people have is that
 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.909

federal space programs like NASA and

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919
federal space programs like NASA and
 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.040
federal space programs like NASA and
commercial space programs like SpaceX

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050
commercial space programs like SpaceX
 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.200
commercial space programs like SpaceX
run by Elon Musk are in some type of a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210
run by Elon Musk are in some type of a
 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.900
run by Elon Musk are in some type of a
competition and you know I am a fan of

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910
competition and you know I am a fan of
 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.850
competition and you know I am a fan of
all things space and one of the things

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860
all things space and one of the things
 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.680
all things space and one of the things
that has been so fun for me in the last

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690
that has been so fun for me in the last
 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.780
that has been so fun for me in the last
few years is the collaboration between

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790
few years is the collaboration between
 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.120
few years is the collaboration between
those two different realms of space

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130
those two different realms of space
 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.880
those two different realms of space
travel so you know for example NASA

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890
travel so you know for example NASA
 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.910
travel so you know for example NASA
routinely buys SpaceX Rockets to put our

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920
routinely buys SpaceX Rockets to put our
 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.470
routinely buys SpaceX Rockets to put our
payloads and our satellites up into

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480
payloads and our satellites up into
 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.420
payloads and our satellites up into
space and that means that as a NASA

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430
space and that means that as a NASA
 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.040

scientist I've gotten to go to several

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050
scientist I've gotten to go to several
 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.979
scientist I've gotten to go to several
launches and landings of these Falcon

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989
launches and landings of these Falcon
 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.270
launches and landings of these Falcon
rockets and that's amazing

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280
rockets and that's amazing
 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.710
rockets and that's amazing
you know used to be that you would go to

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720
you know used to be that you would go to
 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.900
you know used to be that you would go to
a launch and a big rocket would go off

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910
a launch and a big rocket would go off
 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.700
a launch and a big rocket would go off
and everybody would cheer and then you

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710
and everybody would cheer and then you
 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.350
and everybody would cheer and then you
get in your cars and you drive home and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360
get in your cars and you drive home and
 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.160
get in your cars and you drive home and
it was all done

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170
it was all done
 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.649
it was all done
the amazing thing now is seven minutes

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659
the amazing thing now is seven minutes
 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.840
the amazing thing now is seven minutes
later everybody just walks to the other

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850
later everybody just walks to the other
 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.580
later everybody just walks to the other
side of the building and watches the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590
side of the building and watches the
 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.770
side of the building and watches the
first stage of that rocket land and that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780
first stage of that rocket land and that
 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.349
first stage of that rocket land and that
is something that is mind-blowing your

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359
is something that is mind-blowing your
 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.809
is something that is mind-blowing your
eyes basically it does not compute you

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:21.819
eyes basically it does not compute you
 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:23.129
eyes basically it does not compute you
cannot believe what you were seeing

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:23.139
cannot believe what you were seeing
 

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:25.949
cannot believe what you were seeing
because this giant thing comes down from

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:25.959
because this giant thing comes down from
 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.499
because this giant thing comes down from
space faster than you could imagine and

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509
space faster than you could imagine and
 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:29.819
space faster than you could imagine and
this is something that's I know several

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829
this is something that's I know several
 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.609
this is something that's I know several
story high building it's a big thing it

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619
story high building it's a big thing it
 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.550
story high building it's a big thing it
comes careening down and just before it

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560
comes careening down and just before it
 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.539
comes careening down and just before it
gets to the ground

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549
gets to the ground
 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.090
gets to the ground
it stops settles down and then gently

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100
it stops settles down and then gently
 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.219
it stops settles down and then gently
lands and one of the things that I love

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229
lands and one of the things that I love
 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.139
lands and one of the things that I love
is that you don't even hear the sonic

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149
is that you don't even hear the sonic
 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.019
is that you don't even hear the sonic
boom until after you see it land you

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:46.029
boom until after you see it land you
 

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:47.760
boom until after you see it land you
watch this thing come careening down

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770
watch this thing come careening down
 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.429
watch this thing come careening down
then stop land gently and then you hear

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439
then stop land gently and then you hear
 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.169
then stop land gently and then you hear
boom boom because it broke the speed of

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179
boom boom because it broke the speed of
 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.719
boom boom because it broke the speed of
sound coming in and that is something

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729
sound coming in and that is something
 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.300
sound coming in and that is something
that I am just really amazed I live to

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310
that I am just really amazed I live to
 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.269
that I am just really amazed I live to
be able to see I love SpaceX and I love

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:00.279
be able to see I love SpaceX and I love
 

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:02.639
be able to see I love SpaceX and I love
NASA's collaboration I think what a lot

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649
NASA's collaboration I think what a lot
 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.709
NASA's collaboration I think what a lot
of people don't realize is that NASA is

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719
of people don't realize is that NASA is
 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.319
of people don't realize is that NASA is
one of SpaceX's major customers we

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329
one of SpaceX's major customers we
 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:08.760
one of SpaceX's major customers we
actually buy the Rockets and we've even

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770
actually buy the Rockets and we've even
 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.139
actually buy the Rockets and we've even
paid for some of the development of the

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149
paid for some of the development of the
 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.089
paid for some of the development of the
Rockets as well so it was never a

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099
Rockets as well so it was never a
 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.130
Rockets as well so it was never a
question of one or the other it was a it

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140
question of one or the other it was a it
 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.750
question of one or the other it was a it
was the ideas that we're collaborating

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760
was the ideas that we're collaborating
 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.270
was the ideas that we're collaborating
the more companies going into space hey

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280
the more companies going into space hey
 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.530
the more companies going into space hey
the better for us

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540
the better for us
 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.300
the better for us
lower the cost of the rockets and the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310
lower the cost of the rockets and the
 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.490
lower the cost of the rockets and the
more efficient an industry we have and

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500
more efficient an industry we have and
 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.170
more efficient an industry we have and
hopefully the more people that think

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180
hopefully the more people that think
 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.030
hopefully the more people that think
space travel and space exploration are

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040
space travel and space exploration are
 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.429
space travel and space exploration are
good things then there are the questions

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439
good things then there are the questions
 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.080
good things then there are the questions
about whether Elon is going to build a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090
about whether Elon is going to build a
 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.089
about whether Elon is going to build a
giant rocket that can take hundreds of

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099
giant rocket that can take hundreds of
 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.949
giant rocket that can take hundreds of
people to Mars and then this is

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959
people to Mars and then this is
 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.479
people to Mars and then this is
something that as a scientist you know I

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489
something that as a scientist you know I
 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.550
something that as a scientist you know I
am naturally a skeptical person that's

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560
am naturally a skeptical person that's
 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.390
am naturally a skeptical person that's
how I was trained

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400
how I was trained
 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.789
how I was trained
right now what I see is a really cool

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799
right now what I see is a really cool
 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:42.660
right now what I see is a really cool
idea

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670
idea
 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.860
idea
you know reminds me of a lot of my

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870
you know reminds me of a lot of my
 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.839
you know reminds me of a lot of my
favorite science fiction stories but

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849
favorite science fiction stories but
 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.959
favorite science fiction stories but
it's basically just that an idea I think

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:48.969
it's basically just that an idea I think
 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.849
it's basically just that an idea I think
there's a long way to go before we

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859
there's a long way to go before we
 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.059
there's a long way to go before we
actually see any significant

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069
actually see any significant
 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.080
actually see any significant
colonization you know any significant

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090
colonization you know any significant
 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.809
colonization you know any significant
number of people going to Mars first we

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819
number of people going to Mars first we
 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.729
number of people going to Mars first we
need to get one single person to Mars

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739
need to get one single person to Mars
 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.649
need to get one single person to Mars
you know or a small team of people and

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659
you know or a small team of people and
 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.839
you know or a small team of people and
that is something that has proven very

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849
that is something that has proven very
 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.940
that is something that has proven very
very difficult it's not so much a

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950
very difficult it's not so much a
 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.770
very difficult it's not so much a
question that we can't build rockets to

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780
question that we can't build rockets to
 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.300
question that we can't build rockets to
take us there because even today you

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310
take us there because even today you
 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.740
take us there because even today you
know we have rockets that might have the

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750
know we have rockets that might have the
 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.409
know we have rockets that might have the
capability of doing that the problem is

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:13.419
capability of doing that the problem is
 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:14.550
capability of doing that the problem is
how you would keep a crew of people

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560
how you would keep a crew of people
 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.490
how you would keep a crew of people
alive for the journey to Mars and then

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500
alive for the journey to Mars and then
 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.740
alive for the journey to Mars and then
also a life on the surface and get them

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750
also a life on the surface and get them
 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.170
also a life on the surface and get them
back that would be very expensive and

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180
back that would be very expensive and

because the astronauts would not be
protected from the radiation of space

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709
