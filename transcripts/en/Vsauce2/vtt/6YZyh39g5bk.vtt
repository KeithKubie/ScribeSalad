00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.490
The ScanPyramids Project will use thermal
imaging, drone-mounted scanners and radiographic

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.670
muons to create 3D models and hopefully figure
out exactly how the pyramids were built.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.500
And research from Ohio University attempting
to solve a dinosaur nose mystery - suggests

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.380
nasal passages were designed for airflow to
cool blood on the way to dino brains.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.380
Vsauce!

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.380
Kevin here.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.560
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.780
This acoustic hologram is tractor beam that
uses sound.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.000
Developed by researchers at the Universities
of Britol and Sussex in collaboration with

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.010
Ultrahaptics - it can lift and manipulate
objects in mid air.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.860
Acoustic levitation like that mentioned in
Mind Blow #50 had previously been hampered

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.899
by limited maneuverability but this new system
uses 64 miniature loudspeakers emiting high-frequency

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.860
sound with controllable output for manipulating
levitating objects.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.829
Potential uses include zero-gravity environments
for optimizing cell-growth, container-less

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.579
transportation to move parts in factories
and targeted drug delivery by manipulating

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.880
particles inside our bodies.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.850
The hurdles to clear for using this to move
people include the amount of power that would

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.220
require and not killing them.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.930
Scientists at Lehigh University are controlling
fruit flies' heart with lasers.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.799
Optogenetics was first developed to control
neurons with light and researchers are applying

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.499
it to cardiology in an attempt to create a
non-invasive pacemaker.

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:35.079
But bringing this to humans would require
a great deal of further research including

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.670
what type of light to use how to actually
deliver that light source.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.009
The vOICe sunglasses are designed to allow
blind people to see with sound.

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.429
The device translates video to sound with
vertical position being frequency, left-right

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.159
position to scan time and brightness to loudness.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.659
So for example, dark pixels at the bottom
of the video would be heard quietly and with

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.439
a low pitch while bright pixels at the top
of the video would sound high-pitched and

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.439
loud.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.380
The system requires sensory substitution training
and they hope to further develop it by studying

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:16.490
sensory integration in the brain.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.660
Prieto battery is a 3D porous lithium-ion
battery.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.950
In development for nearly five years, they
recently created the first successful 3D battery

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.170
that can be charged, discharged and hold a
charge and just announced a partnership with

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.240
Intel.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.880
Traditional batteries are two dimensional
which limits speed and direction of energy

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.870
which causes long charge times and fast discharge.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.860
A three dimensional architecture would increase
surface area, allow for multi-dimensional

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.420
movement and ultimately lead to fast charging
and longer battery life.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.350
Their goal is to have this available by 2018.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.290
Researchers at Okayama University have created
a tube-free pneumatic rubber actuator.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.450
The system has no moving parts - it uses electricity
during the gas generation stage to create

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.270
hydrogen and oxygen gas from water and reverses
the process during the gas absorption stage

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.560
to simply become water again.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.760
And this gas generator could be used to power
soft robots.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.060
The Gest controller looks to replace the keyboard
and mouse for augmented and virtual reality.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.910
There’s a race to develop intuitive ways
to interact with virtual worlds and the Gest

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.610
not only allows for natural gesture controls
but also typing.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.270
The first device kits plan to ship in 2016.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.890
Earlier this month, Sharp teased RoBoHoN - the
robot smartphone.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.320
It can walk, sit down, dance and features
voice and facial recognition.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.660
It’s pretty big and heavy for a smartphone
but it’s a robot friend in your pocket.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.750
So yeah.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.310
It’ll be on sale in Japan in 2016.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:01.450
Finally, Andy Thomas captured various bird
sounds and visualized them with particle effects.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:16.550
I’m gonna leave you with a tensegrity robot
climbing up a duct.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:48.199
And as always - thanks 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:05:06.800
for watching.
