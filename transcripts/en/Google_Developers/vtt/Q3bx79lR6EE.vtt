00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.550
Citizen A is a social
mobilizing platform

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.620
that helps citizens connect
to make changes in our city.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:21.590
I thought of this
idea because we

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.240
were having huge
riots here in Brazil.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.520
It was all over the
news in the world

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.790
that people were
complaining about the things

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.650
that the government didn't
do and just complaining

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.320
about the things and not
trying to solve them.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.490
All of the riots began
in social networks.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.730
So I thought, why not
build a social network

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.630
that people will
gather and do something

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.430
instead of just complaining?

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.000
So I had the support of
the City Hall from Rio.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.810
They asked to give ideas
to build a smarter city,

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.540
and I gave this
idea to do this app.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.129
And I won two prizes--
one for the idea,

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.930
and then I won a prize
for implementing the idea.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.070
So now I'm partnering
with the City Hall

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.107
to build this platform
in the slums, too.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.100
There are a lot of
people doing things,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.990
but they don't know they
are social entrepreneurs.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.400
So we want to build this notion
of social entrepreneurship,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.450
and we want to help
people do more.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.660
And there are a lot of
people doing things already,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.490
but they don't know
people that are

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.560
doing things similar
to what they're doing.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.200
So this is our
objective-- to show people

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.860
that there are people
similar to them,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.030
and maybe they can join
forces and do bigger things.
