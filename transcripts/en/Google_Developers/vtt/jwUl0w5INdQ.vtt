00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.560
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello and
welcome to Google I/O 2018.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.270
I'm Timothy Jordan,
your host and one

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.244
of your guides for all things
I/O over the next three days.

00:00:22.244 --> 00:00:24.660
We're so happy you're joining
us for our outdoor developer

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.166
festival here in Mountain
View, California.

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.040
We're getting ready for
the keynote to begin.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.440
Before we take our seats,
inside the amphitheater,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.690
I'd like to share a few
things we're doing differently

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.650
this year.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.830
Because millions of viewers
like you joined us remotely last

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.140
year, we've decided to create a
bigger show just for you every

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.490
day of I/O. Now this
means when you're tuned

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.330
in to google.com/io, you'll
essentially have an all-access

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.370
pass for the entire festival.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.390
You'll tour dozens
of Sandboxes with me

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.810
and your other guides
Todd, and Florina.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.670
You'll also take a
stroll down Main Street

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.586
to check out all the
cool installations there.

00:00:58.586 --> 00:01:01.080
Plus, you'll get special
access to interviews

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.810
with Googlers and I/O
guests and a front row

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.250
seat to the concert.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.190
This year, the French
electronic music duo, Justice,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.310
will take the stage on
Wednesday at 8:30 PM.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.240
All of this will be happening
right here on google.com/io.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.639
So keep this window open.

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:18.930
In just a few minutes, we'll
head into the amphitheater

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.140
where you'll join the on-site
attendees for our pre-show

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.270
and two awesome AI experiments.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.510
First, a music performance
using NSynth Super,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.460
which is a synthesizer
that generates new

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.460
sounds using neural
networks and World Draw,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.920
a new, interactive
experience we want all of you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.241
to take part in.

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:38.490
You'll join the rest of the
global developer community

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.250
to draw the world together
in real time using

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.220
the same technology behind
Quick, Draw and AutoDraw.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.660
But before we get
to that, here's

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.190
a rundown of today's show.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.570
Set your alarms now for 10:00
AM and 12:45 PM Pacific time.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.142
That's when our Google and
developer keynotes begin.

00:01:54.142 --> 00:01:55.350
You don't want to miss those.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.520
Now after each
keynote, we'll share

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.540
a recap of the announcements
with some special guests.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.460
In the breaks
between the sessions,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.650
we'll head to the Sandbox
for some hands on fun.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.630
I'll also be
sharing some stories

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.025
that will change
the way you look

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:09.150
at artificial intelligence.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.860
It's a very full day.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.140
We're just about 40 minutes
away from the keynote

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.400
and I can feel the
excitement growing.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.520
But before we go, I'd
like to give a quick shout

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.760
out to the 450 extended
viewing parties

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.110
joining us from
around the world.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.730
Welcome.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.200
It's great to have you all here.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.990
Remember to share photos of
your viewing party with us

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.010
on our Google+ I/O
extended community page.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.760
And let us know which
announcements excite

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.020
you the most this year and why.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.240
Please use hashtag #io18extended
with all your shares.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.710
For everyone else, join the
conversation at hashtag #io18.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.230

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.510
products throughout the year, be
sure to take 30 seconds to sign

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.310
up at g.co/dev/form.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.610
Now, let's join everybody in the
amphitheater for the pre-show.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.300
Remember, I'll be here right
after the keynote for a recap

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.960
and more I/O at Google I/O 2018.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.980
Enjoy the show.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.630
