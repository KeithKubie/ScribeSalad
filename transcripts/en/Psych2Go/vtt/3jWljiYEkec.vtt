00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.370
The four types of love: which one are you?

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.020
The idea of a soulmate is one found throughout all of popular culture.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.240
For example, the idea you could meet someone on a train and fall in love instantly.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.869
Let's remove those rose tinted glasses that romanticize love and take a look at soulmates in a more scientific light.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.989
Dr. Helen Fisher who is a research professor of anthropology has studied human love for years.

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.389
She's made groundbreaking discoveries about who people are as lovers and the love they seek as a result.

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:50.379
There are four love types that she discovered: the explorer, the builder, the director and the negotiator.

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.119
Explorers are dominant in dopamine, builders are dominant in serotonin,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.900
directors are dominant in testosterone and negotiators are dominant in estrogen. Based on our chemical makeup

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.879
it also shows in our personality, characteristics, habits and lifestyle preferences.

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.659
Explorers are often associated with words like adventure, spontaneity and fun.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.329
Because their chemical makeup is predominantly dopamine these people seek a playmate in their lover.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.560
They see life as one big great adventure and want someone to join them in it.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.939
They are highly impulsive and curious. High dopamine levels also influence explorer types to be motivated and goal-oriented

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.399
because they are linked to enthusiasm, energy,

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.979
focus and assertiveness.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.979
Explorers often tend to be attracted to other explorers.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.829
Well, that sounds easy enough. When two explorers come together and sparks ignite with two bold hearts on fire

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.559
if they don't learn what patience is down the road,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.810
it is common for the two explorers to get in a head-on collision. This can result in messy breakups.

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.719
Builders are often associated with words like family, honesty and loyalty.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.390
Because their chemical makeup is predominantly serotonin these people seek a helpful lover.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.800
Serotonin generates caution because it suppresses dopamine levels.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.499
Therefore, builders are relaxed, social, steady and family and community oriented.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.209
They are natural networkers and respect rules and authority in society. Builders are natural planners and like to schedule things ahead of time.

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.979
They have an eye for detail and are linear in the way they do things in a step-by-step fashion.

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.658
Builders are often attracted to other builders. These couples are often the highschool sweethearts you hear about who are still married 60 years later.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.989
Well, that sounds idealistic, that doesn't mean builders don't have their fair share of obstacles to overcome in their relationships.

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.109
For instance, because builders can be set in their rules,

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:50.049
schedules and traditions, two builders may bicker over what they perceive as the right way of doing things.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.649
It is important for builders to keep an open mind and learn the value of flexibility if they want their relationships to grow and evolve.

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:05.349
Directors are often associated with words like nerd, ambition and challenge. Because their chemical makeup is predominantly

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.369
testosterone these people seek a mind mate in their lovers.

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:14.469
Directors are straightforward, tough-minded and decisive. They value logic.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.579
Therefore, when making decisions they are not easily swayed by emotions.

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.518
Directors enjoy competition and are pragmatic,

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.388
focused and daring. They are also highly ambitious and can be so independent that they can come off as lone wolves.

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.279
Directors have excellent spatial skills and musical and athletic ability, too.

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:39.609
Directors rarely ever go for other directors. Instead, they go for their opposite mates, which is the negotiator.

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:46.599
This is because directors lack the verbal and people reading skills negotiators naturally possess that help attract them to one another.

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:52.508
Although the director and negotiator typically make a good pairing problems can still arise.

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:59.709
Directors, for instance, have workaholic tendencies and may neglect to spend quality time with negotiators and their family.

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.439
Negotiators are often associated with words like kindness, empathy and sensitivity.

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.108
Because their chemical makeup is predominantly estrogen they seek a soulmate in their lover.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.430
Negotiators are known to be the philosophers out of the love type group because their high estrogen level provides for web-thinking.

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.279
This helps them connect a vast array of ideas,

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:28.209
concepts and theories with one another as well as think naturally in an abstract manner and provides them with a vivid imagination.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.079
As a result, this makes them habitual daydreamers.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.920
Negotiators are highly intuitive individuals relying on their gut feelings often because they are natural feelers. However,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.069
negotiators can experience problems in their relationships when they dwell on casual comments and criticisms.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.720
They tend to take them personally and can cause them to hold grudges for months or even years.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.020
Negotiators are also susceptible to depression and can overdo it when they constantly feel lost.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.489
Always on the search for themselves, they can become overly self-absorbed,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.250
self-conscious and self-critical.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.670
Although these love types are more likely to be attracted to certain types of lovers over others the truth

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.600
is that any love match can work.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.050
So long as the two members are mature enough and willing to cooperate with one another and work with each other's differences.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.009
Despite the important research Dr. Helen Fisher conducted,

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:29.629
we still know only a speck about love. It is still such an enigmatic concept that cannot be fully explained even in the outmost

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.859
scientific way because after all, people often end up falling in love with those whom they least expect to end up with.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.919
Ultimately, in relationships it's about constantly choosing your partner over and over again and

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.580
kindness.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.680
If you find yourself in a disagreement with your partner pick up the phone or drive over to their place, swallow your pride and apologize.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.460
Ask yourself: is this really worth losing someone over? The sad reality is that things are always fleeting.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.639
But the things you do have control over make those moments count.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.579
