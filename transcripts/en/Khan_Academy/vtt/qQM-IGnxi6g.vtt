00:00:00.155 --> 00:00:01.927
- [Voiceover] A block
is initially at position

00:00:01.927 --> 00:00:03.270
x = zero,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.183
and in contact with an uncompressed spring

00:00:05.183 --> 00:00:06.798
of negligible mass.

00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:08.633
The block is pushed back
along a frictionless

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:10.929
surface from position x = zero

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.368
to x = -D, as shown above,

00:00:13.368 --> 00:00:15.237
compressing the spring by an amount

00:00:15.237 --> 00:00:17.768
delta x = D.

00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:21.402
So, the block starts here,
and it's just in contact

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:22.944
with the spring, so it's initially,

00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:24.583
the spring is uncompressed.

00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:26.383
And it's just touching the block.

00:00:26.383 --> 00:00:28.249
And then we start to compress the spring

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.158
by pushing the block to the left,

00:00:30.158 --> 00:00:32.537
and we compress it by an amount, D.

00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:35.479
They tell us that, right
there, delta x is = to D,

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:37.145
so we compress,

00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:40.699
we move this block back
over to the left by D,

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.276
that compresses the spring by D.

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:46.202
The block is then released at x = zero,

00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:47.952
the block enters a rough part of the track

00:00:47.952 --> 00:00:49.706
and eventually comes to rest at position

00:00:49.706 --> 00:00:51.183
x = 3D.

00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:52.440
So when we compress the spring,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.798
we're actually doing to
work to compress the spring,

00:00:54.798 --> 00:00:58.217
so that work, that energy
from the, or the work

00:00:58.217 --> 00:01:00.589
we're doing, gets stored
as potential energy

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.141
in the spring-block system.

00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:04.905
And then when we let go,
that potential energy is

00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:07.433
going to be converted to kinetic energy,

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.576
and that block is going to be accelerated

00:01:09.576 --> 00:01:11.763
all the way until we get back to x = zero,

00:01:11.763 --> 00:01:13.567
then the spring is back to uncompressed,

00:01:13.567 --> 00:01:15.324
so it's not gonna keep
pushing on the block

00:01:15.324 --> 00:01:16.664
after that point.

00:01:16.664 --> 00:01:18.870
And then the block's going
to have this kinetic energy

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.675
and if there was no friction
in this gray part here,

00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:23.116
it would just keep on going forever.

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:24.689
And if there's no air
resistance, and we're assuming

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.027
no air resistance for
this, for this problem,

00:01:28.027 --> 00:01:29.962
but since there is
friction, it's just going to

00:01:29.962 --> 00:01:32.880
decelerate it at a constant rate.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.529
You're going to have a
constant force of friction

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:39.602
being applied to this block.

00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:41.952
So, let's see, they say, they tell us

00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:43.983
that it's going to come to rest at x = 3D,

00:01:43.983 --> 00:01:45.915
the coefficient of kinetic
friction between the block

00:01:45.915 --> 00:01:47.961
and the rough track is mu.

00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:50.502
Alright, on the axes
below, sketch and label

00:01:50.502 --> 00:01:52.418
graphs of the following two quantities

00:01:52.418 --> 00:01:54.495
as a function of the position of the block

00:01:54.495 --> 00:01:57.675
between x = negative D and x = 3D.

00:01:57.675 --> 00:02:00.972
You do not need to calculate
values for the vertical axis

00:02:00.972 --> 00:02:02.577
but the same vertical scale should be used

00:02:02.577 --> 00:02:04.083
for both quantities.

00:02:04.083 --> 00:02:06.009
So they have the kinetic
energy of the block

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.246
and the potential energy
of the block-spring system.

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:13.506
So let's first focus on
the potential energy, U,

00:02:13.506 --> 00:02:15.185
because when we start
the first part of this,

00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:16.366
when we're compressing the spring,

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:18.757
that's when we're starting
to put potential energy

00:02:18.757 --> 00:02:20.848
into this spring-block system.

00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:22.845
So you have to think about
what is the potential energy

00:02:22.845 --> 00:02:25.492
of a compressed spring?

00:02:25.492 --> 00:02:27.830
Well, the potential energy

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.241
the potential energy

00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:33.986
is equal to one-half
times the spring constant

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:38.619
times how much you compress
the spring squared.

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.661
So if we wanna say delta x is how much you

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:43.980
compress the spring, that squared.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.332
Now, if what I just wrote is

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:47.493
completely unfamiliar to you,

00:02:47.493 --> 00:02:50.075
I encourage you to watch
the videos on Khan Academy,

00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:52.323
the potential energy of
a compressed spring or

00:02:52.323 --> 00:02:54.518
the work necessary to compress a spring,

00:02:54.518 --> 00:02:56.155
cause the work necessary
to compress the spring

00:02:56.155 --> 00:02:57.457
that's going to be the potential energy

00:02:57.457 --> 00:03:00.076
that you're essentially
putting into that system.

00:03:00.076 --> 00:03:04.326
And so, for this, as we
compress the spring to D,

00:03:04.326 --> 00:03:06.301
you are, you're going to end up with

00:03:06.301 --> 00:03:11.249
a potential energy of one-half
times the spring constant

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:14.352
x our change in x is D,

00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:15.656
our change in x is D.

00:03:15.656 --> 00:03:19.950
x D, x D squared.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.725
So let's plot that on
this right over here.

00:03:22.725 --> 00:03:23.503
So right,

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:24.641
whoops,

00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:28.149
right when we are at x = zero

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:30.504
there's no potential energy in our system,

00:03:30.504 --> 00:03:31.917
but then we start to compress it,

00:03:31.917 --> 00:03:33.798
and when we get to x = D,

00:03:33.798 --> 00:03:36.212
we're going to have a potential energy

00:03:36.212 --> 00:03:40.760
of one-half times the spring
constant times D squared.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.231
So let's just say this, right over here,

00:03:43.231 --> 00:03:45.225
let's say that over there,

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.816
actually let me do a,

00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:48.451
let's see that one is,

00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:49.529
actually I'll do it over here so

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.141
it'll be useful for me later on.

00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:55.336
So, let's say that this,
right over here, is one-half

00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:59.585
times our spring constant times D squared.

00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:01.942
So this is what our potential
energy's going to be like

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:04.276
once we've compressed the spring by D.

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:06.516
And it's not going to be a

00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:10.289
linear relationship,
remember the potential energy

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:12.537
potential energy is
equal to one-half times

00:04:12.537 --> 00:04:14.552
the spring constant,

00:04:14.552 --> 00:04:17.834
times the spring constant,
times how much you've

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:20.572
compressed the spring squared.

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:23.780
So, the potential energy
increases as a sqaure

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.938
of how much we've compressed the spring.

00:04:25.938 --> 00:04:26.996
So when we've compressed the spring

00:04:26.996 --> 00:04:28.681
half as much, we're going
to have one-fourth of

00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:30.643
the potential energy.

00:04:30.643 --> 00:04:32.550
So it's going to look
like this, it's gonna be

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.008
you can view it as the
left side of a parabola.

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:38.678
So it's going to, going to look something,

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:41.118
something like this.

00:04:41.118 --> 00:04:43.399
So that's the potential energy.

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.957
Now, when you're in this
point, when the thing is

00:04:45.957 --> 00:04:49.621
fully compressed, and then
you let go, what happens?

00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:53.307
Well that potential energy is
turned into kinetic energy,

00:04:53.307 --> 00:04:57.214
so as the spring, as the
spring accelerates the block,

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:59.291
you're gonna go down this
potential energy curve,

00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:01.259
as you go to the right, but then, it gets

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.800
converted to kinetic energy.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.136
So the potential energy
plus the kinetic energy

00:05:05.136 --> 00:05:08.006
needs to be constant, at
least over this period from

00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:10.943
x = negative D to x = zero.

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:14.285
So the kinetic energy starts off at zero,

00:05:14.285 --> 00:05:15.328
it's stationary,

00:05:15.328 --> 00:05:18.968
but then, it starts, the block
starts getting accelerated.

00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:20.095
It starts getting accelerated.

00:05:20.095 --> 00:05:23.708
And the sum, the sum of these two things

00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:27.069
needs to be equal to one-half
times our spring constant

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.811
times D squared.

00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:30.643
And so you can see if you,

00:05:30.643 --> 00:05:32.543
if you were to add these two curves

00:05:32.543 --> 00:05:35.240
at any position, you are going, their sum

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.450
is going to sum up to this value.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.556
And so right when you
get back to x = zero,

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:43.915
all of that potential energy
has been converted into

00:05:43.915 --> 00:05:45.376
kinetic energy.

00:05:45.376 --> 00:05:47.959
And then that kinetic
energy, we would stay at that

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:50.225
high kinetic energy if
there was no friction

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:51.560
or no air resistance.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.002
But we know that the
block comes to a rest at

00:05:54.002 --> 00:05:57.191
x is = to 3D.

00:05:57.191 --> 00:05:59.280
So all the kinetic energy
is gone at that point,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.370
and you might say well, what's
that getting converted into?

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.215
Well, it's gonna get
converted into, into heat,

00:06:04.215 --> 00:06:05.496
due to the friction.

00:06:05.496 --> 00:06:07.357
So that's where, ya know, energy cannot be

00:06:07.357 --> 00:06:09.943
cannot be created out of thin
air or lost into thin air,

00:06:09.943 --> 00:06:12.609
it's converted from one form to another.

00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:13.693
And so the question is,

00:06:13.693 --> 00:06:15.012
what type of a curve is this?

00:06:15.012 --> 00:06:16.826
Do we just connect these with a line?

00:06:16.826 --> 00:06:18.696
Or is it some type of a curve?

00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:20.060
And the key realization is:

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.584
is that you have a
constant force of friction

00:06:22.584 --> 00:06:25.742
the entire time that the
block is being slowed down,

00:06:25.742 --> 00:06:27.360
the coefficient of
friction doesn't change,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.960
so the force of friction,
and the mass of the block

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.015
isn't changing, so the force of friction's

00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:32.319
going to be the same.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.830
And it's acting against
the motion of the block.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.927
So you can, you can view
the friction as essentially

00:06:36.927 --> 00:06:38.764
doing this negative work,

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:40.971
and so it's sapping the energy away,

00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:42.642
if you think about it
relative to distance,

00:06:42.642 --> 00:06:44.930
in a given amount of
distance, it's sapping away

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.897
the same amount of energy, it's doing that

00:06:46.897 --> 00:06:50.319
same amount of negative work.

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.128
And so, this is going to
decrease at a linear rate.

00:06:54.128 --> 00:06:56.336
So, let me draw that.

00:06:56.336 --> 00:07:00.040
So it's gonna be a linear decrease,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.154
just like that.

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:02.799
And the key thing to remind yourself is:

00:07:02.799 --> 00:07:06.740
is this is a plot of
energy versus position,

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.000
not velocity versus position
or velocity versus time,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.977
or energy versus time.

00:07:11.977 --> 00:07:15.195
This is energy versus position,
and that's what gives us

00:07:15.195 --> 00:07:19.170
this linear relationship right over here.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.467
So, we have the kinetic
energy, k, of the block.

00:07:23.467 --> 00:07:24.766
That's what I did in magenta,

00:07:24.766 --> 00:07:27.248
so this is the kinetic energy.

00:07:27.248 --> 00:07:29.403
Kinetic,

00:07:29.403 --> 00:07:32.598
kinetic energy,

00:07:32.598 --> 00:07:35.184
and in blue, just to make
sure I label it right,

00:07:35.184 --> 00:07:37.740
this is the potential energy,

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.133
potential,

00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:45.026
potential energy.
