00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
On your quest to find a soulmate, it's expected that you would cringe at the idea of finding beauty in the beast.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.220
But we were all for Belle falling in love with a water buffalo. So what are the issues with bestiality, anyways?

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.580
What would actually happen if you had sex with an animal?

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.360
Before you start flirting with huskies on the street,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.300
Biological mechanisms are in place to prevent sex between different species.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.540
If two different species sperm and egg can't even fuse, this is called a prezygotic mechanism.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.100
Examples are if two species have incompatible sex organs that won't fit,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:42.300
Two species live in such different locations that they can never bang, or they have different mating rituals, so are never even interested in trying.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.320
Even if two different species end up managing to have sex,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.140
It's unlikely the sperm and egg would produce an offspring.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.700
In the case of bestiality with you and a closely related species like a baboon -

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.600
One study showed that human sperm couldn't attached to the protein surface of the eggs of the baboons.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.660
Therefore there would be no fusing and the first phase of fertilization could never be completed.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.620
No part baboon, part human babies will ever roam this planet.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.900
But in some cases, a successful offspring can be produced by different species.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.800
For example, male lions and female tigers can produce a liger. This is where post postzygotic mechanisms come into play.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.760
These are mechanisms that prevent the survival of an interbred offspring.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.239
For instance, when you cross a horse and a donkey, you likely end up with a sterile mule.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.560
So the mule, exists but can't have babies itself.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.960
Other postzygotic mechanisms include hybrid inviability, when a successfully fertilized egg doesn't develop past early stages.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.400
Or hybrid breakdown, where the offspring itself can have kids but generations after are sterile and incapable of producing children.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:57.900
All in all, prezygotic and postzygotic mechanisms ensure that if different species do have sex, it's hard for them to successfully reproduce.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.120
But sometimes animals labelled as different species can still mate because they share a relatively recent ancestor.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.340
Like when us, Homo sapiens, mated with Neanderthals.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.360
The hypothesis is that female humans breeding with male Neanderthals were able to generate fertile offspring,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.200
But female Neanderthals who mated with male humans were either rare, absent, or infertile.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.780
There are many conflicting theories about why and how we hooked up with Neanderthals -

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.820
But one reason may have to do with the fact that they are kind of fine.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.820
Being a human who engages in bestiality comes with dangers.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.200
One study shows that males who had sex with animals were at a higher risk for penile cancer than males who didn't.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.460
This is probably because micro traumas on the penile tissue are produced during sex.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.800
This exposes the human tissue to animal secretions and other infectious agents that can lead to cancer.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:59.440
Several other case studies show colorectal trauma and harmful bacterial infections are also possible after sex with an animal.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.120
So, why do people do it? One study identifies several motivations for bestiality.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.080
For instance, there are maybe situational reasons where people have limited access to human partners,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.560
Or financial incentives where people have sex with animals for pornography or sex shows.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.260
There may also be cognitive impairment, emotional immaturity, and dopamine dysregulation motivating the act as well.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.380
And there are some reported cases of zoophiles who feel affection and intimacy with an animal.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.300
With one case study showing a man who left his wife in order to live with horses he had affection for.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.120
So it turns out Belle wasn't the only one who fell in love with a beast.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.250
Clearly, this video was not sponsored, and at this moment in time, it's probably demonetized as well.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.240
So we're gonna take this time to tell you about our new podcast Sidenote, which we love.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:56.460
Every week we take on controversial topics like this one and then we slice in the science information so that you are entertained while simultaneously learning.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.120
You might not know this but surprisingly Mitch and I disagree on a lot of things and that comes out in this podcast pretty evidently.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.680
So make sure you subscribe to it wherever you can - it's called Sidenote.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.680
And we'll see you next week for a new science video.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.680
Mitch: See ya. Greg: Peace.
