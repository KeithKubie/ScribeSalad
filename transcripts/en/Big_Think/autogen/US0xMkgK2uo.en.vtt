them into a distributed ledger because
 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.830
them into a distributed ledger because
again the whole point of a distributed

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840
again the whole point of a distributed
 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.500

somewhat like a Bitcoin wallet right

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400
somewhat like a Bitcoin wallet right
 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.340
somewhat like a Bitcoin wallet right
where you know you have these assets and

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350
where you know you have these assets and
 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.650
where you know you have these assets and
you can decide to share these records

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660
you can decide to share these records
 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.990
you can decide to share these records
with you receive them from one doctor

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000
with you receive them from one doctor
 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.250
with you receive them from one doctor
you could decide to share them with

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260
you could decide to share them with
 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.130
you could decide to share them with
another doctor you could I would if you

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140
another doctor you could I would if you
 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.570
another doctor you could I would if you
moved and you had to change doctors

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580
moved and you had to change doctors
 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.250
moved and you had to change doctors
change health care providers you could

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260
change health care providers you could
 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.990
change health care providers you could
bring that data with you and what would

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000
bring that data with you and what would
 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.300
bring that data with you and what would
be tracked on ledger is a pointer to

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310
be tracked on ledger is a pointer to
 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.940
be tracked on ledger is a pointer to
your wallet and a signature for each of

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950
your wallet and a signature for each of
 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.770
your wallet and a signature for each of
the records you have that attests to the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780
the records you have that attests to the
 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.440
the records you have that attests to the
actual data right so if I get a

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450
actual data right so if I get a
 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.780
actual data right so if I get a
I can't change you know that entry from

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790
I can't change you know that entry from
 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.790
I can't change you know that entry from
ten pills to a hundred pills right

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800
ten pills to a hundred pills right
 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.530
ten pills to a hundred pills right
because that would change the signature

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540
because that would change the signature
 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.970
because that would change the signature
and the signature is what would be

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980
and the signature is what would be
 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.260
and the signature is what would be
recorded in the change in the ledger

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270
recorded in the change in the ledger
 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.750
recorded in the change in the ledger
right so all of these kinds of questions

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760
right so all of these kinds of questions
 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.310
right so all of these kinds of questions
about trust and provenance and discovery

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320
about trust and provenance and discovery
 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.620
about trust and provenance and discovery
right understanding where is all my data
