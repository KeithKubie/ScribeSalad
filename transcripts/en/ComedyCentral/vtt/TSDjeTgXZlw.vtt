00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:02.369
Hello.
I'm Hillary Anne Matthews,

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:06.907
and today, we're going
to talk about Joan of Arc.

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:09.510
 Our story begins in France,

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.145
 in the year 1412.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.616
 The Hundred Years' War
 is raging in Europe

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.451
 in between France and England.

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:20.287
 So Joan of Arc
 was a peasant girl.

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:23.257
 She's 13 years old,
 she's in a field,

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:26.093
 but then, all of a sudden,
 she hears voices.

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:27.761
 We have a mission for you.

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.230
 And she was like...
 [squeaking] What?

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.598
 [normally]
 Who even are you guys?

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.967
 And they were like,
 I'm St. Michael,

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.502
 I'm St. Margaret,

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.937
 and I'm St. Catherine,

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:38.272
 and they're like,

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:40.741
 all we want is
 for you to go to church

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.243
 and just, like, be cool
 and chill and obedient.

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.745
 She's like, that's it?

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:46.847
 And they're like,
 yeah, that's it.

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:49.917
 The King of France
 was King Charles VI.

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:52.653
 People around him get him
 to sign a peace treaty

00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:54.955
 that will end
 the Hundred Years' War.

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:57.991
 He has a son,
 also named Charles--

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.493
 Charles of Valois--

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:01.862
 also called "the Dauphin."

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:04.331
 So when his father

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:06.700
 signed this peace treaty,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.002
 it was disinheriting him
 from the throne.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.437
 [dramatic music]

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:11.538
Gosh darn it!

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:12.739
- It's just one little drop.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.574
- It's been happening
this whole time.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.643
- [chuckles]

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:19.146
- Okay. So, Joan is now
a 16-year-old girl in a 16--

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:21.782
[fly buzzes]

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:23.984
In a 16-year-old world

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:26.887
 and these voices,
 they're like,

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:29.423
 hey, girl, you need
 to lead France to victory

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:33.961
 and get Charles Valois crowned

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:36.663
 as the rightful
 King of France,

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:41.134
 and she was like, ha!
 You guys!

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:45.105
 That's not what you told me
 the first time, you guys.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.207
 They're like, you need to go
 to this lord gentleman

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.642
 named Baudricourt.

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:50.911
 He's gonna help you
 get Charles crowned.

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:52.879
 Then she runs away from home

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.148
 to Lord Baudricourt.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:59.052
 She arrives, and Joan's like,
 hello, I am Joan,

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.188
 and I am here because

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:02.956
 v--saints talked to me
 in my head

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:06.226
 and it is God's will
 to have Charles of Valois

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:09.229
 crowned the rightful
 King of France.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.264
 Lord Baudricourt
 is straight-up like,

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:14.234
 [spoken as teenage girl]
 Get this crazy girl

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.136
 back to her home,

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.904
 but like then,
 what happens is that

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:19.973
 she gets, kind of like,
 a following.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.942
 People have heard
 about Joan of Arc,

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:23.510
 and they are on board.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.946
 Lord Baudricourt is like,

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:28.882
 okay, well, actually,
 we can work with this,

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:30.684
 and Joan's like,

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:32.519
 cut off my hair
 and dress me in men's clothes

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.689
 so I don't get raped,
 and he's like, okay.

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:36.923
 Because it was
 really dangerous

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.558
 'cause she's a woman.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:40.894
Ugh. God, the Middle Ages.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.629
I'm glad we're not in them.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:43.930
- Amen.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.565
- Too harsh to women,

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:49.069
and the breath was bad.
- [chuckles]

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.939
 - So they arrive at Chinon,
 and Charles of Valois is like,

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.509
 um, wait, who's here?

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.444
 And they're like,
 a 16-year-old girl

00:02:57.444 --> 00:02:59.680
 who hears the voices
 of saints,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.782
 and he's like,
 okay, you know what?

00:03:01.782 --> 00:03:03.183
 Here's what I'm gonna do.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:06.219
 I'm gonna put on
 this big goofy mustache

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.754
 and this big floppy hat

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:09.890
 and I'm gonna trick her

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.858
 and I'm gonna see
 if she knows what's up.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.360
 And so, he's just, like,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.395
 [goofy voice]
 I'm just a courtier,

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.031
 I'm just
 a regular old courtier,

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.299
 and she walks in,
 and she's like...

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.369
 [sighs]
 You're Charles of Valois.

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.204
 You are my rightful king.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.839
 He's like, wow.

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.675
[claps slowly]

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:29.676
- Slow clap.

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.711
- He slow claps her.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.413
Can you believe
that he slow claps her?

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:34.614
- The first slow clap.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.183
- Yeah, it was
the first slow clap.

00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:38.418
 And so, he's like,
 great!

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:40.787
 Because we want
 the same thing,

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:42.823
 which is for me
 to be King of France.

00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:44.825
 So Joan was like,

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.761
 okay, dude,
 give me an army.

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:50.497
 I want that army.
 Ooh, give me that army!

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:53.467
 And he's like,
 okay, guess what?

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:54.701
 Army bestowed.

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:56.369
 [triumphant music]

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:59.673
 She sets out with this army
 to Orleans.

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:01.441
 So they get there

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:03.376
 and they were like,
 okay, here's what's up.

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:04.778
 We have to strategize.

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:06.646
 We have to think
 about this logically.

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:08.315
 We have to make plans,
 and Joan was like,

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:10.183
 Guess the [bleep] what?

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:12.719
 No!

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.856
 We got to just go for it,
 you guys!

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:19.626
 Only 'cause God
 wants us to do it.

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:20.927
 and they're like,
 oh, my gosh, God?

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.162
 Yeah, he's the tops.

00:04:22.162 --> 00:04:23.663
 We are going to just

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:25.532
 freaking... Ugh.

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:27.834
 I hate it when
 people say "freaking."

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:28.902
 - Then say it differently.

00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:30.337
- So then they just [bleep]

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:31.805
go for it

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:34.174
and they are like,
attacking and attacking,

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:36.109
 and attacking the English,

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.944
 and Joan is in
 the thick of it,

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.447
 and she is not shying away,

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:42.315
 and then thwup!

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:45.085
 She gets hit in the shoulder
 with an arrow.

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:49.422
 But here's what's amazing:
 the English surrender,

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:52.359
 and they're like, fine!
 White handkerchief.

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:54.127
 White handkerchief.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:56.263
 - You do "handkercheef"
 instead of "handkerchif."

00:04:56.263 --> 00:04:58.265
 - Yes. Handkercheef.
 - Hm.

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.634
- Handkerchief. Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.302
 - And everyone's like,
 we did it!

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.037
 And we did it
 because Joan of Arc

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:06.106
 led us to this point!

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:07.607
 [triumphant music]

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:09.309
 Charles of Valois,
 the Dauphin,

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.578
 is crowned King of France

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:13.880
 and everyone's like, yay.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.216
[quietly clapping]

00:05:16.216 --> 00:05:17.617
- [laughs]

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:20.620
- Then, Charles of Valois
is like,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.190
 now I want you to go to Paris
 and take Paris.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.891
 She's like, cool, I'll do it!

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:26.226
So Joan goes to Paris

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:29.329
 and she shoots
 a bunch of arrows

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.299
 Waa! [makes popping noise]
 Waa! [makes popping noise]

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:34.334
 But in the midst
 of this battle,

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:37.170
 Joan is captured,
 and they're like,

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.340
 we got you!
 Ooh, did we ever get you!

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.576
 You are marins wen's clo--

00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:46.913
 You are wearing men's clothes,
 and now, girlfriend,

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:49.850
 that means you got
 to be burned at the stake,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.452
 and she's like,

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:54.254
 [bleep].

00:05:54.254 --> 00:06:00.493
 Joan of Arc, 19 years old,
 is put onto a wooden stake,

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:02.529
and then, um,
they light it on fire.

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.231
Phew!

00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:06.233
 And then she starts
 calling out for her saints,

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:08.034
 and she's like,
 St. Michael,

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.804
 the big kahuna of saints,
 St. Michael!

00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:12.939
 St. Margaret!

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.341
 Okay, St. Catherine!

00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:15.809
 St. Catherine,
 St. Margaret,

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:17.344
 St. Catherine,
 St. Michael, St. Margaret,

00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:19.346
 St. Catherine!

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:22.682
 It's like, cricket,
 cricket, cricket,

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:25.952
 and everybody's just watching
 this 19-year-old woman

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:28.388
 just get burnt alive
 at the stake.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:33.059
 So then Joan--she dies.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:36.296
The end.

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:39.633
Is it redundant
to believe in your own beliefs?

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:42.135
I don't care,
and neither did Joan.

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:44.104
Here's the thing
about 17-year-olds.

00:06:44.104 --> 00:06:45.872
At that time:

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:48.575
standing in a field,
blinking.

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:49.876
At this time:

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:52.979
 looking at Instagram,
 blinking.

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.581
Joan of Arc:

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:57.150
 leading an army!

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.918
 - [chuckles]

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:02.088
- I'm not saying
you need to aspire to more,

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:04.591
but, like,
maybe aspire to more.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:06.159
Like, maybe lead an army
or two

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:06.860
or one or two.
