00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.163
- [Instructor] How has the debate

00:00:01.163 --> 00:00:03.910
over Reagan's policies evolved into today?

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.100
- When Reagan was making the case for,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.070
basically, they called
it the Reagan revolution,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.430
because it was a real departure

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.060
from the way the federal
government had been

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.640
existing in American life.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.280
The debate had mostly
been between Democrats

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.400
and Republicans over to how
best manage the government.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.490
Ronald Reagan came in and said no.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.700
Just get government out
of the conversation.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.820
That has continued to
bounce along in politics,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.930
there was the most major
fight on those lines

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.440
with Newt Gingrich and
president Bill Clinton.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.030
Since then, there have been pockets of it,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.970
but the appetite for deficit reduction,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.150
for shrinking government
in order to make sure

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.100
that the bills are paid by government,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.960
has kind of gone out
of favor in Washington.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.580
It was a very big deal during the '90s and

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.690
during the first 10 years of this century,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.990
but it has not really been as much a part

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.760
of the conversation in
politics as it once was.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.030
It once dominated the way
people talked about government.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.300
Now there are other things that are taking

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.613
the conversation away.
