Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience now, how often do you practice? Do you practices outside of hypnosis? Is there like some things you concentrate on or meditate on? Yeah, so I do my best to just, it's kind, Kinda like, the weird thing about me is fighting is something that is just kind of happened by accident, but it's caused me to search for so much peace, like inner peace because of everything that I go through emotionally being a fighter. So going from this, I know Shab told you about it, but going from this kid who was just like super overweight my whole life, never fit in with anybody, I was always just like this introverted, Gothic, weird kid that nobody, you know, nobody ever talked to, didn't ever even want it to fight. Oh, I've always been non confrontational. But somewhere in the journey of becoming a fighter, I was like, ah, this is cool, but I need to find more peace because this is like, it's bringing up way too much, just like just way too much. My, of my anger kind of like, you know, from everything that I held onto. So, uh, practice meditation, a lot of meditation. I read a lot of different, I'll study different religions, whatever, wherever on that. Um, all just to find peace. Peaceman how confrontational guy wind up being an elite cage fighter. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:27          stop and think about what, I know what, yeah. It's, that's a very strong, I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it. Yeah. But I think that, um, internally there's just a lot of, there's a lot of expression. I, for me, it's a, it is a big expression man. It's an expression of just my, my danger, my ferociousness this, the, the, the, the, the part of myself that I've always held back. You know, it's like I have to hold back. Um, I'm a big guy, you know, like I, if I get angry, I'm afraid I can, you know, break something and you're like, you know what, it's like, it's crazy. So fighting for me, like when I train after training, I'm super peaceful. Right after I fight, I feel like I've grown. I feel like this guy is trying to hurt me. All these things like it's, it's, it's just a place where we both agree like, Hey, I'll give you my strength versus your strength or whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Whatever powers that strength is, what will we meet in the middle? And so it helps me balance, man. It does. Yeah. Because when I'm not fighting, I'm so relaxed. It's crazy. It makes sense. And I think that something that could aid a lot of men. I think just at least training, just a speck. I think there's something particularly soothing about hitting a heavy bag. There's something particular like when you're done, man, you feel so good when you're done hitting pads. We've done sparring. You feel so just peaceful. Yeah. You got it all out. You don't have anything left in here now. I thought a lot of men carry a lot of extra bullshit. Yeah, man. Well that dash tray extra for no reason you to let it out. Let it out. Yeah. Some guys will build it up in the gym. Right. And they're super huge and it's like, I, you gotta let it out. But then gaining and swing those arms.

Speaker 1:          03:10          Yeah. You'd see less of that now. It was too, it seems like, but yeah, it just, it would be nice if, I really think they should teach kids how to fight at a very early age. That'd be cool. I think it's the opposite. It would have the opposite effect. I think people would fight less. I think if you taught kids how to fight, they would just train and spar and they would get it all out of their system there and they'd probably fight a lot less. It's in, it's kind of like in our nature, right? Like everybody, everybody's got curiosity. Like, I wonder what it's like. Yeah. The, the closest they have tutors, the wrestling team. You can join the wrestling team and they will teach you a very important part of fighting. But other than that, like they're not going to teach you how to fight, but for wrestling, he's kind of like, now at least it's kind of a loophole.

Speaker 1:          03:52          Like they don't teach boxing in high school, but they'll teach you how to wrestle and that they're pretty crazy, man. Hey, wrestling's get rough. Or it seems like, fuck yeah, yeah, yeah. Will the high school kids are savages. I remember being a high school kid in a high school wrestling room. It was awful. And those kids were trying to kill each other and they work at the hardest to, yeah, run it with plates over their head and all that stuff. And football teams just lifting weights and run in practice. Those guys are doing ridiculous shit. Slaven everybody seen that movie vision quest, right? You saw, I've never seen it. Never saw it. I've never seen it. Dude, it's Matthew Modine and Matthew Modine plays this badass wrestler and he's going up against this dude who's this other badass wrestler and he comes to visit the guy while he got his training and this dude's got a log on his back and he's walking up stadium stairs and they had the, he says, you think you make the weight? Cause he Matthew Modine's character, she had to cut weight. And he goes, I hope so. He goes, hope so too. He keeps walking up the stairs like a kid. When did this come out? Long time ago, man. Back when Madonna was young. Oh that's the restaurant. So He's walking up the stadium stairs, carrying a fucking log on to great movie, man. Every wrestler that I knew when I was in high school, everyone worship this movie. What year did the shit come out?

Speaker 1:          05:10          It's probably like 85 or something like the cover for it. Is it 85 Bam. I nailed it son. Is that the cover for it? Yes. Look at that. I didn't even look like you have anything to do with a wrestler. I'd definitely would not click that on Netflix thinking and I was around restaurant movie at all. She was hot as the Sun to fun times. But yeah, that was like the quintessential wrestling movie because he just was dedicated. And then there was this friend who lied about being native American. Is that what that is? I'm gonna say what's that vest he's got going on. Just wanted to be different. Stand out. But it was a, it's a fun movie, man. It's a fun movie. I have to get into that for sure. Yeah. Not a whole lot of movies about wrestling. That's the least glamorous, but probably toughest sport for high school kids to get into.

Speaker 1:          05:50          Definitely. You know, that's, I stayed away from him, you know, I tried out for, I tried out for volleyball in high school, actually made the team, but my grades were terrible so I never got to play. But I was like heavyset dude. And I tried out. I made it. I think it was just kind of like a joke though. I think the coaches were just messing with me and my friends too. When did you get involved in martial arts? Uh, when I was 20, so 2010. So really quick, right after high school I started, um, I started traveling. So I used to play in a band. I used to play a mini bands and willing guitar. I play guitar, I play drums, I play keyboard, a little bit of everything. Every Christmas my mom would just know that, just give me a new instrument and I'd lock myself in my room and teach myself how to play.

Speaker 1:          06:36          And that's just always how like music was my first love, my first love. So I taught yourself. Yeah, I just put on headphones and I would just match the sounds and then keep restarting the songs over and over again. And then if it were like a keyboard song, I'd play it like just on the CD player and you know, as it evolved and for some reason I can just, I can match tunes with whatever instrument it may be. You've always been able to do that since kid. Wow. Yeah. So no formal training. Nothing. That's crazy. I've tried to take, I've tried to take guitar lessons before, um, but it didn't work for me and my mom was just wasting her money like I was learning, but it was Kinda like school for me. Like I had a teacher, he saw me, okay, this cord, this cord.

Speaker 1:          07:23          And I was like, Eh, like just let me feel it. Like I gotta I gotta feel it. You know, like I can hear it, I can, I can feel it, I'll get it. And so I stopped going. How many people do it like, like that? I'm not sure. I know there's a lot of people that can just kind of play by ear, but so I'll like, I just love instruments so I'll pick anything up and just start playing it and ended up teaching myself how to play drums, bass guitar keyboard. I played the standup Bass in uh, in middle school. Um, I've got like a little home production, like beats studio at home, all that stuff. So after high school I started touring and uh, that's when like I started getting my heaviest. We were eating fast food every single day, three times a day, never drank water, soda, only smoking like a pack and a half of cigarettes a day.

Speaker 1:          08:09          And just on the road traveling. And then, uh, by 19, I got up to 305 pounds, 19 years old. And I remember one night laying down to go to bed and I just felt my heart pumping bridezilla Leslie and I was just like, no way. This is like, I think I'm going to die. And like I woke up in a panic and weird thing is I got up and I went outside for maybe like 10 minutes and I smoked another cigarette and I was just like, this is the problem. Like I'm coughing up stuff my hardest gonna give out and I'm only 19 years old, you know? So around that same week is when I discovered MMA with my brother, just like watching ultimate fighter on TV. And so, uh, I went on my last tour and, uh, I told the guys like, Hey, I'm going to go train MMA.

Speaker 1:          08:57          And they're like, oh, you're going to be a fighter, like you think, you know? And I was just like, I don't know what I'm going to be, but I'm going to go train and get healthy. And they're like, okay, cool. We'll see you in a couple of months, you know what I mean? Like, no one really believed that I was going to go and actually train and fight. I told you, I said, well, he's been looks as big, quiet nonconfrontational guy. So, um, yeah, I went and took my first class Moitai and March 1st, 2010 took my first Muay Thai class and then after like a month of doing Muay Thai, I started to see progression. I started to see like my face was slimming down all this stuff. So it gave me motivation to keep going. And then, um, I remember going to a MMA event amateur, and I saw really big heavyweight guys going at it.

Speaker 1:          09:39          So I was like, ah, I think I want to do it. I want to give it a try. And, uh, so my coach was like, okay, if you lose 100 pounds, I'll like, I'll find you a fight. And I was like, a hundred pounds. He's like, yeah, I'll find you a fight if you lose a hundred pounds. So, um, I just kept training within 11 months, lost 100 pounds, and then took my first fight. And then she been like, every fight has been until now because it's like now I have like more of a drive and a passion for it, but all the way up until then, everything kind of happened. By coincidence or just like, I just, I didn't really want to fight, but I had a lot of people like, oh, you're so good. Like keep doing it. And I was the first time in my life I've ever had people supporting me to like really do something that was big and I was a new guy and I was in shape and I can, you know, girls are noticing me now.

Speaker 1:          10:28          I'm like all either, my whole life changed within a year of training MMA. Like wow. From going to this guy that nobody even paid attention to, to just like, oh, hey, how's it going? Are you know, like, oh, you're so in shape. And I was just like, oh, this is weird. It's still weird. It's only been nine years, eight years, you know? So everything is still very new to me. I've only, my first day stepping on the mat was like, you know, nine years ago did. That's an amazing story. It's crazy. That's like a legit success story. Yeah. It's, you know, is, is that you look at a ridiculous ringtone. Do you have sir? Is that, so I thought I turned it off. What is that? It's just like stock iPhone. I wasn't though. You ventured into the options. Yeah. Went down in there. Yes, sir. Um, so yeah, that's like, that's kind of how everything started. And then with three, five, three or four fights, and then I tried out for the ultimate fighter, so I had like three or four fights in one year being a pro and a, and then the ultimate fighter trials came out and I like tried out for that and like made it on and I was like, Oh shit. So most of my career has been in the UFC. Wow. Yeah.
