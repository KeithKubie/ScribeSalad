00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.390
Welcome back.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.165
We're on problem number 7.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.110
If a and b are positive
integers, and a squared minus

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.575
b squared is equal to 7,
what is the value of a?

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.060
So there's a couple of ways that
I would think about this.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.470
You could say-- well, this
is actually the way I

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.450
would think about it.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.700
Whenever I see something squared
minus something, I

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.510
immediately just want to factor
it, and we'll see where

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.910
that gets us.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.370
You get that a plus b times
a minus b is equal to 7.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.280
And we know that a and b
are positive integers.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.470
Well, we know this is going to
be a positive integer, right?

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.870
You add two positive integers,
you definitely

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.340
get a positive integer.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.610
And then we also know that
this is going to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.080
be a positive integer.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.180
How do I know that?

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.200
Well, when I multiply a
positive integer times

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.310
something and I get another
positive integer or I get

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.430
another positive number,
I know that whatever I

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.110
multiplied by is positive,
right?

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.370
Because a positive times
a positive is positive.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.120
So what does this say?

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.080
So these are both positive
integers, and when I multiply

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.250
them, I get 7.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.740
So what could they be?

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.260
Well, what numbers when you
multiply it can be 7?

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.230
Well, there's only
two choices.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.230
1 times 7 because 7 is prime.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.750
7 has no other factors
other than 1 and 7.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.080
So which one's going to be 7 and
which one's going to be 1?

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.730
Well, the larger one's
going to be 7.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.230
And the smaller one's
going to be 1.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.300
So you could eyeball this.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.950
You could say, well, what two
numbers when I add them

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.130
together is 7 and when I
subtract them, I get 1?

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.145
And you can say, well, what
if a is 4 and b is 3?

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.620
And that works.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.380
4 plus 3 is 7.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.220
4 minus 3 is 1.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.480
And if that didn't just dawn
on you all of a sudden, you

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.490
could do a system
of equations.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.290
a plus b is equal to 7.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.690
a minus b is equal to 1.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.740
Add these two equations.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.550
You get 2a.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.370
The b's cancel out.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.510
Plus 0 is equal to 8.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.940
7 plus 1 is 8.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.360
a is equal to 4.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.100
Then you can substitute back
in or just play around with

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.150
the numbers, and you get
b is equal to 3.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.530
So that is choice-- oh, they
want to just know what a is.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.010
So a is 4, which is choice B.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.580
Next problem.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.986
You have a number line here.

00:02:42.986 --> 00:02:44.700
Let me draw it nice and big.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.940
I don't know how much
space I'll need.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.560
Have 0 in the middle.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.890
Negative 1, 1.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:13.820
Let me draw these points
now: t, u, v, and w.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.085
And then you have
x and y here.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.080
And then you have z.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.360
On the number line above,
which of the following

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.130
corresponds to the absolute
value of u minus v?

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.860
And this is just an
approximation problem.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.500
You might get intimidated, like,
how do I figure out u?

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.440
How do I figure out v?

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.020
Well, the answer is you
just kind of guess.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.800
Well, you don't guess.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.220
You approximate.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.840
So let's see.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.570
What does u look like?

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.570
u looks like-- I don't know.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.250
If you're eyeballing it, it
looks like minus 0.8, if I

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.960
were to eyeball it.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.670
Maybe a little more?

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.820
Minus 0.85?

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.420
Because it's almost
at negative 1, but

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.240
not all the way there.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.870
I don't think it's 9/10 there.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.470
Yeah, I would say minus 0.85.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.690
I'm just eyeballing it.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.459
So let's just say u is
equal to minus 0.85.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.380
And what's v?

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.840
v looks about 2/3
on the way to u.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.310
So let's say v is equal
to minus 0.6.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.530
Once again I'm just-- let's
say minus 0.66.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.970
I'm just approximating
once again.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:35.970
So it's minus, right?

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.430
And they're both negative
numbers, and they're both

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.980
almost at 1.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.020
So what is the absolute
value of u minus v?

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.700
Well, that's the absolute value
of minus 0.85 minus v.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.790
So minus minus 0.66.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.570
So the minus minus
becomes a plus.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.970
So what's minus 0.85
plus 0.66?

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.300
Well, that's roughly
minus 0.19.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.960
And if I'm taking the absolute
value of that,

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.200
that becomes 0.19.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.360
0.19, roughly 1/5, and there's
no other number around.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.220
Roughly 1/5 is around here, and
there's no other number

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.310
there even remotely close,
so that's going to be x.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.800
And another way you could have
thought about that, if you

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.490
didn't want to approximate,
use numbers.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.900
I do that just to make sure.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.010
The absolute value, when you
subtract two numbers and you

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.320
take the absolute value, you're
essentially saying,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.710
well, what's the distance
between the two?

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.990
What's the positive distance?

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.610
I don't care whether one's
larger or one's

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.700
less than the other.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.250
So you're essentially saying
what's this distance, this

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.510
distance here that's equal to
this, to this expression?

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.670
So that distance, that
positive distance, is

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.250
approximately equal to x, even
in my not-exact drawing.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.740
And if you look at how they drew
it-- actually, even in

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.130
the way they drew it.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.220
Oh, sorry!

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.070
They did u minus w.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.130
So then it actually makes even
more sense, because w

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.380
is more like 0.5.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.140
I misread the problem.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.640
This w is equal to
more like 0.5.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.800
So the absolute value of u minus
w is going to be equal

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.730
to the absolute value of 0.85--
sorry, w is minus 0.5.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:24.700
It's in the negative domain,
so minus 0.85 minus 0.5, so

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.230
that equals minus 0.35.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.380
Absolute value is equal to 0.35,
still is equal to x.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.560
And they did that.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.550
I was just approximating
that x still works.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.180
But according to the drawing,
it makes even more sense

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.570
because we're actually talking
about this distance.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.090
Sorry, to w.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.820
Let me do it in a different
better color.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.240
This is what u-- not this.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.260
This is what this represents.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.620
The absolute value of u minus
w represents this distance.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.250
And that distance is the
same as the value of x.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.082
And it really makes sense if you
just look at the distance

00:06:59.082 --> 00:07:01.230
between u and w in the book.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.670
It's almost exact.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.960
This actually looks like
it was drawn to scale.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.780
Next problem.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.160
And that's choice
C either way.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.080
Even when I did it wrong
the first way.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.830
I didn't do it wrong,
I misread.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.040
To give myself a little
bit of credit.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.160
Problem number 9.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.840
Although you won't get much
credit if you misread

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.280
when you take it.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.200
A number n is increased by 5.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.210
I write these out as I read
them, is increased by 5, and

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.130
the result is multiplied by 5.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.070
This result is decreased by 5.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.455
Finally, that result
is divided by 5.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.020
The whole result is
divided by 5.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.220
In terms of n, what is
the final result?

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.850
Well, what can we do here?

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.180
We can divide the numerator
and denominator by 5.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.470
So this 5 will cancel out with
this and this, right?

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.670
Because you distribute.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:04.160
So you're left with n plus
5 times 1, right?

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.170
Because this just becomes
a 1, this becomes a 1,

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.240
this become a 1.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.850
n plus 5 times 1-- I won't
write the 1, because it

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.730
doesn't matter anymore--
minus 1.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.064
All of that over 1.

00:08:15.064 --> 00:08:17.480
So we could just ignore that.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.030
So it's n plus 5 minus 1.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.410
Well, it's n plus 4.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.810
Just get rid of the
parentheses.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.980
Plus 5 minus 1 is n plus 4.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.530
And so that's choice D.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.669
Let's see if I have space
to do the next problem.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.990
Or time, actually,
more than space.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.840
I will actually wait to do it
in the next video, just so I

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.570
don't rush things, which
I tend to do.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.090
See you soon.
