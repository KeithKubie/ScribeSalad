00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.940
I came to be a partner
at YC actually because I

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.939
was also someone who went
through the program myself.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.350
I went through Y Combinator
in the Winter of 2006,

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.020
the first batch out here in California
and I founded a company called Wufoo.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.915
Wufoo was an online forum builder,
it helps create online surveys,

00:00:16.915 --> 00:00:19.890
power event registration, and
process simple online payments.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.881
Ran that company for five years and we
then sold that to Survey Monkey in 2011.

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.152
Interesting thing about that company,

00:00:29.152 --> 00:00:32.280
it is not your typical type
of Silicon Valley company.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.060
After we raised our funding,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.250
after demo day, we purposely
only raised about $100,000 and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.280
then we moved back to Florida on the
east coast and we operated out of there.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.530
We never had a centralized office so
it's complete remote working team, and

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.440
we only grew the company to
about ten people, on purpose.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.520
There was a lot of money offered to us,
but we were relatively profitable

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.730
as a startup, so we never needed to take
any money from venture capitalists or

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.920
any other investors at the time.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.874
And when we were acquired,
one of the interesting metrics

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:06.634
that sometimes we talk about is that
the average company that sold, or

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:11.636
required, or went IPO that year was
about, had raised $25 million and

00:01:11.636 --> 00:01:15.852
their average returns to their
investor was about 600%.

00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:19.311
Wufoo only raised $100,000 for
the life of the company and

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:22.286
our returns to our investor was like,
29,000%.

00:01:22.286 --> 00:01:25.119
So, a lot of what I work on with
companies that like combinators is

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.522
focusing on building the kind of company
that doesn't need to raise money from

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:30.583
other people and
being extremely efficient and

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:32.770
productive with the resources
they have at hand.
