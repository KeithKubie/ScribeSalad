00:00:05.547 --> 00:00:07.880
DAVE BARRY: It's nice to be
here, at Google in New York.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.080
I actually have done a couple
of events at Mountain View,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.260
including one where I performed.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.420
I'm in a rock band of authors,
with Stephen King, Amy Tan,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.427
Mitch Albom, Ridley Pearson,
Greg Iles, Roy Blount Jr.,

00:00:24.427 --> 00:00:25.010
Scott Thoreau.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.967
A bunch of authors.

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:27.050
They're very good authors.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.620
We're a horrible band.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.040
We play-- Roy Blount
has described our genre

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.980
as hard listening music.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.209
And I say we play-- I call
it the rumor method of music,

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:41.500
which is everybody in the
band is holding an instrument

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.472
and playing something.

00:00:43.472 --> 00:00:45.180
And then a rumor goes
around that there's

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.350
been a chord change.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.432
Whoa, you know.

00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:48.890
And we all switch
to another chord,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.090
but not necessarily
the same other chord.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.174
But anyway, we spent a
day in Mountain View.

00:00:55.174 --> 00:00:56.090
That was a lot of fun.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.630
They give us this
detailed elaborate tour,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.960
and gave us no
information at all.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.090
I think it's a Google thing.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.940
Like we would say, are
there any questions?

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.150
And we'd go, how many
servers do you have?

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.765
And they go, we
can't tell you that.

00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:11.100
Where's the electricity come?

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.058
We can't tell you that.

00:01:12.058 --> 00:01:15.740
So anyway, the food was great.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.580
And the cafeteria was great.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.130
And Sergey and Larry
were there dancing to us.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.087
So it was a fun experience.

00:01:25.087 --> 00:01:26.420
I'm going to talk about my book.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.910
My book actually has a
major Google component,

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.240
which I will get to after
I've softened you up,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.540
and hope that you don't hate me.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.580
So I can talk about it.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.730
But it's a series of essays on
a bunch of different topics.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.660
The title is meaningless, as is
true of almost all of my books.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.100
I write what I think
are funny essays,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.470
and then the publisher
says, well, we need a title.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.630
We need a theme.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.390
And we sort of make one
up at the last minute,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.800
and that becomes the
title of the book.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.320
Although there is
there a sort of roughly

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.220
a kind of a happiness
and unhappiness

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.270
element to the book.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.060
But mainly it's a
series of essays.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.520
The first one is called
"Bite Me, David Beckham."

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.880
And it is based on the fact
that my wife is a soccer writer.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.860
She's a sportswriter
for the "Miami Herald,"

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.260
and she covers soccer.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.960
Covers the World Cup.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.560
Does a lot of soccer stuff.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.097
And David Beckham,
who is considered

00:02:25.097 --> 00:02:26.680
by many people--
including, I believe,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.750
my wife-- the handsomest
person on the planet,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.510
is trying to start a
soccer team in Miami.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.940
And so he is sort of wooing the
whole city of Miami, including

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.760
the media.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.590
And my wife is the main
soccer writer in Miami.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.239
So she spends an
inordinate amount of time

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.030
with David Beckham.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.940
Now that ordinarily wouldn't
cause me any insecurity all,

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.920
except that I've never been
really good about how I look.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.930
And I explain, in the book, why
I'm insecure about my looks.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.240
And one of the
things I do-- I went

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.120
to Pleasantville High
School, right up, not

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.330
too far from here.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.790
I graduated, class of 1965,
Pleasantville High School.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.360
And I want to show you why
I'm insecure about my looks.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.550
This is my high
school yearbook photo.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.770
OK?

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.610
That is the best I could do.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.470
That wasn't me on a bad day.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.520
This is me looking
as good as I can

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.470
in high school-- as a
senior in high school.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.470
I've got, like,
Soviet Union glasses.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.129
Which now, are,
like, retro and hip.

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.920
I'd like to punch the
hipsters in the mouth

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.086
when they put these glasses
on ironically, because I

00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:40.710
had to wear them.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.990
Also, note my hair.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.630
Just a quick note
of my hairstyle.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.046
I'm not saying
it's wonderful now,

00:03:45.046 --> 00:03:46.940
but it was really bad then.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.850
My dad cut my hair.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.864
And my dad was a professional
Presbyterian minister.

00:03:52.864 --> 00:03:54.530
And he was a good
Presbyterian minister,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.245
but they don't train
them in hair design.

00:03:58.245 --> 00:04:00.830
But he bought a pair of--
he worked in New York City,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.710
bought a pair of hair clippers
at Grand Central Station,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.960
and that's how he cut my
brothers' and my hair.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.410
And I agree that we should
get assault rifles out

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.432
of the hands of the
American public,

00:04:15.432 --> 00:04:17.390
but first we need to get
the hair clippers away

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.670
from the dads who are
still cutting hair.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.505
So anyway, I write an essay
about the awkwardness,

00:04:23.505 --> 00:04:28.192
the insecurity, of looking
like that as a kid.

00:04:28.192 --> 00:04:30.400
And it sort of sticks with
you the rest of your life,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.640
the image you form
of yourself as a kid.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.150
And now having to deal
with David Beckham

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.350
suddenly being really interested
in impressing my wife.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.770
I was just going to read
you one little part of it.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.650
After I show, in the book, the
picture of my high school year

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.920
book, I say--

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.570
Anyway, my point is
that in high school

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.750
I was not physically attractive
to the opposite sex, namely

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.810
girls.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.624
But, Dave, I hear you remarking,
looks aren't everything.

00:04:55.624 --> 00:04:57.790
There are plenty of other
qualities besides cuteness

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.550
that girls look for in boys.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.400
Good point.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.800
And when I say good point, I
mean you are a stupid idiot.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.560
The girls at
Pleasantville High School

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.000
were not interested in, quote,
plenty of other qualities

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.240
besides cuteness.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.450
I know this, because I had
plenty of other qualities

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.700
besides cuteness.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.400
Sarcasm, for example.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.890
I had a black belt in sarcasm.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.930
I went entire years without
ever saying anything

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.180
that was not basically the
opposite of what I actually

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.210
thought.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.740
Also, I could make realistic
farting sounds with my hands.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.240
These are just two of the many
qualities other than cuteness

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.700
I had in high school.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.320
None of them impressed girls.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.680
You will never hear a high
school girl say about a boy,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.115
in a dreamy voice,
he's so sarcastic.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.390
I have an essay, also, about--
it's a letter to my daughter.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.810
I have a 15-year-old
daughter, Sophie.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.710
And she's just turned 15.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.650
And so she is eligible for
a Florida driving permit.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.970
And so I've written
a letter to her,

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.920
which begins, "Dear Sophie, so
you're about to start driving.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.010
How exciting.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.390
I'm going to kill myself."

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.360
I say this because
I live in Miami.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.910
I moved there in 1986
from the United States.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.900
There are many adjustments.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.880
And Miami isn't as
dangerous as it used to be.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.645
People worry about that.

00:06:16.645 --> 00:06:19.061
We have a new attitude down
there, a new tourism promotion

00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:24.470
slogan-- come back to Miami,
we weren't shooting you.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.254
But the driving is still
quite an adventure in Miami.

00:06:29.254 --> 00:06:30.670
When I first got
there, I thought,

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.580
nobody here knows the law.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.130
I now realize that
everybody in Miami

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.750
is driving according to
the law-- of his or her

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.164
individual country of origin.

00:06:38.164 --> 00:06:40.330
And there are some countries
where, apparently, it's

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.396
traditional to put on
the left turn signal

00:06:42.396 --> 00:06:43.520
first thing in the morning.

00:06:46.187 --> 00:06:47.770
Maybe put it on the
night before, just

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.132
to make sure it's working.

00:06:49.132 --> 00:06:50.590
It's the only place
I've ever lived

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.110
where the driver's manual shows
you how to give the finger.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.170
Or people will pass
you in a car wash.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.495
And I know you guys are
working on self-driving cars,

00:07:01.495 --> 00:07:02.370
I think that's great.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.940
We already have that in Miami.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.350
If you drive in Miami, you'll
see many like, no head at all,

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.420
just hands.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.650
These are seniors,
on the road of Miami.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.820
There's a lot of folks down
there, senior citizens.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.760
A lot of them from here, from
New York, who I don't think

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.450
drove a lot most of their lives.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.280
I think they took
public transportation.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.550
Then they moved
to south Florida,

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.620
and lost the vast majority
of their sight and hearing,

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.890
and got driver's licenses.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.380
Which down there come
with your Happy Meal.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.700
This actually happened, there
was a-- you can Google this,

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.890
in fact.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.110
Miami police stopped
a 72-year-old man

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.760
driving a Chevrolet Cobalt,
which in itself is not

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.700
so unusual.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.650
It's where they stopped him.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.300
And this is true-- runway nine,
Miami International Airport.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.220
This man burst through
the perimeter gate

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.011
without realizing it,
and was on the runway

00:07:58.011 --> 00:07:59.734
when they stopped him.

00:07:59.734 --> 00:08:01.400
Which, to me, shows
a lack of awareness.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.670
If I'm driving, and I
realize I'm tailgating a 757,

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.580
I would say, I'm not on
the expressway anymore.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.570
But he was out there.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.390
And the thing is,
that's my airport.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.810
I can't get near a plane,
there, with shampoo.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.002
This man was out
there with a Cobalt.

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:27.770
But anyway, we have
a lot of seniors.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.530
And we also have a lot
of people who drive--

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.159
this is, again, the seniors.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:38.370
They divide the labor of
the driving, older couples.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.919
And I have been in the car
with couples like this.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:46.160
The man drives,
but the woman sees.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.820
He can't see
anymore, but he still

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.200
drives, because that's
what the man does.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.510
So she's in the, you know,
the passenger seat, going,

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.320
Harry, the light,
it's a green arrow.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:54.820
Green arrow.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.640
No, no, red, red.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.034
And that's how they--

00:08:58.034 --> 00:08:59.700
Anyway, this is the
environment in which

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.410
my daughter-- I have
to introduce-- she's

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.110
legally going to be
allowed to drive in.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.180
And I point out in
my letter to her

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.670
that just because the state of
Florida thinks she can drive,

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.110
that doesn't mean-- I mean,
Florida, as far as I can tell,

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.710
there's nobody it
doesn't think can drive.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.796
If alien beings arrive
here from another planet,

00:09:16.796 --> 00:09:18.420
they'll have Florida
driver's licenses.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.340
The only thing we will
know for sure about them.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.100
So anyway, I wrote a letter to
her explaining how to drive.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.490
And I, in there, discuss
the Florida drivers manual,

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.090
which is a festival
of misinformation.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.940
It states, for example, that if
there is no marked speed limit,

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.770
you're supposed to
go 35 miles an hour.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:41.440
If you do that in Miami,
you will receive gunfire

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.280
from behind you.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.580
So I have a Q&amp;A
in here, designed

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.010
to help my daughter understand
how driving actually

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.010
works in the state of
Florida, as opposed to how

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.400
the driver's manual says.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.750
And I'll just read you
a couple of Q&amp;A from it.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.770
Q, How is the turn
signal used in Florida?

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.760
A, It is used to indicate
other motorists that you do not

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.220
realize your turn
signal is blinking.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.540
Q, Could it also be used
to signal your intention

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.790
to change lanes?

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.400
A, Interesting nobody
has ever tried that.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.270
Q, What is the best kind of
food to eat while driving?

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.380
A, Any food, such as a
sandwich, turkey leg, oyster,

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.490
or Ding Dong that
can be eaten one

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.795
handed, so you still have
a hand free for texting.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.460
Q, What if an
emergency situation

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.710
arises that might require me
to operate the steering wheel?

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.180
A, Use your forehead
to honk the horn

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.490
until the emergency has passed.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.820
Q, My car's engine
seems to have stopped,

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.130
and I hear a burbling noise.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.690
A, Are you a senior citizen?

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:47.960
Q, Yes.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.240
A, You have driven
into a swimming pool.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:57.020
Q, I've had a few drinks, how
can I tell if I should drive?

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.470
A, Take this simple test, are
you wearing your underpants

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.730
on your head?

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.190
Q, Not my underpants, no.

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.950
A, Then you are good to go.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.660
Q, What's all that shouting?

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.580
A, Are you a senior citizen?

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.000
Q, Yes.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.745
A, You have struck a pedestrian.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.000
There's an essay, I call
it "The Real Mad Men,"

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.540
which is about my
parents' generation.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.380
I'm a baby boomer, I'm
way older than all of you.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.080
But my parents were
even older than I was.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.160
They were the
greatest generation.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.510
And what got me, writing this
essay, was watching the TV

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.578
show "Mad Men," which I
think is a great TV show.

00:11:40.578 --> 00:11:42.286
And on "Mad Men," if
you've ever seen it,

00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:44.050
you know that everybody drinks
and smokes all the time.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.050
Which I do remember.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.970
It was very accurate.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.460
My parents drank and
smoked like crazy,

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.751
and all their friends did, too.

00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:51.310
And then they got in
cars, and did everything

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.120
we're not supposed to do.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.880
But in "Mad Men" everybody's
always kind of depressed,

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.170
and full of anxiety.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.280
And at what I remember
about my parents--

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.570
we lived in Armonk,
up in Westchester

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.677
County-- was that they
weren't depressed.

00:12:03.677 --> 00:12:04.760
That they had great times.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.360
They had wonderful parties.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.620
They had parties long
after they had us, that's

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.120
how I know they had them.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.135
We would sit and watch
them drink and smoke,

00:12:14.135 --> 00:12:15.260
and just have a great time.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.452
And sing and dance, and
do all these things.

00:12:18.452 --> 00:12:20.910
And it occurred to me that my
generation, the baby boomers,

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:21.630
stopped doing that stuff.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.602
We all did, you know--
sex, drugs, and rock 'n'

00:12:23.602 --> 00:12:25.584
roll-- until we had kids.

00:12:25.584 --> 00:12:27.000
And then we just
suddenly stopped,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.650
and became this very
serious kind of parent

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.800
that was into parenting, which
is a verb my parents would

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.860
never have used.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.050
And we spent the
rest of our lives

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.500
trying to parent our
children, and remove

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.970
all the obstacles
from their paths,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.710
and helicopter around them.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.065
And, you know, follow them
around trick-or-treating,

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:48.398
and pounce on them in case
they got something dangerous,

00:12:48.398 --> 00:12:50.311
like an apple.

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:51.560
And my parents didn't do that.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.934
They didn't do
any of that stuff.

00:12:52.934 --> 00:12:54.450
They didn't take
us to play dates.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:55.190
They sent us out to play.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.660
They didn't know where we were.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.280
They served us gluten.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:12:59.850
Openly.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.350
Openly, people did
gluten back then.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.712
So I talked about that.

00:13:05.712 --> 00:13:07.920
And there's a whole essay
about the difference, then,

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.370
between my parents'
generation and mine.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.050
In which mine doesn't
compare particularly well.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.180
There's a long essay
about Brazil and soccer.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.200
As I said, my wife's
a soccer writer.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.740
And she goes the World Cup.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.610
And I've gone to the
last two World Cups.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.544
And my daughter, who's 15,
plays on a travel soccer team.

00:13:27.544 --> 00:13:29.960
I don't know if any of you
have ever played travel soccer,

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.600
but the basic idea,
is every weekend

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.270
you get in the car
drive 200 miles,

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:39.230
to play another team that also
got a car and drove 200 miles,

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.584
sometimes starting at
the same place you did.

00:13:41.584 --> 00:13:44.000
And the reason you do that,
is you have to play in a place

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.499
where there's a chance somebody
will be killed by lightning.

00:13:46.499 --> 00:13:49.180
Because the rule in Florida is,
you cannot play soccer unless

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.500
it's under heavy downpours.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.630
If we ever want to really do
something serious to eliminate

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.850
the drought in California,
or sub-Saharan Africa,

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.060
schedule my daughter's soccer
team there, and it will rain.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.580
It will rain for days and days.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:08.170
Anyway, so I talk, in the book,
about Brazil, about soccer,

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:09.180
about the World Cup.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.770
And why I love soccer.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.160
I've become a the
big soccer fan.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.070
But also acknowledge the
criticisms that are usually

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.430
leveled at soccer by people.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.260
Many Americans who
detest the sport.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.870
And I'll just give you a couple
of the criticisms I list here.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.051
The players sport haircuts--
I'm talking about pro soccer.

00:14:28.051 --> 00:14:30.050
The players sport hair
cuts that were apparently

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.390
administered by a blind heroin
addict in the men's room

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.269
of a Bulgarian disco in 1978.

00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:36.810
Whenever they collide
with something,

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.590
such as another player,
a tallish blade of grass,

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.560
or an unusually
dense patch of air,

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.060
they try to draw a foul by
hurling themselves dramatically

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.970
to the turf, grabbing a random
knee-- it's always a knee--

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.090
and adopting the agonized
facial expression of a man being

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.260
castrated by irate lobsters.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.060
Not to single out
any specific nation,

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.220
but there are Italian
players who spend enough time

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.880
lying on the ground to be
biologically classified

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.770
as zucchini.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:09.150
I talk about homeownership,
which is the unhappiness

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:10.560
part of the happiness book.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.590
And in an essay that
is titled, Everything I

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:17.630
Know About Homeownership, I
Learned From Johnny Carson.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.480
And it's actually,
it was a true story.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.170
The first humor book I
wrote was in the early '80s,

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.360
and it was called "The
Taming of the Screw," which

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.650
was a parity of a
do-it-yourself book.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:33.850
And it was kind of a funny
book tour, because at the time,

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.840
I was completely
unknown as a humorist.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.540
And when I went on tour, many
of the radio stations I went to

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.190
thought I was a serious
home do-it-yourself guy.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.950
Which made for
some pretty-- like,

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.030
I was across from a guy
in, I believe, St. Louis.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.264
A radio guy, been on
radio a million years,

00:15:51.264 --> 00:15:53.430
and I was just another
interview he was going to do.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:54.180
Another interview.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.270
And his eyes were bloodshot,
I'm pretty sure he'd

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.600
been drinking at lunch.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.160
And he's thinking, OK, here's
the do-it-yourself book guy,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.830
I'll just ask him a question,
and he'll just take it,

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:03.912
and it'll be over.

00:16:03.912 --> 00:16:06.370
And his first question to me
is, so I see-- and he's, like,

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.536
opening the book for the
first time ever in history,

00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:11.360
for him-- so you talk
about insulating your home.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.970
What do you say about that?

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.765
And I go, well, the best place
to put it is on your driveway.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.132
And he goes, what?

00:16:19.132 --> 00:16:20.090
Well, it's just easier.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.345
Because if you go up in the
attic, it's like, spiders.

00:16:22.345 --> 00:16:24.136
Just put it on your
driveway, and you still

00:16:24.136 --> 00:16:25.020
get the tax credit.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.210
So he realized what--
anyway I was that kind.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:35.800
But the first interview I did,
the first actual book tour

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.800
event I did, and the first time
I was ever, ever on television

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.580
anywhere-- local or national,
any television showw--

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.950
was on the Johnny Carson
show, for this book.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.676
I'm really not, to
this day, sure exactly

00:16:47.676 --> 00:16:50.050
how that happened, but somehow
my little humor book ended

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.424
up in the hands
of a Tonight Show

00:16:51.424 --> 00:16:53.310
producer named Shirley Wood.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.660
She was this tough old
broad, chain smoking.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.140
And she calls me up and goes,
I think your book's funny.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:16:59.830
I go, thank you.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.100
And she goes, are you funny?

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.490
You know?

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.930
And that's really, actually
what she sounded like.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.263
That's actually a little more
feminine than she sounded.

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:12.609
She asked me some
questions, and she said,

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:13.619
OK, remember these answers.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:14.660
And then she flew me out.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.380
They flew me out to Los Angeles.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.220
And this is-- I've never been
on television for anything.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.270
And that was my first, again.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.630
She came back stage.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:28.920
I'm in a green room, I'm in
the backstage dressing room

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.140
next to The Pointer Sisters.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.098
I'll never forget this.

00:17:31.098 --> 00:17:33.410
Like, The Pointer
Sisters, Dave Barry.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.200
That was my experience.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.659
And Shirley Wood comes into
my dressing room and goes,

00:17:38.659 --> 00:17:40.450
do you remember what
you're supposed to do?

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.210
Yeah, yeah.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.710
Drink this.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.930
And she hands me
a glass of wine.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.900
Not like a little glass, a
water glass full of wine.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.910
And made me drink it.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.700
And that's how I-- really--
and that's how I went out.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.620
So I go out, and I
had a seven minute

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.110
spot on "The Tonight Show."

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.170
They don't do that much
anymore, where they

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.050
have, like, unknown authors.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.882
But there I was, on
the Johnny Carson show,

00:18:01.882 --> 00:18:02.840
at the end of the show.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.640
It was called the author's spot.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.120
And it went great.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.180
I later realized
that the reason went

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.030
great-- I thought, wow,
television is easy,

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.630
you know, everybody laughed.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.130
I later realized it went great
because Johnny Carson was one

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.620
of the best interviewers ever.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.400
And he was masterful at
giving me the laughs.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.310
So anyway, as soon as it ended,
as soon as our seven minutes

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.630
ended the band starts playing.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.380
As soon as the camera's
off, Johnny Carson

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.920
lights a cigarette.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.976
And he turned to me,
and the only thing

00:18:33.976 --> 00:18:36.600
that he ever said to me, just to
me, that we weren't on the air

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.070
was, I used to try
to do it yourself.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.930
Pause.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.980
You can't do shit yourself.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:43.890
And I laughed.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:44.704
And that was it.

00:18:44.704 --> 00:18:46.120
Anyway, but I
thought of that when

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.245
I was writing this chapter.

00:18:47.245 --> 00:18:49.752
Because I've been a homeowner
for a long, long time.

00:18:49.752 --> 00:18:51.710
And I've owned many, many
homes over the years.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.890
And I've learned that I
cannot do anything myself.

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.872
I have to hire a guy
with a truck to come.

00:18:57.872 --> 00:18:58.580
Guy with a truck.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.110
And he always comes, and
there's a certain ritual

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.556
to the guy with the truck.

00:19:02.556 --> 00:19:04.180
If you are a homeowner,
I'm sure you've

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.221
been through this ritual.

00:19:05.221 --> 00:19:07.847
He comes in, first he wants
to ask you some questions.

00:19:07.847 --> 00:19:09.680
Which I hate, because
if I knew the answers,

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.590
I wouldn't call the
guy with the truck.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.040
But he always wants to
know something like,

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.820
can you tell me where your
demodulation juncture is?

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.638
It should be near the
Boolean overpass valve.

00:19:19.638 --> 00:19:21.096
And I never know
where anything is.

00:19:21.096 --> 00:19:21.770
I say, I'm sorry.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.600
I'm sitting there looking
at whatever stupid thing I'm

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.910
looking at on my
computer screen, which

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.118
looks like I'm doing nothing.

00:19:26.118 --> 00:19:27.495
But I'm a humor writer.

00:19:27.495 --> 00:19:29.120
If I'm looking at a
Japanese game show,

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.661
there's a professional
reason for it.

00:19:30.661 --> 00:19:32.290
OK?

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.010
But anyway, so he goes off.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.830
And then, the part
I hate the most

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:39.652
is when he wants to come
and show you something.

00:19:39.652 --> 00:19:40.860
They always have to show you.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:41.901
Can I show you something?

00:19:41.901 --> 00:19:43.540
Mr. Barry, can I
show you something?

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.610
And first of all, I
don't want to see it,

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.400
because it's not
going to be good.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.750
It's never a good thing.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.640
The truck guy never
says, you see this?

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.070
That's exactly the way
that's supposed to look.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.150
That's not going to
cost you a nickel.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:58.190
That is never what the truck
guy has to talk to you about.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.870
It's always something
very expensive,

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.090
that was always done wrong.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.130
And you always want
to say, well, whoever

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:03.300
did it wrong was in a truck.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.940
I'll tell you that, right now.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.020
So anyway, I wrote a
chapter about-- an essay

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.370
about not being able
to do things yourself.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.830
Having to call the truck guy.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:19.309
And the big culprit in
the do-it-yourself world.

00:20:19.309 --> 00:20:21.600
The one that keeps convincing
people they can do things

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.610
themselves, is like, you know,
the big-- what's the name?

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.470
The big hardware store that
advertises all-- why am I'm

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:30.525
blanking on it?

00:20:30.525 --> 00:20:30.810
AUDIENCE: Home Depot?

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:31.768
DAVE BARRY: Home Depot.

00:20:31.768 --> 00:20:32.390
Home Depot.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.056
They run those
commercials where there's

00:20:34.056 --> 00:20:36.470
like a happy, cheerful
homeowning couple.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.110
One minute they're in the Home
Depot store looking at tiles.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.800
You know?

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.492
And then they show
like one second

00:20:41.492 --> 00:20:43.950
of them wearing goggles and
drilling something, or screwing

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:44.950
a screw in.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:48.500
And then there's a
whole new kitchen.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.380
Which is a very misleading
view of do-it-yourself.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:56.760
So I propose, in
my book, a new kind

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.550
of hardware store called
Reality Based Hardware.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.630
It would be a hardware
store where if you went in,

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.730
we have specially trained
representatives there.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.420
If you went in,
they would actively

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.220
try to discourage
you from whatever

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.920
it is you were trying to do.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.910
So I have a little
dialogue here,

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:16.400
between a homeowner
and an employee

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.830
of Reality Based Hardware.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.760
Homeowner, I want to
install a ceiling fan.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.300
Employee, Really?

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.740
Homeowner, Yes.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.592
Employee, You want to install a
machine with long, sharp blades

00:21:27.592 --> 00:21:29.550
whirling at high speeds
directly over the heads

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.730
of live human beings?

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.970
Homeowner, Well, yes.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.630
Employee, I see.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.950
And do you have any particular
expertise in this area?

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.720
Any training in the field
the ceiling fan installation?

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.170
Homeowner, Um, no, not in
ceiling fan insulation, per se.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.870
Employee, In what, then?

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.870
Homeowner, I'm a dentist.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:51.772
Employee, I see.

00:21:51.772 --> 00:21:54.230
And would you comfortable having
a professional ceiling fan

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.477
installer give you a root canal?

00:21:57.477 --> 00:21:59.310
Homeowner, Well, no,
but that's a different.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.120
Employee, I'd like
you to take a look

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.950
at this photograph of a recent,
quote, do-it-yourself ceiling

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.510
fan installation.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.490
Homeowner, My god, is that?

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:10.675
Employee, Yes.

00:22:10.675 --> 00:22:11.175
His hand.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.210
It landed eight feet away.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.640
I have an essay in
here about Russia.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.960
I went to Russia last
fall, with a friend

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.780
of mine named Ridley Pearson,
the co-author of some books I

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.770
wrote.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.680
We went for the US
State Department

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.030
to Russia, as part of a
program to improve relations

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.050
between the two nations.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:38.920
So you see how
that's working out.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.530
So anyway, I wrote
an essay about it.

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.500
You won't really learn
a lot about Russia,

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.810
because I never understood
what anybody was saying.

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:47.970
But I had a pretty good
time, except for-- I

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.500
ate Mexican food.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.420
I ate a chimichanga.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.210
This is true.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.250
It's like, amazing, how
many non-Russian foods

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.430
you can get in Moscow.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:59.555
And I developed a case of
global thermonuclear diarrhea.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.770
I guess my main piece of
advice is, if you go to Russia,

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.492
don't eat the Mexican food.

00:23:07.492 --> 00:23:08.950
Just like a weaponized
chimichanga.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:16.000
And I close the book with
a letter to my grandson.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.900
I became a grandfather last May.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.880
I really, I get no
credit for that.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.896
My son Rob, he actually
works here in New York.

00:23:25.896 --> 00:23:27.520
He works for "The
Wall Street Journal."

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.200
But he-- well, actually
his wife had the baby.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.960
I'll be technical here.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.900
And I wanted to write a letter
to him, passing on the wisdom

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:38.650
that I've learned.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.190
It was an interesting thing.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:41.821
You know, I kind
of envision what

00:23:41.821 --> 00:23:44.070
it would be like to be like
to be a grandson-- I would

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.653
be a grandfather--
it didn't start out

00:23:45.653 --> 00:23:47.080
the way I pictured it.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.650
My daughter-in-law is
Jewish, and so they

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.080
decided to have a Briss.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.890
I don't know if you're familiar
with the Briss, but basically--

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.220
and I want to stress before
I start, I love Judaism.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.080
My wife is Jewish.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.627
She's Cuban Jewish.

00:24:02.627 --> 00:24:04.210
My joke is, they
didn't come on rafts,

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.485
they parted of the Caribbean.

00:24:07.485 --> 00:24:08.282
So I love Judaism.

00:24:08.282 --> 00:24:09.990
It's a great religion,
except for I'm not

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.600
so big on the Briss concept.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.540
The way it works is,
it's a tradition,

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.350
that when the baby is
born, on the eighth day

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.250
the baby has to be
circumcised, and then there

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.110
are deli platters.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.860
Sometimes on the same surface.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:30.890
And I looked-- when
I found I was going

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.149
to be involved in
this Briss, I looked

00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:35.440
in the Bible-- which is
online, you'll be glad to know.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.920
The way it came about, the
story is, in the Bible,

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.850
there's a whole explanation
why Jews do this.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.790
Abraham, he's 99
years old, Abraham.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.850
He's like the
patriarch of-- and God

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.700
comes to see him, which is
never a good thing in the Bible.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.450
It's kind of like when
the truck guy wants

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.580
to show you something.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.200
God never comes to say, hey,
I just turned all of Lake Erie

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:02.810
into beer.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:05.520
Come on.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.920
Never anything great like that.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.564
It's always something like,
you're going to smite somebody,

00:25:09.564 --> 00:25:10.980
you're going to
have to sacrifice,

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.938
you're going to have to
build something out of,

00:25:12.938 --> 00:25:15.114
you know, goat skins, whatever.

00:25:15.114 --> 00:25:17.530
God has got something in his
mind, some bee in his bonnet.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.170
In this case, God
tells Abraham, I'm

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:27.270
going to make you-- you're going
to be the patriarch-- you're

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:29.582
going to be the forefather
of all these kings.

00:25:29.582 --> 00:25:31.290
I'm going to give you
the land of Cannan.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:35.030
Cannan is the biblical word
for what is now Long Island.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.157
But he said, we have to have
a token of our covenant,

00:25:42.157 --> 00:25:43.615
is you have to
circumcise yourself.

00:25:43.615 --> 00:25:45.573
I'm not kidding, It's
right there in the Bible.

00:25:45.573 --> 00:25:48.760
He's telling a
99-year-old man that he

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.160
has to circumcise himself.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.921
And you think, like, why
would that be the token?

00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:55.420
You know?

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.753
Why can't they just shake hands?

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:05.747
And speaking of shaking
hands, not only has Abraham

00:26:05.747 --> 00:26:07.580
got to circumcise
himself, but God tells him

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.380
he has to circumcise
everybody in his household.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.970
How would you like to
be in that household?

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.560
Hey, guess what
God told me to do.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.690
You know?

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:20.703
So anyway, my
grandson had a Briss.

00:26:20.703 --> 00:26:22.536
And I was chosen-- I
was given the honor-- I

00:26:22.536 --> 00:26:25.420
was told it was an honor--
of being the Sandek, which

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.550
is the person who
holds the baby's legs.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:33.260
While the Mohel-- which is
a Hebrew word for snipper--

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.970
performs the actual
circumcision.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:39.454
That was my first real
interaction with my grandson.

00:26:39.454 --> 00:26:41.370
Holding his legs while
he's being circumcised.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.495
And I, you know, I pictured
something like fishing.

00:26:43.495 --> 00:26:45.414
You know?

00:26:45.414 --> 00:26:47.080
Or learning to
skateboard, or something.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.480
But no-- so I'm
just kind of hoping

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.760
he's forgotten all about that.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.740
But anyway, this
leads me to the one

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.180
I've been scared to talk about.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.670
There's one other topic I wrote
an essay about in this book,

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:00.355
Google Glass.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.480
And I bought a pair.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.620
With my own money, I bought.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.340
I became-- they
call it an explorer.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.756
Is anybody here--
no, I don't even

00:27:12.756 --> 00:27:15.650
want to know if anybody here
is from the Google Glass.

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.044
And I wrote about Google Glass.

00:27:18.044 --> 00:27:19.960
So I was going to read
you a little bit of it,

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.600
and you'll see where
I'm coming from.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.390
And then you can
throw stuff at me.

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:26.304
Before you read this
review of Google Glass,

00:27:26.304 --> 00:27:27.720
I want to stress
that I am totally

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.830
down with modern technology.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.310
I'm not some clueless old
fart shouting hello, hello

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.890
into a mobile phone he
is holding upside down.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.660
Although I have done that.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.930
I love new technology.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.950
I am what is known
as an early adopter.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.510
Over the decades,
I have spent 10s

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.340
of thousands of dollars
adopting new technology that I

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.390
use for periods of time
ranging from one week

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:48.880
to as long as three weeks.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.420
At which time it
ceased to be as new

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.430
as it once was, leaving
me with no choice

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:53.860
but to buy a newer one.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:57.320
I have boxes and boxes filled
with old new technology.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.860
And still more boxes
containing dense tangled snarls

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.170
of cables and power
adapters, that I

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:05.010
would need if I ever wanted to
make the technology work again.

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:08.000
Which, of course, I never
would, because it is old.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.390
I have been buying GPS
units since the days when

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.940
they had tiny black and
white screens, and said only,

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.250
you are probably in either
North or South America.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.830
I have owned mobile phones
the size of LeBron James.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.040
I early adopted
every single version

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.990
of the Windows operating
system, including

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.180
Vista, which summoned
hell demons who

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.070
possessed your computer
and played pranks,

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.480
such as changing all
your verbs to adjectives.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.260
And I continued early adopting
Windows versions after that.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.680
If Windows came out with a
version called Windows Stab You

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.600
in the Eyeball With a
Fork, I would adopt it.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.300
And I skip over the point where
own like 11 electric guitars.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.130
Now the point is, I consider
myself to be pro technology,

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:49.940
and knowledgeable about gadgets.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.640
So when I heard about
Google Glass, I wanted it.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.780
I wasn't sure exactly what it
did, it but I knew it was new

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:58.670
and it apparently
involved electricity.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.450
It also involved Google,
of which I am a huge fan.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:02.860
And this is true, I am.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.920
Google has basically
replaced my brain.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.115
That's also
basically the-- there

00:29:09.115 --> 00:29:11.156
was a time when, if somebody
asked me a question,

00:29:11.156 --> 00:29:12.680
say, who is Socrates?

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.600
I had to manually
think about it.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.050
Whereas now I just Google it,
and boom, I have the answer.

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:20.760
Quote, an ancient dead person.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.510
Google makes thinking
so much easier.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:24.510
If Google had existed
when I was in college,

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.240
I would have spent
the entire four

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.810
years getting high and
listening to Moby Grape,

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:33.450
instead of just 87% of the time.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:34.980
So anyway, I got Google Glass.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.360
It cost $1,500, which
sounds like a lot of money,

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.200
until you realize that it's
100% tax deductible if you

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.450
write about it in this book.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.140
What is Google Glass?

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.790
Its a lightweight
electronic device,

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:54.130
sort of like a high-tech looking
eyeglass frame without lenses

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:55.510
but you wear on your head.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.200
On the front right
side of the device

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.130
is a tiny camera and
a miniature screen,

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.729
that you can theoretically
see with your right eye.

00:30:01.729 --> 00:30:03.520
There's also a tiny
microphone and speaker.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.103
It connects wirelessly
to the internet

00:30:05.103 --> 00:30:06.650
through Wi-Fi or
a Bluetooth phone.

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.080
So basically, when you
put on Google Glass,

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.310
you're wearing a tiny hands-free
computer with direct access

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.030
to the unimaginably
vast information

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.010
resources of the internet.

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.810
Think for a moment
about what this means.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:22.920
It means you look
like a douche bag.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.700
So anyway.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.200
Seriously, you do.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.450
There is no getting around it.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.060
My daughter-- who has been my
daughter for her entire life,

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.500
and therefore has developed
a very high tolerance

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.276
for being embarrassed
by me-- refused

00:30:37.276 --> 00:30:38.650
to walk into a
restaurant with me

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:40.940
until I removed my Google Glass.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.430
If you go to the official
Google website for Google Glass,

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.680
you will see photos of
attractive young people wearing

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.630
Google Glass as they
engage in a variety

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:49.010
of modern youthful activities.

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:50.810
Biking, running,
golfing, chopping

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.260
organic vegetables, et cetera.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.750
Google has enough money
to buy whatever it wants.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.930
Asia, for example.

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:00.670
So you know they paid the
for the absolute best looking

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:02.900
photos of the absolute
best looking Glass wearing

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.480
individuals money could buy.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.670
They still look
like douche bags.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:09.890
So anyway, that's--
and I'll be honest,

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:11.940
I don't give Google
Glass a great review.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.890
It's probably because
I'm 67 years old,

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:16.500
and I could never
really see the thing.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.390
But I wore them.

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:18.390
Wore them for a weekend.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:19.920
I went to wedding with them.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.350
I was very popular
with other guests.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:25.120
And then I did close it.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.740
I know that you've discontinued,
for now, the current version,

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.096
and looking at improvements.

00:31:30.096 --> 00:31:31.470
And I proposed
some improvements.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:36.060
And one of them would be,
like an invisibility cloak.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.770
But, you know, when the next
one comes out, I'll buy it.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:41.690
Because that's the kind
of early adopter I am.

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:44.910
So anyway, that's the
Google part of my book.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.740
So, I don't how
long I've gone on.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.380
They told me there was a
timer, but I can't find it.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.860
So I would be happy
to take questions

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:58.410
on anything, except anything
that requires knowledge.

00:31:58.410 --> 00:31:59.440
I'm not good at that.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.980
That's why I became
humor writer.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.479
Yeah?

00:32:05.785 --> 00:32:07.953
AUDIENCE: Our daughter,
as it turns out,

00:32:07.953 --> 00:32:09.360
is the same age
as your daughter.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.240
DAVE BARRY: 15.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.948
AUDIENCE: This surprises
me considerably,

00:32:11.948 --> 00:32:16.970
because for years we read
your articles and books,

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.900
and marveled at the fact
that the timing was perfect.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.150
They were coming
out at just the time

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:23.887
when we needed your advice--

00:32:23.887 --> 00:32:25.220
DAVE BARRY: That's why I'm here.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:25.940
AUDIENCE: --for
what our daughter

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.380
was just about to go trough.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.260
So somehow you
wrote those books,

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.500
apparently two and a
half years in the past.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.845
Or in no time at all.

00:32:35.845 --> 00:32:37.345
DAVE BARRY: Is this
a math question?

00:32:42.847 --> 00:32:44.430
AUDIENCE: I was
impressed at the time.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.013
I'm more impressed,
because as I said,

00:32:46.013 --> 00:32:48.420
you apparently wrote these
things in no time at all,

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.750
and got them out to us in
time to save our lives.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.180
DAVE BARRY: I'm happy to do it.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.600
My daughter's 15, and I've
written some about the issues

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.870
with 15-year-old girls,
which is boys, is the issue.

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:06.660
And I don't like them.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.110
And we need a cure for puberty.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:12.102
But my proposal-- I don't know
if you've had to deal with it--

00:33:12.102 --> 00:33:12.810
they come around.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:14.476
They come around the
house, the boys do.

00:33:14.476 --> 00:33:16.860
And I would never let them
in, in a million years.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.610
Because I know what
they're thinking.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:19.680
My wife lets them in.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.920
What I would do is have a trap.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.770
A steel trap.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:24.984
A humane trap outside
the front door.

00:33:24.984 --> 00:33:26.400
And it would clang
shut, and there

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.310
would be a teenage boy in it.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:31.150
And I would take him
out in the Everglades

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:35.090
and release him in
a humane manner.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:36.630
But my wife, as I
say, lets them in.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:38.338
And some of them have
hair on their legs.

00:33:38.338 --> 00:33:40.480
I can't stand this.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.820
That alone should be-- anyway.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.298
Yeah?

00:33:43.298 --> 00:33:45.100
AUDIENCE: I hope you
don't mind a question

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.230
from a senior citizen.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:48.316
DAVE BARRY: No.

00:33:48.316 --> 00:33:50.690
AUDIENCE: I live in New York
City, so I don't have a car.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.190
I'll get one when
I move to Florida.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.540
DAVE BARRY: Come on
down to Florida, yeah.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.480
What a lot of seniors
like to do is-- just

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.850
to make sure they have enough
mass-- get two Oldsmobiles

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.872
and have them welded together.

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:03.361
Get that big mass around you.

00:34:03.361 --> 00:34:05.610
AUDIENCE: But listen, a
question, not about your book,

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.693
but about something that
happened a long time ago,

00:34:07.693 --> 00:34:10.429
long before Sophie was born.

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:12.520
Back in the late
'80s, early '90s,

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.409
I think you were
one of the first,

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:17.179
if not the first, sort
of mainstream author that

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.969
was regularly syndicated
on the network.

00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:23.190
On the internet,
ARPANET at that time.

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:28.800
And I think it wasn't with
your authorization, at least

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.780
initially.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.530
It was just people
were taking your stuff.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.070
We had a mailing
list for awhile.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.850
I think that Brad
Templeton picked you up

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:40.400
on ClariNet as one of the first
syndicated authors, and such.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.760
Can you talk a
little bit about what

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:46.520
it was like to be an author
and suddenly discover

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.110
that, totally separate
from what you thought

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.580
was your syndication
pattern, there

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.050
was this bunch of geeks
on the internet that

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:55.449
were syndicating your stuff.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:56.909
How did react to that?

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:58.870
And has it made any
difference in your career

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:02.970
to have been one of the first
internet syndicated authors?

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.740
DAVE BARRY: I do
remember it quite well.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.700
And it took me a while to
figure out what was happening.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.356
But people wrote-- back then
we had letters-- and some

00:35:11.356 --> 00:35:13.855
sometimes they would write me
letters and send me printouts,

00:35:13.855 --> 00:35:16.460
and said, you realize
you're on this?

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.240
And I thought it was cool.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.720
What's funny about it-- I
have about nine thoughts

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.120
trying to come out once,
so I'll try to pick one.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.580
What was really funny about
it is if the newspaper

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:31.810
business had had any
brains back then,

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:35.160
they would have seen something
that they never did see.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.670
And now the newspaper businesses
is going out of business

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.230
because it's run
by English majors.

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.475
But I thought, well this
is really interesting,

00:35:47.475 --> 00:35:48.850
that all these
people-- you know,

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:51.140
it didn't occur to me to
look at it financially,

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.750
because it wouldn't have made
any difference to me anyway.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.190
You know, I was already in
whatever papers I was in.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:57.065
And I don't think it
was taking anything away

00:35:57.065 --> 00:36:02.524
from my way of making a living.

00:36:02.524 --> 00:36:04.940
And I just figured, well those
people will also buy books,

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:05.773
and stuff like that.

00:36:05.773 --> 00:36:07.500
So I thought that it was great.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.320
I do remember the "Miami
Herald" and Knight Ridder

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.580
going way out of their
way to try to stop it.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.240
And failing utterly.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.560
Again, English majors
versus people who actually

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.560
understood the internet.

00:36:21.269 --> 00:36:23.810
So I just sort of remember it
as kind of an interesting time.

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.430
And that's all gone, right?

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:28.686
Those mailing lists,
whatever those?

00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:30.682
AUDIENCE: They're
still there, they just

00:36:30.682 --> 00:36:32.678
don't get-- they're
not-- in fact,

00:36:32.678 --> 00:36:35.672
they probably have more people
on them than they did then.

00:36:35.672 --> 00:36:38.666
But it's a much tinier
percentage of the world

00:36:38.666 --> 00:36:40.180
than it was then.

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.620
DAVE BARRY: At some
point, I got involved--

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.910
I was able to
actually post onto it,

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:47.040
or whatever the word would be.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.110
And what I do
remember, was after one

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:51.110
really long drunken
night in London--

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:54.030
I was on a book tour in London
with a very funny newspaper

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.130
columnist over there.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:58.450
And I wrote him a really
ridiculously obscene email

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:01.260
at the end of the
evening, thanking him.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:04.950
And using the term
Mr. Chuckle Trousers,

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.080
which had great
significance that night.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.060
And instead of
going just to him,

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:17.360
it went to everybody
in the world.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.310
So that was my other
big lesson about that.

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:22.680
Yeah?

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.160
AUDIENCE: Dave,
thanks for coming.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:24.820
DAVE BARRY: Thank you.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.445
AUDIENCE: So I have
a couple questions.

00:37:26.445 --> 00:37:27.870
DAVE BARRY: What kind?

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:29.230
AUDIENCE: A couple questions.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:30.855
First of all, my
parents live in Miami,

00:37:30.855 --> 00:37:32.730
so I've been looking at
your stuff for years.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.670
DAVE BARRY: Everyone's
parents live in Miami.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.545
AUDIENCE: But we came
from South America, so.

00:37:36.545 --> 00:37:37.300
DAVE BARRY: OK.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:37.785
AUDIENCE: From Columbia.

00:37:37.785 --> 00:37:38.850
DAVE BARRY: Columbia!

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:40.106
AUDIENCE: No threat.

00:37:40.106 --> 00:37:42.400
DAVE BARRY: No, I have
many Colombian friends.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.227
AUDIENCE: So first
question is, what--

00:37:44.227 --> 00:37:46.310
DAVE BARRY: Can I tell you
the first Colombian guy

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:47.927
I met in Miami?

00:37:47.927 --> 00:37:49.510
I know I'm interrupting
your question,

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:54.110
but-- This was in the '80s, when
there were a lot of Colombians

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:55.450
there for the wrong reasons.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.241
You know, they were
not software engineers.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.530
And I was meeting, as it
happened, a police officer

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.400
in a bar in South Beach.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.590
And he had not arrived yet.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.340
And it was not like a
close friend police,

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.550
it was a guy-- I
was doing a column,

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:11.966
and he was going
to meet be there.

00:38:11.966 --> 00:38:14.367
So I'm sitting there, and
this guy comes over to me,

00:38:14.367 --> 00:38:15.700
and he goes, are you Dave Barry?

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:16.650
And I go, yeah, I am.

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:17.430
And he sits down.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.180
He's a nice guy.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:21.570
We're chatting away.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.374
After a while I said,
well, what do you do?

00:38:23.374 --> 00:38:26.040
And he goes, I'll be honest with
you, I'm a narcotics trafficer.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:33.580
I said well, do
you mind if like we

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:37.275
carry on this conversation
in, like, another state?

00:38:37.275 --> 00:38:39.400
But the other one, the
other Colombian thing-- it's

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.440
actually in this book.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.250
In the Uruguay Columbia game
at the World Cup this-- yes,

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:47.570
I sat in the Colombian
rooting section.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.090
And we actually rooted for them.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:50.360
But I sat with a
bunch of Colombians.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.080
And they said,
where are you from?

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:51.430
And I said, Miami.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:52.630
He said that's the
same as Colombia.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:53.910
Which is really kind of true.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.879
And they won that game,
as you may recall.

00:38:55.879 --> 00:38:56.670
It was a good game.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:59.260
But anyway, go ahead.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.545
And can you do the dance
that your team does?

00:39:01.545 --> 00:39:02.670
AUDIENCE: I'm not going to.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:04.730
DAVE BARRY: OK.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:07.150
AUDIENCE: My first
question is, what

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:09.890
prompted you to move to
Miami in the first place?

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:10.910
DAVE BARRY: OK, you want
me to answer that first?

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:11.300
AUDIENCE: Yup.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.850
DAVE BARRY: Good, then I
don't have to remember it.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.420
The "Miami Herald" hired me.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.900
And for reasons of-- incredibly
poor planning on their part--

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.200
they located the "Miami
Herald" in Miami.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.040
Rather than an English
speaking country or city.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:24.876
But anyway, no.

00:39:24.876 --> 00:39:26.660
The "Herald" hired
me, and at first I

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.410
didn't want to move there.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.860
I lived in suburban
Philadelphia at the time.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.960
In lovely little quiet suburban,
not even really suburban,

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.620
more like a forested place.

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.530
And I went to Miami,
and I said, my god, I'm

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:42.140
never going to move down here.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.515
And they said,
you don't have to.

00:39:43.515 --> 00:39:45.720
You can stay in Miami and
be our humor columnist.

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.435
I mean stay in Glen
Mills, Pennsylvania

00:39:47.435 --> 00:39:48.560
and be our humor columnist.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.694
So I, for three years,
was the humor columnist

00:39:52.694 --> 00:39:54.110
for the "Miami
Herald," but living

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:55.980
in suburban Philadelphia.

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.890
And during those
three years, I kept

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:00.580
visiting-- to do
stories and whatever--

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.490
and I came to love Miami.

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:03.950
And I really love it now.

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:05.860
I would never live
anywhere else.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.820
I mean, it is, as you know,
it's a completely insane city,

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.700
but it's a really
interesting, fun city.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:14.738
And it doesn't look like
that out there, now, there.

00:40:14.738 --> 00:40:15.404
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:40:15.404 --> 00:40:16.380
Absolutely.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.510
So my second question's
sort of related to that.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.570
Do you think your
career would have

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.610
been very different had you
not had the craziness of Miami?

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:25.110
DAVE BARRY: Yeah,
it probably would.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:28.890
I mean, definitely,
probably, 60% to 70%

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:30.790
of the material I've
had over the years

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:32.690
has come from where I am.

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:34.672
So, yeah it would
have been different.

00:40:34.672 --> 00:40:36.630
I mean, I still would
have been a humor writer,

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:40.220
but I would never have known
about the kind of wild world

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:44.270
down there, which, to
this day sort of fuels me.

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:47.077
I feel alive when
I'm down there.

00:40:47.077 --> 00:40:49.035
If nothing else, because
of the random gunfire.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.180
No.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.220
It's not so bad.

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.390
It's really not.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:55.630
It's not random, really.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.450
It's much more targeted
than it used to be.

00:41:00.387 --> 00:41:01.220
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:02.637
DAVE BARRY: You're welcome.

00:41:02.637 --> 00:41:03.136
Yeah?

00:41:03.136 --> 00:41:03.677
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:03.677 --> 00:41:04.502
Thanks for coming.

00:41:04.502 --> 00:41:06.210
My dad and I used to
listen to your books

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:07.780
in the car on the way to
school in the morning.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.155
DAVE BARRY: You're
trying to make

00:41:09.155 --> 00:41:11.769
me feel even older than
I already am, right?

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:13.935
This is right after the
Civil War, you and your dad.

00:41:16.166 --> 00:41:17.790
AUDIENCE: But one of
our favorite books

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:19.310
was "Dave Barry in Cyberspace."

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:21.450
And I was wondering, in
the intervening years,

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.470
I'm sure the internet's had
a big impact on your career,

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:23.970
and such.

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:26.409
So is it time to write "Dave
Barry in Cyberspace 2.0?"

00:41:26.409 --> 00:41:27.450
DAVE BARRY: I don't know.

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:29.725
Melissa, who introduced me,
was saying the same thing.

00:41:29.725 --> 00:41:30.850
That she really liked that.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:33.740
See, I find that book
hideously embarrassing now.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.930
You know, everything
about it just so dated.

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:39.510
And it moves so
fast, I don't know

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:43.160
that I could ever write about
the internet in a book that

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.129
wouldn't immediately
be so out of date.

00:41:46.129 --> 00:41:47.670
I wrote a book about
bad songs, once,

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:49.550
it was kind of the same thing.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:52.770
At the time, when I wrote it,
it was like in the early '90s,

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.021
and everybody was sort of
listening to the same music

00:41:55.021 --> 00:41:55.520
then.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.570
But you could never--
to write that book now.

00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:00.140
And besides, I don't even know
what bad would mean anymore,

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.550
to be honest with you.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:05.680
No, you know, these kids today
with their rock 'n' roll.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.290
I don't know.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.140
I write, occasionally,
about the internet,

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:08.970
it's just so much a
part of our lives,

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:11.470
but I don't think I would ever
try to write a book about it.

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:13.512
I don't think you can
capture it anymore.

00:42:13.512 --> 00:42:14.220
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.310
DAVE BARRY: Not that
I even did then.

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:16.105
Yeah?

00:42:16.105 --> 00:42:19.390
AUDIENCE: So I have a story to
thank you, and then a question.

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:20.480
So, I didn't grow up here.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.313
I grew up in Israel.

00:42:21.313 --> 00:42:23.930
And when I met my
family-- my wife's family

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:26.640
did grow up in New
York, upstate New York.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.060
And it was kind
of important to me

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.559
to make a good
impression them but I

00:42:29.559 --> 00:42:32.000
had like zero cultural
reference basis.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.880
So I discovered two things
that could make me, like,

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.184
impress my wife's parents,
especially her father.

00:42:37.184 --> 00:42:39.350
One was reading the baseball
stats the night before,

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.690
so I could quote them back
at him in the morning.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:44.770
But the other thing was,
my view of American culture

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:46.329
was very much shaped
by your books.

00:42:46.329 --> 00:42:48.120
And I only had your
'80s books, so it might

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.230
have been a little outdated.

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:53.400
But it definitely made a
very favorable impression.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.324
So, who knows, I might
not be here today

00:42:55.324 --> 00:42:56.240
if it weren't for you.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:56.530
Thank you.

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:57.196
DAVE BARRY: Wow!

00:42:57.196 --> 00:42:59.522
So you owe me money.

00:42:59.522 --> 00:43:01.290
AUDIENCE: What?

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:03.085
DAVE BARRY: The way
I read that question.

00:43:06.045 --> 00:43:07.420
AUDIENCE: The
actual question is,

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.870
so, the persona you
project in your books

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:12.970
is, like obviously, a
very exaggerated version

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:13.820
of lots of things.

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.270
But I've always wondered
if, like, there's

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:16.160
some basis in fact.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.201
For example, when you
describe how you go and buy

00:43:18.201 --> 00:43:21.040
a car by sitting at the Dairy
Queen opposite, and so on.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.840
You can see that I'm
reading your old books.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:28.370
Is that, like, an exaggeration
of something that happened,

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.929
or is it just totally unrelated
to your actual persona?

00:43:30.929 --> 00:43:31.720
DAVE BARRY: No, no.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:35.270
I mean, I don't run around
the house making jokes.

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.780
And I compare it to, like,
if you lived with a magician,

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.740
and all day long he was
pulling coins out of your ears,

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.130
you would hate him.

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:43.790
So I think I'm a normal person.

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:48.550
But yes, most humor comes
from something real.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:50.940
I've always said that what
people laugh the hardest at

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.394
is not something that nobody
would have thought of before,

00:43:54.394 --> 00:43:56.060
but it's something
that everyone already

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:57.696
does sort of think
on some level,

00:43:57.696 --> 00:43:59.320
and you've just
pointed it out to them.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.620
That's when people
really laugh the hardest.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.874
So generally, I never
think in terms of,

00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:05.040
like, I'm going to use this.

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.100
I'm going to use
this for material.

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.016
I'm going to use this.

00:44:07.016 --> 00:44:11.231
Just sort of living a life,
material will come to you.

00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:11.730
Anyway.

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:15.430
By the way, I went to
Israel the year before last.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.600
With my temple, which I
belong to, because-- like,

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.990
there's orthodox, conservative,
reformed-- mine is relaxed.

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:22.800
They'll let anybody in.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.580
So I belong to it, even
though I'm not Jewish.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.760
And I loved Israel, except
for the camel ride, which I'm

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.730
sure no Israeli would ever do.

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:34.290
The Bedouin have a camel
ride in the desert.

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:36.380
You go in the bus,
and they stop,

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:39.132
and there's like a train
of camels with saddles,

00:44:39.132 --> 00:44:40.090
and then you go around.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:42.760
And what I remember,
was when they give you

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.850
the little lecture-- the safety
lecture-- the Bedouin guy.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:49.250
When you climb onto
the saddle, he goes,

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:51.175
do not scream when
camel is getting up.

00:44:51.175 --> 00:44:53.120
Camel is getting
up a little funny.

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.822
And I'm going, like,
how bad can it-- Waah!

00:44:56.822 --> 00:44:58.280
But after, like,
riding just, like,

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.196
a quarter of a mile on
a camel, which is not

00:45:00.196 --> 00:45:01.570
a comfortable
ride, I'm thinking,

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:04.546
no wonder the Middle
East is so tense.

00:45:04.546 --> 00:45:07.850
If this is how people
are getting around.

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:09.480
Anyway, thank you.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.190
Yeah?

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.730
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:10.940
DAVE BARRY: Yeah.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.540
AUDIENCE: So I told my family
that you were speaking here

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.096
today, and my dad said, wow,
well, your younger brother--

00:45:15.096 --> 00:45:16.470
who's a freshman
in high school--

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:18.303
has a writing assignment
to write an article

00:45:18.303 --> 00:45:20.260
in the style of Dave Barry.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.730
So you're still influencing
many high schoolers today.

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:24.688
DAVE BARRY: Which is a
little terrifying to me.

00:45:24.688 --> 00:45:27.825
Over the years, I've
heard that many times.

00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:29.500
The one thing that
I hate the most,

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.410
is when the teacher
assigns them, read this,

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:34.320
he's a great American humorist.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.927
Like, when I heard
that from my teachers,

00:45:37.927 --> 00:45:40.010
I already hated whoever
it was that I had to read.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:42.000
You know?

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.880
And like, every now
and then, the teacher

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:47.210
will send me a whole
batch of-- the students

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:50.630
all had to write something
to me, like, you know,

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:51.400
about my essay.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.190
And usually it's just like, I
read your essay, it was funny.

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:55.890
Sometimes it was like, I
didn't think it was that good.

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:59.395
Well, fuck you, kid, I
didn't ask you to read it.

00:45:59.395 --> 00:46:02.010
It wasn't my idea that you
had to read this thing.

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:02.670
I'm sorry.

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:05.830
I don't mean your
brother or sister.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:08.180
AUDIENCE: I'll let you know
what his sentiments are.

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:10.410
But related to your
style, have you

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:11.854
found that that
voice in your head

00:46:11.854 --> 00:46:14.020
has remained essentially
the same since high school?

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.478
Or have you
consciously adapted it?

00:46:15.478 --> 00:46:18.162
Or has it become more optimistic
or more cynical over the years?

00:46:18.162 --> 00:46:19.620
DAVE BARRY: I get
asked that a lot.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:20.599
I don't really know.

00:46:20.599 --> 00:46:22.390
I don't feel as though
I've changed at all.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:23.860
I must have changed,
because I've

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.600
been doing this for like, what,
40 years, something like that.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.870
I don't feel any differently.

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:33.530
If I have changed, it's
been pretty gradual.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.560
I still feel basically
that what I do

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:39.310
is I write silly humor,
rather than satire,

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:43.470
which I always viewed as
humor that was not funny.

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:45.560
Or meaningful,
point making humor.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.580
I'm just looking for
the next easy joke.

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:51.475
I'm not really trying
to help anybody.

00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:54.810
And every now and then somebody
will say to me, you know,

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:56.887
people, when I laughed,
it made me feel better.

00:46:56.887 --> 00:46:58.720
I was going through a
tough time in my life,

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.195
and I read your stuff,
and I felt better.

00:47:00.195 --> 00:47:01.790
Or I got along
better with my son.

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:03.160
And I said, that's great,
but I would have done it

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.805
even if it made you feel worse.

00:47:04.805 --> 00:47:07.850
Because it's the only
skill I actually have.

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:08.350
Anyway.

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:09.485
I don't think I've changed much.

00:47:09.485 --> 00:47:10.420
AUDIENCE: All right,
well, keep it up, then.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:11.670
DAVE BARRY: Thank you, I will.

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:12.230
Yeah?

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:13.120
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for coming.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.290
DAVE BARRY: No,
it's my pleasure.

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:15.998
AUDIENCE: My dad and
I read your articles

00:47:15.998 --> 00:47:17.640
as well, very consistently.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.806
I read "Tricky Business"
and "Big Trouble,"

00:47:19.806 --> 00:47:21.680
and I think I have a
very good sense of-- you

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.382
have a very distinct voice.

00:47:23.382 --> 00:47:25.340
And somehow I totally
missed that "Big Trouble"

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.522
was made into a movie.

00:47:26.522 --> 00:47:28.480
Someone tells me about
it, and I'm like, oh no.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.938
Oh no, they're
going to mess it up.

00:47:29.938 --> 00:47:32.955
There's no way they're going to
capture his voice in film form.

00:47:32.955 --> 00:47:34.437
And I was so happy
that it really

00:47:34.437 --> 00:47:36.270
felt like it was your
writing in movie form.

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:37.686
DAVE BARRY: I'm
glad you liked it.

00:47:37.686 --> 00:47:41.950
There actually is, in my
Russia essay, in this book.

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:45.215
"Big Trouble" is-- I wrote
a novel set in Florida

00:47:45.215 --> 00:47:48.310
called "Big Trouble," where
basically a couple of losers

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:52.140
get hold of a nuclear
bomb suitcase.

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:55.430
They think it's emeralds,
but it's a nuclear weapon.

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:59.262
And this was
hilarious madcap plot.

00:47:59.262 --> 00:48:01.720
The only problem is that the
movie was supposed to come out

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:04.970
on September 12, 2001.

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:05.920
The day after 9/11.

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:08.910
And so you're not
going to have a madcap

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:13.300
comedy about a bomb in a plane
come out after-- nobody gets

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.290
killed in the movie or
in the book-- but still,

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:16.260
it was just all wrong.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.450
So the movie came
out kind of, like,

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:20.430
secretly six months later.

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:22.880
And it didn't make
much of a ripple.

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.960
It became sort of a
cult-- you can still

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:29.030
see it on TV, sometimes.

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:32.710
But when I went to
Russia, the one thing

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:36.030
I learned from the talks Ridley
and I gave around Russia.

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:39.100
I would always ask
them, what do they

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.940
think our stereotypical
views of them are.

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.910
What are their
stereotypical views of us?

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:46.300
Their stereotypical
views of was always like,

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.530
we're a bunch of consumer
obsessed people who

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:49.738
don't care about [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:49.738 --> 00:48:51.780
You know, totally
accurate, to be honest.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:53.680
And they always
said ours of them

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.910
was that they are vodka
drinking, balaklava

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:59.632
playing gangsters.

00:48:59.632 --> 00:49:01.590
I heard the word gangsters
over and over again.

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:05.590
So the last night I was there,
we were in St Petersburg.

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:08.180
And we were at the
American consulate,

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:10.670
where they have, once
a month, a movie night,

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:12.600
where they bring
in Russian citizens

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.920
and show them American movies.

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.820
These usually people
who speak some English.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.070
And it's meant to just build
relations between the two

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:19.800
countries.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.399
And usually it's some
traditional American classic.

00:49:22.399 --> 00:49:23.940
But because I was
there, they decided

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.210
to show them "Big Trouble".

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:27.434
Which was fine.

00:49:27.434 --> 00:49:29.350
And then he said, would
you introduce the book

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:31.330
to the crowd, and then
answer questions after?

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:32.038
And I said, sure.

00:49:32.038 --> 00:49:34.360
So I get up in front of
all of these Russians.

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:38.795
And I just gone over the
plot, because I hadn't seen it

00:49:38.795 --> 00:49:39.680
in years.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.520
And I realized that
there are Russians

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:44.300
in-- the good news is there
are Russians in this movie.

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:47.610
The bad news is
they're gangsters.

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:49.890
The only Russian
characters in movie.

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:52.242
Because it was based on an
actual incident in Miami,

00:49:52.242 --> 00:49:53.950
where they closed down
a bar in Jai-Alai,

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:56.650
which was Russians
selling surplus

00:49:56.650 --> 00:50:02.267
Soviet illegally obtained
military weaponry.

00:50:02.267 --> 00:50:03.850
And I turned them
into people who were

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:05.862
selling a nuclear suitcase.

00:50:05.862 --> 00:50:08.460
But anyway, I had to get up in
front of all these Russians,

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.250
and say, there are
Russians in it.

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:11.090
So, big smiles.

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:11.840
They're gangsters.

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.132
You know, like.

00:50:14.132 --> 00:50:15.590
But they're really
smart gangsters.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.800
The American gangsters
are stupid in my movie.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.480
So I don't know if
that mollified them.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.129
Did you have a question, or am
I just blithering away up here?

00:50:22.129 --> 00:50:23.170
AUDIENCE: That was great.

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:26.239
But I was curious how
much influence you

00:50:26.239 --> 00:50:27.530
were able to have in the movie.

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:30.780
And also being a fan of
your "Peter and the" series,

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.775
hearing that that may be
becoming a movie as well.

00:50:33.775 --> 00:50:35.900
If you'll be able to
influence that in the same way

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:37.108
you influenced "Big Trouble"?

00:50:37.108 --> 00:50:38.960
DAVE BARRY: With the
movie, not really much.

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.810
I mean, I got to hang around
and watch them make it,

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:41.393
which was fun.

00:50:41.393 --> 00:50:44.250
And see how ridiculously
the amount of money

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:47.169
they spend on things like
food when they make a movie.

00:50:47.169 --> 00:50:48.960
And Barry Sonnenfeld,
who was the director,

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:49.793
was very nice to me.

00:50:49.793 --> 00:50:52.419
And he allowed me
free access to the set

00:50:52.419 --> 00:50:54.710
at all times, which I later
learned was because I never

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:55.620
suggested anything.

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:57.320
Usually they don't want the
writer anywhere near it,

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.730
because they change everything.

00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:59.980
You sort of get used to that.

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:02.372
"Peter and the Star
Catchers," I don't know

00:51:02.372 --> 00:51:03.580
that it will ever be a movie.

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:04.580
There was talk that it would be.

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.190
This is the prequel
to "Peter Pan,"

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:07.880
that I wrote with a guy named
Ridley Pearson, the guy I

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:08.890
went to Russia with.

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:10.680
And we end up running
a bunch of books.

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.510
It did become a
Broadway play-- which

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:15.250
won five Tony awards-- called
"Peter and the Starcatcher."

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:18.180
And it's still touring
the country as a play.

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.810
The play was adapted by a
guy named Rick Ellis, who

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:21.690
wrote "Jersey Boys."

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:23.981
And it's actually a lot
funnier than the book we wrote.

00:51:23.981 --> 00:51:26.900
We wrote sort of a
straightforward kids' adventure

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.650
story.

00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:31.699
And Rick made it for grownups,
and very, very funny.

00:51:31.699 --> 00:51:33.240
Anyway, that's what
happened to that.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.610
Thank you.

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:37.050
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:38.460
DAVE BARRY: Everybody says that.

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.370
You're very polite.

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:40.940
I mean, I had to come.

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:43.045
Katie McKee, back
there, my publicist,

00:51:43.045 --> 00:51:45.170
made me come here, because
she wants the food here.

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:46.169
She likes the cafeteria.

00:51:49.466 --> 00:51:50.840
AUDIENCE: I had
a simple question

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:54.170
about how do you think
the-- generally, when

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:57.770
I try to show American
humor to my parents, who

00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:04.356
are from India, they kind of
think, like, that's very banal.

00:52:04.356 --> 00:52:05.730
It's not really--
They don't even

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:08.600
laugh at, like, things
which I laugh at.

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.990
And I find it really wise.

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:13.490
Some say, for example, all
the beer is much faster.

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:17.725
I would tell it to my parents,
and they would say, hmm, OK.

00:52:17.725 --> 00:52:19.350
DAVE BARRY: You need
new friends, dude.

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.050
AUDIENCE: What are
the general humor

00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:27.030
that you have found, since
you have presented at Russia--

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:28.490
you covered a lot of Russia.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:30.989
I was hoping to look through,
like, all right, India, India,

00:52:30.989 --> 00:52:31.610
no, no.

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:33.210
DAVE BARRY: I
didn't get to India.

00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:35.990
AUDIENCE: And so what
are the sets of humor

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:37.650
that you find-- say,
satire is probably

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:39.800
not-- you do mention
that it's not probably

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.670
that cross cutting.

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:42.280
Try talking satire
to your girlfriend,

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.221
and making, not so much.

00:52:44.221 --> 00:52:44.720
Right?

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.980
So that actually works across
all cultures very well.

00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:50.490
And what are some which
don't really jell,

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:52.275
and they sometimes
insult people.

00:52:52.275 --> 00:52:55.370
DAVE BARRY: Yeah, I've
never really been sure.

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:57.970
The only foreign country
where my humor has,

00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:01.830
I know, has done reasonably
well, is England.

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:05.440
And as you probably know,
they speak English over there.

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.353
Not as well as we
do, in my-- no.

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:11.670
Even then, it's difficult.

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.860
The first book tour
I went on in England.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:20.410
They all think we're
idiots, I mean, the Brits,

00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:21.160
in terms of humor.

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.780
They think they are way more
sophisticated than we are.

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:26.680
And maybe they
are, I don't know.

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.200
But they feel that
American humor,

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:32.230
it tends to be primitive,
and they're much more attuned

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:34.189
to sarcasm and irony.

00:53:34.189 --> 00:53:35.230
Again, they may be right.

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:36.710
But I remember, I
went on a book tour.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:38.001
I don't even remember the book.

00:53:38.001 --> 00:53:40.060
This was, like, a long time ago.

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:43.780
And I would go into BBC
show after BBC show,

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.700
that's all I did.

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:46.200
And I would get
into a little studio

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.590
with a very well educated
BBC guy, who would

00:53:49.590 --> 00:53:51.309
speak much better than I did.

00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:52.850
And we'd do an
interview for an hour.

00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:54.550
And then I go out and get in
a car, drive through London

00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:55.720
traffic for an hour.

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.470
And go back into, what
looked to me, like,

00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:58.970
exactly the same room.

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:00.320
Maybe even the same BBC guy.

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:00.820
You know?

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.190
They have, like, 300 shows.

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:03.280
And do another.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.270
But what I remember was, this
book-- "The New York Times"

00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:09.740
had run a book review where
some reviewer who didn't even

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.200
work for "The New
York Times" said,

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.990
Mr Barry is the
funniest man in America.

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:18.094
And so, of course every,
publicity person ever

00:54:18.094 --> 00:54:19.760
since used that quote.
"New York Times,"

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.670
funniest man in America.

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:21.840
It really wasn't
"The New York Times,"

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.425
and who cares what "The
New York Times" thinks

00:54:23.425 --> 00:54:24.258
about humor, anyway?

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:31.280
But every single BBC interviewer
would start this way,

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:35.500
our next guest
has been described

00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:40.400
as the funniest man in America.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:44.810
Which was like,
we'll see about that.

00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:46.161
And would have to win them over.

00:54:46.161 --> 00:54:46.660
You know?

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:47.610
So it was painful.

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:50.210
But that's the only country
where I'm sure of it.

00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:54.850
I, every day practically, get
a book of mine in the mail,

00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:58.369
that the publishers have to
send you when it gets published.

00:54:58.369 --> 00:55:00.410
And half the time I don't
even know what the book

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:01.701
is, since I can't even read it.

00:55:01.701 --> 00:55:04.720
It's not even in our alphabet.

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:07.467
So I don't know what book it is.

00:55:07.467 --> 00:55:08.800
I have no idea what it's saying.

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:11.240
I have no if anybody thinks
it's funny anywhere, at all.

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.480
I just don't know.

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.720
But I think you should
tell everyone in India

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.820
to buy my book and find out.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.240
Thank you.

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:19.740
Yeah.

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:22.740
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:24.150
DAVE BARRY: No, thank you.

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:25.730
AUDIENCE: Aw, you're welcome.

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:28.110
I'm wondering how you
feel about-- you know,

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:31.065
Florida humor has become more
popular these days, with,

00:55:31.065 --> 00:55:33.050
like, the Florida
Man Twitter account,

00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:34.810
and the Florida Woman
Twitter account.

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:37.940
And, like, everything that
people from Florida do.

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:40.472
Like when that guy ate that
person's face, or I don't know,

00:55:40.472 --> 00:55:41.180
whatever they do.

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.471
DAVE BARRY: That was hilarious.

00:55:42.471 --> 00:55:43.096
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:43.096 --> 00:55:45.137
Not so much for that person
whose face got eaten.

00:55:45.137 --> 00:55:46.150
But for everybody else.

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:49.560
I'm wondering how you feel about
Florida humor becoming more,

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:52.680
like, degenerate and
more mainstream, I guess,

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.610
and different from the, sort
of like, '80s Florida humor,

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:57.407
where like, it was
mostly cocaine gangsters

00:55:57.407 --> 00:55:58.240
shooting each other.

00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.198
DAVE BARRY: I'm for it.

00:55:59.198 --> 00:56:01.580
I mean, in fact, I'm planning
to write a book about it,

00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:03.840
about Florida.

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.860
There is something-- you know,
after all these years there-- I

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:08.320
used to just say,
well, we're just

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.870
saying that because we're here.

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:12.600
But I genuinely think there
is something truly unusually

00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.910
weird about Florida.

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:17.610
At one point, we just
overtook California

00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:19.480
in the just weirdness level.

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:23.230
And there's really no one clear
explanation for what happened,

00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:25.480
except that everybody
who's there is there

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.857
for a bad reason.

00:56:27.857 --> 00:56:29.940
Nobody ever just says, I'm
going to go to Florida,

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:33.250
and live a clean, upright
life, and be productive.

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:34.390
That person doesn't exist.

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.098
You know, they went
there because they're

00:56:36.098 --> 00:56:38.240
done with working.

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:42.260
Or they know that it's easier
to do illegal things there.

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:46.160
Or you could run for office
in five minutes and win.

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:50.720
My proposal in Miami was that to
streamline our government, when

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:53.840
we have an election, we should
swear them in and indict them

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.560
in one ceremony.

00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:59.330
I've been in Miami 30 years,
and like, gee, they come and go.

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:00.980
People just show up, and
they're suddenly, like,

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.104
pillars of the community,
and then they're in jail.

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:07.780
In Miami is only one, like,
part of the wilderness.

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:10.540
Then there's Orlando, which
is its own kind of weird.

00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:11.563
So I'm for it.

00:57:11.563 --> 00:57:15.270
I'm for the prevalence
of Florida awareness

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:18.470
out there, because I hope
to write a book about it.

00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:21.510
So purely for just venal
reasons, I think it's good.

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:22.650
AUDIENCE: Makes sense.

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:23.650
DAVE BARRY: Yeah?

00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:25.150
AUDIENCE: So near
the beginning, you

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:26.490
said that when you're
in high school,

00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:28.220
you could make farting
noises with your hands.

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:28.460
DAVE BARRY: Yeah.

00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:30.230
AUDIENCE: Can you still do that?

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:32.860
DAVE BARRY: Well, could
you hold the microphone?

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.240
I'm not in-- wait!

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.610
That far away?

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:42.490
[FARTING NOISES]

00:57:44.104 --> 00:57:45.020
DAVE BARRY: Thank you.

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:46.364
Thank you very much.

00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:51.190
And I'm sure if Joyce
Carol Oates were here,

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:52.870
you would ask her
to do that, as well.

00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:56.490
Well anyway, I think we're sort
of through the allotted time,

00:57:56.490 --> 00:57:57.810
and well beyond it.

00:57:57.810 --> 00:57:59.150
But thank you all for coming.

00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:01.320
This has been-- I
actually enjoyed this.

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.780
And I don't always say that on
book tour, but this was fun.

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.600
Thank you.
