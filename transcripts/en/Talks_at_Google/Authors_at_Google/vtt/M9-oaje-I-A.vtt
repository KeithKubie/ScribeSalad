00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.580
MALE SPEAKER: I'm incredibly
excited to be on stage here

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:19.410
introducing Andy Weir, the
author of "The Martian."

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.300
I read the book last
year, and it was

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.850
my favorite book of all 2014.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.050
And I've lost track of how
many engineer friends I have,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.960
that I respect, who also say
it was their favorite book

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.244
of last year.

00:00:32.244 --> 00:00:33.160
Andy is the son of a--

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.201
ANDY WEIR: What about the
ones you don't respect?

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.820
SPEAKER: They-- they think
it was not very good.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.612
Andy is the son of a
particle physicists

00:00:40.612 --> 00:00:42.320
and has a background
in computer science.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.750
He began writing 'The
Martian' in 2009,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.850
researching related
material to try

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.150
to make the book as
realistic as possible

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.460
and based on real technology.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.290
Andy's book is an
extraordinary adventure

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.870
about human ingenuity and humor
in the face of great odds.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.940
Although, it falls easily into
the science fiction genre,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.880
it's a book for every one.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.730
It has remained on
Amazon's best seller

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.080
list since its
publication last year.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.790
And it was the winner
of the 2015 Audie Award

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.710
for best science fiction.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.850
A film version of
the book is actually

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.790
coming out in October,
directed by Ridley Scott

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.860
and starring Matt Damon
and Jessica Chastain.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.860
Please join me in
giving a Google warm

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.630
welcome. to Andy Weir.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.040
ANDY WEIR: Thank you.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.540
Hello.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.460
Hi everybody.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.020
Oh cool, the wander around mike.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.450
Good.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.100
So, I'll just give--
I'll preface this

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.590
by saying I threw out
my back this morning.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.560
So, I may have to sit
down during my talk, which

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.270
is why they've set
up this chair for me.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.885
That's what I get
for turning 40.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.230
So, I'm going to tell you a
little bit about the story

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.910
behind the story,
and then I'll get

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.825
into the things you
actually care about,

00:01:58.825 --> 00:02:00.020
the details of the movie.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.040
So, I always wanted
to be a writer.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.760
All my life I loved writing.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.270
I loved science fiction.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.630
I grew up with reading
my dad's endless supply

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.400
of classic sci-fi,
which is interesting

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.650
because he'd grown up
just collecting, kind of,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.600
pulpy sci-fi books.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.215
And, so I ended up reading,
kind of, one generation off.

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:23.700
I Don't think dad ever
thrown away a book.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.780
And he has- he had
a bookshelf that

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.780
was about six feet high,
three feet wide, one foot deep

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.620
just jam packed
full of sci-fi books

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.760
from the '50s '60s and '70s.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.160
So that's what I
grew up reading.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.049
And so my idols are Heinlein,
and Clarke, and Asimov.

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.590
And a lot of those
books don't really

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.910
stand up today
especially when you

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.150
talk about the role
of women in society.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.300
But if you grade
them on a curve,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.580
they're still really good.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.250
Anyway when the time came for
me to choose a college major,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.540
I kind of-- there were
two things I really liked.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.150
I liked writing and I
liked computer programming.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.920
And I wanted to be
a writer, but I also

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.670
want to eat regular meals.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.110
And I wanted to live somewhere
other than a box in an alley,

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.020
so I decided I'll be
a computer programmer.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.120
So I went into
computer programming.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.770
And I did that for
about 25 years.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.690
Or actually I started
when I was 15,

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.160
because I ended up working
for a national lab in town.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.370
I grew up in
Livermore, California.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.870
Woo.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.040
There's a whoo.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.490
Thank you one person.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.970
And, so, I end up working there
as a test tube cleaner lab

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.690
assistant guy.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.150
And they said, well, we don't
need you to clean test tubes,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.110
but we need someone to figure
out how to present this data.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.090
There's a computer.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.500
Here's a book on programming.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.850
Come back when you
figured it out.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.650
That began a 25 year career
in computer programming.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.220
Anyway, I went to college.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.550
And I actually dropped out
because I ran out of money,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.420
because that's kind of the
norm for my generation.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.860
And I ended up going into the
computer programming field.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.630
I worked for a couple places.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.320
I was actually one of the
programmers on Warcraft II,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.900
when I worked for Blizzard.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.020
So, yes, you can thank
me for some of those lost

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.070
productive hours of your youth.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.060
And then-- and then later
on I worked for AOL.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.020
And I worked for
AOL until 1999, when

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.940
I got laid off along with
800 of my closest friends

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.810
because they merged
with Netscape.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.240
Yes, that's how
long ago that was.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.440
Now at the time at a
bunch of stock options.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.010
And, so, I was forced to
sell these stock options.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.770
I had 60 days to sell
them or lose them.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.530
So I sold at what turned out
to be AOL's peak price ever.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.400
So I assure you I would not have
made any sort of wise market

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.010
decisions if left
to my own devices,

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.949
but I was forced to do this.

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.490
And I ended up with
a bunch of money.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.190
And I'm like, hey, I've got a
bunch of money, now is my shot.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.420
I can live for a few years
without having a job, which

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.130
is good because it was 1999.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.570
All engineers lived a few
years without having a job.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.440
And I'm going to take my
shot at writing, here we go.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.020
I'm going to write a book.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.770
So I took three years
off, and I wrote a book.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.630
And it was not "The Martian."

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.740
So, you may wonder why
you haven't heard of it.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.250
It's because it
wasn't very good.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.620
It was actually my second book.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.910
I wrote a book in
college that was

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.470
so bad, even I knew it was bad.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.560
And it was before the
era of the internet,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.120
so there are no digital
copies out there.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.750
No one will ever find it.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.880
There's only one physical
copy left that I know,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.280
and my mother has it and
won't tell me where it is.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.190
Because she knows what'll
happen if she does.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.960
The second book,
I did post online.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.000
It was OK.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.750
The plot was decent,
but the prose was awful.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.090
And it's really awkward
to read, but you

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.120
know it was my second pancake.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.560
And, so, I had the
standard sad experience

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.320
that all struggling
authors have.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.370
Couldn't get an agent.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.450
Couldn't get a
publisher Interested.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.460
Just nobody was interested.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.350
And after three
years no success,

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.310
I went back into the
software industry.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.350
Now this wasn't a
huge defeat for me,

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.570
because I actually really
like programming computers.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.940
I've always-- I've always
enjoyed that aspect of my job.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.480
And I've always enjoyed the
high salary that comes with it.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.250
But I went back in
the programming.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.575
And around this time,
it's around 2002ish,

00:06:12.575 --> 00:06:15.790
and now the-- know the internet
is starting to really creep

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.110
up and become more popular.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.094
Everyone's got an
internet connection.

00:06:19.094 --> 00:06:20.510
Everyone knows how
to use the web.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.380
And I thought, OK,
so what I'll do

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.320
is I'll write stories
for fun and just

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.770
post them to a website.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.097
And I can-- that way I can get
an audience reading my stuff.

00:06:30.097 --> 00:06:32.180
And I don't need to make
a profession out of this.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.640
It'll just be a hobby.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.080
So that's what I did
for about 10 years.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.080
I made-- I started
out making web comics.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.850
I made a web comic called "Casey
and Andy," back in the day.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.230
And then another one
called "Chesire Crossing."

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.510
And then I realized I'm A,
a terrible artist, in and B,

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.730
I don't like doing art.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.270
So I went to writing short
fiction or long fiction,

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.100
whatever, just
narrative fiction.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.660
And so I spent a lot
of time doing that.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.960
Just posting short stories
and serials to my website.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.710
I wrote one short
story called "The Egg"

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.750
that was very popular, and
that brought a lot of people

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.350
to my site and helped
build up a mailing list.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.810
And around the time I started
"The Martian," which was just

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.880
a serial I was
posting to my website,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.550
I had about maybe
3,000 regular readers.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.260
But they were all science
minded dorks like myself.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.870
And, so, it was kind of cool,
because as I posted chapter

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.440
by chapter, I posted a chapter
maybe every six to eight weeks,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.320
they would email
and say, excuse me

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.669
you got something
wrong on page 17.

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:28.960
And, so, that was really handy.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.140
It was-- I called
them beta readers.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.990
So that process went
really smoothly.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.410
And it-- but it wasn't
some laser like focus.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.930
It was like sometimes
I'd go months

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.130
without posting a chapter.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.200
It took me three years
to write the thing.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.220
And I was working
on other serials

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.650
and short stories of the time.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.930
So while I was writing "The
Martian," this hard sci-fi

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.590
story about this man
stranded on Mars,

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.480
I was also writing a story
about aliens invading earth,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.920
and a story about a mermaid in
the 19th century a New England.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.270
So it's sort of an
eclectic group of stories.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.320
Anyway, so eventually I
finished "The Martian." and.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.890
I thought, OK, I'm done,
moving on with life,

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.020
on to other things.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.550
But I started to get email
from people saying, hey.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.050
I really enjoy "The
Martian," but I

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.930
hate reading it on your
site, which is fair

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:14.940
because my site is crap.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.207
Can you make an
e-reader version?

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.540
So I figured out how to do that.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.584
I made an e-reader version,
an EPUB, and a MOBI.

00:08:22.584 --> 00:08:25.000
And I just posted them on the
site, and said there you go.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.880
Then I got another email
from people saying,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.980
hey I love your
story, hate your site.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.280
But I appreciate that
there's an e-reader version,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.840
but I'm not very
technically savvy.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.340
And I don't know how to download
the thing from the internet

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.940
and put it on the my e-reader.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.980
So, can you just post it
on Amazon or something.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.210
So I figured how to do that.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:41.751
And I did it.

00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:44.360
And it was pretty easy.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.680
It's KDP, Kindle
Direct Publishing.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.840
There's no initial cost outlay.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.400
You just upload your
thing and you set a price.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.402
But you have to set a
price of at least $0.99,

00:08:54.402 --> 00:08:56.110
are not allowed to
give it away for free.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.070
It turns out Amazon
likes to make money.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.540
So, and you get a
percentage the royalties.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.885
And, so, I set the price
at the minimum $0.99,

00:09:04.885 --> 00:09:07.850
earning me a cool
$0.30 per copy.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.250
And told everybody all
right-- well, OK so first

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.480
off you do that, you
post it, and then they

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.640
hold onto it for
about 48 hours to have

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.050
an actual human look at it.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.300
Just to make sure you're
not posting a big goat porn

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:20.800
compendium.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.140
Don't judge.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:30.520
So, then once it's for
sale I posted to everybody.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.950
I said, OK, here you go.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.410
You can read on
my site for free.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.330
You can download the e-reader
version from my site for free.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.480
Or you can pay Amazon a buck
to put it on your Kindle, which

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.810
is basically what you're doing.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.310
And more people paid the
buck than anything else.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.470
They really-- it
just goes to show you

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.482
the reach that Amazon has
into the readership market,

00:09:49.482 --> 00:09:51.190
and that people are
willing to pay a buck

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.420
to avoid technical hassles.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.837
So it started to
sell really well.

00:09:54.837 --> 00:09:57.128
And it started working its
way up the top sellers list,

00:09:57.128 --> 00:09:58.490
in various categories in Amazon.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.450
Got Gone up into the
top 10 of sci-fi.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.060
Got up into number one in
sci-fi, into the top 20

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.134
in all Kindle.

00:10:05.134 --> 00:10:06.550
And, so, that's
when things really

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.190
start to snowball, right.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.437
Because now you've
got people going,

00:10:10.437 --> 00:10:11.520
oh, I want to read a book.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.080
I don't know.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.251
Whats-- I feel like sci-fi.

00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:15.500
What are the top 10 in sci-fi?

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.740
I'll pick one of those.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.640
So you get this--
a lot of exposure

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.340
by being on those lists.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.980
And so the sales really
went through the roof.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.185
And I didn't realize
how well they

00:10:25.185 --> 00:10:27.310
were selling, because I
had no experience with self

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.190
publishing.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.490
I looked at my sales
and I was like, huh,

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.470
I'm selling about
500 units a day.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.870
Is that good?

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.660
I don't know.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.740
It's self publishing.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.320
It seems like it's good.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.300
I can't tell.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.660
And then-- but
what's funny is when

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.620
you submit to KDP you
automatically become

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.230
part of this forum, where you
can talk to other authors.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.313
And, so there's this forum
where other authors are

00:10:49.313 --> 00:10:51.830
talking about their books and
how to market their books.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.746
And there are threads
where they say,

00:10:53.746 --> 00:10:54.870
tell us your sales numbers.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.430
Everybody post
your sales numbers.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.190
And people are like, I
sold five copies today man.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.110
That's awesome.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.600
Hurray for Christmas rush.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.390
And I'm like, I sold 500.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.550
I guess that's pretty good.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.690
So anyway, eventually, I
didn't know this was going on.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.690
But it got the attention
of Random House,

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.290
or actually
specifically by Crown.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.039
If you look at your
free copies you'll see

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:17.850
is published by Crown
Publishing, which

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.730
is a division of Random House.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.040
And at the time there's an
editor at Random House name

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.200
Julian Pavia, and
he was re-- he had

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.390
the book recommended to him.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.000
He'd heard about it and he saw
it was doing well on Amazon.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.200
And he thought,
should I read this.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:32.967
I don't know.

00:11:32.967 --> 00:11:35.050
Is it something that would
have mainstream appeal,

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:36.700
or is it just engineer porn.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.310
It's not clear.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.690
And so he said-- he was
talking to a colleague of his,

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.540
a literary agent
named David Fugate.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.230
And he said, I'm not sure if
I want to read this or not.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.684
And David said well,
I'll read it and let

00:11:47.684 --> 00:11:48.600
you know what I think.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.420
And he's all right.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.300
So David read it
and he liked it.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.300
And he came and said hey,
you want an agent, to me.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.250
And, so, after three
years of not being

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.460
able to even-- after three
years of just constant rejection

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.480
by agents, now later in life,
I have one knocking at my door.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.430
Which was pretty cool.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.370
And, so, I did some
research on him,

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.020
make sure he was a real person.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:11.010
And then said sure and he's
like-- and he's like alright.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.260
So Julian, how much you going
to pay us for this book.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.970
So he was-- he negotiated
the book deal with Jillian.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.600
And then while
that was going on,

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.820
20th Century Fox came
for the film rights,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.680
which is interesting, right.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.890
And those two negotiations
were going on at the same time.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.960
And both of them were--
both negotiations

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.320
were completed four days apart.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.030
So that was a very
eventful week for me.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.900
I got a print deal and a
movie deal in one week.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.850
So I was-- I had to take a
day off there just to go home

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.450
and lay down.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.690
I was so worked
up, and stressed,

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:49.860
and anxious it was horrible.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.960
I got-- I couldn't breathe.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.750
So anyway, the print
deal came together.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.070
We did some minor
editing on the book,

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.459
because of course once
a publisher gets it

00:13:01.459 --> 00:13:02.750
they want to make some changes.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.560
But pretty minor in the
grand scheme of things.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.370
No substantive plot changes.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.442
Just hey Andy, you got a little
excited in this section here.

00:13:10.442 --> 00:13:12.150
You have people talking
but never tell us

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.080
what room they're in
or what's going on.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.210
It's just a bunch of
floating dialogue.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.300
That sort of thing.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.026
And, hey Andy, nobody
anywhere understands

00:13:20.026 --> 00:13:22.400
what you were saying in this
paragraph of technical crap,

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.197
so simplify it.

00:13:26.197 --> 00:13:27.280
And then they released it.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.370
And it was-- in its
first week of sales

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.190
went straight to the
best seller list.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.770
So it really did very well.

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.730
And at the time
the movie rights--

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.850
so the way movie rights
deals work is it's

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.956
not just some guy drives
up in a limousine,

00:13:45.956 --> 00:13:47.580
hand you a pile of
money, and then they

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.750
go make a movie, right.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.910
It's a little more complicated.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:55.470
So the first thing they do
is they secure the option.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.777
So they're not actually
buying the rights yet.

00:13:57.777 --> 00:14:00.110
What they're doing is giving
you a small amount of money

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.100
to be the only studio that
is allowed to buy the rights.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.180
So they're securing
the exclusive option

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.400
to buy the rights.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.697
So you work out the whole deal.

00:14:07.697 --> 00:14:09.530
You work out the whole
rights purchase deal.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.730
It was a 34 page contract that
I had to sign and notarize

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.669
in four places.

00:14:14.669 --> 00:14:16.335
You work out that
whole deal in advance.

00:14:16.335 --> 00:14:17.950
Saying, here's a
big pile of money

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.984
we're going to give you
if we buy the rights.

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.650
And here's a part the
contract that says

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:22.960
only we can buy the rights.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.160
And here's a small pile
of money that we give you,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.789
so that you're willing to
agree to this option deal.

00:14:28.789 --> 00:14:30.580
And so they give you
a small pile of money.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.015
Then they have 18 months
to activate the contract.

00:14:34.015 --> 00:14:35.640
And they can just
activate the contract

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.480
by sending you the
big pile of money.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.910
And if they don't
activate the contract,

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:42.130
then the rights
devolve back to me,

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.380
and I get to keep
that small amount.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.930
So that's how options work.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.481
And they don't activate
until they are absolutely

00:14:48.481 --> 00:14:50.980
sure they need to do it, because
it's a fair amount of money

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.688
and they don't want
to just piss it away.

00:14:52.688 --> 00:14:56.310
So they actually only activated
the rights contract the day

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.270
they started filming.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.595
So it's the moment--
and the reason

00:15:01.595 --> 00:15:02.970
is because that's
the moment when

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.150
they have now generated
intellectual property

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.710
based on it.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:09.590
And they're like, well, now we
need to make sure we own it.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.230
So anyway watching that
process unfold was fascinating,

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:17.910
because I didn't-- at the
beginning everybody told,

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.040
they literary agent,
my film agent,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.180
everybody in the
industry told me,

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.500
don't get excited about
people buying a movie option.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.601
The studios by several hundred
options for every actual movie

00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:30.100
they make.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.570
You have a less than 1%
chance of this actually being

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.342
greenlighted.

00:15:33.342 --> 00:15:34.300
So don't get worked up.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.920
Just enjoy the money that they
gave you and call it a day.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.650
But then they got
Drew Goddard on board.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.450
Drew Goddard is veteran
screenwriter and director.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.970
He directed "Cabin
in the Woods."

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.680
He wrote "Cloverfield"
and a bunch of episodes

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.890
of "Lost" and Buffy."

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.650
He is the creator and
writer of the new Netflix

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:55.150
"Daredevil" series.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.800
So he's a veteran.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.190
And he really liked the book.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.900
And so he wrote a screenplay.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.260
He said I want to
write and direct this.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.990
So the studio FOX was
like, sure, sounds good.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.270
Write a script and
we'll take a look.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.100
So he wrote a screenplay.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.589
And then he was set
to write and direct.

00:16:11.589 --> 00:16:13.380
And they're like, well,
we have a director,

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.950
but we need an actor.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.770
We need someone to
take an interest

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.030
in playing the lead role.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.239
This movie is not-- we're
not willing to make it

00:16:20.239 --> 00:16:21.530
with a nobody in the lead role.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.210
It has to be a big name.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.970
And, so, right
around that time then

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.670
Matt Damon expressed
interest in playing the lead.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.782
And, so, the studio
is like, oh really.

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:33.990
And they start taking a
project a lot more seriously.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:37.635
They're like, OK, now we've
got a veteran director

00:16:37.635 --> 00:16:41.650
and a the top tier well
known actor to play the lead.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.910
And then Sony came along
and offered Drew Goddard

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.079
the director's chair for
the new "Spiderman" movie.

00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:48.870
And he's like, sorry
guys I got to do that.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.130
This is a dream come true.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.930
So he left to go work on that.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.070
But he's like,
enjoy my screenplay.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.691
And that makes it
sound mercenary.

00:16:56.691 --> 00:16:58.440
He was-- he's really
invested in a project

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.690
and he kept working
on it the whole time,

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.390
but he's like I'm
not going to direct.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.810
So, he goes off to direct
the next "Spiderman" movie.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.660
And then-- now the
studio is like, aah.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.291
We had a director and a star.

00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:11.040
Well, first we had a
director and no star,

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.660
now we have a star no director.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.470
And then Ridley Scott
said, I'll direct it,

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.829
and they said, oh really?

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.859
So once they have
Ridley Scott on board

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.190
to direct and Matt
Damon on board to star

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.790
that's pretty much when they
made the decision that they're

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.079
definitely going to do this.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.319
Although I didn't know that.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.200
To me it just seemed,
well, this looks good.

00:17:32.884 --> 00:17:35.050
And then everything else
started to fall into place.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.633
The studio was like, OK, we are
going to sink a bunch of money

00:17:37.633 --> 00:17:38.210
into this.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.790
If we're going to green
light it, we'll go big.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.070
And then, also a bunch of
big name actors and actresses

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.530
took an interest in the
project, because it's

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.745
Matt Damon and Ridley Scott
in a big budget movie,

00:17:48.745 --> 00:17:50.270
and it'll be heavily marketed.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.600
And they like being in
those sorts of things.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.860
So then they started
to get all these really

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.520
big name actors and actresses
interested in playing roles

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.260
in the movie.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.320
And they were like,
well, this is super,

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.200
but there's just no way
we can afford all of you.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.986
There's no way.

00:18:04.986 --> 00:18:06.610
If we paid all of
you what you're worth

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.080
this movie would cost $400.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.950
Million We can't do it.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.370
And they just-- a lot
of them just agreed

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.930
to do it for less than
they would normally

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:17.250
get just because they
really liked the story.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:20.040
So that's why that
cast is ridiculous.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.410
It stars Matt Damon, Jessica
Chastain, Sebastian Stan,

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:28.090
Kate Mara, missing,
missing one of the crew.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.690
Oh Michael Pena,
and Aksel Hennie,

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.160
which most people
don't know him.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.680
Meanwhile on earth,
the roles are

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.290
played by Chiwetel
Ejiofor, who you

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.710
may know from "12 Years a
Slave," or maybe this crowd

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:43.970
might know him best from the bad
guy from the movie "Serenity."

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:51.076
And Kristen Wiig, Donald
Glover, AKA "Childish Gambino."

00:18:51.076 --> 00:18:52.690
Hey, for those of
you under wrap,

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.830
you might know him by that
name and not the other one.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:01.850
Let's see, who else is
on Earth, Jeff Daniels.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.319
Yeah, it just goes on and on.

00:19:03.319 --> 00:19:04.610
It's just this ridiculous cast.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.030
I'm sure I missed people too.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:10.000
But, so, they got this
cast and then, yeah.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.470
They started
shooting in November.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.780
They finished shooting
in March, and now they're

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.930
doing post production
and test screening.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.410
The test screenings have
been going very, very well.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.090
The audiences are
really liking it,

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.420
so it's looking like it'll
be a really good movie.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.166
And I got to see it on Friday,
just two-- a few days ago.

00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:29.540
That's actually
why I'm down here

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.050
in Southern California,
because I went to FOX

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.150
and I got to watch it.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.790
And I was really psyched because
I get my own title placard.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.140
It's up on the movie, "based
on the novel by Andy Weir,"

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.610
and no other text on the screen.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.547
So, now the first
question I always get,

00:19:46.547 --> 00:19:48.380
so I'll just go ahead
and pre-answer it now.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.630
Hey Andy, what was your
involvement in the movie?

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.230
So I'll go ahead
and answer that now.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.830
My main job on the film
was to cash the check.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.080
I did that very well I feel.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.360
I mean just smoothly.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.807
They didn't have any--
they have no requirement

00:20:02.807 --> 00:20:03.890
to involve me in anything.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.570
They don't need to
consult me in any way.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.090
The only thing
that's in my contract

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:11.150
is they're going to give me
money, and then way later on I

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.790
get to go to the premiere.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.309
That's it.

00:20:14.309 --> 00:20:15.850
They don't need to
consult me at all.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.580
But they chose to involve
me, so that was really cool.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.400
Drew called me a
lot, frequently when

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.970
he was writing the screenplay.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:23.810
He's a super guy.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:24.690
He's really friendly.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.110
And in fact,
immediately after this,

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.651
I'm going to go have
drinks with him.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.910
He called me a lot,
because he really wanted

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.780
to stay true to the novel.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.390
And then he sent revs
of the screenplay,

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.100
and got my feedback on it.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.289
He made some changes based
on one on my feedback,

00:20:43.289 --> 00:20:44.830
and ignored other
things, which fine.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.450
It's his screenplay.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.070
And then, while they
were filming it,

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.900
I would get these
questions filtered

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.700
through four intermediaries
from Ridley Scott.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.090
And I could tell
from the questions

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.830
that he was asking
that he really

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.530
cared about technical
and scientific accuracy.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.970
I mean one of the questions
that came through was,

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:08.720
he said, OK, can we show
Mark pouring hydrazine

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.030
from one container into another,
out on the surface of Mars.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.464
He's wearing his
EVA suit and he's

00:21:13.464 --> 00:21:15.010
pouring it from one
container to the other.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:16.970
And I'm like, no, hydrazine
is really volatile

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.550
and in Mars atmospheric
pressure it would boil off.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.800
And he's like, OK, then
we're not going to do it.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:26.170
And so it's that level of
technical double checking, led

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.440
me to believe, OK, they're
really being accurate.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.565
And then, of course, a few
days ago I saw the movie

00:21:30.565 --> 00:21:32.730
and I'm like, ooh!

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:33.954
It's really good.

00:21:33.954 --> 00:21:36.370
Although the version I saw
it's funny-- the version I saw,

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.460
they're still adding
in special effects.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.960
So there's some really cheesy
roughed in visual effects

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.660
right now.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.401
Oh look, a grainy JPEG of
Mars in the background, that's

00:21:49.401 --> 00:21:49.900
awesome.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.030
And the Zero G
scenes, they still

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.990
have the wires holding the
actors and actresses up

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.910
as they float around.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.931
And it's funny, but it's--
that's all going to be taking

00:22:02.931 --> 00:22:03.430
care of.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.380
Oh, and a lot of scenes
on Mars, It's like, look,

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.010
oh look it's Mars, and
there's some Martian plants

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.840
and shrubbery.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.620
Oh, these must be some
native Martian tire tracks.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.340
And I see a couple
of Martian pickup

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.910
trucks in the background.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:20.690
So it's really funny to watch
the test screening versions,

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:24.030
because the CGI is just
about the last thing they do.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:27.175
Because they rough everything
in, and then they look,

00:22:27.175 --> 00:22:28.550
they view it over
and over again,

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.174
they do test screenings
and everything.

00:22:30.174 --> 00:22:32.490
And only when they know the
exact sequence of scenes,

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.220
when they have the
editing complete,

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.267
are they willing to
commit to the CGI.

00:22:36.267 --> 00:22:38.600
So there are parts of the
movie where they're like, yes,

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.058
definitely this is going to be
in, go ahead and work on it.

00:22:41.058 --> 00:22:43.320
But if you waste
a second of CGI,

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.830
if you have your effects
department make one second

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.960
of CGI that you later
cut from the film,

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.360
you've just pissed
away $100, 000.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.200
So they really care
about that, which

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.690
is why the CGI is so rough.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.360
So, let's see I though
there's one other--

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.550
I thought there was
something else, but I'm old

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.320
and I'm senile.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.860
So I forgot.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.680
So anyway, that's the
end of my little spiel.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.470
So now I'm going
to take questions.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.740
And if anybody has
questions, they're

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.706
going to set that microphone up.

00:23:12.706 --> 00:23:15.150
This lovely lady here
is setting it up.

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:18.377
And anybody who wants ask
a question just walk on up.

00:23:18.377 --> 00:23:19.210
AUDIENCE: First off.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:23.360
Where are we having drinks
with Drew after the--

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.195
ANDY WEIR: It's at ah--

00:23:25.195 --> 00:23:26.570
AUDIENCE: And the
second question

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:30.360
is, when you went
for the movie rights

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.160
at the same time
as the book rights,

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.510
I never even heard that before.

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:34.850
Is that unique?

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.340
ANDY WEIR: I think so.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:42.580
It's kind of unique to the new
world of-- to self publishing.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.680
Self publishing and, well,
the internet in general

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.170
has really turned the
publishing industry on its ear.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.730
There's no longer
an old boy network

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.340
between you and the reader.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.799
So people can
easily self publish.

00:23:51.799 --> 00:23:53.840
Now that doesn't mean you
get a pretty bad signal

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.902
to noise ratio.

00:23:54.902 --> 00:23:57.110
If you look out-- if you
look through Kindle and say,

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.960
what's available
in self publishing.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.877
Well, there's about a million
books, and most of them suck.

00:24:01.877 --> 00:24:04.335
But that's where-- that's where
rating systems, like Barnes

00:24:04.335 --> 00:24:08.016
and Noble and Amazon have,
come in really handy.

00:24:08.016 --> 00:24:09.140
Kind of drifting off topic.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:14.610
But the point is self
publishing causes people

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:19.630
to be, what do you call it,
popular successes before they

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.110
have business deals.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.200
So this sort of thing will
happen if you do that.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.740
"Martian" is one case.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.900
"Wool" by Hugh Howey, I
don't know if any of you've

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:28.730
read that.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.380
That's another case of a self
published novel going big.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.960
And, of course,
I'm sure all of you

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.660
are huge fans of
"Fifty Shades of Gray."

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.270
Because you all look
like you're into that.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.220
Yeah, but that
is-- whether or not

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.670
you like it or
consider it trash,

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.250
it is a self publishing success.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.455
That also, like in
all these cases,

00:24:46.455 --> 00:24:48.580
the book and movie rights
came very close together.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.039
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:50.039 --> 00:24:52.330
AUDIENCE: When you started
putting together all these--

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.200
signing your rights away,
did they make you do anything

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:55.990
with your website?

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:57.636
Like take down the
text of the book?

00:24:57.636 --> 00:24:58.260
ANDY WEIR: Yup.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.140
AUDIENCE: Or make it not
suck or anything like that?

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.098
ANDY WEIR: Yup, it turns
out they don't like it

00:25:02.098 --> 00:25:04.480
when you give things away for
free that they're selling.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:08.400
So they said, well, I
mean conceptually I sold

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.670
the rights to Random House.

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:13.610
So I no longer have the legal
ability to distribute it.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:14.410
Right.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.290
And so they said,
yes, please we'd

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.770
like you to take that down.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:19.314
So, yeah.

00:25:19.314 --> 00:25:21.230
AUDIENCE: Do you still
have other works there?

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.660
ANDY WEIR: Oh sure.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.493
All the other stuff.

00:25:22.493 --> 00:25:25.500
Anything that-- everything
except for "The Martian".

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.660
And my next book is going to be
"Zhek', tentative title "Zhek."

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.080
And it's-- it's a more
traditional sci-fi.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.050
It's got aliens, and
faster than light travel,

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:35.560
and stuff like that.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.070
And I had been posting
that as a serial also.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.750
Around the same time
as "The Martian."

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:42.510
And now the Random House
bought the rights to that,

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.299
and I'm working on
that as my next book,

00:25:44.299 --> 00:25:45.590
they had me take that down too.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.881
But everything else on my site.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.440
AUDIENCE: So hi Andy.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.220
ANDY WEIR: Hi.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.970
AUDIENCE: I know that you--
when you wrote the book you

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.750
got a lot of feedback from
readers of your website.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.800
And later on from
members of the space

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.530
community on technical
accuracy and so on.

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:07.020
You were able to
smooth all that out.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.530
However, I noticed
reading the book,

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.620
you also really got a
lot right in the sort

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.132
of NASA political
world, in the way

00:26:14.132 --> 00:26:16.340
that things kind of-- people
interacted back on Earth

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.350
and that kind of thing.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.679
I wondered if you also got
some feedback from the space

00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:21.970
community about those things,
and how those would work.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:24.290
And if you make any
changes to reflect that,

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:27.170
or if you just got lucky and
got it right on the first shot.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:28.811
ANDY WEIR: Well,
so, first off, I

00:26:28.811 --> 00:26:31.060
didn't know anyone in aerospace
when I wrote the book.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.080
So I didn't have any sources.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.170
I just actually-- I say this
every time, but this is true.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.230
My primary form of
research was Google.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:45.620
Just-- and about 90% of
the things I looked up

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.870
took me straight to Wikipedia.

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.460
So, I didn't have any feedback
from NASA folks or anything

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.876
like that, at the
time I wrote it.

00:26:53.876 --> 00:26:56.270
But later on, after--
afterward they did come back

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.010
and say, yes.

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.190
The way you describe
the politics

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.910
in NASA and the way things
work are absolutely correct.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:06.420
One thing that was awesome about
this whole experience for me

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.220
is that NASA invited me out
to the Johnson Space Center

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.790
for four days of VIP tours.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.860
And I got to look at
all sorts of cool stuff.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.020
And my favorite
part of it was I got

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.980
to go into the mission
control center for ISS.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.774
Into, not just an
observation area, but into.

00:27:20.774 --> 00:27:23.190
And I got to sit at one of the
stations and remote control

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:24.770
a camera on the outside of ISS.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.430
It was very cool.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.420
But I got to talk to
Dr. Ellen Ochoa, who

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.930
is a two time astronaut and
the current Director of Johnson

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:33.730
Space Center.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.400
So she answers to the
administer of NASA.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.940
That's her rank.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.360
And she was telling
me, she said,

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.290
for every NASA
character in your book

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:45.880
I can tell you a real person
who is exactly like that.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.830
And so that was pretty cool.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:49.270
How did I get it right?

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:53.740
Well, I mentioned earlier on
I worked for Sandia National

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.200
Labs, back when I was 15.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.180
And I did that all
through high school.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.940
And Sandia National Labs is a
big federally funded research

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:02.850
facility.

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:06.400
And, so, I didn't know anything
about the internals of NASA,

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.400
so I just assumed-- I just
said, well, big federally funded

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.950
research facility, big federally
funded research facility.

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.880
I'm just going to use the
politics that I saw at Sandia

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.410
as being the politics at NASA.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:19.010
Turns out it was correct.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:20.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah, spot on.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.090
ANDY WEIR: I think
you worked for NASA?

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:22.715
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:22.715 --> 00:28:23.050
ANDY WEIR: Oh.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:23.550
Cool.

00:28:27.249 --> 00:28:27.790
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:31.820
I always wondered, what is
the ratio between the end

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.480
product of a book and
the background material,

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.685
and the research material
that you collect and compose

00:28:39.685 --> 00:28:41.200
in the mean time.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.200
The background stories,
the maps, the whatever,

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.866
they don't make their
way into the book,

00:28:44.866 --> 00:28:47.242
but you need them to make
everything feel real.

00:28:47.242 --> 00:28:47.950
ANDY WEIR: Right.

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:49.880
Well, sometimes I
do a lot of content

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.550
without requiring
any research at all.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.700
And other times I did do
huge amounts of research

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.190
just to get a tiny
bit of content.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:00.516
And it was really frustrating,
because I would be like,

00:29:00.516 --> 00:29:01.640
oh I did all this research.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.150
It took me a week
to figure this out,

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:06.350
and it's going to be one
sentence in the book.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.810
I'm like, no, it took me
a long time to write this.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:12.000
It should take you a
long time to read it.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.560
But you've gotta resist
that urge to overdo it

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.810
and show your work.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:18.960
One thing I did was
I wrote software

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.760
to calculate the
orbital trajectories

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.830
that they take on their
ship from Earth to Mars.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.540
Those are all real.

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.140
And it was hard,
because I kind of have

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.470
an interest in normal dynamics.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:29.860
It's actually
really simple math.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.620
It's not really complicated.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.650
But it gets insanely
complicated when

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:37.150
you have a ship that
constantly accelerates.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.080
So their ship uses
ion propulsion.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.600
So it has a very slow constant
acceleration of two millimeters

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.820
per second per second.

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.130
That's it, but it can do
it constantly for months.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.190
And so once I was
about 10 integrals in,

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:53.752
in my gigantic page full
of formulas, You know what?

00:29:53.752 --> 00:29:55.210
I'm not going to
work out this way.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.690
But I'm a computer programmer.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.820
So when the only tool
you have is a hammer,

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.950
every problem starts
to look like a nail.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.160
And, so, I'm going to do
this through brute force

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.300
and simulation.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.600
So I wrote software to work it
out and try different things,

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.700
until I found the
course that they would

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.532
take to get from Earth to Mars.

00:30:12.532 --> 00:30:14.240
Which also required
me to choose a launch

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.430
window that would work.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.550
And I had the
additional limitation

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:21.000
of the launch window
had to work such

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.280
that, while they were on Mars,
Thanksgiving of that year

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:24.960
would happen.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.070
During that period.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:27.780
For plot reasons, I needed that.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:31.600
And, so, OK, I need to calculate
a constantly accelerating

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:37.020
orbital trajectory that gets to
Mars such that within 31 days

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.540
there'll be Thanksgiving.

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.320
And it has to happen at
least 20 years in the future

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.600
to be plausible, and I don't
want me to far in the future.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:50.010
Anyway July 7, 2035.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:55.240
Anyway, so, I would say I spent
at least half to 3/4 of my time

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.550
doing research.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.750
AUDIENCE: So, no you
have these huge books

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.644
somewhere at home that has
all this stuff that you--

00:31:01.644 --> 00:31:02.310
ANDY WEIR: Yeah.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:06.860
I have a file called stuff,
and a file called notes,

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:10.040
and a file called ENPO, which
is a thing I do for every story.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.530
It stands for events,
no particular order.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:17.140
And with just all my
crap, and all my thoughts,

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.020
and all my math,
and stuff like that.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.977
And spreadsheets galore.

00:31:21.977 --> 00:31:22.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:26.640
AUDIENCE: Hi Andy.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.330
I was wondering about your
thoughts for in our world.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:35.147
What you think the future
holds or space exploration.

00:31:35.147 --> 00:31:37.480
Whether we will be able to
have a mission like the Aries

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.985
missions in our lifetimes?

00:31:38.985 --> 00:31:40.890
If we'll move beyond that?

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:42.600
And just your thoughts
on the future.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.620
ANDY WEIR: Sure.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:47.000
Well, first off unlike--
so the Aries mission as

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.398
predicted-- as put in
the book, not predicted.

00:31:50.398 --> 00:31:54.222
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:55.178 --> 00:31:56.140
ANDY WEIR: No.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.080
The ARES mission in
the book, remember.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.010
So first off, I should be clear.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.020
The only reason I
write is to entertain.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:02.990
I never have a point.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:04.280
I never have a moral.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.880
I never want to do anything
but make the reader go, "cool!"

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.940
And that's it.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.630
So there's no-- I'm
not pushing any agenda.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:12.560
And, so, with that
mind the Ares mission

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.340
was made to entertain people.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.360
Not-- it's not
necessarily my idea

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.490
of how a Mars mission
will probably work.

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:21.410
I did it deliberately to evoke
those feelings of the Apollo

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:22.070
era.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:25.970
And that excitement that every
reader-- everybody in the world

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:28.720
has some sense, some connection
with the Apollo program,

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.520
even if you were
born way afterward.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:34.360
And so this rather
shamelessly and cheesily

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.920
pulled on those heart strings.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.070
Realistically, I think
a manned mission to Mars

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:41.070
would be a large international
effort, like the International

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.350
Space Station.

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:45.325
I think it'd be us, European
Space Agency, the Russians,

00:32:45.325 --> 00:32:48.550
maybe even the
Chinese, JAXA for sure.

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:53.460
And it'll be this big
complicated space station

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.170
basically that
they send to Mars.

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:56.530
And it'll be like that.

00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:00.060
So that's my prediction for how
a manned Mars mission will go.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:04.090
And I also think that-- NASA
says they can do it by 2035.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.415
I believe they could if
they got enough funding,

00:33:06.415 --> 00:33:08.290
but I don't think they'll
get enough funding.

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:11.630
I predict more on
the order of 2050ish.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.190
That's my guess.

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:14.940
And then your other
question is, what do I

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.820
feel about the future
space exploration.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.010
I think we're right at the
cusp of an awesome era,

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:21.560
because now we're
finally starting

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.260
to look at it from a commercial
and economic sense, instead

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.090
of just a flags and
footprints kind of thing.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.500
And, so, we've got
companies like SpaceX

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.820
driving the price down.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.950
I think the absolute
key to space exploration

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.760
is driving the price down to get
a mass in the low earth orbit.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.755
Once you do that a commercial
industry will naturally evolve.

00:33:41.755 --> 00:33:44.360
And if you don't believe
me, let me ask you this.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.640
All of you, your engineers
mostly, probably, right?

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.070
And, so, you make decent income,
but you're not billionaires,

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.960
right?

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:55.990
Would you pay $100,000
to spend a week in space?

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:58.200
Raise your hand if you
would pay $100,000 to spend

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.190
a week in a space hotel.

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:00.820
All right.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:05.290
So this is about 30% of the
population of this room.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:09.230
If you could make it such that
middle class Americans could

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.580
afford, as a once
in a lifetime event,

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:15.719
to go into space for a week, you
would have effectively infinite

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:16.900
demand.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.830
And then that's
when companies would

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.590
start to come in, and
figure out the technology

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:23.909
necessary to drive the price
down further and further

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:25.260
and compete with each other.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.280
So it all starts with companies
like SpaceX and Boeing,

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.409
and the commercial
programs that NASA's doing.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:34.449
And I think we're on our way.

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:37.067
So I think it's going
to be pretty awesome.

00:34:37.067 --> 00:34:37.900
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.479
ANDY WEIR: Sure.

00:34:39.479 --> 00:34:40.020
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.290
Thanks for coming to Google.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:42.624
ANDY WEIR: Thanks for having me.

00:34:42.624 --> 00:34:44.123
AUDIENCE: So you
talked a little bit

00:34:44.123 --> 00:34:45.949
about how you were
researching the science

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:47.120
aspect of your books.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:51.429
I'm curious about your
process for the plot

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:52.330
and the characters.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:54.210
Do you have them in
your head ahead of time?

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:56.850
Or do they kind of
appear as you write?

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:58.500
How much rewriting do you do?

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.600
I'm really curious about
that kind of stuff.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.250
ANDY WEIR: The characters did
just kind appear as needed.

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.682
So, it's-- a lot
of people ask me,

00:35:06.682 --> 00:35:08.390
why did you make
Commander Lewis a woman?

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:12.180
Or are you pushing-- are you
trying to show empowered women?

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:12.730
I'm like, no.

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:15.350
I thought, I need a
commander and my brain

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:16.657
came back with Commander Lewis.

00:35:16.657 --> 00:35:18.240
I don't know why
she's a woman anymore

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.850
than I know why you know the
director of NASA's a man.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:23.650
It's just, OK, thanks brain.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:25.870
So I just pretty much
made them as I went along.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:28.620
When I did rewrites I didn't
change any of the characters

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:29.330
at all.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.940
I did sharpen their
personalities a bit,

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.080
especially the NASA people.

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.790
Because they tend to,
in the earlier revs

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:38.810
and probably even still, they
tended to blend together,

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:41.540
and you're like wait, which
one is this guy, which

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.780
one is that guy.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.500
And so I give them
all personality quirks

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.700
to try to make them more severe,
but that was fine tuning.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.930
As for rewrites, I
didn't really go off

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:55.136
on too many tangents that had
to be backed out and redone.

00:35:55.136 --> 00:35:56.760
I tend to think
things-- it worked out.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.270
"The Martian" went
really smoothly.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:00.735
I'm learning that was
abnormally smoothly,

00:36:00.735 --> 00:36:02.360
because I'm working
on my next book now

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.300
and I'm just screwing
up all the time.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.770
I'm going off-- I
mean I just recently

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:10.360
deleted about 25,000
words of the book I'm

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.690
working on now, to go back
and do a different line.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.300
So the answer to the question
is, on "The Martian" no,

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.050
but in general apparently yes,

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:20.950
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:23.225 --> 00:36:25.600
AUDIENCE: So I'll ask what I
think is a give me question.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.802
But, suppose that
you were-- you were

00:36:27.802 --> 00:36:29.010
going to be stranded on Mars.

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:30.426
You Andy Weir were
are going to be

00:36:30.426 --> 00:36:33.970
stranded on Mars with basically
the stuff that Mark Watney has.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:35.800
But you get to pick
where on Mars you're

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.400
going to be stranded.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.670
Where would you want
to be stranded on Mars,

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:44.230
to survive the longest, to
get back, that kind of thing.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.780
Where's the best place for you,
as far as you're concerned?

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.550
ANDY WEIR: Well, that sucks.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.050
AUDIENCE: No, that
would be awesome.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:52.030
ANDY WEIR: What's that?

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.960
AUDIENCE: I said that
would be awesome.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.960
But I don't want to
interfere with your answers.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.280
ANDY WEIR: Well,
I guess I'd want

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.030
to be somewhere that had
a decent amount of water

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:05.070
in the soil.

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:08.770
So one fun thing that
happened is in the book,

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:11.920
we see this huge long process
that the protagonist has

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.250
to go through to create water.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:17.420
He reduces hydrazine to
liberate hydrogen out of it.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.900
He collects carbon dioxide
from Mars' atmosphere,

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.650
runs it through the-- runs
it through HAB's oxygenator

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:25.420
to liberate the oxygen. Takes
the hydrogen and oxygen,

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.900
burns them together
to generate water.

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:28.760
Screws add up.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.710
Blows himself up a little bit.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.580
It's interesting.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.130
And then, after I
finished "The Martian,"

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:37.760
they landed the Curiosity
probe on Mars in real life.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.620
And the Curiosity
probe went scoop,

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:43.410
hey there's a shit
load of water here.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:47.010
Turns out for every cubic
meter of Martian soil,

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:49.580
there's 35 liters
of water in it.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:53.342
So all Mark had to do was
get some dirt and heat it up.

00:37:53.342 --> 00:37:54.300
But I didnt' know that.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.508
So I get away with one thing.

00:37:55.508 --> 00:37:57.690
What I do is say,
well, Curiosity

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:01.390
is in Gale Crater right now, at
the base of Mount Sharp, which

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:04.501
is 5,000 or 6,000
kilometers away from where

00:38:04.501 --> 00:38:06.750
"The Martian" takes place
in [? Assideliaplonessia. ?]

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.410
So I could say well Mars
is not one universal thing.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.460
I'm saying
[? Assideliaplonessia ?]

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.460
is a desert, and it doesn't
have a lot of water.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.370
And yet can't prove me
wrong until somebody

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:19.460
sends a probe there.

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:24.260
So I guess, I would want a
place that has a lot of water.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:27.180
So Gale Crater we know
for a fact has water.

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.830
That is handy because if you
have water, you have hydrogen.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:33.577
And that is a really
critical element.

00:38:33.577 --> 00:38:36.160
AUDIENCE: You'd also have to get
the percholorates out though.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.840
ANDY WEIR: Yes and I have-- I've
heard all sorts of conflicting

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.980
crap about perchlorates.

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:45.000
I get people-- I get
some people telling me.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.940
So for those who don't know.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.200
For those of you who don't know
the details of Martian soil

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.951
sciences.

00:38:51.951 --> 00:38:53.575
Martian soil has a
lot of perchlorates.

00:38:53.575 --> 00:38:56.180
And perchlorates they
don't prevent plant growth,

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.520
but they can make the plants
that you grow poisonous.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.680
Or so I'm told.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.390
I get conflicting
reports on that.

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:06.300
Some people tell me, oh no, if
you grow plants in Martian soil

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.320
without clearing out
the perchlorates,

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.170
your bone-- those
plants are bad for you.

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:13.200
Other people are like, yeah it's
bad for you, but so is smoking.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.510
And it's not as bad
for you as starving.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:18.380
So I get conflicting
reports on that.

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:19.900
In an emergency situation.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.180
I think the perchlorates
aren't that big a deal.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.892
But you wouldn't want to
found a colony based on this.

00:39:24.892 --> 00:39:25.600
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.350
AUDIENCE: Aside from
the apparent new

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:33.540
found understanding of
the abundance of water

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.930
on Mars, aside
from that, what do

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:40.050
you think is the least plausible
scene or series evens--

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.050
sequence of events
in the Martian?

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:43.381
ANDY WEIR: OK there are few.

00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:43.880
So--

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.136
AUDIENCE: The least plausible.

00:39:48.136 --> 00:39:49.390
They're all very implausible.

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:49.900
ANDY WEIR: Yeah.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.460
Well.

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:54.020
OK, so there are two
places where I deliberately

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:57.770
violated physics in
reality for plot purposes.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:01.090
Number one, the biggest one is
the sandstorm at the beginning.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:06.450
In reality Mars' atmosphere
is 0.6% as in about one two

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:09.130
hundredth, the density
of Earth's atmosphere.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.610
So it's extremely,
extremely thin.

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:13.870
And yes they do get
sandstorms on-- they.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:15.570
You know those Martians.

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:19.410
Mars does get sandstorms
150 kilometers an hour.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:23.850
But with the air so thin the
inertia of the sandstorms

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:24.990
is extremely low.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:27.120
It's like being in about
one kilometer an hour

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.320
breeze on earth.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.720
It wouldn't knock over anything.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.020
It wouldn't damage anything.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.240
It wouldn't hurt anything.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.440
I came up with an alternate
scenario in the story

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:40.580
where it turns out, oh, OK--
I had it where they're doing

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:41.830
and MAV engine test.

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.820
And there's an explosion
during that process.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.600
And that's what causes
all the problems.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.527
And I had ways to force
them to the lift off.

00:40:47.527 --> 00:40:49.360
And think Mark was dead,
and all that stuff.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.150
But it just didn't feel
right, it didn't feel as good.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:53.590
And in a man versus
nature story,

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.680
I wanted nature to get
the first punch in.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.820
And, so it worked out
for the 99.9% of people

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:03.510
who don't know about the
realities of Mara' atmosphere,

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.570
there's a real
general public idea

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:07.660
that Martian dust
storms are this--

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.410
are like Earth sandstorms.

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:10.780
So I played into that.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:15.030
The other deliberate thing
I did was-- the violation

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:18.430
of the reality I did was, I
just have this one paragraph

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:20.930
somewhere in the middle of the
book where he says, oh, yeah,

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.640
the HABs, and the
rovers, and EVA suits

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.784
are all radiation shielded.

00:41:25.784 --> 00:41:26.760
OK.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.930
There's no such material
that can do that,

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:31.700
that casually or that easily.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:35.160
He has this thin, flexible,
airtight material,

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.097
it's about that thick that
will block all the radiation,

00:41:38.097 --> 00:41:40.180
or brings the radiation
levels inside the HAB down

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.530
to Earth normal.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:42.780
And you just can't do that.

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.430
You would actually need
several centimeters of lead,

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:48.910
or 10 centimeters of
water, or a meter of rock

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:51.200
to get the radiation
levels down to what we

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.660
have on the surface of Earth.

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.987
Because Earth has a big
strong magnetic field and also

00:41:55.987 --> 00:41:57.820
a big thick atmosphere
to stop the radiation

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:58.611
from getting to us.

00:41:58.611 --> 00:41:59.930
And Mars has neither.

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:01.590
So that was another
thing that I didn't

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:02.640
want to deal with,
because I knew

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.340
he was going to be
out on the surface

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.514
doing all these makeshift
solutions, lots of stuff.

00:42:06.514 --> 00:42:07.930
And I didn't want
to say, oh, yeah

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:10.450
and then he dies of cancer.

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:17.860
So-- so that was
some hand wavy stuff.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:21.090
So some things I
got wrong by mistake

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:23.410
are the water thing that
I just talked about.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:26.700
And then one of them is really,
really obscure, but I liked it.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.300
A chemist emailed me after
the book was out in print,

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.550
so I couldn't change anything.

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:33.510
He's like, OK, you told
me how much hydrazine Mark

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:34.930
reduced in the HAB.

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:38.240
You told me how much and
how long he took to do it.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.220
You gave information
elsewhere in the book

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:42.110
about the internal
volume of a HAB,

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:44.760
and what the atmospheric
makeup is of the HAB.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.140
And so this gives me
enough information

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.720
to calculate how much the
temperature inside the HAB

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.640
is going to go up,
do that chemistry.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.885
It's 400 degrees Celsius.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:59.470
I could have solved
that one pretty easily,

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:01.597
if I'd known about it.

00:43:01.597 --> 00:43:03.680
But anyway, so those are
the few the inaccuracies.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.430
But, I think, you're asking
what is the biggest inaccuracy?

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.220
The biggest inaccuracy is that
a mission that size would get

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:11.896
funded at all.

00:43:11.896 --> 00:43:14.890
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:16.840
AUDIENCE: So, one more.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.134
This isn't particularly--
I don't particularly

00:43:20.134 --> 00:43:21.800
have a well formed
question around this.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.430
It's just one thing that kept
striking me over and over as I

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.550
was reading the book is this
is a man versus nature story,

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:28.840
as you were just alluding to.

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.510
And those are really
all that common.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:34.010
You see a lot more
inter-personal conflicts,

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:37.120
man versus man or whatever, in
terms of these gross categories

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:37.950
of stories.

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:39.430
Is this-- I guess
my question would

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:41.260
be, is this kind of your
favorite sort of thing

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:41.759
to write?

00:43:41.759 --> 00:43:44.720
Did you find this
to be fruitful?

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.380
Just what was your feeling on
writing that kind of story?

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.720
ANDY WEIR: I really enjoyed it.

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.430
And I do love man
versus nature stories.

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:57.970
Because it's really just a
veiled way of saying science!

00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:58.470
Right.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:01.220
Because that's what man versus
nature really is, right.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.160
I mean-- and the
other thing I like

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.660
about it is, I don't
know about other people,

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:10.280
but when I'm watching a story
with a central plot conflict,

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.070
with a protagonist
and an antagonist.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:14.840
A part of me, no matter,
how bad he is, a part of me

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.680
roots for the antagonist.

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:19.430
Because first off I know
that in almost all stories

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:21.970
the antagonist is
destined to fail.

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.180
And so I kind of
feel sorry for him.

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.180
And I'm rooting for him.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:27.280
Also usually the antagonist
is the prime mover.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.890
The antagonist is, I'm the
villain who's robbing the bank,

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:32.265
or I'm the guy who's threatening
earth with my death ray,

00:44:32.265 --> 00:44:32.860
or something.

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.300
He's the one who's
making the plot happen.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.174
He's generally the most
interesting character

00:44:36.174 --> 00:44:37.090
in the story.

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:38.910
And you feel kind
of conflicted when

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:41.160
you're reading the stories,
or watching a movie,

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.760
or whatever, because
you're like, ah,

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.700
well now this hero is going to
come in and ruin everything.

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:46.680
Right.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.660
And in a man versus nature
there's no divided loyalties.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.220
Nobody roots for nature
in man versus nature.

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.470
It's like, I hope
that guy drowns.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:56.640
And so, it's nice.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.010
And, also, it plays into this
kind of Pollyanna optimism

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:03.260
that I have in-- this
really is my world view.

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.300
I really think humanity is good.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:10.300
Despite how-- despite
what you see in the news.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.910
I really feel humanity
is good and it

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:14.720
makes me feel good to see
a bunch of people working

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.720
together to help each other.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.360
And not a bunch of people
in a war working together

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.693
to kill a bunch of other people.

00:45:20.693 --> 00:45:22.390
But, OK, we're all
going to do this.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:25.970
So that's why it's, yeah,
there are bad people

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:27.470
and they do bad things.

00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:30.110
But the people who do good
things greatly outnumber them.

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:32.590
And they don't make the news,
because it's just presumed

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:33.940
as part of human nature.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:38.360
And so the quote I always say
is, 19 people made 9/11 happen,

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.070
but thousands of people
rushed in to help.

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:43.965
So that's my view on
the nature of humanity.

00:45:43.965 --> 00:45:44.715
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:45:44.715 --> 00:45:45.590
Thanks very much.

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:47.965
ANDY WEIR: Sure.

00:45:47.965 --> 00:45:48.915
OK.

00:45:48.915 --> 00:45:50.320
AUDIENCE: Hi Andy.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.322
I'm Abbey.

00:45:51.322 --> 00:45:52.030
Nice to meet you.

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:53.449
Thanks for coming.

00:45:53.449 --> 00:45:55.490
First of all, I want to
give a shout out to-- you

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:58.740
actually have your marketing
team whose working with FOX

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.110
to help market your movie here.

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:00.985
ANDY WEIR: Oh, great.

00:46:00.985 --> 00:46:03.780
AUDIENCE: So, Everyone's
here to help you.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.675
ANDY WEIR: Hello

00:46:05.675 --> 00:46:07.300
AUDIENCE: But I also
I want to ask you,

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.140
obviously this is like
a life changing thing--

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:10.840
ANDY WEIR: Nah.

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:11.900
AUDIENCE: You were putting
something on the website,

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.570
and you have a
movie about a book.

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:17.260
And as someone who want to be
a writer, that probably nice.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.590
ANDY WEIR: It is really nice.

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:19.610
AUDIENCE: Are you
transitioning now

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:20.910
into being a full time author.

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:24.470
Or are you still doing
the computer programming?

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:25.720
ANDY WEIR: I quit my day job.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.860
I'm working full
time as a writer now.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:31.880
I quit my day job
back, last April.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.140
And it was kind of bitter
sweet, because it wasn't a

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.860
take this job and
shove it situation.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.422
I liked my job.

00:46:37.422 --> 00:46:39.380
I worked for a company
called MobileIron, where

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.050
I did Android programming.

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:43.780
And I really liked it.

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:44.660
I liked my coworkers.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.030
I liked my team, my boss.

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:47.215
People respected me there.

00:46:47.215 --> 00:46:49.340
And everybody was rooting
for me on the book stuff.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:50.925
As they were all
watching this happen.

00:46:50.925 --> 00:46:52.050
And they're, yeah, yeah go.

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:53.758
And they knew I was
a flight risk as seen

00:46:53.758 --> 00:46:58.720
as a book started
to be-- But I still

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.030
love computer programming.

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:01.780
In fact, I have to not do it.

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.890
Because if I start a side
project, just some little fun

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:07.200
thing on the side, a game
or something like that,

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.033
I know I'll work on
that instead of writing.

00:47:09.033 --> 00:47:10.117
And that's dangerous.

00:47:10.117 --> 00:47:11.950
AUDIENCE: Well, how did
you find the balance

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:14.160
when you were doing
work and writing?

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.800
Obviously one's-- their
both fueled our passion,

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.846
so you make time for that, but--

00:47:18.846 --> 00:47:20.470
ANDY WEIR: Part of
it that really helps

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:23.340
a lot is to not have a life.

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.731
And, so, after work I'm at home.

00:47:26.731 --> 00:47:33.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:37.470
So, and I don't know.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:41.010
It's just-- the main thing
that motivated me and made

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:42.924
it a priority for
me was releasing

00:47:42.924 --> 00:47:43.840
it chapter by chapter.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.320
I got feedback and
just constant reminders

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.140
that people really
were reading it.

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.890
Every time I'd
release a chapter,

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:52.487
I'd get hundreds of emails
of people with feedback.

00:47:52.487 --> 00:47:54.570
And it just went, OK,
people are reading my stuff.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:57.220
And I think that's--
almost no writter--

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.760
almost every writer
is driven by that.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.700
Not driven by like, I
want to make some money.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:03.033
I mean some of them are I guess.

00:48:03.033 --> 00:48:05.010
But the vast majority
of us are just like,

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:06.410
people are reading this book.

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:08.740
I created of a fictional world.

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.510
And other people are
enjoying it and I love that.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:13.347
And so that'll help motivate me.

00:48:13.347 --> 00:48:14.180
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.190
ANDY WEIR: Thank you.

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:16.120
Is that it?

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:16.620
OK.

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.411
AUDIENCE: Let's extend
a thank you to Andy.

00:48:18.411 --> 00:48:19.690
ANDY WEIR: Thank you.
