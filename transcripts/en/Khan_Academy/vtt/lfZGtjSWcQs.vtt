00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.430
Let's say I've got a sequence.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.210
It starts at 1, then let's
say it goes to negative 1/2.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.500
Then it goes to positive 1/3.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.580
Then it goes to negative 1/4.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.650
Then it goes to positive 1/5.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.400
And it just keeps going on
and on and on like this.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.010
And we could graph it.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.040
Let me draw our vertical axis.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.005
So I'll graph this
as our y-axis.

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:27.230
And I'm going to graph
y is equal to a sub n.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.580
And let's make this our
horizontal axis where I'm going

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.430
to plot our n's.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.040
So this right over
here is our n's.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.030
And this is, let's say this
right over here is positive 1.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.890
This right over
here is negative 1.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.370
This would be negative 1/2.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.540
This would be positive 1/2.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.740
And I'm not drawing the
vertical and horizontal axes

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.530
at the same scale, just so that
we can kind of visualize this

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.420
properly.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.350
But let's say this
is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.420
and I could keep going
on and on and on.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.980
So we see here that
when n is equal to 1,

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.220
a sub n is equal to 1.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.940
So this is right over there.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.310
So when n is equal to 1,
a sub n is equal to 1.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.940
So this is y is
equal to a sub n.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.720
Now, when n is
equal to 2, we have

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.430
a sub n is equal
to negative 1/2.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.890
When n is equal to 3, a
sub n is equal to 1/3,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.150
which is right about there.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.990
When n is equal to 4, a sub
n is equal to negative 1/4,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.910
which is right about there.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.190
And then when n is
equal to 5, a sub n

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.050
is equal to positive 1/5, which
is maybe right over there.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.790
And we keep going
on and on and on.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.790
So you see the points,
they kind of jump around,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.580
but they seem to be getting
closer and closer and closer

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.600
to 0.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.070
Which would make us ask
a very natural question--

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.560
what happens to a sub n
as n approaches infinity?

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.930
Or another way of saying
that is, what is the limit--

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:18.730
let me do this in a new color--
of a sub n as n approaches

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.450
infinity?

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.780
Well, let's think about if we
can define a sub n explicitly.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.590
So we can define this sequence
as a sub n where n starts at 1

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.680
and goes to infinity
with a sub n equaling--

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.730
what does it equal?

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.110
Well, if we ignore
sign for a second,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.430
it looks like it's
just 1 over n.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.010
But then we seem like
we oscillate in signs.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.410
We start with a positive, then
a negative, positive, negative.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.970
So we could multiply this times
negative 1 to the-- let's see.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.085
If we multiply it times
negative 1 to the n,

00:02:57.085 --> 00:02:59.544
then this one would be negative
and this would be positive.

00:02:59.544 --> 00:03:00.793
But we don't want it that way.

00:03:00.793 --> 00:03:02.530
We want the first
term to be positive.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.990
So we say negative 1
to the n plus 1 power.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.240
And you can verify this works.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.900
When n is equal to 1, you have
1 times negative 1 squared,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.040
which is just 1, and it'll
work for all the rest.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.250
So we could write this
as equaling negative 1

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.260
to the n plus 1 power over n.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.200
And so asking what
the limit of a sub

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.900
n as n approaches infinity
is equivalent to asking what

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.660
is the limit of
negative 1 to the n

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.420
plus 1 power over
n as n approaches

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.950
infinity is going
to be equal to?

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.370
Remember, a sub n, this
is just a function of n.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.970
It's a function where we're
limited right over here

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.000
to positive integers
as our domain.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.690
But this is still just a
limit as something approaches

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.634
infinity.

00:03:46.634 --> 00:03:48.300
And I haven't rigorously
defined it yet,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.560
but you can conceptualize
what's going on here.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.470
As n approaches
infinity, the numerator

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.934
is going to oscillate between
positive and negative 1,

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:57.350
but this denominator
is just going

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.309
to get bigger and bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:01.474
So we're going to get really,
really, really, really

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:02.440
small numbers.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.800
And so this thing right over
here is going to approach 0.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.790
Now, I have not proved
this to you yet.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.690
I'm just claiming
that this is true.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.279
But if this is true-- so
let me write this down.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:23.540
If true, if the limit of a sub
n as n approaches infinity is 0,

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:33.940
then we can say that a
sub n converges to 0.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.200
That's another way of
saying this right over here.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.190
If it didn't, if the
limit as n approaches

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.230
infinity didn't go to
some value right here--

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.950
and I haven't rigorously
defined how we define a limit--

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.175
but if this was not true, if
we could not set some limit--

00:04:49.175 --> 00:04:50.550
it doesn't have
to be equal to 0.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.450
As long as it-- if this was
not equal to some number, then

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.900
we would say that
a sub n diverges.
