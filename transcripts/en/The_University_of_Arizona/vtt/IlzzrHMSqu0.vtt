00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.680
Commencement is
just a lot of fun.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.440
To see the students celebrate,
and see the families

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.300
and everybody so
excited and so happy,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.830
there's just a ton of energy.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.260
Today we are all
here volunteering

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.116
for our 2017
commencement ceremony

00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:16.490
that's going to
be happening here

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.350
at the University of Arizona.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.840
My job is to help the
students get into the stadium.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.450
And just making sure
that they're excited as

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.740
they enter the stadium.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.240
Make sure we get
safety in place,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.300
make sure they're being
safe while they celebrate.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.940
My job today is called SOS.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.010
Which means that our
tiny team of five

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.240
responds to really any and
every situation that might

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.100
need additional assistance.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.280
This is probably my sixth year.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.750
A lot of my friends volunteered,
and so I said, why not?

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.700
That sounds like fun.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.310
It's a way to meet new
people and other people

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.210
that I work with.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.918
I spend a lot of time
throughout the year

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.660
bringing in brand new Wildcats.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.194
And I've actually
been here long enough

00:00:56.194 --> 00:00:58.610
where I've seen the students
that I've recruited when they

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.620
were in high school
graduate, which is just

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.720
a really special feeling.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.365
It's a celebration of it all.

00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:06.740
Really celebrating our students
and their accomplishments

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.060
while they've been here.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.210
Graduating from the University
of Arizona is a huge deal.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.700
And it's really important
to us that we send them out

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.840
with a bang.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.060
Literally, fireworks.
