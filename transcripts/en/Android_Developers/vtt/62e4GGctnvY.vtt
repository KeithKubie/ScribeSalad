[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.840
SPEAKER: Releasing your
new app on Google Play

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.330
means you're likely to have
gone through many checks

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.710
like testing for quality and
making sure bugs are fixed.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.100
It's also important to make
sure you check your app

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.960
for potential policy issues.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.840
Here are 10 ways to stay on
the right side of Google Play

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.120
policy.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.100
Review our Policy Center.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.970
The Developer Policy Center
found at play.google.com/policy

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.640
is your resource for everything
related to Google Play policy.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.760
We've organized the
policies into themes

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.370
represented by tiles.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.540
You can select a specific
policy to learn more about it

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.120
and see visual examples
of common violations.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.720
Describe your app appropriately.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.690
Taking the time to
describe your app

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.140
can save you from receiving
a metadata policy violation.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.470
Read through your short
and full descriptions

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.360
and remove any excessive keyword
lists, irrelevant information,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.260
or user testimonials.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.269
Your app description should
be appropriate for all ages.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.860
Remember that every translation
of your app description

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.370
needs to be compliant
with the metadata policy.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.170
Used images you
have the rights to.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.920
If you want to stay on the right
side of intellectual property

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.120
policy, it's best to create
your own images and videos

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.480
to promote your app.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.440
Your app icon, feature graphic,
and any other assets you upload

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.140
to your Store
listing should only

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.590
include images you
have the right to use.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.970
If you've been
granted permission

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.070
to use assets owned
by others, you

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.030
can notify the App Review
team using this form.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.990
And just like your
app description,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.150
the images and videos
in your Store listing

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.900
should be appropriate
for all ages.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.890
Rate your app accurately.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.800
Once you've completed the
content rating questionnaire,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.880
you're almost ready
to submit your app.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.510
It's important to provide
accurate responses in order

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.960
to receive an accurate
rating as apps that

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.430
aren't rated correctly
or aren't rated at all

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.200
can be removed from
the Play Store.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.370
Handle user data with care.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.660
Is your app
collecting user data?

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.080
User data can include
information provided

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.380
by users, about users, or
about their interactions

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.830
with the app or device.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.760
If you're collecting
user data, you

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.830
need to include a privacy
policy in your Store listing

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.820
and in your app.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.770
The privacy policy
should let users

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.680
know what data you're collecting
and why you're collecting it.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.300
Read over the Personal
and Sensitive Information

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.820
section under our
User Data Policy

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.400
to see what types of data
to pay special attention to.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.760
Make sure the ads in your
app are policy compliant.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.720
When you submit
your app for review,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.550
the Google Play
team also reviews

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.680
the content and behavior
of the ads within your app.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.420
Make sure the ad content doesn't
include adult images, violence,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.530
or anything else that would
violate our content policy.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.890
Ad behavior should
be straightforward.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.620
We don't allow ads that are
disruptive or deceptive,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.360
including ads that pose
as system notifications,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.950
ads that aren't dismissible,
or ads that appear

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.060
after a user closes the app.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.290
A policy issue with your ads
can lead to an app rejection

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.460
or suspension.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.670
Check with your ad provider to
learn about filtering options.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.000
Don't forget the
restricted content policy.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.020
Review your app and
your Store listing

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.190
page for any
restrictive content,

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.060
such as adult content,
violence, or drugs.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.360
If you're concerned about
any of your content,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.510
read through the
Restricted Content Policy

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.580
for more details and examples.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.200
Any apps that contain or
feature user-generated content

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.130
must take additional
precautions in order

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.290
to provide a policy
compliant app experience.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.290
If this describes
your app, check out

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.650
the User-Generated Content
Policy to learn more.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.220
Update your email preferences.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.170
You're almost ready to submit.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.390
Just one final
thing-- take a second

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.090
to update your email address
on the Account Details

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.340
page in your developer console.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.360
If a policy issue
does come up, we

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.360
can contact you with the
necessary steps to address it.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.660
Congratulations.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.940
Now it's time to push that
shiny, blue Publish button.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.710
Fix any policy issues
found in review.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.450
Even though you've checked
your app against our policies,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.810
it's always possible that your
app gets rejected or suspended

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.170
after review.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.020
If your app or app
update gets rejected,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.800
keep in mind that many
violations can be fixed.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.900
Just follow the steps in the
notification from Google Play

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.350
email you received
to address the issue

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.930
and submit your app again.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.440
Reach out to us for support.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.940
If you disagree with
a policy violation

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.630
or if you'd like help
resolving your policy issue,

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.180
you can contact our
Policy Support team.
