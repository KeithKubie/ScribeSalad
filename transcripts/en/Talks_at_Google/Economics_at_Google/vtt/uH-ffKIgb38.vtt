[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.510
SPEAKER 1: Hello, everyone.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.350
Aswath Damodaran is
here and I couldn't

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.270
be more pleased
because I have learned

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.260
a lot about investment valuation
from just reading his blogs.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.380
I think he is one person
who has single-handedly made

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.780
investment valuation open source
and available to all of us.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.110
In addition to his
original classroom at NYU,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.530
he also has a virtual classroom
on YouTube of tens of thousands

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.600
of students spread
all over the world.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.140
And one thing I really
admire about Aswath

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.750
is that he does not shy away
from discussing current ideas

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.310
and let them be examined
over time in real time.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.800
He's also somebody who has
been very open and transparent

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.110
about sharing
investment mistakes,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.950
which you don't really
see in the investment

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.840
community in general.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.940
I think they're the really
special thing about professor

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.680
is that he brings the side
of an academic and bridges it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.220
all the way to that
of a practitioner

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.910
and does it in a very
open, candid way.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.360
He's written phenomenal
books about investing

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.720
and today he is here
to discuss with us

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.080
the latest in the
edition of books, which

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.180
is "Narrative and Numbers."

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.630
So without any further ado,
I am very delighted, please

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.750
join me in welcoming
Professor Aswath Damodaran.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.916
ASWATH DAMODARAN: Thank you.

00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:39.356
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.940
So let me start with a story.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.310
I came to NYU in 1986,
that was when I was hired

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.540
as an assistant professor.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.470
And I was given a class to teach
called security analysis, which

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.410
is an old class with
a collection of topics

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.789
that I chose to replace
with a valuation class.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.580
I actually didn't tell
them I was doing it,

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.820
I just went into the class
and made it a valuation class.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.960
And that was 1986.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.230
This will be my 31st year
teaching valuation, my 53rd

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.820
semester.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.120
And everything I
know about valuation

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.177
I've learned in the course
of teaching this class.

00:02:17.177 --> 00:02:19.010
So one of the lessons
I'd like to talk about

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.370
is something I didn't know when
I started teaching this class

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.200
that I had to teach myself.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.260
So I'm going to take you on a
personal journey on something

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.462
I had to learn to do better
to actually do valuation.

00:02:31.462 --> 00:02:33.170
So I'm going to start
out with a question

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.878
that I start off every
one of my classes.

00:02:34.878 --> 00:02:37.690
Let me give you a sense of
what my classes look like.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.640
I have a typical
class of about 300.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.940
It's an MBA class,
it's about 300 people

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.340
who walk into the room.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.074
And if you're familiar with
how MBA programs have evolved,

00:02:46.074 --> 00:02:47.615
they've become more
and more diverse.

00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:51.290
So I've got not just bankers,
but I've got museum directors,

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.250
I've got ballet dancers
and NBA players.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.940
In a sense, it's a
very diverse classroom.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.940
So here's one of the first
questions I ask them,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.732
and I'm going to start off this
session with that question.

00:03:02.732 --> 00:03:04.940
There's no right answer,
don't look at your neighbor.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.590
So here's my question.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.030
If I asked you to classify
yourself as a person,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.820
would you more naturally
think of yourself

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.346
as a storyteller or
a number cruncher?

00:03:17.346 --> 00:03:18.720
Think about it
for just a moment.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.300
What comes more naturally
to you, storytelling

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.300
or number crunching?

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.440
Howard, I know you've
known for a long time,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.450
so you probably knew.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.600
I'll tell you when I knew.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.570
I knew when I was
about 13 or 14,

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.930
right after my first
English literature class.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.269
And I was asked to read
"Moby Dick," and I did.

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.310
And I was ready for the
discussion, ready to talk

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.510
about whales and captains.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.240
So I show up in class ready to
talk about whales and captains

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.300
and there's nary a mention
of whales or captains.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.920
And about 15 minutes
into the session,

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.970
the instructor says,
there was no whale.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.220
And so what?

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.070
I distinctly remember a big
black fish going all the way

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.360
through the book.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.520
And then she started talking
about hidden meanings

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.160
in the book and I remember
sitting there saying, really?

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.286
That's what Herman Melville was
thinking when he wrote that?

00:04:07.286 --> 00:04:09.160
And my reaction when I
came out of that class

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.100
was, never again am I
going to subject myself

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.680
to this kind of bullshit.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.399
And my life was
laid out for me--

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.519
it was Algebra I,
Algebra II, Algebra III,

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.729
out of high school.

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.270
And these were the good old days
when you could go to college

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.360
and not have to deal with the
crap you have to do today--

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.860
core curriculum,
you know where they

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.890
make you take classes for two
years you never want to take.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.230
Those days, you could take
numbers class, numbers class,

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.900
numbers class, numbers
degree out there.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.340
And then you had a numbers job--
you were a banker, an engineer.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.590
And after about four
years of entering numbers

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.610
into spreadsheets, you
got incredibly bored so

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.276
what did you do?

00:04:43.276 --> 00:04:46.090
Come back to business
school, you're in that class.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.570
About 180 people in my
class are number crunchers,

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.480
recovering number crunchers.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.640
But there were people
in that literature class

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.140
who loved this
hidden meaning stuff.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.340
I've never understood them.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.770
They're the poets.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.526
My youngest son is a poet.

00:05:01.526 --> 00:05:02.900
He showed me his
first poem and I

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.358
don't think he's going to show
me too many poems after this

00:05:05.358 --> 00:05:07.970
because he showed me the
poem and I said, [INAUDIBLE],

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.110
I think there's a problem.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.110
Aren't the last words
supposed to rhyme?

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.750
He said, Dad, you're not a poet,
that's why you don't get this.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.584
I said, you're right.

00:05:16.584 --> 00:05:19.000
But there were people who loved
this hidden meaning stuff.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.249
They took Literature I,
Literature II, Literature III,

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:24.070
became history majors
at Yale, went to work,

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.680
and discovered that even
Yale history majors don't

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.840
get paid very much.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.174
So after about three years
of poverty-stricken lives,

00:05:31.174 --> 00:05:32.590
they come back to
business school,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.870
they're the other 120
people in my class.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.990
That's roughly speaking what
my class breaks down into,

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.710
60% number crunchers,
40% storytellers.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.640
And once this
classification happens,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.515
the number crunchers
start to preen.

00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:50.290
They say, what the hell are
you guys doing in this class?

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.630
This is a numbers class,
it's a valuation class.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.700
And that's when I
let them in on what

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.270
I think is the biggest
hidden secret in valuation.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.090
Valuation can never be
just about the numbers.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.600
If you have just a collection
of numbers in a spreadsheet,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.270
you just have a collection
of numbers in a spreadsheet.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.660
To me valuation, is a bridge
between stories and numbers.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.580
And let me explain
what I mean by that.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.100
When you show me a valuation,
I point to a number

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.370
and ask you, why is that number
what it is, I need your story.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.670
And when you tell me a
story about a company, about

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.560
great management,
about a brand name

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.260
and I say, what does that story
mean, I need to hear a number.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.790
Good valuations
bridge that divide.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:31.800
And it is what--

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.680
I mean, I know this word
is going to sound strange

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.620
in the context of valuation.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.245
The story is what gives
soul to your valuation.

00:06:40.245 --> 00:06:42.280
A valuation, that's
a spreadsheet.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.990
The story is what gives
your valuation a soul.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.940
And here's where my
personal journey begins.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.610
I started teaching the
valuation class in '86.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.680
And when I first
started teaching it,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.260
I taught it as a number
cruncher does, which is what?

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.000
All numbers all the time.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.430
When in doubt, add an equation.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.740
You're in further doubt,
add two equations.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.140
That's how number
crunchers think.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.180
And about six years
into the process,

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.440
I discovered I had no
faith in my own valuations,

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.930
another word you don't see
in the context of valuations,

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:13.660
right?

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.560
And here's what I mean about
faith in your own valuations.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.740
When you value a company,
especially if you're not

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.180
being paid to do the valuation,
why do we value companies?

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.154
It's not because we're
intellectually curious.

00:07:25.154 --> 00:07:26.820
I don't lie awake and
say, I wonder what

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.350
Facebook is worth right now.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.010
If you do, see a psychiatrist.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.220
I value companies because I
want to act on those valuations

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.000
in what sense?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.520
If I find something
to be undervalued,

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.200
I need to be able to
buy that stock, right?

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.790
And what I discovered about
six years into this process was

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.800
I could value a
company, but I wasn't

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.000
willing to act because I knew
it's a collection of numbers.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.700
I knew how easily I
could make those numbers

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.700
move if I wanted to, make
that revenue growth from--

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.370
I could hide my biases
all over the place

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.059
and you would never find it.

00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:04.350
That's when I started thinking
about what am I missing?

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.900
And what I found I was
missing was the capacity

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.460
to tell a story.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.980
So what I'd like to do is
take you on this journey

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.380
because if you're
a number cruncher,

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.414
you have some
delusions to overcome

00:08:15.414 --> 00:08:18.080
and if you're a storyteller, you
have your own set of delusions.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.775
So let me ask this room that
question, how many of you

00:08:20.775 --> 00:08:24.290
are natural number crunchers?

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.640
So let me list some delusions.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.500
Let's see if we share
these delusions.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.310
The first is the
delusion of precision.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.400
The way I describe this is when
a number cruncher is in doubt,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.909
you know what he or she does?

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.580
Adds decimals.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.500
It makes you feel
much better, right?

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.500
Three decimals,
maybe make it five--

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.980
delusion of precision.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.590
The second is the delusion
that you being objective.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.730
Why-- I just use numbers,
I'm not being biased.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.690
And the third is the
delusion of being in control.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.820
Just because you have
a number for something

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.890
doesn't mean you control
it, but it gives you

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.280
the delusion of control.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.850
Those are the number
cruncher's delusions.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:06.830
If you're a storyteller, you
have your own set of delusions

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.720
and here are some
of those delusions.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.090
The first is you
think being creative

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.980
should bring its own reward.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.630
I told you such
a great story, it

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.650
should be worth at
least $3 billion, right?

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.960
You think number crunchers
dream in black and white,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.690
they're incapable of
dreaming in color,

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.810
they have no imaginations.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.270
And you love anecdotal evidence.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.760
You're like my
mother-in-law, and I don't

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.990
mean that as a compliment.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.790
She comes up with the most
outlandish conclusions.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.959
You wonder, where
did that come from?

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:41.000
I'll give you an example.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
About 10 years ago,
she mentions in passing

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.897
that the best car to drive in a
snowstorm is a Volkswagen bug,

00:09:47.897 --> 00:09:49.730
you know the old ones
that you could pick up

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.999
with two errands and move?

00:09:51.999 --> 00:09:53.540
I said, how do you
come up with this?

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.760
And she told me--

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.050
I should never ask her, how
do you come up with this

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.820
because she always tells me.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.250
She said 25 years
ago she was driving

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.000
in Lake Tahoe in a Volkswagen
bug in a snowstorm.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.580
There were two cars in front
of her which went off the road

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.110
and she made it back home.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.770
Therefore, a
Volkswagen bug is the--

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:13.970
sample size of one.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.770
Amazing how you can
extrapolate from there.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.270
So when I look at my 300
students, I tell them,

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.730
this is what I hope this
class will do for you.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.590
I turned to the
storytellers first and say,

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.960
by the end of this
class, I hope you

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.570
learn enough number
crunching skills

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.280
to develop some discipline.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.280
Because when you tell
stories, you sometimes get

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.570
carried away, right?

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.265
You wander across that line
between fact and fantasy

00:10:39.265 --> 00:10:41.640
and you're not even sure that
you walked across the line.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.030
I hope you develop enough
number crunching that you know

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.190
that you're crossing the line.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.800
I hope that you become
disciplined storytellers.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.230
Then I turn to my
number crunchers

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.460
and say, by the
end of this class,

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.730
I hope you trust
your imagination.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.500
To me, that is the
essence of somebody

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.230
who's good at valuation,
disciplined storytellers

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.480
or imaginative number crunchers.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.910
So let me ask you a final
question before we move on.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.130
Who do you think I
have more trouble with,

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:13.720
getting storytellers to develop
discipline or number crunchers

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.060
to trust their imagination?

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.790
It's not even close--
number crunchers.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.950
You give me 100
history majors, I

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:22.990
can teach them enough
valuation in a day

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.610
that they're going
to be OK tomorrow.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.660
You give me 100 engineers,
I'll give up right away.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.230
You guys are beyond
redemption because you've

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.374
spent your entire lifetime
bludgeoning your imagination

00:11:35.374 --> 00:11:36.040
into the ground.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.260
You don't trust it anymore.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.290
So to me, this is
the key to valuation

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.570
is working on your weak side.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.350
I know it's a legend about the
left brain and the right brain,

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.130
but if that legend is true
that the left brain controls

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.420
logic and the right
brain, why are you

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.940
using only half a brain?

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.950
It's tough enough
using your entire brain

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.930
and doing things right.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.830
If you trust only
half your brain,

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.570
you're not using the other half.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.130
So what I'd like
to do is take you

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:09.540
on my journey of how I
taught myself storytelling.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.000
And I'm going to take
you through five steps

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.920
that I go through to
get to a valuation.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.801
Why five steps?

00:12:16.801 --> 00:12:18.800
Because I'm a number
cruncher, I think linearly.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.841
I have to think in steps.

00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:22.100
If you're not a number
cruncher, jumble them all up.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.345
It doesn't matter the sequence.

00:12:24.345 --> 00:12:26.720
So here are the five steps
I'm going to take you through.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.550
I'm going to start
off by telling you

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.370
a story about a company.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.170
And to tell a story
about a company,

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.628
you know what, I
need to understand

00:12:34.628 --> 00:12:35.720
what the company does.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.269
If I think Cisco
makes vegetable oil,

00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:41.060
the story I'm going to
tell you about Cisco

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.800
is going to make
no sense at all.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.950
So that common
sense wisdom you're

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.720
given, you've got to understand
a business to value it,

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.740
that applies in spades.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.630
I've got to tell you a
story about the company.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.750
Second step, I've
got to stop and make

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.880
sure the story I've told
is not a fairy tale.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.210
I've got to ask three
questions-- is it possible, is

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.674
it plausible, is it probable?

00:13:04.674 --> 00:13:06.340
Sounds like I'm playing
on words, right?

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.810
Which is the weakest test--

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:11.200
possible, plausible,
or probable?

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:11.700
Possible.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.500
Lots of things are possible.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.620
A subset of those are plausible.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.540
An even smaller
subset are probable.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.430
For every 100 business stories
I hear, maybe 15 are plausible

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.932
and five are probable.

00:13:24.932 --> 00:13:27.390
I'll give you a very simple
way of thinking about possible,

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.935
plausible, and probable.

00:13:28.935 --> 00:13:32.760
Any San Francisco
Giants fans here?

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.260
Nobody?

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:33.820
OK.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.460
Any Yankee fans here?

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.580
I'm a Yankee fan.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.330
OK, they're 10 and
five right now.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.790
I'm feeling very good.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:48.400
Is it possible that they could
go 157 and five this season?

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.420
There are 162 games
in a baseball season,

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.190
you don't know.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.860
Is it possible?

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.910
Yes, it's possible.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.090
Is it plausible?

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:57.590
No.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.520
Why not?

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:04.210
No team in history has ever
won 147 games in a row, ever.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.340
It's possible,
but not plausible,

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.530
and it's definitely
not probable.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.710
Three different levels of tests.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.320
Once I've established that my
story is possible, plausible,

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.890
and probable comes what I call
the craft part of valuation.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.840
And here's what I mean
by the craft part.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.780
I have to be able to take
every part of my story

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.380
and make it into a
number in my valuation.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.600
And you say, what if my
story can't become a number?

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.000
I view it as a challenge
when somebody says,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.060
I have a variable you can't
or I have a story you can't--

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.580
you tell me a story, I'll find
the number and a valuation

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.380
to reflect it.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.750
And once I convert my
story into numbers,

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.370
the valuation does itself.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.500
By the time you look
at the valuation,

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.600
it's my story that's
driven the valuation.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.060
so if you point to a
number in my valuation,

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.150
I should be able to back
it up with the story.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.256
And then comes the
most difficult part.

00:14:55.256 --> 00:14:56.880
So you've told this
great story, right?

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.838
Do you like your story?

00:14:57.838 --> 00:14:58.520
Yeah, of course.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.537
It's your story.

00:14:59.537 --> 00:15:01.370
You've converted the
story into a valuation.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.600
Do you like your valuation?

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.980
Absolutely.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.530
And when you present
that valuation

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.910
to other people, what do
you want them to tell you?

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.510
This is amazing.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.030
This is exactly the way
I'll value the company.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.940
So here is my
advice to you, don't

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.280
talk to people who
think just like you.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.139
Don't hang out with
people who think just

00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:21.430
like you because they're
going to say, this is amazing.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:25.070
This is exactly how I'd
value the company, too.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.630
So here's what I call keeping
the feedback loop open.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:32.094
Seek out people who
think the least like you.

00:15:32.094 --> 00:15:33.760
When you present your
valuation to them,

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.510
you know what they're
going to say, right?

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.740
This is horrible, this is a
stupid way to value a company.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.920
Listen because they might
be telling you things that

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.450
can make your story better.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.610
So what I'm going to do
is take two companies

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.030
through this process so you
can see this game play out.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.740
And the two companies
I'm going to use I

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.159
know you're familiar with.

00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:56.700
And the reason I'm going to pick
familiar companies is here's

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.700
what I'd like you to do.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.780
As I tell my story,
I'd like you to think

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.910
about how wrong my story is.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.520
So I want you to
think about what

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.280
you disagree with my story,
but don't interrupt me.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.440
This is my story, my turn.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.080
But after I'm done, I'm going to
give you an architecture where

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.260
you can take your story
about these companies

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.120
and make them with
your valuations.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.800
To me, that is the
essence of investing

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.070
is you take ownership
of your own stories.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.640
So here are the two
companies I'm going to use.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.530
The first is Uber
in June of 2014.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.060
So why does the timing matter?

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.040
Because my story for
Uber shifts over time.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:34.790
Why does it shift?

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.010
Because the world
shifts around me.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.490
So I've actually on my blog
valued Uber in June of 2014,

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.900
September of 2015, September of
2016, and I plan to do it again

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.270
in a month.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.290
And my stories change
and I have no shame

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.780
about admitting the fact that
my stories change all the time.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.170
The second company
I'm going to value

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:59.040
is Ferrari in
October of 2015, just

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.760
before their initial
public offering.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.220
Ferrari has actually been around
a long time, since the 1940s.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.290
But in the 1960s, Enzo
Ferrari got into some trouble

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:12.030
and he had to sell off 90%
of Ferrari to Fiat Chrysler

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.160
and for about 50
years, Ferrari stayed

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.060
as a part of Fiat Chrysler,
until 2015 when it was spun off

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.450
as an independent company.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.589
So I'm sure everybody
in this room

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:24.480
is at least familiar
with what Uber does

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.200
and what Ferrari does.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.160
So these are stories that should
have a hint of familiarity

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.780
to you.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.090
So let's start the game.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.300
The first step in the process
before I tell a story is I

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.260
need to understand the company,
understand the business.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.570
One of my problems with the
way research has evolved,

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.754
it's become too much around
financial statements.

00:17:44.754 --> 00:17:46.670
When I ask you to do
research, what do you do?

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.560
You collect
financial statements.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.360
And the other thing
that's become a problem

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.754
is Google search
because when I ask you

00:17:53.754 --> 00:17:54.920
to do research, what do you?

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.169
You type the name of the
company, hundreds of articles

00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.740
pop up.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.410
That's not a bad place to
start, but it should never

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.270
be the place you end.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.220
You know you learn
more about a company?

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.690
Talk to people.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.190
Talk to people who
use the product,

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.320
talk to people who
work at the company.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.020
You need to understand
what the company does,

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.610
what makes it tick, to
be able to value it.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.850
So I'm going to tell you
when I first heard of Uber

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.240
and when I say this,
you're going to laugh.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.239
You'll say, you didn't
hear about it until then?

00:18:22.239 --> 00:18:24.257
I heard about Uber
in June of 2014.

00:18:24.257 --> 00:18:26.590
You're saying, what were you
doing, living under a rock?

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.382
I was actually
living underground.

00:18:29.382 --> 00:18:31.840
Because I live in New York
City, I take the subway, I never

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.060
take the surface roads.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.044
Because who wants to
deal with the traffic?

00:18:35.044 --> 00:18:37.210
So I see this new story in
the "Wall Street Journal"

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:41.490
that says Uber has been
priced by a venture capitalist

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.400
at $17 billion.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.440
Notice the word I used.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.400
I used the word priced,
not the word valued.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.870
So let me put this on the table.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.480
No venture capitalist in history
has ever valued anything,

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.010
they have priced things.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.297
It's a very different
game because the way

00:18:58.297 --> 00:19:00.630
you win as a venture capitalist,
you buy at a low price,

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.250
you flip it to somebody
else at a high price.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.544
They had priced
it at $17 billion.

00:19:06.544 --> 00:19:07.960
And I said I hadn't
heard of Uber,

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.126
but that was a bit of a lie.

00:19:09.126 --> 00:19:11.560
I'd seen the word Uber on
my credit card statements

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:15.460
in the three months
leading into June of 2014

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.400
because it turned out that my
son, who was going to college

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.220
in North Carolina,
was using Uber

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.080
and using my credit
card to back it.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.694
I don't know how that happened.

00:19:24.694 --> 00:19:26.860
But I thought he was taking
German language classes,

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.120
to be quite honest.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.860
the no umlaut on the U should
have kind of given it away.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.245
So I called him, but
he was still sleeping.

00:19:35.245 --> 00:19:38.690
It's like 11:30 in the
morning, college student hours,

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.280
which means you go to bed at
like 5:00, you wake up at noon.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.260
So I called my niece,
who worked in Chicago,

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.870
and she was on her way to
work and not in a good mood.

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.110
So I said, what's this Uber?

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.000
She said, it's a
ride-sharing service.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.040
I said, what the heck is
a ride-sharing service?

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.970
She said, I don't have
the time to tell you.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.553
Why don't you just download the
app and find out for yourself?

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.500
So I hang up the phone,
I download the app,

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.250
and I hit the app.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.041
Magical things start
to happen on my phone.

00:20:06.041 --> 00:20:09.290
I see a GPS open up and I see
a car trying to get to me.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:10.250
It's New York City--

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:11.750
you only try to
get to a place, you

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.140
don't actually get there because
it's all one-way streets.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.607
And I could see a
guy called George

00:20:16.607 --> 00:20:17.690
sitting in the front seat.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.690
This has never happened
to me with a yellow cab.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:24.495
The car pulls up, I run out to
the car and say, hi, George.

00:20:24.495 --> 00:20:25.870
He says, where do
you want to go?

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:27.130
I said, I don't
want to go anywhere.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.255
Can you drive me around
for about 30 or 40 minutes?

00:20:29.255 --> 00:20:30.792
I have some
questions to ask you.

00:20:30.792 --> 00:20:33.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.547
He thought I was
a serial killer,

00:20:36.547 --> 00:20:39.130
but then he took one look at me
and said, I can take this guy.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.500
Get in the backseat.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.910
So I get in the back seat I
start asking him questions.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:45.230
I said, this is an Uber
car you're driving?

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.730
He said, no.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.320
This is my car.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.906
I said, are you
an Uber employee?

00:20:48.906 --> 00:20:50.530
He said, I'm an
independent contractor.

00:20:52.665 --> 00:20:53.790
I said, why do you do this?

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.074
He says, I have a regular job.

00:20:55.074 --> 00:20:56.490
I don't make enough
money and this

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.920
allows me to make a
second income in a car

00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.820
that I already own.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.780
I said, why do you need Uber?

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.280
He said, without Uber, I can't
pick up people in the street.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.980
It's illegal in New York City to
pull up to somebody in the curb

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.560
and say, do you want a ride?

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.840
Uber is my matchmaker.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.530
So at this stage,
I could understand

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:18.500
why this guy used Uber,
because it allowed him to take

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.829
a car he already owned--

00:21:19.829 --> 00:21:21.870
in fact, I asked him, do
you pay extra insurance?

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:24.078
He said, I don't mention it
to the insurance company.

00:21:24.078 --> 00:21:28.310
What they don't know,
they don't know.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.110
So basically, he
was taking the car,

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.570
he was using the
insurance he already had

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.180
and making a second income
and Uber was the matchmaker

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.680
that allowed him to do it.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.770
So he lets me off in
front of my office.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.222
I offer to pay him.

00:21:42.222 --> 00:21:43.680
He should have just
take the money.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.300
He said, you don't
have to pay me.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.130
I said, it's free?

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.855
He said, no, it's not free.

00:21:48.855 --> 00:21:50.730
When you downloaded the
app, did they ask you

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:51.825
for a credit card number?

00:21:51.825 --> 00:21:54.824
I said, yes, and bells
go off in my head.

00:21:54.824 --> 00:21:55.990
They're going to charge you.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.323
And I said, how do you get paid?

00:21:57.323 --> 00:22:01.240
He said, they'll send me
80% of whatever the fare is.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.800
I remember asking, why 80%?

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.270
He said, I don't know.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.110
That's what they all do.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.660
Now I could understand why
Uber did what they did.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.190
For essentially
being matchmakers,

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.180
they collected 20%
of whatever you pay.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.230
I said, this is
a great business.

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:17.870
Which left me with
one missing piece,

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.020
why do customers like Uber?

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.590
So this time, I called my
son at a civilized hour,

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:27.032
like 3:30 in the afternoon,
when he was awake.

00:22:27.032 --> 00:22:29.240
And I decided to put him on
the defensive right away.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.750
I said, I've been noticing
you've been using my credit

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.760
card to back up
your ride-sharing--

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:39.470
I made it sound like I knew what
Uber was doing all the time.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:42.170
You have your own car,
why do you need Uber?

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.610
He said, Dad, on some
nights, I like Uber.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:49.510
Some questions as a parent
you don't dig too deeply on.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.190
I kind of got it.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:54.070
But this is a kid I
can't even visualize

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.750
him calling a traditional cab.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.460
It's not even in his
frame of reference

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.711
to go out on the street
and wa-- you know.

00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:01.210
I said, what do you
like about Uber?

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.610
And he said, I can call
the car from my phone.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.320
And I said, these cars must
cost you a lot more than a cab,

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:06.820
right?

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.890
He said, no, they're
cheaper than a cab.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.750
I said, you must wait
a lot longer, right?

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.015
He said, no, no, they,
come faster than a cab.

00:23:13.015 --> 00:23:15.160
I said, these cars
must be filthy, right?

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.510
They're cleaner than a cab.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:17.990
I said, let me get
this straight--

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.470
they're cheaper than a cab,
they're faster than that cab,

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:21.595
they're cleaner than a cab.

00:23:21.595 --> 00:23:24.490
That's when I knew cab
service was destined for doom.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.380
We can dance around
as much as you want.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.290
The final question I had
to clean up for myself was,

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.570
why couldn't I do
this in my basement?

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.910
I could be a matchmaker
just like Uber.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.210
And there were three answers I
came up with in June of 2014.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.130
The first was $3 billion.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.260
That's how much they
raised from the VC.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.820
I didn't have $3 billion.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.720
That puts me at a disadvantage.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.380
The second is this is a game
with a networking benefit,

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.340
you see what I mean?

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.287
As you sign up more
drivers, it becomes--

00:23:51.287 --> 00:23:52.870
a new driver wants
to join, he's going

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:54.700
to go where the
rest of the drivers

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.550
are because the bigger
that space, the more likely

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:59.590
it is you'll get customers.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:03.100
And the third is it is a company
that is using data in ways

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.480
that hadn't been used before.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.460
Like what?

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.100
The surge pricing, for instance.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.440
So when I talk about
understanding your company,

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.310
I'm essentially talking about
learning more about what

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.560
your company does-- why do
people like it's products,

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.030
why do they work for it--

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:21.140
and getting a sense of
what the business model is.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:25.580
So to complete the story, after
I did this research-- if you

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.810
can call it that-- on
Uber, I drew a picture

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:30.690
and I try to do this with
almost every company I value,

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:33.330
a picture of what the company
does, what it produces,

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.690
who buys from the
company, why they do it.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.430
In the case of Uber, what
completes the story is

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.570
they have a business model--

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.750
and I could see this
in June of 2014--

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.644
that is easily scalable.

00:24:44.644 --> 00:24:46.310
You know what I mean
by easily scalable?

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.420
For Uber to go to a new
city, all they need to do

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.725
is hire one person, put
them in a motel room

00:24:50.725 --> 00:24:53.119
and say, sign up as
many drivers as you can.

00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:54.660
There's no infrastructure
investment.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:59.070
They don't buy the cars, which
means they are going to--

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.820
it comes with
pluses and minuses.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.800
It means they can grow
much faster, that's a plus.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.450
What's a minus?

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.640
It means that other
people can use the same--

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.710
so it's a business that's
going to grow fast,

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:13.970
but it's going to be difficult
to defend and make money on.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:18.830
I had a sense, at least, in
June of 2014 of what Uber did.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.690
Let's turn to Ferrari.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.700
Technically speaking,
it's a car company, right?

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:24.533
That's the bad news.

00:25:24.533 --> 00:25:25.900
Why is it the bad news?

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.770
Because this is not a
great business to be in.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.200
It's one of the 10 worst
businesses in the world

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.252
to be in.

00:25:32.252 --> 00:25:33.960
That sounds like a
categorical statement,

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.840
but every year I actually
rank the 10 worst businesses.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.750
Online advertising has not
made it there, so don't worry.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.950
Your businesses are safe.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.280
The automobile business
is an awful business.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.210
Let me start laying out the
basis for that statement.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:51.090
In the 10 years
leading up into 2015,

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:53.400
which is when
Ferrari went public,

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.940
the revenue growth at automobile
companies on an annual basis

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.150
globally was only about 5.6%.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:01.332
That's it.

00:26:01.332 --> 00:26:03.200
That's pretty anemic growth.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.670
And half that growth comes from?

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.610
I tell my MBAs, when somebody
asks you a question you don't

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.470
know the answer to, say China.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:14.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.890
It's amazing how often
that is a good answer.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:18.750
Whatever the
question, China works.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:19.910
Why are interest rates low?

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.094
China.

00:26:21.094 --> 00:26:22.260
Why are interest rates high?

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.187
China.

00:26:23.187 --> 00:26:24.270
Why is inflation going up?

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.230
China.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.710
It's like six degrees of
separation from Kevin Bacon.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:32.250
Every question, China is
within six degrees of hey,

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:33.820
that's the right answer.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.332
So 5.6% growth, half
of it comes from China.

00:26:36.332 --> 00:26:37.290
You're saying, so what?

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:42.470
If China slows down, the
5.6% is going to become 4%.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.570
Operating margins are abysmal.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.730
The average operating margin--

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.200
so this is not
net profit margin,

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.680
this is higher up in the
income statement-- is 4.4%.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.240
And 1/3 of all automobile
companies lose money.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.880
So you've got low
revenue growth,

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.420
you've got abysmal margins,
let's nail the coffin shut.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.280
Normally, when you have
low revenue growth,

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.260
one of the few
bonuses you get is

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.786
you don't have to
reinvest very much.

00:27:07.786 --> 00:27:09.560
But in the case of
automobile companies,

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.059
that is not true
because they've had

00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:13.695
to reinvest not in
assembly lines, but in R&amp;D.

00:27:13.695 --> 00:27:16.070
Do you know why they
have to invest in R&amp;D?

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.030
The modern car is more
computer than car,

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.150
so they had to invest
in R&amp;D to catch up.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:23.270
This is your definition of
a bad business-- low revenue

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.000
growth, abysmal margins,
lots of reinvestment.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.410
The way this manifests itself
is in nine of the last 10 years

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:33.170
leading into 2015,
automobile companies

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:38.650
earned a return on capital
less than the cost of capital.

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:41.840
That's the bad news for Ferrari,
they're in a bad business.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.370
The good news for
Ferrari is they're

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.170
not another car company, right?

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.180
In fact, I'm not even
sure if it's a car.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.250
It's a very impractical car.

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.080
There's one guy in my
town owns a Ferrari,

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.820
I've never seen him drive it.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.304
It's kept in an extra armored
garage with two security

00:27:56.304 --> 00:27:56.970
guards in front.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.070
You could break into his
house multiple times,

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.780
but his car is protected.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.821
Rumor is once every year, he
takes the car out of the garage

00:28:03.821 --> 00:28:05.820
and drives it around town,
back into the garage,

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.707
locks it up for the next year.

00:28:07.707 --> 00:28:08.790
And who can blame the guy?

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.360
What are you going to do in your
Ferrari, go grocery shopping?

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.990
Can you imagine parking your
car, walking into the grocery?

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.990
AUDIENCE: A lot of
them, the insurance

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.990
covers only the weekends.

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:17.610
ASWATH DAMODARAN: There you go.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:19.170
And even the
weekends, you probably

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:20.940
have to have two guards
running next to your car

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.689
to make sure nobody
is scratching your car

00:28:22.689 --> 00:28:24.270
as you're driving it.

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.840
You can't go grocery--

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.380
how about carpool in a Ferrari?

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.130
You've got four kids
to pick up, one seat.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.796
What are you going
to do, stack them up?

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.020
So why would people
spend all this money

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.040
to buy a car you
can't drive anywhere?

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.580
Because you're part of
a very exclusive club.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.690
How exclusive?

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.100
Let me give you a picture.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.310
In all of 2014, the year
leading into the IPO,

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:53.140
Ferrari sold 7,255
cars globally.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.522
In the entire year, 7,255.

00:28:55.522 --> 00:28:56.230
Think about that.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.260
That's how many cars
Volkswagen probably rejects

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.130
on its assembly line every day.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:04.700
7,255 the whole year,
that's bad news.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:09.696
The good news is their
operating margin is 18.2%.

00:29:09.696 --> 00:29:12.070
Remind me again what it was
or the rest of the automobile

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.030
business.

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:14.560
4.4%.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.880
So why is their margin so high?

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.060
One answer is because they've
priced the car so high.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.190
The other is they
spend almost nothing

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.850
on traditional advertising.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.340
Have you ever seen
a Ferrari ad on TV?

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.630
Come on in, 10% off.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.630
It's not the kind of
person they want coming in.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.857
In fact, I'm not even sure
how you buy a Ferrari.

00:29:32.857 --> 00:29:34.440
You walk in, the
dealer probably says,

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.910
do you have any references?

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:37.410
To what?

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:38.739
Billionaires you know.

00:29:38.739 --> 00:29:39.780
You know no billionaires?

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.310
Get out of here.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:44.760
It's an exclusive club, they
can't let the riffraff walk off

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.780
the street and buy a Ferrari.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:52.610
So it's doesn't sell very
many cars, high margins.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:55.590
And here is the final advantage.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:59.370
Normally, when you sell these
high priced luxury goods

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.580
like Tiffany and Guccis, in
good times you sell a lot--

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.890
you're affected by the
economy, because people

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.930
are reaching to buy your stuff.

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:08.400
That's not been true at Ferrari.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.320
They've sold about 7,200 cars in
the 10 years leading into 2014,

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.120
including 2009.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.530
Know why I picked 2009?

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:19.590
The year after the crisis
you'd expect sales to drop off.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:21.090
Nothing happened at Ferrari.

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.790
Why not?

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.530
The people who buy
Ferraris are so

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:27.570
rich that if you ask them,
what's the economy doing,

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:30.772
their response is,
what's an economy?

00:30:30.772 --> 00:30:32.480
Because to them the
essence of a bad year

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.820
is I'm worth only $4.5 billion
instead of $7.5 billion-- not

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:39.250
exactly cutting corners
or cutting costs.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.680
So the final bonus
you're getting

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.950
is you actually get pretty
stable revenues even though you

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:49.220
have this luxury product because
you've kept it so exclusive.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.710
Those things are all going
to play out when I tell you

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:54.190
my story for Ferrari.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:56.770
So let me talk about
business stories.

00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:00.040
What exactly is a business
story, how should you tell it?

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.770
If any of you are entrepreneurs,
want to be entrepreneurs,

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.822
dream of being
entrepreneurs, take

00:31:05.822 --> 00:31:07.030
this for whatever it's worth.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:11.700
If you're telling a business
story, keep it simple.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.580
As opposed to what?

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.240
Don't make yourself
so George RR Martin

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.832
and tell me a "Game
of Thrones" story.

00:31:17.832 --> 00:31:20.290
I still remember trying to read
the first "Game of Thrones"

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:20.790
book.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:22.305
About halfway
through, I gave up.

00:31:22.305 --> 00:31:23.888
There are like
hundreds of characters.

00:31:23.888 --> 00:31:24.490
They die.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:25.586
They come back to life.

00:31:25.586 --> 00:31:26.710
There are like six empires.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.390
I said, I'm too old for this.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.340
You tell a "Game
of Thrones"-- you

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.460
don't have seven
seasons and 70 episodes

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.960
to tell your business story,
you probably have five minutes.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.630
Keep it simple and
keep it focused.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.820
What's the end game
for every business?

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.460
You have to show me a
pathway to making money.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.080
Pathway doesn't have
to be next year,

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.980
it might be seven
years from now.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.340
So don't keep talking about
how many users you have.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.540
That's nice.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:54.460
Tell me how you plan to convert
these users into profits.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.960
That might come
way down the road,

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.700
but without thinking
about it, it's

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.560
not going to magically happen.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.620
So I'm going to try
to follow those rules

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.670
in trying to come up with
stories for Uber and Ferrari.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:10.020
So in June of 2014, here was
the story I told for Uber.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.800
And every word in the story
is going to have consequence,

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.320
so kind of hang in there.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.674
I described Uber as an
urban car service company.

00:32:17.674 --> 00:32:19.090
So already, I'm
trying to tell you

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:21.190
where I think Uber is
going to succeed, right?

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.420
Urban means cities
and big towns,

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.569
car services is
the basic business.

00:32:25.569 --> 00:32:27.610
Remember I said I wanted
you to think about where

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.510
you disagree with my story?

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:31.420
So given where
Uber is now, start

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.590
thinking about that's wrong.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:36.520
That's fine, but this is
my story in June of 2014,

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.470
an urban car service
company that's

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:41.530
going to attract new users
into the car service business.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:42.070
Like whom?

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:45.880
Like my son, people who normally
never take a cab who have now

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:49.050
tried to take this car service.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.087
With local networking
benefits, I've

00:32:51.087 --> 00:32:53.170
already talked about what
networking benefits are.

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:55.510
As you become the largest
ride-sharing company

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.474
in New York, there's
a tipping point

00:32:57.474 --> 00:32:59.140
where you're essentially
going to end up

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.014
dominating the market.

00:33:01.014 --> 00:33:02.680
You think, what's the
local doing there?

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.930
Let's say Uber becomes
the largest car service

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.680
company in New York
and I fly to Chicago.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.430
I don't care about the
largest car service

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.971
company in New York, I now care
about the largest car service

00:33:11.971 --> 00:33:12.850
company in Chicago.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:15.130
So in my story, here is
what's going to happen.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.140
Uber can end up
dominating New York,

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.450
Lyft can end up
dominating Chicago,

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:22.570
Didi Chuxing can end
up dominating Beijing,

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.700
and Ola can end up
dominating Mumbai.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:25.930
You think, so what?

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:28.829
When I start assigning
market share of the market,

00:33:28.829 --> 00:33:30.370
this story is going
to come into play

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.560
as to what kind of market
share you're going to see.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.000
And finally, I'm going
to assume that Uber

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.750
is going to be able
to continue to do what

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.240
it does now, which is what?

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.190
Not own the cars,
not hire the drivers,

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:42.034
which means that they
can scale up really fast.

00:33:42.034 --> 00:33:44.200
And they're going to be
able to keep that 80-20 mix.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.710
That's completely arbitrary.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:48.730
Why not 85-15, 90-10, 95-5?

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:50.710
They're going to keep that mix.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:54.160
So that was my Uber
story in June of 2014.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.000
Here's my Ferrari story
in October of 2015,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.166
at the time of their IPO.

00:34:00.166 --> 00:34:02.760
I assumed that it would
stay in an exclusive club.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.900
It doesn't have to, right?

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.070
It could pull what
I call a Maserati.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.719
Maserati in 2008 looked
a lot like Ferrari,

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:13.900
it sold about 7,000
cars, had high margins.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.380
But in 2009, Maserati
decided that they

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.300
wanted it to grow faster.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.600
The way they did this, they
introduced a new Maserati,

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.690
a cheaper--

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:23.570
don't get too excited,
it's not that cheap--

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:26.761
called the Ghibli, going
after a bigger market.

00:34:26.761 --> 00:34:27.469
And it succeeded.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:28.550
In what sense?

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.429
Their growth jumped
to 15% a year.

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:31.624
That's the good news.

00:34:31.624 --> 00:34:33.949
But what do you think
happened to their margins?

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:36.730
They went down because they
had to advertise, expend.

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:40.100
So they went from 18% to 14%.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.600
And in addition,
you are now selling

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.639
to people who are rich
but not super rich.

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:46.010
So they actually knew
what the economy was doing

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.469
and stopped buying cars if
they felt the economy was not

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:50.332
doing that well.

00:34:50.332 --> 00:34:51.790
So I'm going to
assume that Ferrari

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:53.790
is going to stay with
their exclusive club model

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:57.200
and not pull a Maserati.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.630
Now comes that test where--

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.610
one of the biggest
things about stories

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:04.340
is your biggest
test is yourself.

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:07.100
You've got to make sure
that you ask of your story

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.180
the question before
somebody else asks it.

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:14.470
So is it possible, is it
plausible, is it probable?

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.470
The reason you ask that
question is probably

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:18.400
easy to build into
your cash flows, right?

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.200
There are all these
techniques we can use.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.260
Plausible I can build
into growth, possible

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.220
I'll just wave my hands and
perhaps use some option pricing

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.220
to kind of bring it in.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.260
But to illustrate what
I mean by possible,

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.200
plausible, probable, the
best way I can do this

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.000
is to flip it on
its head and talk

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.150
about implausible stories,
implausible stories,

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:42.260
and improbable stories.

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.590
I'll give you one example
of an impossible story.

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:47.300
Every person in my class has
to pick a company to value

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.249
and they can pick
whatever they want.

00:35:50.249 --> 00:35:52.540
So about two years ago, one
of the students in my class

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.100
picks Netflix to value.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.200
This is a company that is a
great company value-- exciting,

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:57.950
dynamic--

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.650
but a company where you
have to really stretch

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:03.460
to get the value up to the price
because it's a really richly

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.640
priced stock.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.420
So it's trading
at 1.8, comes back

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.110
with a $500 value per share.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.370
I'm flabbergasted.

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:13.870
So I look at the
numbers and he's

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:19.570
projected revenues of $600
billion for Netflix 10 years

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:20.516
from now.

00:36:20.516 --> 00:36:22.540
So I call the kid in--
he wasn't even a kid,

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.270
he was 29 years old--

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:25.800
and I said, do you have Netflix?

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.790
He said, yes.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:27.710
I said, how much do
you pay for a year?

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:28.830
He pulled out his
calculator, which seemed

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:30.350
to be attached to his hip.

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:32.880
He hits the numbers,
about $100 a year.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.490
I said, how many
subscribers would you

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:39.132
need to get to $600
billion in revenues?

00:36:39.132 --> 00:36:40.590
He pulls out this
calculator again.

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:42.298
I said, you don't need
a damn calculator.

00:36:42.298 --> 00:36:44.010
Divide $600 billion
by $100, you've

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.422
got six billion subscribers.

00:36:46.422 --> 00:36:48.130
He says, I don't see
where this is going.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.255
I said, just hang in there.

00:36:49.255 --> 00:36:51.559
I have a couple of
more questions for you.

00:36:51.559 --> 00:36:53.350
I said, what's the
population of the world?

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:54.266
He says, I don't know.

00:36:54.266 --> 00:36:55.704
I have to go check Wikipedia.

00:36:55.704 --> 00:36:57.120
I said, I'll save
you the trouble.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.066
It's about maybe six billion,
six and a half billion.

00:37:00.066 --> 00:37:02.070
I said, is there something
I don't know maybe

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:03.000
that you should be telling me?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.791
Maybe there's been a
law that's been passed

00:37:04.791 --> 00:37:07.270
that says every man, woman,
and child and perhaps

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:11.730
pet in every household has
to have a Netflix account.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:13.440
He says, don't be absurd.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.510
I said, I'm not the one
estimating $600 billion

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:16.920
in revenues.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.526
That's an impossible story.

00:37:19.526 --> 00:37:21.650
I'll make a statement--
you might not believe this,

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:24.190
but as you look at
valuations, you try this out.

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:27.550
One in four valuations that
I see, maybe one in three,

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:31.080
from big name
appraises and banks

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.530
are impossible valuations,
it just can't happen.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:36.120
Its a fairytale.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.540
An implausible
valuation can happen,

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.910
but you have to have a really
good explanation for it.

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:45.830
I'll give you one example.

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:48.240
A student of mine went
to work for an NFL team,

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.840
I won't name the
team, and he sent me

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.752
a valuation of the team, I
don't know for what reason.

00:37:52.752 --> 00:37:54.210
So I looked at the
evaluation, he's

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:55.850
put in 3% growth and revenue.

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:57.350
It looks pretty
reasonable until you

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:00.350
get to how much money are you
putting back into the business.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:02.540
And they own their own
stadium and there was nothing

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:06.370
going back into the stadium,
no investment at all.

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:08.662
So I called him and I said,
I looked at your valuation.

00:38:08.662 --> 00:38:11.161
How come you're not putting any
money back into the stadium?

00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:12.660
Don't you have to maintain it?

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.520
He said, that's easy to explain.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.850
Every time we need to get the
stadium refurbished, here's

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:19.290
what we do.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:23.640
We go to the city
and we threaten them.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.420
With what?

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.030
We're moving to Las Vegas.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.530
Are you going to
fix the stadium?

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.320
And it works.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.420
It's an implausible story,
but if you can tell me why.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.230
So implausible
stories can happen,

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.938
but I'm going to push
you back and if you

00:38:36.938 --> 00:38:39.840
can give me a really good
explanation, OK, that's good.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.470
And improbable stories are
stories where your assumptions

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:44.760
are at war with each other.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.876
Let me explain.

00:38:45.876 --> 00:38:47.250
When I look at a
valuation, there

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:50.710
are three sides what I
call my valuation triangle.

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.710
There's the growth side,
the re-investment side,

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.450
and the risk side.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:55.500
So help me out here.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.950
If I have a company with
high growth on one side,

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:01.635
what should I expect to see when
I look at your reinvestment?

00:39:01.635 --> 00:39:05.770
High reinvestment and usually
high risk. high, high, high.

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:06.270
OK.

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.978
That makes sense.

00:39:06.978 --> 00:39:08.550
Low, low low makes sense.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:11.110
You have high, low, low,
I'm going to push back.

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:13.380
And again, you can have
a really good explanation

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.674
as to why your company has high
growth and low reinvestment.

00:39:16.674 --> 00:39:18.090
You're a toll road
company, you've

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:21.942
spent the last 10 years
building your told roads.

00:39:21.942 --> 00:39:23.900
Now you're getting the
growth from those roads.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.980
So you get the high
growth, but you

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.320
don't have to reinvest because
the reinvestment is all--

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.320
so if you're an
infrastructure, I get it now.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.866
My job in valuation is to
push you on these assumptions.

00:39:33.866 --> 00:39:35.240
And if you've
thought through it,

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.516
you can give me a
good explanation.

00:39:37.516 --> 00:39:39.515
But if you say, look, I
didn't even notice that,

00:39:39.515 --> 00:39:43.200
then you have the valuation
that's at war with itself.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.180
So I took my Uber story
and I checked it out.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.440
Is it possible?

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.700
Is it plausible?

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.372
Is it probable?

00:39:48.372 --> 00:39:49.830
And guess what,
I'm describing them

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.080
as an urban car service
company, which they're already

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.540
succeeding at.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.940
I argued that they're
bringing new users in.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.740
I could use my
son as an example,

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:01.772
but then I'm behaving
like my mother-in-law.

00:40:01.772 --> 00:40:03.230
So I'll use the
part of the country

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.970
where ride-sharing
has its deepest

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.100
roots, which is the Bay Area.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.630
Do you know that
by some estimates,

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:10.940
the size of the car
service business

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:13.510
in this part of the
country has tripled

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:17.114
since ride-sharing
companies came in?

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:18.780
You know what that's
telling you, right?

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.570
That there are people now
who take Uber who would never

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:24.390
have taken a cab, who might
have driven their own cars

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:25.530
or taken mass transit.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:26.970
It's making inroads.

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:29.550
So clearly, that part of
the story works, as well.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:31.500
It's plausible.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.540
The one part of
the story I wasn't

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.080
willing to go to
in June of 2014 was

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.680
the story of how Uber could
replace your second car.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.380
It's a story that I'm more
willing to buy into today,

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:45.840
that if you live in
the suburbs like I do.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.500
I drive my car to the train
station every morning.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.844
It's a three-minute drive,
I'm too lazy to walk.

00:40:50.844 --> 00:40:53.010
I park it there all day, I
come back in the evening,

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:56.410
I get back in the car, I drive
it home-- six minutes a day.

00:40:56.410 --> 00:41:00.390
Weekends I go crazy, like
25 minutes on a weekend.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.590
Collectively, I keep a
car, I pay insurance.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.860
It's insane.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.840
But if I lived in the
suburbs 10 years ago,

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.240
my answer would have been,
what other choice do I have?

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:13.240
It's not like I can
call a car service.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.229
Uber is in my town now.

00:41:15.229 --> 00:41:16.770
In fact, in the last
few months, I've

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:19.480
been noticing a billboard that
you can see from your train

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.910
as you're going through and
it's like every station.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:25.840
The billboard says, did you
drive to the station today?

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.860
And right below it
says, take Uber.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.210
The message is not to me,
I'm too old to change.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:33.720
But if you are you're 35,
you move to the suburbs,

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.260
instead of buying that second
car, you might take Uber.

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.240
This is really
good news for Uber,

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.420
it's really bad news for whom?

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:44.990
Automotive cars.

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:47.120
We talk a lot about
the disruptors.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.480
The more exciting thing is
what happens to the disrupted?

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.350
And there is, in
fact, a price that's

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:56.080
going to be paid
by those companies.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.920
So that's basically your
check on your story.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.580
Now, I'm going to take
a little tangent here.

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.050
Let's suppose you're
tired of working

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:07.150
at whatever you're doing.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:10.630
You quit and you become
a movie producer.

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:11.410
You move to LA.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:14.880
You hang out at the Bel
Air, Beverly Hills Hilton,

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.207
something by the pool.

00:42:16.207 --> 00:42:18.165
And I'm going to come
and pitch a story to you.

00:42:18.165 --> 00:42:20.170
And as I pitch this
story, you tell me

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.420
whether this story
sounds good to you.

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.980
It's about a 19-year-old
who drops out of Stanford.

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:27.234
Who does that?

00:42:27.234 --> 00:42:30.454
What's their acceptance
rate, like minus 3%?

00:42:30.454 --> 00:42:32.370
You got into one of the
most selective schools

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:33.703
in the country and you drop out?

00:42:33.703 --> 00:42:36.420
To make it interesting, let's
make the 19-year-old a woman.

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.980
Usually it's a male
geek dropping out

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.630
and starting a tech company.

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:42.840
This is a 19-year-old woman
who drops out of Stanford

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.030
and starts a business--
but not a tech business,

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:48.752
but a blood testing business.

00:42:48.752 --> 00:42:51.210
This is something we all have
experience with in our lives,

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:51.340
right?

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.130
We hate the way it's structured
right now with the labs that

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.430
take forever to run your tests
and charge you $1,500 to take

00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:59.730
two buckets of your blood
and feed it to Dracula,

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:01.606
I don't know what.

00:43:01.606 --> 00:43:02.980
So she's created
a business where

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:06.910
she needs only two drops of
your blood in a nanotainer.

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:09.490
That sounds pretty
fancy to begin with.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:12.040
And 32 tests are going
to be run in 45 minutes

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:15.880
and emailed to you and
it will cost you $50.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.270
Do you want this
story to be true?

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:19.500
I do.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.440
These are what I call
runaway stories, stories

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:26.319
that sound so good you're
afraid to ask the question.

00:43:26.319 --> 00:43:28.110
You know, the question
that's going to show

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:29.970
that the story doesn't work.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:32.100
I wish I had made up this
story because it's not

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:32.840
a made-up story.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.220
The 19-year-old who
dropped out of Stanford

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.510
was called Elizabeth Holmes.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:39.390
The company she
created was Theranos.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:42.550
And in the middle of
2015, venture capitalists

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:45.000
had priced Theranos--
again, that word comes out--

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:45.750
at $9 billion.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:49.030
Some of the biggest
names were on that list.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:50.950
And it's not just the
VCs who got excited.

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:54.100
It was the Cleveland
Clinic, Walgreens.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.012
If you'd asked me in
the middle of 2015, what

00:43:56.012 --> 00:43:57.720
do you think about
Theranos, my reaction,

00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.480
there must be some
substance here,

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.860
you have all these big names.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.110
But let me ask you a question.

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:04.472
You're investing in a
blood testing company.

00:44:04.472 --> 00:44:06.055
What's the first
question you're going

00:44:06.055 --> 00:44:08.830
to ask before you put your
money into the company?

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:10.130
Does it work, right?

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:11.920
And you'd assume
that somebody in here

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.430
would have asked that question.

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:16.510
But that turned
out to be not true.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:19.240
In October of 2015, a "Wall
Street Journal" reporter

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.702
decided to ask the question.

00:44:21.702 --> 00:44:23.160
And this is a
question, the answers

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.951
are actually out there
in the public domain

00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:26.617
because you have to
file with the FDA.

00:44:26.617 --> 00:44:28.200
He went to the FDA
and said, have they

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.130
been approved for 32 tests?

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:30.880
The FDA said, no.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.220
They've been approved
for one of the 32.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.600
He said, why?

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.900
Because the other 31, the
results are too noisy.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.910
Noisy blood tests--
it's not a feature you

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:41.885
want in a blood test, right?

00:44:41.885 --> 00:44:43.690
Maybe you have leukemia,
maybe you don't.

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:45.880
But don't worry about it, we'll
get back to you later, right?

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.830
It's not exactly something
you go looking for.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.410
And of course, the story
unraveled after that.

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:55.060
And the final
pieces of the story

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.220
are playing out with
Elizabeth Holmes being banned

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.560
from the blood testing
business for the next two years

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.990
and Theranos kind of unfolding.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:04.690
Runaway stories
are stories where

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:08.092
you want the story to be
true so much that you're

00:45:08.092 --> 00:45:10.300
afraid to ask the question
because you're afraid what

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.531
the answer might be.

00:45:11.531 --> 00:45:13.030
I would love to
tell you that if I'd

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:17.180
been an investor in Theranos, I
would have asked that question.

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:19.900
But I don't know.

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.821
Can you imagine
being in that room

00:45:21.821 --> 00:45:24.070
with Elizabeth Holmes saying
do your blood tests work?

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:27.857
You'd have felt like the
hunter who shot Bambi's mother.

00:45:27.857 --> 00:45:28.690
Have you ever felt--

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:30.370
I felt badly for that
guy in the movie.

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:32.920
Somebody shot that-- you have
no idea what I'm talking about,

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:33.420
right?

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.711
This is what happens when
you don't watch enough Disney

00:45:35.711 --> 00:45:36.220
movies.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.050
Go watch "Bambi."

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:43.360
So you're afraid that the answer
is going to ruin the story

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.570
and you don't ever
ask the question.

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:48.460
I mean, you'd be amazed at how
many business stories take off

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:50.450
and keep going
because people don't

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:52.820
want to ask that question.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:56.640
Let me do one other tangent.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:01.950
Sometimes I look at banking
valuations just for fun,

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:03.562
just to see
inconsistencies pop up.

00:46:03.562 --> 00:46:05.520
And this is the valuation
of Tesla, another one

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.240
of my favorite companies.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.960
This is a valuation where
the analyst had projected out

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.600
growth for Tesla where the
number of cars that Tesla would

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.850
produce would go from 25,000
in the most recent 12 months--

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:17.520
this was in 2013--

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.470
to 1.1 million in 10 years.

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:20.460
Is that possible?

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.090
Sure.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:22.080
Is it plausible?

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.640
Yeah, I can tell you really--

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.040
because let's face it,
this is a big business.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.350
So I was OK with that
part of the story.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:32.000
He then projected on margins
of about 7%, again plausible.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.930
So up to now, we're
on plausible story.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.990
Now, what's the capacity of that
Fremont Plant that Tesla has,

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:43.024
150,000, maybe 250,000 cars?

00:46:43.024 --> 00:46:45.190
So I went looking for the
third piece of the puzzle,

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:48.240
are you putting in money
to build more plants?

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.990
And in this
particular valuation,

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:53.750
it looked like the analyst
was putting nothing back

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:55.670
into new plants.

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:58.280
In fact, I called the analyst
and I pushed him on it

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.980
and he admitted finally that
it had slipped his mind.

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:05.580
I made a suggestion to him.

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.420
I said, you know what?

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:07.980
The only way you're going
to be able to get away

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.380
with this is you need to
watch "Willy Wonka's Chocolate

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.390
Factory."

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:15.830
Have you ever seen that
movie, the old version?

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:17.330
I was a very strange
younger person,

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:19.500
now I'm a very
strange older person.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:22.000
I remember coming out of that
movie with a big question.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.750
The question was,
Willy Wonka chocolates

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:27.400
are all over the world, but
there's only one factory--

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.485
six floors,
inefficiently laid out

00:47:29.485 --> 00:47:31.610
with chocolate rivers
running through it and stuff.

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:34.254
And I said, how do they
produce all these chocolates

00:47:34.254 --> 00:47:35.170
from this one factory?

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:38.310
And the answer, of
course, is in the movie.

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:41.310
It was the Oompa-Loompas.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:44.010
Remember them, magical
creatures that dance around

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:45.302
and chocolates come flying out?

00:47:45.302 --> 00:47:46.759
I said, here's what
you need to do.

00:47:46.759 --> 00:47:48.450
Put out a press
release that Tesla's

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:52.290
fired all of its regular
workers in its Fremont plant

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.850
and replaced them with
them Oompa-Loompas.

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:57.310
I call these
Oompa-Loompa valuations,

00:47:57.310 --> 00:47:59.470
where you have this growth
and nothing set aside

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:01.040
to create the growth.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.660
It's not going to happen.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:07.297
So I have my story, I'm going
to convert it into numbers.

00:48:07.297 --> 00:48:08.380
So let's start at the top.

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:11.150
I describe Uber as an
urban car service company.

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:13.500
The total market that
I used for my valuation

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:16.350
was the urban car service
market, which is $100 billion

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:18.900
in June of 2014.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:23.170
I assumed that Uber would pull
in new users into that market.

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:24.222
So here's what I did.

00:48:24.222 --> 00:48:25.680
Instead of letting
that market grow

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:28.450
at 2%, which is what it had
been growing going into,

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:31.620
I let it grow at 6%.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:34.931
I assume that Uber will have
in my story local networking

00:48:34.931 --> 00:48:35.430
benefits.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.412
The market share I
gave Uber reflected

00:48:37.412 --> 00:48:38.370
that part of the story.

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:42.060
It was a 10% market share, huge
relative to the typical car

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.970
service company then
but not a 40% or 50%

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:47.310
market share, which would
come about if you have

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:49.830
global networking benefits.

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:52.410
I assumed they'd be able
to maintain that 80-20 mix.

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:54.732
You're getting 20%
for doing nothing,

00:48:54.732 --> 00:48:56.940
your margins are going to
be immense in steady state.

00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:01.770
I gave them an operating
margin of 40% in steady state.

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:04.424
And finally, I also assumed that
they would never buy the cars,

00:49:04.424 --> 00:49:05.840
they would never
hire the drivers,

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.370
which means that they can
grow relatively easily.

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:11.330
So the way I reflected that is
for every dollar they invested,

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:13.130
they got $5 of revenues.

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:15.140
To give you a contrast,
for a typical US

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.920
company, every dollar you
invest brings $2 in revenues.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.010
I gave them $5.

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:23.865
Every part of my story
has become a number.

00:49:23.865 --> 00:49:25.990
If I take those numbers,
the valuation does itself.

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:28.050
So when you look at
the actual spreadsheet,

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:29.880
it looks like a
spreadsheet, but if you

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.080
point to a number in
the spreadsheet and say,

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.980
why is Uber making
what it is in year 10,

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.650
my answer is never going to be,
because I used a 10% revenue

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:40.500
growth for the first five
years and 7% thereafter.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.740
Its going to be because they're
an urban car service company

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:45.810
with local networking benefits.

00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:48.690
Every number in
this valuation will

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:50.950
reflect a part of my story.

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:52.450
And if you read
through the numbers,

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:53.449
we come up with a value.

00:49:53.449 --> 00:49:56.890
The value that I came up
with for Uber in June of 2014

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:58.500
was $6 billion.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.841
What is the story that
attracted my attention?

00:50:00.841 --> 00:50:02.340
The "Wall Street
Journal" story that

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:05.850
said they were priced
at $71 billion, right?

00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:07.895
So 15 minutes after I
post this on my blog,

00:50:07.895 --> 00:50:10.020
I get a call from a "Wall
Street Journal" reporter.

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:14.020
She must have been just hanging
out looking for this post.

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:17.310
She said, I've noticed the
valuation you put up of Uber

00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:18.660
and you came up with $6 billion.

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:19.204
I said, yes.

00:50:19.204 --> 00:50:21.120
she said, you do know
that venture capitalists

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.560
have priced it at $17 billion?

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.460
I said, yes.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.360
She said, how do you
explain the $17 billion?

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.359
I said, I don't have to.

00:50:26.359 --> 00:50:27.660
I didn't pay it.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.050
I've never felt the urge
to go around explaining

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:31.560
what other people do.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:34.580
So all you can do a valuation is
have your story and your value.

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:36.870
It's not my job to
sell you on that value.

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:39.810
I'm not a salesperson, I'm not
an equity research analyst.

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:41.630
I'm not asking you to
sell short on Uber,

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:43.200
I'm not saying don't buy Uber.

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.450
I'm saying I wouldn't buy Uber.

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:49.050
And I'm entitled
to make my choices.

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:51.410
So my story has
become a valuation.

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:52.785
I did the same
thing with Ferrari

00:50:52.785 --> 00:50:55.800
and here's how my exclusive
club story rolled out.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.690
Because it's an
exclusive club, I

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:01.050
had to give them low revenue
growth, only 4% a year.

00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:02.070
Could they grow faster?

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:03.910
Absolutely.

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:06.850
But I can't let them
grow faster in my story.

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:09.197
The bad news is revenue
growth is going to stay low.

00:51:09.197 --> 00:51:10.780
The good news is I'm
going to continue

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:13.570
to give them these hefty
margins, 18% margins.

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.976
And I'm going to give
them a low cost to capital

00:51:15.976 --> 00:51:17.350
because they're
selling to people

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:19.270
who are so rich
that they don't feel

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:21.250
the effects of the economy.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.550
The value that I came
up with for Ferrari

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:26.310
was 6.3 billion euros.

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:28.690
It actually went public
at about 7.5 billion,

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:30.900
it danced around six billion.

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:32.280
It's kind of settled in now.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:36.420
But this was my story
playing out as a valuation.

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:39.810
Last piece and then we'll
kind of open to questions.

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:41.372
As I said, you
finish a valuation,

00:51:41.372 --> 00:51:43.080
you feel pretty good
about your valuation

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.240
because it's your
story of value.

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.010
And as I said, the
best thing to do

00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:48.856
is actually put
it in places where

00:51:48.856 --> 00:51:50.730
people who don't agree
with you will read it.

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:53.970
And I got incredibly
lucky with my Uber post

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:56.950
because it got picked up in
four very different places.

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:59.210
The first was a site called 538.

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:00.980
Are you familiar with 538?

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:02.997
It's where numbers
geeks go to hang out

00:52:02.997 --> 00:52:05.330
because they apply statistics
and numbers to everything.

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:07.290
It's like money
ball and everything.

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:10.500
The second place it got
picked up was the Forbes blog.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.180
Who reads the Forbes blog?

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:15.870
People who are geriatric
investors who are basically old

00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:17.940
time value investors.

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:20.820
The third place it got
picked up was Tech Crunch.

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:23.400
You know who reads Tech Crunch.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.980
And finally, the final
place it got picked up

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:28.030
was this blog called
the Ride-Sharing Guy.

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:31.480
It's a guy who actually writes
for Uber and Lyft drivers.

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.940
There are actually
enough of them

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:35.010
that he can write a
blog just for them.

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:38.910
I got four very different sets
of reactions to my blog post.

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:41.190
The people in 538 nitpicked.

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:43.800
They said, why did you use
a 10% chance of failure?

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.720
Why not a 9.96%?

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.030
This is how numbers geeks think.

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:50.340
So I said, why don't you
take the spreadsheet--

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:54.360
because I put the spreadsheet--
and change the 10% to 9.97%

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.672
and see what happens.

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:57.130
Five minutes later,
I get an email,

00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:59.430
now I see why you used 10%.

00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:02.680
So all that nitpicking
with really no big picture.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.397
The Forbes blog people loved it.

00:53:04.397 --> 00:53:05.980
They said, this is
the way they should

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:09.430
be valuing companies, those
crazy Silicon Valley people.

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:10.514
I ignored the Forbes blog.

00:53:10.514 --> 00:53:12.971
No point going there and getting
patted on the back saying,

00:53:12.971 --> 00:53:14.020
this is amazing.

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:17.740
The Tech Crunch people
absolutely hated it.

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:23.230
They said, how dare you value
one of ours with your d.c.f.

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:25.390
We don't do that
in Silicon Valley.

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:27.070
I got this wave of abuse.

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.810
And in addition to
the wave of abuse,

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:32.560
I got some things about this
business I wouldn't have known.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.270
I'm not a tech person, I don't
want to be a tech person.

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:36.660
I'm not a ride-sharing expert.

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.560
Remember, I hadn't even
heard of ride-sharing

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.536
until June of 2014.

00:53:40.536 --> 00:53:42.160
So there were things
about the business

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:46.570
that I would never have known
if I hadn't read those posts.

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:48.200
And finally, from
the Ride-Sharing Guy,

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.790
I had some very interesting
things about the 80-20 mix.

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:53.470
They said, this is unusual.

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:56.710
Uber doesn't get to keep 20%
because they kick it back.

00:53:56.710 --> 00:54:00.360
They pay us $1,500
to switch from Lyft.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.400
And I would never
have found this

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.940
out by talking to Uber's
top management, right?

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:06.690
Because they want to
preserve the illusion

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:08.720
for the investors of its 20%.

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.837
In fact, that's what they
said even in the most

00:54:10.837 --> 00:54:11.670
recent announcement.

00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:13.270
They said, we're
still keeping 20%.

00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:16.080
Then how the heck are you losing
$4 billion on a $6 billion

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.040
revenue?

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.660
The numbers don't gel, right?

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.370
And it all came to
fruition while I

00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:26.400
was sitting waiting
for a flight to Munich

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:29.680
and I get an email
from Bill Gurley.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.690
I knew who he was.

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:33.430
And the email says, I
read your post on Uber

00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:36.980
and I did not like it and
I've written my own post

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.920
to counter your post, a blog
post to blog post warfare, very

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.954
new age.

00:54:40.954 --> 00:54:42.870
He said, I've said some
mean things about you.

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:45.581
I just want to let you know.

00:54:45.581 --> 00:54:46.330
I close the email.

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:48.640
I have an hour and a
half left for my flight,

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.650
so guess where I go next.

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:52.780
I go Above the Crowd,
which is Bill's blog,

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.280
and right there on
the top, it says,

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.570
"Damodaran Misses by a Mile."

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:58.004
Get it, Uber driving,
misses by a mile.

00:54:58.004 --> 00:54:59.920
And he took issue with
every part of my story.

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.920
He said, Uber is not just
a car service company,

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.020
it's a logistics company.

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.817
Words have consequences, right?

00:55:06.817 --> 00:55:08.650
Because all of a sudden,
what have you done?

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:12.130
You've expanded your business
to be car service, it's moving,

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:13.474
it's delivery.

00:55:13.474 --> 00:55:15.890
He said, it's not just urban,
it's going to be everywhere.

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:17.980
He gave examples of
suburban services

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:19.895
that they were going to offer.

00:55:19.895 --> 00:55:21.270
And he talked
about how they were

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:25.170
going to connect with airlines
and credit card companies

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:29.040
so that when you flew to Jakarta
on United, before they drag you

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:32.305
off the plane you'd get a
little Uber thing at the bottom

00:55:32.305 --> 00:55:33.930
where you could click
the Uber and say,

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:36.270
when I land in Jakarta,
I get-- so basically, you

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:38.670
want to connect with
airlines and have your credit

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:41.460
card already on there
so your local networking

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.170
benefits become global benefits.

00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:45.135
I was fascinated by the story.

00:55:45.135 --> 00:55:48.050
In fact, right after I read
the story, I took his story

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:49.050
and put it into numbers.

00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:50.330
And it's easy to do.

00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:52.440
The $100 billion
becomes a $300 billion

00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.770
total market if you make
it a logistics market.

00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:57.360
The 10% market share
becomes a 40% market

00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:01.649
share, the $6 billion value
becomes a $53 billion value.

00:56:01.649 --> 00:56:02.940
And then I said, you know what?

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:07.570
Those ride-sharing drivers
told me that 20% is fake,

00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:10.380
so I replaced the 20%
with 10% because if that's

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.540
the true margin, I
should be putting it in.

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:15.610
And that reduced the value
to about $29 billion.

00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:17.610
You're saying, does this
mean any number goes?

00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:17.760
No.

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.590
That's not what I
would take out of this.

00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:22.140
But your story drives
your valuations.

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:23.580
If you're a start-up
entrepreneur,

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.530
the way you describe
your company

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:28.800
can make a huge difference
in what people walk out

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.320
of the room willing to pay.

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:35.460
So in fact, in December
of 2014, I basically

00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:38.170
took this in a blog post-- and
you're welcome to visit this--

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:39.930
and I let people pick
what they thought

00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:42.630
about Uber, what kind of company
is it, what kind of networking

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:43.202
benefits.

00:56:43.202 --> 00:56:44.910
And at the end of the
blog, I essentially

00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:47.320
put a list of values ranging
from less than $1 billion

00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:51.200
to over $90 billion,
depending on your story.

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.720
And with young companies, that
should always be the case.

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.170
You'll have vast
disagreements among people

00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:58.370
because of your story.

00:56:58.370 --> 00:57:01.100
And in fact, it's
what, two and a half,

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:05.420
three years later with
Uber and you're still

00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:07.506
getting a big set
of disagreements

00:57:07.506 --> 00:57:08.630
about what the stories are.

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:11.200
There are obviously people who
think it's worth $100 billion

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:14.030
and there are people that
think it's worth nothing.

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:20.040
And this is what makes it so
fascinating, a story in motion.

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.860
So as you go through this
process, one final point.

00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:25.710
You finish the story, don't
rest too long because the world

00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:27.150
changes around you.

00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:29.130
There are macro
shifts happening.

00:57:29.130 --> 00:57:31.470
The French election tomorrow
could change your story

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:33.600
about not just every
French company,

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:36.420
but about every global company.

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:39.210
You have macro stuff going on,
you have micro stuff going on.

00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:41.130
Every time a company
reports earnings

00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:44.430
or announces an acquisition,
it's changing its story

00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:47.700
and your job, in a sense, is to
bring it into your valuation.

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:52.190
And your stories can break, they
can shift, or they can change.

00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:55.380
Broken stories are stories where
your story just blows apart.

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:56.930
An example would be Aereo.

00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:58.670
Remember the company
that said they'd

00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:01.476
come up with a way of streaming
things to your device?

00:58:01.476 --> 00:58:03.350
You could watch cable
channels on your device

00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:04.730
without paying cable fees.

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:06.930
Sounds too good
to be true, right?

00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:08.969
And it turned out
that in June of 2014,

00:58:08.969 --> 00:58:11.010
the Supreme Court found
that what they were doing

00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:11.550
was illegal.

00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:13.050
Overnight, the
company essentially

00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:15.600
went from being a billion
dollar company to nothing.

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:17.900
That's a story break.

00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:21.330
A story shift isn't the same
story, but it can be small.

00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:24.300
I've told the same story about
Apple for the last six years,

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.700
which is it's the
most incredible cash

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:30.970
machine in history that
derives almost all of its value

00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:32.950
from the smartphone business.

00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:36.410
And that business is
maturing with margins

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:38.410
that are going to come
under pressure over time.

00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:40.990
That's the same
story I told in 2012.

00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:43.630
My valuation for Apple
hasn't shifted very much,

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:46.320
but the price goes up and down.

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.210
And that's part of investing.

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:50.970
And you can have story changes,
where a company convinces you

00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:53.261
that they can do stuff you
never thought they could do.

00:58:53.261 --> 00:58:56.700
My valuation for Facebook
has gone from $30 per share

00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.070
when they went public
to almost $90 per share

00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:01.125
because every time
they show me they

00:59:01.125 --> 00:59:03.000
could do things I didn't
think they could do,

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.520
I have to revisit my
story and change it.

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:08.160
It makes investing
in valuation a lot

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.710
more fun if you think
about these valuations

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:13.440
not as spreadsheets and
numbers, but as stories

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.516
that evolve over time.

00:59:14.516 --> 00:59:16.140
And if you're an
entrepreneur, your job

00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:19.189
is to nurture that story and
make it bigger over time.

00:59:19.189 --> 00:59:20.730
And if you're an
investor, it's to be

00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:23.240
skeptical about that
story and push back.

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:24.990
And if you're an
outsider, to just observe

00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:26.820
what's happening in
the stories and attach

00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:29.210
a number to those stories.

00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:29.710
That's it.

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:32.796
If there are any questions you
have, I'd be glad to answer.

00:59:32.796 --> 00:59:35.186
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.900
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the online advertising

00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:43.400
business.

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.305
Is in the top 10
worst businesses?

00:59:45.305 --> 00:59:46.180
ASWATH DAMODARAN: No.

00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:47.030
No, it's not.

00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:49.709
It's actually-- you know
it's a profitable business.

00:59:49.709 --> 00:59:52.000
The only thing is there are
only two giants in the room

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.570
sucking up all the profits--

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:56.200
one is you, the
other is Facebook.

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.480
For the rest of the world,
it's become a bad business.

00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.130
And you're responsible
for-- and that's

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:02.920
your job is to make it
a good business for you

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.930
and a bad business for
the rest of the world.

01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:09.280
And you've succeeded beyond
your wildest imaginations.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.492
And I think that's what the--

01:00:11.492 --> 01:00:13.700
last year if you look at
the growth in this business,

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:17.590
I think 60% of the growth came
from just Facebook and Google.

01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:20.710
So it is a profitable business,
but it's a very skewed profit.

01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:23.830
The two companies at the top
get almost all of the profits,

01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:27.587
the rest don't even get the
droppings off the table.

01:00:27.587 --> 01:00:29.670
They're like Twitter, they
basically have revenues

01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:31.920
but they can't show profits.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.600
AUDIENCE: What
about the partners

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.720
that we have in the ecosystem--
the agencies, the marketers?

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.280
Where do you see
them moving as you

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.090
said the industry
seems to consolidate

01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:43.470
around Google and Facebook?

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:45.640
ASWATH DAMODARAN: I think
they're more commoditized.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.765
They're not going to make
the margins that they do.

01:00:47.765 --> 01:00:49.500
They will be profitable,
but you're not

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.020
going to let them become too
profitable because if they

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:54.705
make excess profits, you
know what your job is, right?

01:00:54.705 --> 01:00:57.920
It's to mop it up and take it
back into the parent company.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.310
So you're like a
parent spaceship

01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:01.980
that essentially is watching
all these other little ships.

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.440
You look too prosperous, we're
going to-- so again, there's

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.000
nothing amoral.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.132
That's the nature of business
is if you're creating the value,

01:01:10.132 --> 01:01:11.340
you want to claim that value.

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.750
So I think your
ecosystem will survive,

01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:18.220
but there will never be
the prosperous mother ship

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.400
that you have as a company
because that's what's

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.389
creating all those revenues.

01:01:22.389 --> 01:01:24.680
AUDIENCE: Measurement it's
a big part of that business,

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.840
so teaching brands that online
advertising is valuable,

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.200
how do we do a better job of
using the kinds of narratives

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.670
that you talked about today?

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:35.052
ASWATH DAMODARAN: I think
that ultimately, it's

01:01:35.052 --> 01:01:37.260
the richness of the data
that lets you convince them.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.880
Because right now
you can show people

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.994
that they're clicking on--

01:01:39.994 --> 01:01:42.160
I think it's easier for you
than it is for Facebook,

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.580
for instance, because you have
a search engine that people

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:44.940
go through.

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.356
It's much more
direct to say, this

01:01:46.356 --> 01:01:49.110
is how you landed on
a site is through us.

01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:51.300
I think that
increasingly, you're

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:53.660
going to start seeing
people ask questions about,

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.410
oh, people are clicking
on it but are they

01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:57.420
actually buying stuff on it?

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.299
And as the data
gets richer, you'll

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:00.590
be able to answer the question.

01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:02.730
And sometimes you might
not like the answers

01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:04.580
you have to give your--

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:07.110
so it's not always
going to be good news.

01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:09.150
So you will have to
learn from what works

01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:11.310
and what doesn't to kind
of adapt, modify, which

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:12.990
you probably already are doing.

01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:16.170
AUDIENCE: My question
is in doing number

01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:18.560
crunching or forming
the narrative,

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.610
I guess in these
two examples it felt

01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:24.540
like the background was
assuming competent companies

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.295
and management.

01:02:25.295 --> 01:02:27.670
ASWATH DAMODARAN: Oh, I've
told some horror stories, too.

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.975
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:02:27.975 --> 01:02:29.580
ASWATH DAMODARAN: So read
my story about Valeant.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.205
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:02:30.205 --> 01:02:31.920
So how do you
account for Uber has

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.970
a misogynist toxic culture
or United's assaulting

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:35.730
their passenger?

01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:38.142
How do you account
for lack of conversion

01:02:38.142 --> 01:02:39.850
that a company just
can't achieve their--

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:42.016
ASWATH DAMODARAN: That's
actually a very good point.

01:02:42.016 --> 01:02:45.070
Uber has this combination
of being aggressive--

01:02:45.070 --> 01:02:47.070
they've always been an
aggressive company that's

01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:50.700
broken every rule in the book
and they've succeeded with it.

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:53.370
But in a sense, it's also
their biggest weakness.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:56.190
In fact, the best way
to see this play out

01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:58.650
is I have a story
about Lyft in the book.

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:00.540
And if you think
about Lyft, I describe

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:04.530
Lyft like you know how in
bike racing if you're a racer,

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:06.990
you actually want to hang
out behind the lead racer

01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:10.770
because he or she picks
up the wind resistance?

01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:13.890
Lyft is like the rider
who hangs out behind Uber.

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:16.470
So Uber is the one who
does the wind resistance,

01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:17.644
goes after the regulators.

01:03:17.644 --> 01:03:19.810
Lyft says, we're the good
guys, we're the good guys,

01:03:19.810 --> 01:03:20.643
we're the good guys.

01:03:20.643 --> 01:03:23.580
It's actually an interesting
different story, right?

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.505
It's a much less
ambitious story.

01:03:25.505 --> 01:03:27.630
It's a story where you keep
your head down and say,

01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:28.500
we're the good guys.

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.966
And they're going to do things
very conspicuously to show

01:03:30.966 --> 01:03:32.090
that they're the good guys.

01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:34.230
You saw that in the
last few weeks, right?

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:36.060
You're the bad guys,
we're the good guys.

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:38.850
It's actually interesting,
but the good guys don't always

01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:40.280
win in these stories.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.720
That's, I think, the
other thing is sometimes

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.300
this aggressive toxic
culture might actually

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.890
be what ends up winning.

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:50.730
So unlike novels, where you
can make the good guys win,

01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:53.910
sometimes the bad guys
win in these stories

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:57.480
and it becomes part of
the value of the business.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.320
So in that sense, justice
doesn't always prevail

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.360
and morality doesn't
always win out.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.010
It is investing, right?

01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:06.630
But I do tell stories about--

01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:08.910
I mean, I don't enjoy them
as much-- about companies

01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:10.140
that are horror stories.

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:12.181
I mean, I've been telling
the story about Valeant

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:14.340
for the last two years
of a company that

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.290
fell from grace, right?

01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:18.660
It's a reverse Cinderella story.

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:20.730
It starts off with this--

01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:25.732
you start off in the castle, you
end up cleaning the chimneys.

01:04:25.732 --> 01:04:27.690
And I think it's fascinating
sometimes watching

01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:29.490
horror stories
unfold because you

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:32.310
can see the behavioral and
the psychological issues that

01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:34.224
play into these valuations.

01:04:34.224 --> 01:04:35.640
SPEAKER 1: So one
of the questions

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.330
was regarding a company
which in your blog posts

01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:41.150
you call the "Field
of Dreams" company.

01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:43.920
The question is,
growing revenues,

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.920
the earnings are maybe
shown, not shown,

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.780
but the cash flows are there.

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:50.310
And a lot of that
is still driven

01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:52.390
by changes in working capital.

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:55.920
So for those of you who don't
know, I'm talking about Amazon.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.439
The question is, how do you
look at a company like that

01:04:58.439 --> 01:04:59.730
and what do you think about it?

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.160
ASWATH DAMODARAN: You know I
call it the "Field of Dreams"

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.130
company, right?

01:05:02.130 --> 01:05:03.660
Seen "Field of Dreams?"

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:06.750
Kevin Costner builds
this baseball field

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:08.402
in the middle of
nowhere and people

01:05:08.402 --> 01:05:09.610
ask him, what are you, crazy?

01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:12.235
Why are you building a baseball
field in the middle of nowhere?

01:05:12.235 --> 01:05:16.770
And remember what he said, if
I build it, they will come.

01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:17.670
That to me is--

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:20.460
when I think about Amazon,
that is the message

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:23.880
that Jeff Bezos has been
sending right from day one.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.640
If you get a chance,
go check out the letter

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.937
that Jeff wrote
about Amazon in 1997.

01:05:29.937 --> 01:05:31.020
You know where I found it?

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:34.280
I found it in Google search,
so you can find it, too.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.140
It's actually an
incredible letter

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:38.870
because it lays out what he
was going to do at Amazon.

01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:43.140
He said, at Amazon we're
going to go for revenues first

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.570
and then after we've
built the revenues,

01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:48.220
they will come, the profits.

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:50.650
That's the story
told in '97 and he's

01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:52.510
told the same
story for 20 years.

01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:55.009
And he's acted consistently
with that story.

01:05:55.009 --> 01:05:56.800
You know what I mean
by acted consistently?

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.090
How many people here
have Amazon Prime?

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:02.360
What do you pay for it?

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.410
$99.

01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:07.010
Do you know what it costs Amazon
to service every Prime member?

01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:09.170
About $400.

01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:11.270
That's crazy, why
would you do that?

01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:13.760
If you build it, they will come.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.470
What is he building
with Amazon Prime?

01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:17.870
He's building this
block of consumers

01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:20.300
who are addicted
to Amazon, for lack

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:23.840
of a better word, Who don't even
know what a retail store looks

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.610
like anymore.

01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:29.220
And one of these days,
he's coming for you.

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.190
So don't be surprised
if a third nine pops up

01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:34.490
after the first two nines and
you have nothing you can do,

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:36.410
because where are
you going to go?

01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:38.810
Everything else will be
out of business by then.

01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:41.090
So the conspiratorial
view about Amazon

01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:43.610
is he's building a business
where ultimately, he's

01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:45.020
going to get you.

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:50.740
And that explains the
$700, $800, $900 per share.

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.840
The problem there is
it is a business where

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.996
keeping newcomers out, new
ways of doing business,

01:06:55.996 --> 01:06:57.120
is going to be tough to do.

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.376
So the challenge here is
what if that doesn't happen?

01:06:59.376 --> 01:07:01.000
Well, you could end
up growing revenues

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.490
and never being able
to deliver the profits.

01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:07.090
So it's, again, a
fascinating case study of how

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:09.280
if you can tell a
consistent story.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.380
Because people often say,
markets are short-term.

01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:14.060
You heard that probably
in Silicon Valley.

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:17.510
What short-term market would
let a company go for 20 years

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:22.100
without making a profit and keep
pushing up their market cap?

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.250
To me Amazon is the
perfect counter-example

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:26.540
of if you can tell
a consistent story,

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:29.390
markets will cut you a
heck of a lot of slack.

01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:31.580
You know why they don't
do it for most companies?

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:34.190
Because the story keeps
changing every year.

01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:37.040
The top management is incapable
of telling the same story

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.710
over time and then the market
says, we don't trust you.

01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:43.055
So the other lesson that I
think you get out of Amazon

01:07:43.055 --> 01:07:44.430
is if you're
building a business,

01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:47.380
you're telling a story, don't
keep swinging like a weather

01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:49.440
vane to whatever works.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.660
You have to have a
consistent story,

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.820
you have to act consistently
with that story.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:57.180
And you'll be surprised
at how much slack you

01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:59.672
get cut because of that.

01:07:59.672 --> 01:08:02.130
SPEAKER 1: Professor, before
we get to a specific question,

01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:03.713
there's one question
that we generally

01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:07.350
ask of all the guests,
and this is mostly

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:08.850
not only for this
audience, but also

01:08:08.850 --> 01:08:11.100
for your audience on YouTube.

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:13.780
You've written this fantastic
book, in addition to others.

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:16.080
What are some books
that you have found

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.845
useful that are generally
underappreciated?

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:20.720
ASWATH DAMODARAN:
Generally underappreciated.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.310
I thought you would ask me what
my favorite book was because I

01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:26.160
was going to revealed
my number crunching

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:31.380
roots and you that my
favorite book is "Moneyball."

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:33.439
That tells you where I--

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:34.950
and I think it's--

01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:37.740
but I think in terms of
underappreciated books,

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:42.750
I think that I learn a
lot more about investing

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:45.210
in valuation from
non-business books

01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:48.391
than I do from business books.

01:08:48.391 --> 01:08:49.890
It, again, goes to
the storytelling.

01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:53.017
I need to build my
storytelling side.

01:08:53.017 --> 01:08:54.600
I don't know whether
you've ever read,

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:58.620
there's a book written
by an insider at Pixar.

01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:01.380
It's a book I absolutely
love because it

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:02.970
taught me things
about storytelling

01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:04.470
that I did not know, things--

01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:08.770
because let's face it, if I can
tell a story like "Toy Story,"

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:11.740
I'm going to be able to sell
incredible businesses, right?

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:14.740
So I read diverse things.

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:16.290
I read fairy tales, I read--

01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:18.729
I mean, I love
serial killer books

01:09:18.729 --> 01:09:20.649
because they always end badly.

01:09:20.649 --> 01:09:24.370
But I think in a
sense, I get my stuff

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:26.009
from all kinds of
different places.

01:09:26.009 --> 01:09:27.550
AUDIENCE: So there
are some companies

01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:29.479
that need external
capital at the beginning,

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:30.850
like Tesla, right?

01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:32.710
For those companies,
they're actually

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:36.370
more valuable if they are priced
higher because the capital will

01:09:36.370 --> 01:09:38.359
be very low, right?

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:39.800
If they are priced
at $2 trillion,

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.760
again, issue the
stocks very cheaply

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.250
and they get any
money they want.

01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:47.500
And it also applies to real
state investment trusts.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.654
How do you put that
in your valuation?

01:09:49.654 --> 01:09:50.529
ASWATH DAMODARAN: OK.

01:09:50.529 --> 01:09:52.899
The first thing to remember
is you don't set the price,

01:09:52.899 --> 01:09:53.640
the market does.

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.110
So if you can get them to
give you a high pricing,

01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:58.400
it does make your life easier.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.045
I mean, you hear this word
cash burn thrown around Silicon

01:10:01.045 --> 01:10:02.170
Valley all the time, right?

01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:04.419
Cash burn basically means
you have negative cash flows

01:10:04.419 --> 01:10:06.610
up front because you need
that cash flow to grow.

01:10:06.610 --> 01:10:09.520
And you have cash burn, you need
capital to cover the cash flow.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.840
You can't survive as a company.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.615
And if you're priced
high, the advantage

01:10:13.615 --> 01:10:18.020
is you can raise that capital
at a very advantageous price.

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:20.217
So here is, in fact,
what it plays out as.

01:10:20.217 --> 01:10:22.300
For these companies, there's
actually an incentive

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.250
to tell really,
really big stories

01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:26.680
up front, right, because big
stories get the big prices.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.470
The pricing allows you
then to cover the capital.

01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:31.169
There will be a
letdown at some point

01:10:31.169 --> 01:10:33.460
because people are going to
say, well, that story never

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.120
was going to work.

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.230
And then you get all kinds
of disappointment kicking in.

01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:40.850
I might be hitting
too close to home,

01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:43.872
but anybody ever
hear of Juicera?

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:45.580
I've been reading the
story about Juicera

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:48.210
and I said, what kind of story
would you need to tell me

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:49.590
for me to invest in it?

01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:54.180
How many people would pay
$400 for a juicer that's--

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.856
I mean, it's a
very small market.

01:10:56.856 --> 01:10:58.230
So if you were
telling that story

01:10:58.230 --> 01:11:01.150
and I was assuming a market of
50 million Americans buying,

01:11:01.150 --> 01:11:03.060
it's a story that doesn't fly.

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:06.750
But if you could push the story
bigger, you'd push pricing up.

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:10.600
It allows you to raise capital
to cover your cash burn needs.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.330
So that's something to remember.

01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:15.050
I don't think that's
Elon Musk's rationale.

01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:18.280
I think he just likes
telling really big stories

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.890
and making them
bigger over time.

01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:24.699
But I think for some start-ups,
I think part of this is a game.

01:11:24.699 --> 01:11:27.240
If you can push your pricing
up, it actually makes it easier.

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.490
It greases the skids
for you while you have

01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:31.410
those early years of cash burn.

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:33.240
SPEAKER 1: Don't hit
me for asking this,

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.040
I'm just the messenger here.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.130
How do you decide when
there was something

01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:41.100
wrong with your estimate
of value and the price

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:44.490
to value divergence stays
on for an extended period?

01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:49.200
What are some examples
that you can share with us?

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:51.840
Could you talk a little
bit about your investing

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.820
in Valeant and
Twitter and so on.

01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:57.360
And again, I'm
just the messenger.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:00.480
ASWATH DAMODARAN: As I
said, one of the things

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:03.540
I find that gets in the
way of good investing

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.360
is I tell people the
three words that you

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:12.240
need to be able to say openly
in investing is, I was wrong.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.150
Because once you say that, it
frees you from your own story.

01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:17.310
Because as long as you're
not willing to say that,

01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:19.018
you're going to find
ways to kind of take

01:12:19.018 --> 01:12:21.720
your old story that it's
not wrong, this part of it--

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:25.140
it's somebody else's fault.
I have absolutely no qualms

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.660
about accepting the
fact that I'm wrong

01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:31.410
and I'm horribly wrong
sometimes and it's not my fault.

01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:33.656
That's what allows me
to get away with it.

01:12:33.656 --> 01:12:35.155
It's not my fault
in the sense there

01:12:35.155 --> 01:12:38.210
are things happening around
that I really can't control.

01:12:38.210 --> 01:12:40.960
So when I'm wrong, I have to
look at what portion of it

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.980
was my fault and what portion
of it is out of my control.

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:47.200
With Valle, here's
what happened.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.510
I bought Valle and
Brazil went to hell

01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:53.030
in a handbasket in the
year after I bought Valle.

01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:54.530
You say, why didn't
he predict that?

01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:56.090
If I had been able
to predict it,

01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:57.980
there were a lot easier
ways to make money

01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.440
than to go out and buy--

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.870
I could have sold short
in Brazilian bonds.

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:04.080
It was out of mind control.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.020
I call this the karmic
moment in investing.

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:08.419
You've heard of karma, right?

01:13:08.419 --> 01:13:10.460
Basically, karma means
there are some things that

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:12.950
are going to happen, nothing
that you and I can do

01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:14.490
can change that.

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:17.802
You've got to accept that
on Valle I was wrong,

01:13:17.802 --> 01:13:19.760
but there's nothing I
could have done about it.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.660
With Valeant I was wrong
and it was partly my fault.

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:25.460
And here's what I
missed in Valeant.

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:27.251
For those of you not
familiar with Valeant,

01:13:27.251 --> 01:13:30.350
Valeant built its reputation
as an uncommon pharmaceutical

01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:34.130
company by going out and
acquiring other drug companies

01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:38.180
and doing something that
is morally and ethically

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:38.750
questionable.

01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:43.357
They would take underpriced
drugs and reprice them.

01:13:43.357 --> 01:13:44.690
You know what that means, right?

01:13:44.690 --> 01:13:46.500
So you're a company
which is at a--

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.172
let's say you're heart
drug that's been around,

01:13:49.172 --> 01:13:50.630
it's been patented
for eight years.

01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:52.960
They're charging $50 a dose.

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:55.880
It serves only
like 7,000 people.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.240
And Valeant said, those
people will pay $5,000.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.199
They need it to live.

01:14:00.199 --> 01:14:00.990
They raised prices.

01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:02.910
They did incredibly
well for a period.

01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:06.630
But that story was a story that
worked only as long as they

01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:07.980
stayed under the radar, right?

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:10.022
Because this is
not exactly a story

01:14:10.022 --> 01:14:11.230
you're going to tell openly--

01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:13.063
we buy other companies,
we take their drugs,

01:14:13.063 --> 01:14:17.730
we increase the price
50% or 500% or 5000%.

01:14:17.730 --> 01:14:19.200
So when Valeant
came apart, it was

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.760
because they got too ambitious.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.630
They got too big.

01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:23.790
They bought Salix, an
$18 billion company.

01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:26.550
When they tried to raise
the price of the drugs,

01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:27.900
people noticed.

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:30.520
And the minute that happened,
the whole company unraveled.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.020
It dropped from
$200 down to $32.

01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.820
And I bought it at
$32 saying, look,

01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:37.570
there's still enough
value in the company.

01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:40.830
You know what I missed
is this company did so

01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:42.460
much damage to its reputation.

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:44.085
We talk about corporate
sustainability.

01:14:44.085 --> 01:14:47.460
It taught me a lesson about
why corporate sustainability

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:48.510
has a place in Valeant.

01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:50.550
They had done so much
damage to their reputation

01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:52.094
that nobody trusted them.

01:14:52.094 --> 01:14:53.760
Because I assumed
that they would become

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.467
an old fashioned drug company.

01:14:55.467 --> 01:14:57.300
But to become an old
fashioned drug company,

01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:57.780
what do you have to do?

01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:59.130
You have to build
an R&amp;D department,

01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:00.379
you've got to hire scientists.

01:15:00.379 --> 01:15:01.530
Let me ask you a question.

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:02.970
You're a scientist, I'm Valeant.

01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:05.580
I come and say, do you
want a job at Valeant?

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:06.750
What's your reaction?

01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:09.167
I've heard about you guys,
I'm not coming there.

01:15:09.167 --> 01:15:11.250
So they're having trouble
building their business.

01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:14.070
They try to sell a
portion of the business.

01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:16.810
I'm Valeant, I try to sell a
portion of my business to you.

01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:17.899
What's your reaction?

01:15:17.899 --> 01:15:18.690
You guys are liars.

01:15:18.690 --> 01:15:20.640
I don't trust anything you do.

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.770
So what I missed in
the case of Valeant

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:25.830
is the damage that they had
done to their reputation that

01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:29.470
makes it almost impossible for
them to be a going concern.

01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:33.630
That damage cost me, what, 60%
of my investment in Valeant.

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:36.090
But it's a lesson that
I can use when I think

01:15:36.090 --> 01:15:37.390
about other damaged companies.

01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:39.790
So would I buy United
after the billion dollars?

01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:40.300
Maybe.

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:40.740
Here's why.

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:42.310
It's a damaged company,
but it's in a business

01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.950
where they're all damaged.

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:45.170
There but for the grace
of God goes Delta, right?

01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:48.030
Don't assume that Delta would
not have dragged you off.

01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:51.780
Maybe they'd have dragged you
off a little more gently, OK?

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:54.870
This is a business-- and that's
why I bought Volkswagen after

01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:55.650
the--

01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:58.060
because I looked at
Volkswagen and said, hey,

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:00.270
do you think only
Volkswagen does this stuff?

01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:01.620
They all do it.

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:04.170
You've knocked down the
value of Volkswagen 24%.

01:16:04.170 --> 01:16:06.995
So it's a game
I've played before.

01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:08.370
But in the case
of Valeant, I got

01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:10.500
this warning sign of
sometimes a company

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:15.240
can step across the line so
much that coming back over

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:18.360
is going to be
really tough to do.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.967
And the other thing
is a mistake will

01:16:20.967 --> 01:16:23.550
cost you a lot less if you don't
have half your money invested

01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:24.780
in the mistake.

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:28.370
So this is actually a pushback
against what you sometimes

01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:31.770
hear from value investors which
is don't spread their bets,

01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:33.570
buy four great companies.

01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:35.760
I have never
believed that advice.

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.770
That's hubris to think
that somehow you've

01:16:37.770 --> 01:16:41.040
got these four winners forever.

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:45.720
So to me, the reason I keep
any investment I make at 10%

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:48.660
or below my portfolio is because
I know I can make mistakes

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:49.952
and I have to be aware of that.

01:16:49.952 --> 01:16:52.035
SPEAKER 1: What does your
typical positions always

01:16:52.035 --> 01:16:52.590
look like?

01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:55.080
ASWATH DAMODARAN: I would
say on entry about 5%.

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.960
If it does well, if will get
to 10%; if it does badly,

01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.270
it takes care of itself, it
goes away from my portfolio.

01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:04.720
So Valeant is no longer
5% of my portfolio.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.890
So it's really the stocks that
do well that I have to nurture.

01:17:07.890 --> 01:17:09.960
And in fact, with
Apple this will

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:15.330
played out over a 15-year period
because I bought Apple in 1998

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:18.040
and I bought it as a
charitable contribution.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.290
Because I loved Apple so much.

01:17:19.290 --> 01:17:21.081
It looked like it was
going out of business

01:17:21.081 --> 01:17:23.550
and this was going to be
my final contribution,

01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:25.050
look how much I loved you.

01:17:25.050 --> 01:17:26.334
Here, take the $14.

01:17:26.334 --> 01:17:28.500
It turned out to be the
best investment I ever made.

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.692
Sometimes shows you that
your best investments don't

01:17:30.692 --> 01:17:32.400
come from all your
intrinsic value stuff,

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.770
it comes from your
charitable contribution.

01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:36.660
The problem with
Apple is did so well

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:39.690
that it kept pushing
into that 10%.

01:17:39.690 --> 01:17:42.867
I left about half
the profits I'd

01:17:42.867 --> 01:17:45.450
have made on Apple on the table
because I had to keep selling.

01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:48.060
And I have no
regrets for doing it

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:51.270
because that's what I need
to do to be disciplined.

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:54.110
And one of the things
I've discovered is if I--

01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:55.670
the way I do this
is I automate it.

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:57.720
Do you know what I
mean by automate it?

01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.820
I have limit sells on
every single investment

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:03.340
in my portfolio that I have
put in before it happens.

01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:05.670
Because if I wait for it
to happen and then I say,

01:18:05.670 --> 01:18:09.390
should I sell it now, I find
delusional ways of saying,

01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:11.250
this time is
different, this stock

01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:12.790
is going to keep going up.

01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:15.750
So sometimes lots
of time you've got

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:18.720
to realize that you
can't trust yourself.

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:20.880
You essentially have
to automate the process

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.089
to take it out of your hands.

01:18:22.089 --> 01:18:24.254
SPEAKER 1: So we were talking
about your limit order

01:18:24.254 --> 01:18:25.890
on Apple before,
and I think it would

01:18:25.890 --> 01:18:27.540
be nice for the
audience to maybe share

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:29.050
some of that conversation.

01:18:29.050 --> 01:18:31.050
But I found it very interesting.

01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:34.020
So you had an estimate
of intrinsic value

01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:38.400
and once it hit, the limit
order executed for Apple.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:41.310
My question to you
was, if the price then

01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:43.630
goes below that price, are
you going to buy again?

01:18:43.630 --> 01:18:45.690
In other words, how do
you think or quantify

01:18:45.690 --> 01:18:48.210
the margin of safety and
how do you differentiate

01:18:48.210 --> 01:18:49.955
buying and selling?

01:18:49.955 --> 01:18:52.080
ASWATH DAMODARAN: When I
bought Apple, I got lucky.

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:55.620
I bought Apple at $94, I
put a limit sell at $140,

01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:58.069
and it executed so Apple
is out of my portfolio.

01:18:58.069 --> 01:18:59.610
I've bought Apple
four times and I've

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:01.630
sold Apple four times
in the last six years.

01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:02.130
Why?

01:19:02.130 --> 01:19:04.030
Because my value stayed
stable, but here's

01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:05.290
what happens to Apple.

01:19:05.290 --> 01:19:09.046
A new iPhone comes out, revenues
jump 8%, people start dancing

01:19:09.046 --> 01:19:09.670
in the streets.

01:19:09.670 --> 01:19:11.170
It's a growth company again.

01:19:11.170 --> 01:19:13.420
They push up the price
too much and then

01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:15.100
four quarters later,
their revenues

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:17.050
drop because the iPhone
is aging and people

01:19:17.050 --> 01:19:19.452
are convinced that this is
the end, they sell Apple off.

01:19:19.452 --> 01:19:21.160
So it's almost like
your taking advantage

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:24.780
of a manic depressive, which
is what the market is-- manic,

01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:28.900
I sell to it, and it's
depressed, I buy from it.

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.700
My rule of thumb,
though, in investing

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:34.150
is I want to buy when I feel
that a stock is undervalued.

01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:37.480
And when I value a stock, I
come up with a point estimate.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.280
But that's, again,
hubris, right?

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.930
Because I made assumptions.

01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:42.969
The assumptions were
revenues will grow 7%.

01:19:42.969 --> 01:19:45.010
But if you push me, I'd
say, well, you know what?

01:19:45.010 --> 01:19:47.680
They probably can grow 5% to 9%.

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:49.990
So over the last few
years, I've taken

01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:52.480
to using Monte Carlo
simulations in my valuation,

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:56.110
partly because it forces me to
be honest about how uncertain I

01:19:56.110 --> 01:20:00.460
am and then it forces me to be
specific about how uncertain I

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:01.750
am.

01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:04.530
And I get a
distribution of value,

01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:07.210
that becomes my basis
for deciding when to buy.

01:20:07.210 --> 01:20:09.970
So I'm not going to buy
Apple when it drops to $139.

01:20:09.970 --> 01:20:10.870
My value is $140.

01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:13.155
It dropping to $139,
I'm still with--

01:20:13.155 --> 01:20:14.530
if you look at
this distribution,

01:20:14.530 --> 01:20:16.760
I'm so close to
my expected value.

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:20.110
So by having a distribution,
I can look up a trigger point

01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:20.730
and say--

01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:21.979
and I have to set the trigger.

01:20:21.979 --> 01:20:23.890
It has to be at
least 80% undervalue

01:20:23.890 --> 01:20:27.970
to kick in, which would be
about $124 to $122 for Apple.

01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:29.920
That becomes the
basis that I think

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:33.280
about both buying and selling
is in terms of distributions,

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.920
not in terms of point estimates.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.170
SPEAKER 1: So do we
have one live question

01:20:38.170 --> 01:20:38.920
from the audience?

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.280
Yeah.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:43.072
AUDIENCE: So this
actually echoes--

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:45.030
I guess you mentioned a
Monte Carlo simulation.

01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:46.990
I actually did a
Monte Carlo simulation

01:20:46.990 --> 01:20:48.650
for my PhD and
part of my feeling

01:20:48.650 --> 01:20:51.410
is just that all of
the assimilation--

01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:54.780
simulations, number
crunching, storytelling--

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:57.600
all of this is assumptions
that goes into it, right?

01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.270
And it echoes the uncertainty,
the prediction part

01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:01.560
you're talking about.

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.960
At the end of the
day, how do I know

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.850
I made the right assumption?

01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:07.740
ASWATH DAMODARAN: The
word you used was know.

01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:09.827
You never know.

01:21:09.827 --> 01:21:11.410
And that's something
that-- and that's

01:21:11.410 --> 01:21:12.826
I said one of the
biggest problems

01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:15.450
that number crunchers have is
a psychological barrier you've

01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:19.560
got to overcome, which is we're
so used at the end of a math

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.854
problem to checking
the answer and saying,

01:21:21.854 --> 01:21:22.770
I know I got it right.

01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:23.820
Look, I can check it.

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:25.861
That's why accounting is
so much more comfortable

01:21:25.861 --> 01:21:27.030
to do than valuation, right?

01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:28.560
Balance sheets have to balance.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:30.077
It balanced, I'm done.

01:21:30.077 --> 01:21:32.410
The problem in valuation, you
get done with a valuation,

01:21:32.410 --> 01:21:34.576
and you look at it and say,
how do I know I'm right?

01:21:34.576 --> 01:21:37.060
I'll tell you the
answer, you don't.

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:39.040
And you have to be OK with it.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:42.460
There is no confirmation
mechanism that I can offer you.

01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.800
That's why I used
the word faith.

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.300
What's the essence of faith?

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.730
Why do you go to church every
week or temple every week?

01:21:48.730 --> 01:21:52.420
It's because you have
faith that God exists.

01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:53.650
You say, prove it to me.

01:21:53.650 --> 01:21:55.300
I can prove it.

01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:56.950
The same thing
applies in investing.

01:21:56.950 --> 01:22:00.250
If you ask me, prove to
me that valuation works.

01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:02.590
I don't have proof,
I have faith.

01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:04.252
And I can't pass
that faith onto you.

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:05.710
So when I teach my
valuation class,

01:22:05.710 --> 01:22:07.780
I tell people, at
the end of this class

01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:10.420
you have to decide for yourself
whether this works for you.

01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:13.660
I can teach you how
to value a company,

01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:15.430
but I can't give you faith.

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:17.000
That's got to come from within.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.157
Maybe you will develop
faith, maybe you will not.

01:22:19.157 --> 01:22:21.740
And if you don't develop faith,
it's not the end of the world.

01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:25.330
You can buy ETFs and index funds
and you'll be perfectly happy.

01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:27.500
And here is my
definition of faith,

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.210
and it's going to sound morbid.

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:31.540
I ask people who are
active investors,

01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:34.540
let's say you get to the age of
85, you're on your deathbed--

01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:36.700
I told you it was
a morbid thought--

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:39.520
and I come to you
with some statistics.

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.020
I say, look, over
the last 60 years,

01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:43.000
you've been doing valuation
and picking stocks

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.300
and you made 8.13% a year.

01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:47.799
This is cruel and unusual to
somebody on their deathbed.

01:22:47.799 --> 01:22:49.340
And then I say, you
know what, if you

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:51.090
had put your money in
ETFs and index funds

01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:55.110
over the last 60 years,
you would have made 8.22%.

01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:56.850
So you've spent 60
years of your life

01:22:56.850 --> 01:22:59.864
doing two hours of
research every night

01:22:59.864 --> 01:23:02.280
and you've essentially made
less money than you could have

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.050
by just putting your money--

01:23:04.050 --> 01:23:06.120
would you be OK with it?

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:08.070
And if your answer
is no, I tell people

01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:11.230
don't do active investing.

01:23:11.230 --> 01:23:12.100
I'd be OK with it.

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:12.641
You know why?

01:23:12.641 --> 01:23:15.111
Because I enjoy
the process so much

01:23:15.111 --> 01:23:17.110
that even if at the end
of the game you told me,

01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:18.935
you're not going to make any
money off this, I would say,

01:23:18.935 --> 01:23:19.435
I'm OK.

01:23:19.435 --> 01:23:22.310
I've had lots of fun doing it.

01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:24.820
And that's, to me, part of
the reason the storytelling

01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:27.220
works is if I were just
crunching through spreadsheets,

01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:30.440
I would drive myself crazy.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:31.940
Because when you
do spreadsheets,

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:32.990
you want affirmation--

01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:36.560
I did all this hard
work, I tortured myself.

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:39.099
I need to be rewarded.

01:23:39.099 --> 01:23:41.390
And the market says, no, you
don't need to be rewarded.

01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:42.514
I'm going to take away 20%.

01:23:42.514 --> 01:23:44.060
And your neighbor,
who picks stock

01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:48.050
based on astrological
signs, is making millions.

01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:51.607
You say, this is so unfair.

01:23:51.607 --> 01:23:52.690
It's the way the world is.

01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:56.840
So unfortunately, there
is no way to know.

01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:01.700
But that's the part about faith
is it might come, it might not.

01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:05.870
But it's got to
come from within.

01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:07.970
AUDIENCE: And a small
quick follow-up question

01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:10.880
is, when we look at
valuation, how do we learn?

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:13.490
For instance, if the
numbers come back

01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:15.320
agreeing with my
prediction, does it

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.570
mean that I did a good job?

01:24:16.570 --> 01:24:19.170
How can I tell which part is
my work, which part is not?

01:24:19.170 --> 01:24:21.003
ASWATH DAMODARAN: Here's
what I tell myself.

01:24:21.003 --> 01:24:23.540
When I pick a stock and it
goes up, the first thing I say

01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:25.310
is, I got lucky.

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:28.130
And then I say, OK, maybe
I did something on the side

01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:30.650
because luck is the dominant
paradigm in this business.

01:24:30.650 --> 01:24:34.190
There's so much stuff
that's out of your control

01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:37.310
that you really
can't do much about.

01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:39.590
And it helps you both on
the plus and the minus side.

01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:42.620
That's why I can be sanguine
about the stocks that go down

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.522
is you can't be selective.

01:24:44.522 --> 01:24:45.980
And this is what
behavioral finance

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:47.510
finds, when something
works you want

01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:49.880
to claim credit by yourself.

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.010
When something doesn't,
what do you do?

01:24:52.010 --> 01:24:54.290
You blame the rest of the world.

01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:57.350
I mean, when I talk about taking
ownership of your investments,

01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:59.270
what I'm talking about
is taking ownership

01:24:59.270 --> 01:25:01.010
of both sides of
the investments.

01:25:01.010 --> 01:25:03.410
So we need to behave
exactly the same way

01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:04.571
when we win as we lose.

01:25:04.571 --> 01:25:05.820
And that's really tough to do.

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:08.150
I have to force
myself to try to do it

01:25:08.150 --> 01:25:10.560
and it doesn't
come easily to me.

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:14.610
SPEAKER 1: You've written
about Facebook, about Amazon,

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:16.470
about Apple.

01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:18.300
Traditional value
investing has generally

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:22.230
sort of put tech in a
certain light because

01:25:22.230 --> 01:25:25.080
of the risk of, I guess,
innovation disruption

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:25.780
and whatnot.

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:27.780
Do you think over time
that has changed and does

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:30.702
value investing in
technology work well?

01:25:30.702 --> 01:25:32.160
ASWATH DAMODARAN:
It should change.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.840
And I think part
of the problem is

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:36.270
we use the word tech
to capture this very

01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:37.920
diverse set of companies now.

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:40.530
In the 1980s, if you
said tech, I'd have said,

01:25:40.530 --> 01:25:42.570
young, high growth, risky.

01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:44.790
Today when you say tech,
you're talking about 22%

01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:45.745
of the market.

01:25:45.745 --> 01:25:47.620
And you're talking about
companies that range

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:49.770
the spectrum in life cycle.

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:54.550
Intel is tech, but so is
Facebook and so is Snap.

01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:57.430
But what do they
share in common?

01:25:57.430 --> 01:26:01.180
One is a company that's I mean,
not quite the walking dead,

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.010
but if you think
about Yahoo, so you

01:26:03.010 --> 01:26:06.730
can have walking dead tech
companies which are essentially

01:26:06.730 --> 01:26:09.820
looking towards the exit and
you can have companies growing.

01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:12.370
So a couple of years
ago, I actually

01:26:12.370 --> 01:26:17.230
took every tech company in the
US and I broke it down by age.

01:26:17.230 --> 01:26:21.140
It took the founding year and
I then looked at the metrics

01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:22.220
by age.

01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:25.909
And tech companies age
in what I call dog years.

01:26:25.909 --> 01:26:27.450
Do you know what I
mean by dog years?

01:26:27.450 --> 01:26:30.210
A 20-year-old tech company
is like a 140-year-old

01:26:30.210 --> 01:26:32.776
manufacturing company.

01:26:32.776 --> 01:26:34.400
Because the old man--
if you look at GM

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:38.000
and how long GM and Ford took
to go from start-up to mature

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.980
company, it took them 60 years.

01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:43.670
They stayed at that cash
cow status for about 30

01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:46.610
and then they went into
this long-term decline.

01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:49.424
A tech company, you look at it,
the growth that took 60 years,

01:26:49.424 --> 01:26:50.090
you do in eight.

01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:50.965
That's the good news.

01:26:50.965 --> 01:26:52.790
The bad news is you
don't get much of time

01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:55.060
to enjoy yourself as a cash cow.

01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:56.960
And then when you
start declining,

01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.954
the drop is precipitous.

01:26:58.954 --> 01:27:00.370
So if you think
about life cycles,

01:27:00.370 --> 01:27:02.889
the life cycle is a
much steeper lifestyle.

01:27:02.889 --> 01:27:04.430
So in tech companies,
I think we need

01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:06.950
to stop talking tech
as a collective space

01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:09.370
and think about some of the
best bargains in this market

01:27:09.370 --> 01:27:11.820
are in the old tech space.

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.640
I'm talking the
Microsofts, the Intels.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.530
These are cash cows.

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:16.380
Can be disrupted?

01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:16.880
Sure.

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:19.940
So can GM, so can Ford, so can
Coca-Cola, so can McDonald's.

01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:22.520
What makes us think that just
because you have a consumer

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.840
product company, I
can't disrupt you?

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:27.210
Disruption is part
of this process.

01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:32.150
So to me, ignoring tech
because you feel it's too risky

01:27:32.150 --> 01:27:34.910
means that you're at
least 75 years old.

01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:37.670
Because we have
frames of references

01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:40.280
that come from the
1980s and the '90s

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.290
that people are still
carrying through.

01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:46.130
I was happy when Warren
Buffett finally bought Apple

01:27:46.130 --> 01:27:50.117
because it's a small
step, but for a long time

01:27:50.117 --> 01:27:51.825
his view was, I don't
buy tech companies.

01:27:51.825 --> 01:27:53.241
In fact, his view
was, I don't buy

01:27:53.241 --> 01:27:55.580
anything I don't understand.

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:57.500
And that basically
means 80% the world

01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:59.300
is going to go
outside the domain

01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:03.050
if that's your definition of not
being able to invest in things.

01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:04.820
So I think we need to
start breaking tech

01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:08.970
into old tech, middle
aged tech, and young tech.

01:28:08.970 --> 01:28:10.470
SPEAKER 1: This is
a little bit more

01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:13.422
into accounting because you've
written a lot about accounting.

01:28:13.422 --> 01:28:15.880
ASWATH DAMODARAN: I say very
nasty things about accounting,

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.220
so hopefully I don't have
to say it [INAUDIBLE].

01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:18.360
SPEAKER 1: Well,
they still invite you

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.880
to events and to give talks,
so I'm hoping all is well.

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:23.520
But you've written about
reinvestment, growth and return

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.470
on capital, and how
these are connected

01:28:25.470 --> 01:28:27.690
and you talked about that
in your talk as well.

01:28:27.690 --> 01:28:29.670
The question is
about definitions.

01:28:29.670 --> 01:28:32.890
When you think about
return on capital,

01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:37.650
capital can be defined as equity
plus debt minus excess cash.

01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:40.740
Some people define capital
as tangible capital

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:44.460
that is used in
operating the business.

01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:48.030
What really drives compounding?

01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:49.800
Is it the tangible
capital and returns

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:53.866
on tangible capital or is it
how you define it and sort of I

01:28:53.866 --> 01:28:56.490
guess what I'm asking is what is
the difference between the two

01:28:56.490 --> 01:28:58.366
approaches and how do
you make sense of that?

01:28:58.366 --> 01:28:59.740
ASWATH DAMODARAN:
The first thing

01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.659
is to stay away from the
accounting definition

01:29:01.659 --> 01:29:02.700
from all of these things.

01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:05.280
And let me explain what I
think about as reinvestment.

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.664
You want to grow as a company.

01:29:06.664 --> 01:29:08.580
The question I want to
ask you is, what do you

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:11.740
have to spend money on to grow?

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:14.019
When I ask that of a
manufacturing company--

01:29:14.019 --> 01:29:16.560
what do you have to spend money
on, new factories, new plant,

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.940
new equipment--

01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:20.719
and old time accounting
captures with the capex.

01:29:20.719 --> 01:29:22.260
You look at a
pharmaceutical company,

01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:24.520
what do you invest in to grow?

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:26.210
R&amp;D.

01:29:26.210 --> 01:29:27.850
And what do
accountants do with it?

01:29:27.850 --> 01:29:29.410
Screw it up big time, right?

01:29:29.410 --> 01:29:31.660
They treat it as an
operating expense.

01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:33.959
And if I ask a
company like Google,

01:29:33.959 --> 01:29:35.500
what do you have to
reinvest to grow,

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.930
you can already see the
accounting definitions are not

01:29:37.930 --> 01:29:40.360
going to capture what
you put money in to grow.

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:42.820
You might have to grow by
buying young technologies

01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:45.740
because that's what you need
to bring into the space.

01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:47.230
So one of the
things we need to do

01:29:47.230 --> 01:29:50.634
is stop getting focused on what
does the accountant call capex.

01:29:50.634 --> 01:29:52.300
Because that's not
going to capture what

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.820
I want to call capex at
a company like Google.

01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:57.790
Because that's the only way for
me to be rational in the way

01:29:57.790 --> 01:29:59.719
I think about valuing
these companies.

01:29:59.719 --> 01:30:01.510
If you're a consulting
company, what do you

01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:03.820
have to invest in to grow?

01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.110
Human capital.

01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:07.780
So those recruiting and
training expenses that you have,

01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:10.912
some of that at least should
be treated like capex.

01:30:10.912 --> 01:30:13.180
So my definition of
capex is not going

01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:15.340
to match an accountant's
definition of capex

01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:18.232
because my definition of capex
is driven by how quickly do

01:30:18.232 --> 01:30:20.440
you want to grow and what
do you need to put money in

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.231
to get that growth?

01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:25.040
SPEAKER 1: Same
thing about capital,

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:26.040
like tangible capital versus--

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:26.530
ASWATH DAMODARAN: Same thing.

01:30:26.530 --> 01:30:28.150
Once you make that definition.

01:30:28.150 --> 01:30:30.170
My invested capital at
a company like Google

01:30:30.170 --> 01:30:32.799
will require me to
capitalize R&amp;D, right?

01:30:32.799 --> 01:30:34.340
Because if you put
money in R&amp;D and I

01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:36.370
do what the accountants
do, it will never shop as--

01:30:36.370 --> 01:30:38.600
SPEAKER 1: What about goodwill
and non-operating assets

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:39.140
and stuff like that?

01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:40.970
ASWATH DAMODARAN: Goodwill
is kind of a useless area.

01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:43.002
It's the most dangerous
variable ever created

01:30:43.002 --> 01:30:44.960
because it shows up when
you do an acquisitions

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:46.629
and accountants--
it's a plug variable.

01:30:46.629 --> 01:30:48.170
SPEAKER 1: So you
would not count it.

01:30:48.170 --> 01:30:48.860
ASWATH DAMODARAN:
I wouldn't count it

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.890
as part of invested capital,
simply because you could

01:30:50.890 --> 01:30:52.140
consistently keep [INAUDIBLE].

01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:56.030
Because goodwill captures future
growth, it captures stupidity,

01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:57.710
it captures premiums
you're paying.

01:30:57.710 --> 01:31:00.930
It captures everything you do
over and above that book value.

01:31:00.930 --> 01:31:03.530
So to me goodwill is
a non-asset, right?

01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:04.460
SPEAKER 1: OK.

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:06.140
Thank you so much
for humoring us

01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:08.540
with our questions and your
valuable time and talk.

01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:09.140
[APPLAUSE]

01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:11.290
Thank you so much.
