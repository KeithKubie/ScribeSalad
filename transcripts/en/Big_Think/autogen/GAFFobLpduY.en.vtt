everything and to me cuisine is really

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460
everything and to me cuisine is really
 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.270
everything and to me cuisine is really
one of the signal achievements of our

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280
one of the signal achievements of our
 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:21.910
one of the signal achievements of our
society plants play an essential role in

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920
society plants play an essential role in
 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.570
society plants play an essential role in
that process by giving us the goods the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580
that process by giving us the goods the
 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.570
that process by giving us the goods the
fruits and vegetables that provide much

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
fruits and vegetables that provide much
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.510
fruits and vegetables that provide much
of the raw material for our cuisine and

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
of the raw material for our cuisine and
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.080
of the raw material for our cuisine and
yet plants themselves never get to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
yet plants themselves never get to
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.440
yet plants themselves never get to
experience cuisine as we do and to me

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450
experience cuisine as we do and to me
 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.030
experience cuisine as we do and to me
that seemed always to be kind of a shame

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
that seemed always to be kind of a shame
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.310
that seemed always to be kind of a shame
I suppose that they should give us

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320
I suppose that they should give us
 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.979
I suppose that they should give us
something as extraordinary as they do

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989
something as extraordinary as they do
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.670
something as extraordinary as they do
and not get it in turn so I started to

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680
and not get it in turn so I started to
 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.170
and not get it in turn so I started to
think about how plants might get their

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
think about how plants might get their
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.200
think about how plants might get their
own form of cuisine that would go beyond

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210
own form of cuisine that would go beyond
 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.100
own form of cuisine that would go beyond
the everyday experience that they have

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
the everyday experience that they have
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.660
the everyday experience that they have
of gouging themselves on sunlight if you

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670
of gouging themselves on sunlight if you
 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.990
of gouging themselves on sunlight if you
think about it our cuisine is simply a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000
think about it our cuisine is simply a
 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.070
think about it our cuisine is simply a
fancy way in which the basic nutrients

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
fancy way in which the basic nutrients
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.090
fancy way in which the basic nutrients
that we need are articulated in balance

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100
that we need are articulated in balance
 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.719
that we need are articulated in balance
with each other to provide an

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729
with each other to provide an
 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.960
with each other to provide an
aesthetically pleasing experience I

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970
aesthetically pleasing experience I
 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.149
aesthetically pleasing experience I
figured that there's no reason why you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
figured that there's no reason why you
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.620
figured that there's no reason why you
can't do the same thing for a plant

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630
can't do the same thing for a plant
 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.280
can't do the same thing for a plant
given that plants are consuming the full

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
given that plants are consuming the full
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.770
given that plants are consuming the full
spectrum of sunlight and that different

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
spectrum of sunlight and that different
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.609
spectrum of sunlight and that different
parts of the spectrum give plants

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619
parts of the spectrum give plants
 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.420
parts of the spectrum give plants
different essential elements in their

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
different essential elements in their
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.270
different essential elements in their
diet so I started to look at some of the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
diet so I started to look at some of the
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.359
diet so I started to look at some of the
leading cookbooks by Julia Child and

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
leading cookbooks by Julia Child and
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.370
leading cookbooks by Julia Child and
others and trying to reverse engineer

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380
others and trying to reverse engineer
 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.459
others and trying to reverse engineer
from those cookbooks the various ways in

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
from those cookbooks the various ways in
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.219
from those cookbooks the various ways in
which different ingredients work

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229
which different ingredients work
 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.060
which different ingredients work
together the way in which different

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070
together the way in which different
 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.710
together the way in which different
foodstuffs that are necessary for our

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
foodstuffs that are necessary for our
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.070
foodstuffs that are necessary for our
sustenance are put together to transform

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080
sustenance are put together to transform
 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.310
sustenance are put together to transform
them into cuisine at the same time I

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320
them into cuisine at the same time I
 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.150
them into cuisine at the same time I
started looking at sunlight and the way

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160
started looking at sunlight and the way
 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.180
started looking at sunlight and the way
in which different parts of the spectrum

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190
in which different parts of the spectrum
 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.820
in which different parts of the spectrum
are essential to plants and plants

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830
are essential to plants and plants
 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.050
are essential to plants and plants
respond to different parts of the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
respond to different parts of the
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.040
respond to different parts of the
spectrum in different ways and then I

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050
spectrum in different ways and then I
 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.230
spectrum in different ways and then I
started to map the one on to the other

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240
started to map the one on to the other
 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.470
started to map the one on to the other
in order to make a photosynthetic

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480
in order to make a photosynthetic
 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.740
in order to make a photosynthetic
cuisine a photosynthetic restaurant for

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750
cuisine a photosynthetic restaurant for
 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.380
cuisine a photosynthetic restaurant for
plants the idea was to build a meal that

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390
plants the idea was to build a meal that
 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.880
plants the idea was to build a meal that
the plant would experience over the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890
the plant would experience over the
 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.520
the plant would experience over the
course of the day by filtering sunlight

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530
course of the day by filtering sunlight
 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.100
course of the day by filtering sunlight
through colored filters where the order

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110
through colored filters where the order
 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.280
through colored filters where the order
in which different colors were exposed

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290
in which different colors were exposed
 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.180
in which different colors were exposed
to the plant would be the cuisine that

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190
to the plant would be the cuisine that
 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.280
to the plant would be the cuisine that
would have all of the nutritive value

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290
would have all of the nutritive value
 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.410
would have all of the nutritive value
that the plants would get were they

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420
that the plants would get were they
 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.940
that the plants would get were they
exposed to the full spectrum for the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950
exposed to the full spectrum for the
 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.480
exposed to the full spectrum for the
entire day but would put those nutrients

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490
entire day but would put those nutrients
 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.850
entire day but would put those nutrients
in relationship to each other in a way

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860
in relationship to each other in a way
 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.580
in relationship to each other in a way
that would have a sort of culinary

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590
that would have a sort of culinary
 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.730
that would have a sort of culinary
satisfaction in addition to simply a

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740
satisfaction in addition to simply a
 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.640
satisfaction in addition to simply a
metabolic satisfaction so in the case of

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650
metabolic satisfaction so in the case of
 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.400
metabolic satisfaction so in the case of
a comfort food for plants or a French

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410
a comfort food for plants or a French
 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.710

sort of style cuisine in a continental
cuisine what I can do is I can take the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500
cuisine what I can do is I can take the
 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.650
cuisine what I can do is I can take the
sunlight that occurs over the course of

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660
sunlight that occurs over the course of
 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.210
sunlight that occurs over the course of
the day naturally where it moves from

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220
the day naturally where it moves from
 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.430
the day naturally where it moves from
more in the red to more in the blue

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440
more in the red to more in the blue
 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.610
more in the red to more in the blue
range and then back again and I can

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620
range and then back again and I can
 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.340
range and then back again and I can
increase the redness and the blueness

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350
increase the redness and the blueness
 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.010
increase the redness and the blueness
and I can make it so that it's a more

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020
and I can make it so that it's a more
 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.180
and I can make it so that it's a more
extreme version of what happens in

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190
extreme version of what happens in
 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.510
extreme version of what happens in
nature or I can switch it up I can make

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520
nature or I can switch it up I can make
 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.010
nature or I can switch it up I can make
it so that the plant is constantly

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020
it so that the plant is constantly
 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.160
it so that the plant is constantly
surprised and that surprise becomes in

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170
surprised and that surprise becomes in
 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.750
surprised and that surprise becomes in
the way that avant-garde cuisine works

opened a restaurant in the town of

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670
opened a restaurant in the town of
 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.210
opened a restaurant in the town of
Sacramento California at the Crocker Art

Sacramento California at the Crocker Art
 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.460
Sacramento California at the Crocker Art
Museum out in the gardens there were

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470
Museum out in the gardens there were
 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.130
Museum out in the gardens there were
hundred year old rose bushes that had

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140
hundred year old rose bushes that had
 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.760
hundred year old rose bushes that had
always been gouging on sunlight just as

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770
always been gouging on sunlight just as
 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.940
always been gouging on sunlight just as
it came down to them from the sky had

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950
it came down to them from the sky had
 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.159
it came down to them from the sky had
never had a cuisine of their own

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169
never had a cuisine of their own
 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.709
never had a cuisine of their own
and I built some filters into the garden

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:30.719
and I built some filters into the garden
 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.890
and I built some filters into the garden
that were oriented according to how the

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900
that were oriented according to how the
 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.730
that were oriented according to how the
Sun arcs across the sky so that

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740
Sun arcs across the sky so that
 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.830
Sun arcs across the sky so that
naturally over the course of the day the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840
naturally over the course of the day the
 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.499
naturally over the course of the day the
plants get a meal that involves many

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509
plants get a meal that involves many
 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.989
plants get a meal that involves many
different colors and then since not

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:44.999
different colors and then since not
 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:48.800
different colors and then since not
every plant can go to Sacramento in fact

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810
every plant can go to Sacramento in fact
 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.179
every plant can go to Sacramento in fact
they can't travel at all for the most

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:50.189
they can't travel at all for the most
 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.309
they can't travel at all for the most
part I decided that plants at home

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319
part I decided that plants at home
 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.689
part I decided that plants at home
should have the opportunity to have a

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699
should have the opportunity to have a
 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.489
should have the opportunity to have a
photosynthetic cuisine as well

00:04:55.489 --> 00:04:55.499
photosynthetic cuisine as well
 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:58.129
photosynthetic cuisine as well
I made a TV dinner for plants that was
