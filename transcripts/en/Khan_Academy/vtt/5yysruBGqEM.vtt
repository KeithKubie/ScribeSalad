00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.540
Welcome back.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.610
We're doing problem
number ten.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.770
And I just drew the figure.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.570
They said a right, circular
cylinder with radius 5 and

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.860
height 4 has volume v.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.000
So what's the volume of this?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.490
The volume of the cylinder--
they give you the formula

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.700
actually-- but it's just the
area of the base, or the area

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.210
of the top of the cylinder
times its height.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.490
So it's pi r squared, where the
radius is 5, so that's pi

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.310
times 25-- 5 squared-- times
the height, times 4.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.720
So v is equal to 100 pi.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.140
Fair enough.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.110
Then they say, in terms of v,
what is the volume of a right

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.500
circular cylinder with radius
5 and height 8?

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.560
Oh, you see I didn't even have
to do all this because now

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.695
this new cylinder is just like
this cylinder, right?

00:00:51.695 --> 00:00:55.110
But instead of having height
4 it has height 8.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.620
See I didn't have to know
that formula, oh my god.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.610
I wanted to draw the ellipse.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.350
So this new cylinder looks
something like this, although

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.890
I'm not drawing it really
to scale, but I

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.670
think you get the point.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.890
The new cylinder you can kind
of just-- then new cylinder

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.340
has height 8.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.310
So what, the new cylinder is
twice the size of the previous

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.850
cylinder, right?

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.420
The previous cylinder had
height 4, radius 5.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.150
This new cylinder has
radius 5, height 8.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.350
So the new cylinder is going to
be twice the volume, right?

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.110
The volume for this is v, so
the volume for the new one

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.347
is-- it's twice as high so it's
going to have twice the

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.070
volume-- so 2v.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.160
So it's answer B.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.400
You didn't even have
to know all this.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.920
See you can go on the wrong
track very quickly.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.660
Although if you did it
that way, you would

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.370
get the right answer.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.620
Problem number eleven.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:06.040
If k, n and r are integers,
let k be defined-- let k

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:16.190
diamond, n, r-- be defined to be
true only if-- so k diamond

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:28.650
is true if n is less than
k, which is less than r.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:40.660
Then they tell us that minus
2 diamond n, 0 is true.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.760
Which of the following could
be a possible value of n?

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.110
So let's just translate this
into this world, right?

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.160
So this is true.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.780
Minus 2 diamond n, 0 is true.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.510
So that means that we just
pattern match, right?

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.430
K is minus 2, n is
n, and r is 0.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.900
So our n is just n.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.720
So that means n is
less than k.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.530
K is minus 2, which is
less than our r.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.600
Our r is 0.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.270
So n is less than minus 2,
which is less than 0.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.130
I mean obviously minus
2 is less than 0.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.190
So which of the following
could be a

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.480
possible value of n?

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.450
So they give us three choices.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:33.220
I is minus 3, II is minus 1 and
then III is positive 3.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.230
Well , which of these numbers
is less than negative 2?

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.420
Positive 3 isn't.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.575
Negative 1 is greater than
negative 2, so all we're left

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:42.000
with is choice I.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.280
Not too hard of a
problem right?

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.660
A.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.910
It just looks complicated.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.650
Image.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.540
Invert colors.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.790
Problem twelve.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.910
If 20% of x is equal to 80% of
y-- so immediately my brain

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.910
converts that to decimals.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:10.380
So 0.20x is equal to 0.80y.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.190
Which of the following expresses
y in terms of x?

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.050
So we want y in terms of x,
so let's solve for y.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.700
We divide both sides by 0.80.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:27.020
So y is equal to 0.20 divided
by 0.80 times x.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.870
Right?

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.380
I switched them around
too, right?

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.750
I switched the two sides, but
I divided both sides by 0.8,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.460
that's all I did.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.730
So y is equal to-- what's
0.2 over 0.8?

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.620
Well that's the same thing
as 2 over 8, or 0.25x.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.680
Or, y is 25% of x.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.970
And that is choice B.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.220
Next soon. problem.

00:04:55.908 --> 00:04:59.940
It's a very cold day today.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.885
My feet are cold.

00:05:00.885 --> 00:05:04.510
I should go do a run, run
a hill or something.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.850
All right.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.100
Problem number thirteen.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.950
If x, y and z-- this seems
familiar, anyway- if x, y and

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:20.770
z are positive integers such
that the value of x plus y is

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:30.840
even, and the value of x plus
y squared plus x plus z is

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.440
odd, which is the following
is true?

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.400
And they give a bunch
of choices.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.930
So this is actually
quite interesting.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.800
So let's see what we can say.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.640
Can we say that x is odd?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.770
That's choice A, x is odd.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:59.050
If x plus y is even, then x plus
y squared will also be

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.230
even, right?

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.880
x plus y squared is also
going to be even.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.130
So this is even.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:15.020
But if this is even and then
this whole thing is odd, the

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.010
only way you can add something
to an even number and get an

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.650
odd number is if the thing
you added was odd.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.955
And you can think about that.

00:06:22.955 --> 00:06:26.630
So x plus z is odd.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.330
So we essentially
know two things.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.320
x plus y is even.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.785
And we also know that x
plus z is odd, right?

00:06:35.785 --> 00:06:37.880
And how did we figure
out x plus z is odd?

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.110
Because we know x plus y is
even, x plus y squared must be

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.930
even, and the only way to add
something to something that's

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.630
even and get an odd number is if
that thing you add is odd.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.630
So we know that x
plus z is odd.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.290
This is interesting.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.150
So we know x plus y is even.
x plus z is odd.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.700
So do we know for sure
that x is odd?

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.590
Well no. x could be even.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.780
x could be 2, y could be 2.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.220
And x could be 2 and
z could be 1.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.820
So we don't know
that x is odd.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.070
And then choice B
says x is even.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.600
Well, not necessarily.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.236
x could be odd.

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:22.030
x could be 1, y could be
1, x could be 1 here

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.820
and z could be 2.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.430
So that all works.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.780
So choice B doesn't
work either.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.010
Now choices C and D
look interesting.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:35.390
If z is even then x is odd.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.860
That is true.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.910
Because if we add these two
numbers and we get an odd

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:44.040
number and we know that z is
even, if this number is even,

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.970
then this number
has to be odd.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.540
And you can try it out
with numbers if you

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.660
don't believe me.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.680
So C is true.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.410
And we could go through the
other ones but you only have

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.770
to pick one so C is
definitely true.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:01.400
If z is even then x
is definitely odd.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.830
Because the only way to add
something to an even number

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.080
and get an odd number is if you
add it to an odd number.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.160
Let's do problem number fourteen
if I have time.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.490
Problem fourteen.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.770
0 is less than x which
is less than 1.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.580
Which of the following
statements must be true?

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:31.030
Statement I is, x squared
is greater than x cubed.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:37.010
Statement II is x is
greater than x/2.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:44.179
Statement III says that x is
greater than x to the third.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:45.730
So x is pretty much
a fraction.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.935
It's a positive fraction
less than one.

00:08:48.935 --> 00:08:52.270
And you know what, let's
just try out a number.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.900
Let's just try out x
is equal to 1/2 and

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.960
that'll simplify things.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.160
Because really all the fractions
between 0 and 1 have

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.610
the same properties when
you take the exponents.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:02.590
So let's see, is this true?

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.890
1/2 squared is 1/4.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.900
1/4 is greater than 1/8.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.300
Well yeah, sure, that's true.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:15.060
Is 1/2 greater than 1/4?

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:15.320
Right?

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.890
1/2 divided by 2 is 1/4.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.810
Well sure, that's true.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:27.290
And finally is 1/2 greater
than 1/4 to the third?

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.590
Sure.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.800
1/2 to the third is 1/8.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.220
So 1/2 is definitely greater
than 1/2 to the third, right?

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.510
And they're all positive
numbers so all

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.970
three of them are true.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.360
So it's choice E.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.020
And that's all the time
I have in this video.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.870
I will do problem number fifteen
in the next video.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.380
See you
