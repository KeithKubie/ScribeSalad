 (church bells ringing)

  (slow piano music)

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:18.118 align:start position:0%
 - I guess in this lifetime,
 we weren't meant to be

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.121 size:88% position:44%
  yet the pictures
  behind my eyeballs

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:24.257
 are only you and me.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.060
I only want to love you
and heaven knows I tried

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:29.696
so now the only way is suicide.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.067
 Then I'll fuck you in heaven,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.903
that's when we can live in sin.

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:39.405
 When the pearly gates are open

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:42.075 size:88% position:44%
 you can be inside me again.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:45.411
- Yes I can be inside you again.

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:46.779
 Hello.

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:48.915
- The first time I saw your face

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:51.684 size:88% position:44%
 I knew we were meant to be.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:54.120
 When I looked into your eyes

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:56.956 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I thought, wow,
 you're just like me.

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.292 align:start position:0%
 - When I go to Jesus, you'll
 go down on my all day.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.094 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - When I go to the
  pie in the sky,

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:04.564 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I'll lay there and
 let you have your way.

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:09.001 align:start size:88% position:13%
  And then I'll fuck
  you in heaven,

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:11.471
that's when we can live in sin.

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:14.273
When the pearly gates are open,

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:17.076 size:88% position:44%
 you can be inside me again.

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.879 size:84% position:42%
  - Yes, I can be
  inside you again.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.851
 If you can't have
 me, no one else can.

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:30.857 size:84% position:42%
  - When we're dead, I'll
  be your one and only man.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.559
 - Our timing was off.

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:35.061
 - Our timing was bad.

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:36.295 size:84% position:42%
  - I blame my mom.

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:40.666
- And I blame my dad,
which is also your dad.

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:43.002
 - And also your mom.

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:45.605 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Both] And we'll fuck
all night in heaven

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.174 size:84% position:42%
  since we can't do
  it here on Earth.

00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:50.776 size:88% position:44%
 We're not allowed as lovers

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.813
 even though we've been
 together since birth.

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:56.282
 Oh yes, together since birth.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.720 size:84% position:42%
  I guess in this lifetime,

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:03.322
we weren't meant to be.

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:07.527 size:88% position:44%
 But when I kill myself, it
 will finally be you and me.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.698
 Yes, finally just you and me.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.006 size:84% position:42%
  - Mother?

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.840 size:88% position:44%
