00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.360
If animals were on Facebook, they'd be pretty
stoked about the non-binary sex options out

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.670
there.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.450
Hey wild animals, Jules here for DNews.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.890
Humans have spent the last few millennia attempting
to paint biological sex as purely black and

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.630
white, and only in the last few years has
that dichotomy slowly blossomed into more

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.630
of a continuum.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.869
The natural world, however, doesn't have those
sticking points.

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.599
Instead, nature produced so much variation
in animals and insects, that it would be ridiculous

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.559
to even suggest that there are only two sexes
out there, or that they can only be one.

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.320
For example, some animals are born intersex,
just like some humans are.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.859
That means they possess both categories of
male and female sexual characteristics, primarily

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.190
judged by the appearance of testicles and
ovaries, also known as gonads.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.950
Gonads are just any organ that produces gametes,
which are necessary for reproduction.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.660
Some lower animals, such as earthworms or
snails, are inherently intersex, which in

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.379
this case is also called “simultaneous hermaphroditism”
this means they have both ovaries and testes.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.300
When they mate they pass packets of sperm
back and forth before putting the fertilized

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.909
cells in a cocoon.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.030
Some animals are born with one sex, and for
a variety of reasons undergo, what is basically

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.920
a self-induced sex change.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.390
This is called “sequential hermaphroditism”.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.649
A number of fish, amphibians, and reptiles
are famous for this ability, and in some cases,

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.500
they’ll change sex just based on social
hierarchy.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.710
The clownfish, for example, is structured
in a social hierarchy with the only female

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.710
fish at the top.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.390
If this top female clownfish dies, then the
most dominant male takes her place, and in

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.189
doing so, changes its sex to female.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.869
The same thing happens with wrasses, but in
reverse, with a school of females and a male

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:38.869
at the top.

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.210
There are also animals that are considered
one sex but show characteristics of another.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.729
In one African game reserve, keepers discovered
a group of female lionesses sporting thick

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.259
masculine manes, and producing loud guttural
roars, which these lionesses used to trick

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.770
predators and even safari guests into thinking
they were male lions.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.899
According to one biologist interviewed in
Popular Science, these lionesses likely have

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.220
an overabundance of testosterone.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.600
This is similar to the increase experienced
by older women after menopause . Kind of like

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.230
these lionesses, many older women begin to
display some secondary sexual characteristics

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.489
which we more associate with men, like hair
growth and a deeper voice.

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.670
Biological sex is a wide spectrum, with plenty
of overlap, loopholes, shortcuts, and just

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.450
plain unexplainable weirdness; at least that’s
how it looks to humans.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.920
But, if everyone else is comfortable with
their sex, maybe we’re the ones with the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.920
weird obsession?

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.510
If you’re interested in the natural world
you can go outside or stay in your chair and

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.850
check it out in 360 degress!

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.980
Our newest channel, Seeker VR, has all kinds
of cool stories, including one about weed

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.730
farmers in California.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.310
Now we know that human sexuality has a lot
of ambiguity, but could a man have a baby?

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.900
Find out in this video.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.870
