[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.486 --> 00:00:09.610
GUY HORGAN: Good afternoon.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.110
My name is Guy
Horgan, and today I'm

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.050
happy to welcome
RP Eddy to Google.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.740
RP got his start on the
National Security Council,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.560
after which he served as
both the UN and United States

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.370
diplomat.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.730
Today he is the CEO and founder
of Ergo, a global intelligence

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.730
and strategy firm that advises
large governments and companies

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.101
on a variety of matters.

00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:29.850
Today he's here to
talk about his new book

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.610
that he wrote alongside Richard
Clarke called, "Warnings--

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.846
Finding Cassandras to
Stop Catastrophes."

00:00:34.846 --> 00:00:36.720
He's going to give us
a few prepared remarks,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.300
after which point we
will do a Q&amp;A together.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.260
RP, welcome to Google.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.070
RP EDDY: Thanks, Guy.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.700
Thanks very much.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.366
Glad to be here.

00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.990
Today I want to
talk about people

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.754
who can see the future, people
who can warn us of disasters,

00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:54.170
people who
historically we ignore,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.044
and people we must
stop ignoring.

00:00:56.044 --> 00:00:58.210
The man in that video at
the end was Richard Clarke.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.412
He's my co-author.

00:00:59.412 --> 00:01:01.120
I had the real honor
of working with Dick

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.970
at the National Security
Council in the mid '90s.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.532
One of Dick's primary missions,
then, inside the White House,

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:08.740
was to convince the White
House and other governments

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.670
that a group called
al-Qaeda posed

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.960
a massive threat to us-- not
just to us but to our allies.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.460
At that time,
terrorism was looked

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.950
at as a largely national
issue or a regional issue.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.720
We thought of groups like
Hezbollah or Carlos the Jackal.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.410
We didn't think of big global
movements like al-Qaeda.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.750
Dick realized this was
a massive threat to us

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.890
and something that had to
be taken more seriously.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.510
Dick tried to make
his warnings heard.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.400
He wrote a series
of important memos.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.300
He talked from
president to president.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.220
Dick ultimately was
ignored, and 9/11 happened.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.659
As you can imagine, Dick and
I, and a small band of us

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.200
who had worked on
the al-Qaeda issue,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.460
have looked back on that
question over the years

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.340
and asked how we failed and
asked how failures like this

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.390
occur.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.660
One evening he and I
had a conversation,

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.880
likely over a bottle
of scotch, and we

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.790
started realizing that
disaster after disaster,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.010
there'd be a commission.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.279
There'd be articles.

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:02.070
There'd be journalists
who would pursue it.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.640
And someone would
come out, who'd

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.150
stand out, who had predicted
that disaster in great detail

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.370
and been ignored.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.780
We realized there seemed to
be a pattern of these people,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.250
and that, perhaps, was
worth looking into further.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.830
In Greek mythology, there
was a woman named Cassandra.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.730
She was a beautiful
mortal, and she

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.360
refused to sleep with Apollo.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.260
Apollo's curse to her
was that every time she

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.010
foretold disaster--
in fact, he allowed

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.390
her to foretell disasters--
she would be ignored.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.610
Cassandra then, being from
Troy, saw the sack of her city,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.235
saw her brothers killed,
saw her family destroyed,

00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:36.610
her home destroyed, her entire
city burned to the ground.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.440
She saw this in
perfect detail, well

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.820
before it occurred, and
warned and warned and warned.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.360
And Cassandra went
crazy with her warnings,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.250
crazy that no one
listened to her.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.140
So we decided to go look
for modern-day Cassandras.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.510
And boy, did we find them.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.100
What we found was a huge number
of people who were ignored--

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.720
but not just warnings,
not sandwich plate,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.610
crazy people on the
street corner saying

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.990
the sky is going to fall, but
people with shockingly clear,

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.620
data-driven warnings,
eminently qualified experts

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.150
who were telling us about
events of massive consequence.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.120
You know, yes, we
are right to ignore

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.680
many warnings of
disaster, but there

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.506
are some we have to listen to.

00:03:15.506 --> 00:03:17.130
And when we don't
find these Cassandras

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.990
and we don't listen
to them, people die.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.760
I'll talk about a
couple examples of this.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.510
Some of these are
awfully painful.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.910
We went out and interviewed
as many of the Cassandras

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.140
as we could find.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.840
And it was a fascinating
and sad experience.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.620
We learned a lot.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.869
These are extraordinary
people who gave these warnings

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:36.010
and were ignored.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.380
Another example of a
Cassandra that was ignored,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.500
another extremely poignant
example, is Charlie Allen.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.480
Charlie was the National
Intelligence Officer

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.200
for Warning.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.660
This is a job in an
organization called

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.250
the National
Intelligence Council that

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.780
sits above the CIA.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.330
Charlie was a career
intelligence professional,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.420
and he realized in '89
that Saddam Hussein

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.770
was going to invade Kuwait.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.810
Charlie had a variety
of intelligence

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.319
that was giving him high
confidence of this concern,

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.860
and he brought it
to the interagency.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.890
He brought it to the DoD,
brought it to the State,

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.140
brought it to the deputies,
brought it to the cabinet.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.120
Everybody ignored Charlie
all the way along the line.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.620
He had a power to
write something

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.390
called a warning of war.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.070
By virtue of his
position, he could

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.500
write a letter that would
land on the president's desk.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.419
So Charlie wrote
the warning of war.

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.710
It ended up at the White House.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.126
The president looked at it,
and it said, I am telling you,

00:04:25.126 --> 00:04:27.060
Saddam Hussein
will invade Kuwait.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.940
It might be a few months from
now, but it's coming soon.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.930
Charlie had extraordinary
confidence in this.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.180
And again, it was data-driven.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.701
Of course, Charlie was
ignored, and the First Gulf War

00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:37.200
occurred.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.750
We call it the First
Gulf War because then we

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.990
had a Second Gulf War.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.840
If you think about what
ended up occurring, the price

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.690
we paid from the First Gulf
War, from Saddam's invasion

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.640
of Kuwait, it's
fairly extraordinary.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.890
One thing that might
not be as obvious

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.750
is that American troop
presence in Saudi Arabia--

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.440
we put troops there to protect
Saudi Arabia at this moment--

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.120
was the entire raison
d'etre of al-Qaeda.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.600
Al-Qaeda did not exist
until we put troops there.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.655
Al-Qaeda had no
reason, no raison

00:05:02.655 --> 00:05:03.900
d'etre until we did that.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.510
Al-Qaeda was born because
we put troops there,

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.787
because Saddam invaded Kuwait.

00:05:07.787 --> 00:05:09.370
Of course, Saddam's
invasion of Kuwait

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.400
and the First Gulf
War and al-Qaeda

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.230
led to the Second Gulf War.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.400
We're talking about 25 years of
destabilization in the region,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.630
trillions of dollars of treasure
spent, millions of lives lost.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.342
And Charlie, the man
who got it right,

00:05:23.342 --> 00:05:25.050
well, he was threatened
with being fired.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.740
He was screamed at, yelled
at for giving the warning.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.300
And the National Intelligence
Officer for Warning position

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.160
has since been abolished.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.830
We're not very good at
listening to these people.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.720
The final example I'll
give is of Fukushima.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.000
Dr. Okamura is a noted
seismologist in Japan.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.020
And when the Fukushima Daiichi
Nuclear Plant was being built,

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.120
he came to them in every
open hearing and said,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.490
you cannot build this nuclear
reactor where you are.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.380
You are too close
to the shoreline.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.620
You are too low.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.310
If you do, a tsunami will
come and will destroy it.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.300
He knew the tsunami.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.092
He knew the speed.

00:05:58.092 --> 00:05:58.800
He knew the time.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.180
He said you're 40 years
overdue for a tsunami.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.040
He knew precisely the
one that would come.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.200
He was able to go and
look in the mountainsides

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.200
above the Fukushima
Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.320
and find sand and stones that
came from this Jogan tsunami.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.590
Now, the problem with the
tsunami he foretold was it

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.060
was from AD 869.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.650
It was a long time ago.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.840
So he would go to hearing
after hearing, a noted

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.350
PhD seismologist from a
noted center of seismology,

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.110
and warn them, do not build this
plant where you're building it.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.651
And every time he
would show up, they

00:06:29.651 --> 00:06:31.770
would say, Dr. Okamura,
thanks for coming.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.089
The hearing today is about
earthquakes, not tsunamis.

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:36.630
Well, when's the
meeting on tsunamis?

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.467
We don't know yet.

00:06:37.467 --> 00:06:39.300
The meeting on tsunamis
was never scheduled.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.420
He never was able
to be listened to.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.910
He was ignored repeatedly.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.450
So what happened because of
his warning not being heard?

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.620
Well, the tsunami wave
showed up at the precise wave

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.410
height he warned, about the same
time he said it would happen.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.430
It rushed in shore at 435 miles
an hour, crested the wall,

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.680
and destroyed all the
backup power at Fukushima,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.440
leading to the largest nuclear
disaster since Chernobyl.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.870
19,000 people died in
Japan, and many of them

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.990
tragically died when they
went to tsunami evacuation

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.760
spots that were too low.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.470
Even the tsunami
evacuation spots

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.080
hadn't been built to
the proper height.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.450
And Fukushima, what happens
when a nuclear power

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.040
plant has no power?

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.910
It melts down.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:24.660
It explodes.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.000
It spews toxic and
radioactive gases,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.680
and that's what happened here.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.000
We estimate that if TEPCO, the
builder of the Fukushima plant,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.700
had spent the money making
the improvements that Dr.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.300
Okamura had suggested, it would
have cost them $50 million.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.410
It's a real number.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.310
But it's cost $100 billion to
clean up the nuclear disaster.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.230
It will probably
lead to 10,000 deaths

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.010
from the ongoing radiation
poisoning and cancers.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.360
That's a 2,000 times
return on the investment.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.040
Those examples and
many others were

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.530
predicted in nearly
perfect detail

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.110
by highly credible
data-driven experts,

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.360
yet we ignored them,
one after the other.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.134
And we continue to do this.

00:08:05.134 --> 00:08:07.050
So the only question
that Dick and I could ask

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.508
is, what the hell
is wrong with us?

00:08:08.508 --> 00:08:10.050
Why are we doing this wrong?

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.464
Why don't we get this?

00:08:11.464 --> 00:08:13.380
Every one of these experts
had massive numbers

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.010
of similarities.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.759
So we realized there
was a clear pattern

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:18.800
through these interviews.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.341
One thing that was
pretty fascinating

00:08:20.341 --> 00:08:24.200
is they all said to
us two sentences.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.240
Every Cassandra we interviewed
said two things to us.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.890
One was, when I discovered
this data, when I figured out

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.580
what was happening,
I wanted to be wrong.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.080
So I went to my colleagues and
said, please look at my data.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.789
Please study what
I think I found.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:39.243
Tell me this is inaccurate.

00:08:39.243 --> 00:08:41.659
And of course, in all instances
their colleagues couldn't.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.075
And the second
thing they all said

00:08:43.075 --> 00:08:45.350
was, well, now that
I knew it was right,

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.815
I took it to the decision
makers and presumed

00:08:48.815 --> 00:08:49.690
they would act on it.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.620
And of course, they
didn't, or else they

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.212
wouldn't be Cassandras.

00:08:53.212 --> 00:08:54.920
And when they ignored
it, I said to them,

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.730
why are you ignoring
your own data?

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.600
This wasn't proprietary insight.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.396
This was publicly available
data that they provided.

00:09:02.396 --> 00:09:04.020
So that's one thing
they had in common.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.500
Another thing we realized
they had in common

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.050
was that there were four
sets of characteristics

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.670
across every Cassandra event.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.100
We called this the
Cassandra Coefficient.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.570
The first one is
the warning itself.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.030
The second is the
decision makers,

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.610
the third the Cassandra,
and the fourth the critics.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.410
Each one of those
things can help

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:27.360
us identify if a warner is a
Chicken Little or a Cassandra.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.130
Now, this Cassandra Coefficient
is only the beginning.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.090
This book is very clear in
describing itself not as

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.980
a perfectly scientific tome.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.170
There's a team at MIT
working on that now,

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.880
doing a series of
analyses to figure out

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.730
how to make this Cassandra
Coefficient more accurate.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.500
And I hope someone else
will look at that as well.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.030
But there are some very powerful
patterns that we found in here.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:52.890
I will mention only two of the
24 Cassandra Coefficients, two

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.580
that we think are
relatively interesting.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.960
The first one is called
initial occurrence syndrome.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.850
Many of these disasters occurred
and nothing like it had ever--

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.389
never occurred before.

00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:07.930
Initial occurrence
syndrome has to do

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.620
with our human bias availability
heuristic and normalcy bias.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.110
It's very hard for us to
imagine something happening that

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.030
hasn't happened
before, very difficult

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.780
for us to see totally
novel events in our head.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.000
This is a quote by
Chairman Ben Bernanke, one

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.450
of the most intelligent men ever
to serve in the US government,

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.430
highly credentialed,
highly smart.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.530
And in this instance,
he falls fully victim

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.980
to initial occurrence syndrome.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.560
What he's saying
here is, we've never

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.650
had the entire nation have a
real estate decline in prices.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.360
And since we haven't, we won't.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.210
And since we won't, we won't
have a full employment problem

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.330
or an economic downturn.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.480
He said that in July 2005.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.220
When you see words
like "never before,"

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.820
you should look twice and wonder
why people are thinking this.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:49.469
Was he right?

00:10:49.469 --> 00:10:51.010
Of course, he was
dramatically wrong.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.470
The 2008 collapse
happened entirely

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.420
because of a nationwide
collapse in real estate.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.690
The 2008 collapse is also
notable for another Cassandra.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.380
Meredith Whitney, a young
Wall Street analyst,

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.990
began to do the homework
on Citibank very early

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.770
on in '06, '07, and realized
that they were going to fail

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:10.700
as a company.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:15.499
The largest firm in the
world was going to collapse.

00:11:15.499 --> 00:11:16.540
Meredith had the numbers.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.650
She had the data.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.300
She produced her estimate.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.410
She was obviously right.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.810
But until she was right,
what did she get in return?

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.080
Death threats, threats of being
fired, and extraordinarily

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.000
sexist responses.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.790
She then was correct about
Lehman and then Bear.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.040
In every instance, she
was ahead of the market.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.410
She was ahead of the naysayers.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:35.590
This Cassandra was correct.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.710
The other major category
of why we get things wrong

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.886
has to do with not
so much our biases--

00:11:44.886 --> 00:11:46.760
and if you look at the
Cassandra Coefficient,

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.093
there's a large number of
things that are highly related

00:11:49.093 --> 00:11:50.546
to human biases.

00:11:50.546 --> 00:11:52.670
The other one has to do
with the massive complexity

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.670
in the world.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.570
I call this the
acceleration of history.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.810
We were all taught how
the Second Industrial

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.666
Revolution of 1870
led to World War

00:12:02.666 --> 00:12:04.220
I which led to World War II.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.680
When you have
technological revolutions,

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.390
you end up with
massive displacements.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.380
Yes, you have winners,
but for all the winners,

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.720
you have losers.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.470
The losers often tend to be the
employed class, the blue collar

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.410
class, as it has been in
every technological revolution

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.052
that we've had
throughout history.

00:12:21.052 --> 00:12:23.010
And when you have a large
number of unemployed,

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.640
you obviously have a massive
disruption to society.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.680
The 1870 technological
revolution

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.942
led to World War I,
led to World War II.

00:12:30.942 --> 00:12:32.400
And other technological
revolutions

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.910
have been just as disruptive.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.790
Now, as you look
at this chart, you

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.720
see the periodicity between the
revolutions is getting shorter.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.440
We go from 200 years
till 1780, to 100 years

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.220
till 1870, and on we go.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.890
The periodicity matters.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.280
Society needs time to absorb
and retrain the workers.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.220
We need time to get back
on our feet as nations.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.600
We need time to
get over the wars

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.060
that we generally have had
after these revolutions.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.780
But the periodicity between
the technological revolutions

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:06.100
is getting much, much closer
together, much shorter.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.420
How fast are we
moving as a society?

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.360
How fast is history
accelerating?

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.580
Well, it's worth noting
the period of time

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.310
from the bronze
sword to the steel

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:19.240
sword is four times longer than
the time from the steel sword

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.910
to the nuclear weapon.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.980
We are moving
extraordinarily quickly.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.830
Now, if you look at where
we find ourselves today,

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.350
you could argue we have three
technological revolutions

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.960
happening at the same time--

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.480
three revolutions that are
leading to massive disruption,

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.532
three revolutions that
are changing regions,

00:13:36.532 --> 00:13:37.990
three revolutions
that are changing

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.030
employment and employability.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.520
They're all happening within
a decade of each other.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.800
Super intelligence and
artificial intelligence,

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.730
genetics, and energy.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.160
It is this complexity
mismatch, it's

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.170
this acceleration
of history that

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.150
also makes it hard
for decision makers

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.470
to make decisions
when given warnings.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.500
I'll give you an example
of complexity mismatch.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.460
Harry Markopolos is a quant.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.670
Harry Markopolos is a very,
very smart hedge fund manager,

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.630
and Harry Markopolos got a
warning of a hedge fund run

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.400
by a guy named Bernie Madoff.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.620
When Harry began to look
at the Madoff hedge fund,

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.130
he said he realized within five
minutes it was a Ponzi scheme.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.210
How did he know?

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.620
The math told him so.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.940
The data told him so.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.010
His education told him so.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:22.890
So what did he do?

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.830
He went to his friends and said,
this can't be right, can it?

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:25.541
They said it is.

00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:28.040
He went to the SEC and said,
please listen to me, won't you?

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:28.730
They said, no.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.770
He said, how are you
ignoring your own data?

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.390
The exact same story.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.690
He had 11 exchanges with
the SEC over nine years.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.170
He provided three highly
complicated explanations

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.140
of why Bernie
Madoff was a fraud.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.730
He was ignored every time.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.950
Do you remember when
the SEC arrested

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:47.690
or caught Bernie Madoff?

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:48.530
They didn't.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.480
Bernie Madoff's
kids turned him in.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.850
He went scot-free for decades.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.530
He stole $65 billion, the
largest financial fraud

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.590
in history.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:04.050
And the warnings were
there, in perfect data.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.686
Complexity mismatch--
it's very hard for people

00:15:06.686 --> 00:15:07.810
to understand these things.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.620
Now remember, the lawyers
at the SEC at the time,

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:11.780
well, they were lawyers.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.030
They were liberal arts grads.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.727
When Harry came in with a bunch
of charts and math and numbers,

00:15:15.727 --> 00:15:16.810
they didn't understand it.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:17.980
They couldn't get it.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.680
That's a relatively easy thing.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.180
Imagine how hard this is going
to be with superintelligence.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.110
Imagine how hard this is
going to be with the nano.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.651
Imagine a how this is going to
be with new sources of energy,

00:15:26.651 --> 00:15:28.120
genetics, CRISPR.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.100
We're in real trouble
if we can't begin

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.040
to understand what's going on.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.746
So while that's an
historical look back,

00:15:34.746 --> 00:15:36.120
the only value to
this book would

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.703
be if we can see
something coming down

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:38.970
the pike in the future.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.980
Can we apply the
Cassandra Coefficient

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.690
to current warnings?

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.880
At the end of the book,
the final seven chapters,

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.254
we looked at seven
other threats.

00:15:47.254 --> 00:15:49.170
These are people right
now pounding the table,

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.880
warning us, explaining
to us that these

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.400
are species-level risks.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.580
Things that could kill.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.663
There's a phrase that I
learned writing this book,

00:15:56.663 --> 00:15:59.880
a word called gigadeath,
billions of people killed.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.740
People who traffic in
this world understand

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.641
these horrible ideas.

00:16:02.641 --> 00:16:04.890
It's very difficult for us
to get our heads around it.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.234
That's what they think about.

00:16:06.234 --> 00:16:08.400
When we wrote this book
about a year and a half ago,

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.340
the actual drafting, all
seven of these warnings

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.730
seemed a little preposterous,
a little out there.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:17.910
In a year since then, five
of them-- six of them--

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:22.114
five of them, they've gone
from fantastic to probable.

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:23.280
I'm going to talk about two.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.550
The first one is very timely.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.700
This is a warning being
given to us right now

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.460
by a noted professor
named Alan Robock.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.730
Alan has picked up the work
previously done by Carl Sagan.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.060
Carl Sagan, in the '70s
and '80s, very ingeniously

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.430
teamed with a group
of Russian scientists

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.230
and did a lot of
study about what

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.152
would happen if 1,000
nuclear weapons were

00:16:46.152 --> 00:16:48.610
thrown back and forth between
the United States and Russia.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.830
Other than the death,
other than the destruction,

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.230
what would occur to the planet?

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.510
What he discovered is
you'd have massive fires.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.600
Those fires would create
superheated plumes.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.300
The plumes would go
in the mesosphere.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.300
And they would dump a
huge degree of effectively

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.550
dust and small particulate
matter around the earth.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:07.540
That leads to global
nuclear winter.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.869
Global nuclear winter
was considered so proven,

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:14.230
so mathematically
correct, so well-modeled

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.119
by the Russians
and the Americans

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.599
that Carl Sagan's theory led
to a huge degree of disarmament

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.670
talks, disarmament success.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:25.030
It's considered a
really magical tool

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.700
to help ease some of the
tensions in the Cold War.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.040
He was considered correct.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.050
Alan Robock, our
current Cassandra,

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.490
went to go look at
Sagan's work using,

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.356
obviously, much more advanced
computers, much larger models.

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:38.480
And he said, wait a second.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.110
You don't just need thousands
of weapons going back and forth.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.193
You could probably trigger
a global nuclear winter

00:17:43.193 --> 00:17:44.770
with 40 weapons.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.110
Now, 40 seems like a lot of
nuclear weapons in a world

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.460
when we've only used two.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.570
40 is not.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.472
I've worked on nuclear weapons
strategy, nuclear planning.

00:17:52.472 --> 00:17:54.430
When the United States
decides to hit a target,

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:57.790
like perhaps North Korea,
it's 30 weapons minimum.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.260
That's just our weapons.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.772
Nuclear weapons don't go in
onesies and twosies anymore.

00:18:03.772 --> 00:18:05.230
So Alan Robock took
a look at this.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.520
And his initial study was
on Pakistan and India.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.890
And he came back and said
that if they went to war,

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:12.640
we'd have trouble.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.700
And he's since modeled a Korean
peninsula nuclear exchange.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:22.389
What he's found is if even 40
warheads are shared in between,

00:18:22.389 --> 00:18:24.180
this would trigger a
global nuclear winter,

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.075
where the entire earth
temperature would go down two

00:18:27.075 --> 00:18:28.680
to four degrees Fahrenheit.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.750
Crop productions would
go down 15% to 25%.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.610
And that would lead to 1
to 2 billion people dead.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.560
So while 40 weapons
in the peninsula

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.390
would be a horrific
thing in and of itself,

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.430
it could lead to a
global catastrophe

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.960
like we can't imagine.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.560
This is hard science, real
data, by an eminently qualified

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.050
expert who's trying to
get the word out there.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.610
Now, the good news
is Alan Robock

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.985
and his team won the Nobel
Prize last year for their work

00:18:52.985 --> 00:18:54.330
on nuclear weapons disarmament.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.940
His work on weapons disarmament
is being well heard.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.540
His work on global nuclear
weapons theory is not.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.660
I've had conversations with
the parts of the US government

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.580
that are making the
nuclear weapons plans that

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.220
would be the ones who would
actually press the button,

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.950
and this theory is
largely unknown to them.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:15.100
That's a real problem.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.520
The final risk I
want to talk about

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.810
is about artificial intelligence
and then superintelligence.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.806
Artificial intelligence,
meaning machines

00:19:23.806 --> 00:19:25.680
that do the work of
humans, is all around us.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.917
It's your ATM machine.

00:19:26.917 --> 00:19:29.250
If you don't think you're
already a cybernetic organism,

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.624
try to survive without your
phone or computer for a week.

00:19:31.624 --> 00:19:32.460
You are.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.810
Superintelligence is
dramatically different.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.320
It's the idea that a computer
can be, quote, unquote,

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.600
"smarter than a human"
at all tasks humans do.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.390
It's also called AGI,
artificial general intelligence.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.290
I'll call it superintelligence
to make it easy to understand.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:50.010
It is definitionally very
hard for our small brains

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.800
to understand a thing that would
be twice as smart, 10 times as

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.190
smart, or 1,000
times as smart as us.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.310
But please understand
there is no real argument

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.600
that this is coming.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.330
Every person involved with
superintelligence or artificial

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.090
intelligence, down to
only a couple dissenters,

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.340
says yes, we will get
to superintelligence.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.860
Now, we don't know the how
and we don't know the when.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.901
That makes it very difficult
to make the argument

00:20:13.901 --> 00:20:16.870
that we should be concerned
about it, but it is coming.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.447
In fact, when it does come,
it'll come very quickly.

00:20:19.447 --> 00:20:21.655
We're talking about machines
that program themselves.

00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:24.280
It's called self-recursive
programming.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.800
This is a self-replicating
technology.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.870
A little footnote--
any technology

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:33.820
that's self-replicating or
self-recursive and asymmetric

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.980
is wildly dangerous.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.140
This is a self-replicating
technology.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.594
It has to be considered
extraordinarily powerful.

00:20:42.594 --> 00:20:45.010
The only argument about this
superintelligence, as I said,

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.330
isn't if it will happen or not.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.690
It's if it will bring
good tidings or bad.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.970
We spent some time
with Eli Yudkowsky.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.940
He's our Cassandra in
this part of the book.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.900
He's a man of
extraordinary intellect

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.260
and now of great stature who
is dedicating his entire life

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.630
to ensuring that
superintelligence is safe,

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.010
that it brings good tidings.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.540
It's a very difficult puzzle.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.030
He doesn't know the solution
yet, but he's dedicated to it.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.890
And in fact,
billions of dollars,

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.510
nominally, are
being dedicated now

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.820
towards ensuring that
superintelligence

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.460
is done safely.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:20.650
Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking,
Bill Gates, Eli Yudkowsky,

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.350
philosopher Nick Bostrom, who
I think gave a Google Talk,

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.690
they all say, you
better watch out.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.780
This is a species-level
event of extraordinary risk.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:32.520
Others aren't so concerned.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.340
There's two possible
outcomes, to make it simple,

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.960
with superintelligence.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.750
One is personified here
by this picture of Lobot

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:40.900
from "Star Wars."

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.704
Lobot, as you can see with his
1970s technology in his face

00:21:43.704 --> 00:21:45.870
looks-- he looks like an
Atari console or something.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:50.440
But Lobot is a
cybernetic machine,

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.990
part human, part computer.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.860
Google's own Ray Kurzweil
looks at this as the future

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.760
of superintelligence.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.950
He tells a very
rosy story that we

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.710
don't have to be concerned
about superintelligence

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.690
because we will get the
cybernetic interface,

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:09.830
and we'll be able to learn
with, grow with, and control

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:14.550
superintelligence because of
our capacity to be part of it.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.430
He and others argue,
the Lobot argument,

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:17.990
that superintelligence
will create

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:19.640
an immense amount of good.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.510
And it will.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.800
This is the most powerful
tool of all time.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.700
Any problem that can be solved
by computation or intelligence

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.670
will be solved by
superintelligence.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.290
Problems we don't
know exist will

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:31.820
be solved by superintelligence.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:32.570
That means hunger.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:33.422
That means disease.

00:22:33.422 --> 00:22:34.130
That means death.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:35.510
That means climate change.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.090
This is the most powerful
tool ever to be invented.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.130
And remember, as I said,
it will be invented.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.300
There's no question of that.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.160
But it's been called
our final invention.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.950
It will then invent
everything else.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.090
And the question is,
yes, it will give us

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.730
all those great societal
benefits as described,

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:53.066
but what does it do then?

00:22:53.066 --> 00:22:54.940
So then you switch to
the other picture here.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.790
And this is of the
Terminator T-2000.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.800
And every conversation
on superintelligence

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.870
apparently has to
show this picture.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.280
We've all watched this movie.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.310
We all know that robots
will come for us.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:10.480
Footnote-- part of the fact
that that is so outlandish, part

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.330
of the fact that Hollywood
has peppered us with movies

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.050
about robots coming
to get us makes

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:16.550
us believe it's not
going to happen.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.924
It makes us believe it's in
the realm of fantasy in film,

00:23:18.924 --> 00:23:20.440
not in our actual lives.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.280
It's inured us to the threat.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.050
People like Gates and
Hawking and others

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.390
believe this is a real risk.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:31.087
And this is the way we'll
personify it in this instance.

00:23:31.087 --> 00:23:32.920
The only way I could
basically describe this

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.270
is think about a genie
coming out of the bottle.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.362
In every narrative, it
gives you three wishes.

00:23:38.362 --> 00:23:39.820
I described the
goodness that we'll

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.945
get from superintelligence.

00:23:40.945 --> 00:23:43.680
But then the genie is
off to do its own thing.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.080
Now, I don't know if we'll
control superintelligence.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.760
I don't know if Eli
Yudkowsky will be right

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:54.570
and if we can put ethics
into the computer.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.770
I have a really hard time
understanding how we will.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:01.720
But I know it's a question
we have to address.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.180
Elon Musk calls this
summoning the demon.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.280
And the one question
people often ask is, well,

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.660
can't you just turn it off?

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.650
Well, why didn't chimpanzees hit
the off switch on human beings?

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.960
Again, every noted
expert working

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.460
on artificial
intelligence agrees

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.950
we will have superintelligence
at some point, probably

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:23.240
within the next 100 years.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.680
I would guess 25 years.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.630
This is a photo of
the World GO champion

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:33.090
losing to your computer here
at Google called AlphaGo.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.192
And if you want to see
the face of dejection,

00:24:35.192 --> 00:24:36.650
I think you can
see it right there.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.930
This chess-- this
GO tournament was

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.790
watched by a huge number
of people inside Asia.

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.550
It was a massive event.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.680
It was a massive event
for popular media,

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.230
but it also was a massive
event in the superintelligence

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.040
community.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.110
I called up and talked
to one of the experts

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:55.580
we had worked with
on this chapter

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.522
as soon as this win had
happened, and I said,

00:24:58.522 --> 00:25:00.980
you told me that this wasn't
going to happen in five years.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.030
And he said, I thought it wasn't
going to happen in five years.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.250
And he was almost in tears.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.290
It's not supposed to have
happened this quickly.

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.870
Technology develops much faster
than humans usually give it

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.130
credit to be able to do.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.390
We are very, very bad as
a race of understanding

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:16.520
technological development.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.690
Complexity mismatch,
which I mentioned before,

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.700
is all over the issue
of superintelligence.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.710
We do not understand
what's happening here.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:24.960
Another issue called
diffusion of responsibility

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.926
is all over superintelligence.

00:25:26.926 --> 00:25:29.550
Can you tell me who at the White
House is responsible for this?

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.020
Can you tell me who in
the Department of Defense

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.400
is in charge of
making sure we don't

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.200
get killed by
superintelligence and robots?

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.030
I don't know who it is.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:40.620
But standing here, I believe
Eli Yudkowsky, Elon Musk, Bill

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.389
Gates, Stephen Hawking
is giving us the chance

00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:44.430
to listen to a Cassandra.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.600
This is a Cassandra moment.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.200
And if I, at the Google
campus, didn't mention this,

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.430
I'd be remiss.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.160
You are one of two or
three places in the world

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.610
legitimately in the race to
create superintelligence.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:59.987
Google may well have the fate
of humanity in its hands.

00:25:59.987 --> 00:26:01.320
It's an extraordinary statement.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.611
What other company in history
could you say that about?

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:08.280
Google's leaders,
in some instances,

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.670
have become dismissive about
the threat of superintelligence.

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.200
That worries me.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.190
Google's early manifesto
was, don't be evil.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:22.380
Google's new manifesto needs
to be, don't build evil.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.460
Cassandras are out there,
and we need to find them.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.410
We now have a tool
to help us do so.

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:33.680
And I think we can do a
much better job at this.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.290
So Dick and I have
dedicated a huge amount

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:39.110
of our future effort to getting
the word out about Cassandras.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.240
This wasn't about writing
a book or making money.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.840
There's no money
in books anymore.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.760
This was about
getting a message out

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.750
so others don't have to feel
the dejection and the failure

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:51.580
and the catastrophe of giving
a warning and being ignored.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.250
We've created something called
the Cassandra Award Foundation.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.260
You can see the board
and jury up here.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.730
Some very distinguished
individuals

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.680
have joined us, including
some former Cassandras.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.430
We have representatives
from the military,

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:07.600
from intelligence, from
Wall Street, from medicine.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.540
And we, every year,
will give out one award

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.790
to one individual giving
a warning we think needs

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.400
more attention.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.220
We gave the award this
year to Alan Robock.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.830
I mentioned earlier Alan's
work on global climate change,

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.720
on a new nuclear winter.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.880
We gave him the Cassandra Award.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.950
And part of the value
here isn't that he

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.350
gets to hold a piece of
glass, as pretty as it is.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:31.990
Part of the value is
that Alan's work ideally

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:33.400
gets a little more of a voice.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.440
More people pay attention
to what he was doing.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.700
The members of the board--

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.080
you saw their names earlier--

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.570
we've all committed to
trying to get the story out.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.906
When we go on media now,
we talk about Alan Robock.

00:27:42.906 --> 00:27:44.530
When we meet with
government officials,

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.080
we talk about Alan
Robock and the fear

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.970
that we all have of a
global nuclear winter.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:52.060
We're going to give this
award out every year.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.740
It is a nonprofit organization.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.090
The website's on there.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:59.620
Please nominate others about
whom we have to be concerned.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.870
And please donate if
you're interested.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:05.650
The funds are used entirely
to reward the award winner

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:08.560
and to pay for publicity
around the message.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.000
So thank you for
taking the time,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.090
and please remember we've
found a tool we think

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.880
can help us avert catastrophes.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.255
GUY HORGAN: RP, thank you so,
so much for joining us here

00:28:18.255 --> 00:28:19.046
and for being here.

00:28:19.046 --> 00:28:21.710
I'm properly freaked out, so I
have a few questions for you.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.110
RP EDDY: [LAUGHS] You're not
supposed to be freaked out.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:24.380
This is a good news story.

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:24.880
Right?

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.270
We now have a tool.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.300
GUY HORGAN: I so
appreciate your being here.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.190
And I was hoping we
could kick things off

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.040
by talking a little bit about
the perception of Cassandras.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.260
So one of the key
things that you describe

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.540
is that most
frequently Cassandras

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.720
are not paid attention to.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.720
Either they are not likable.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.620
They're abrasive.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.080
They don't look the part.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.205
And I was wondering if you
could speak specifically

00:28:45.205 --> 00:28:47.260
about Ms. Whitney and her
experience, especially

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.560
in light of the
topic of the day.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.750
RP EDDY: So Meredith
Whitney, the Cassandra

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.690
who predicted the
2008 collapse, is

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.940
a little different than some
of our Cassandras for one

00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.780
primary reason.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.850
A lot of the
Cassandras we looked at

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:04.240
had something we call an
off-putting personality.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.210
Now, I don't know if they had
the off-putting personality

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.800
the day they found the warning.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.620
But by the time we got to
them, and other people had

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.050
interacted with them, a lot of
them were relatively abrasive.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.970
And I guess you would generally
call kind of a low EQ.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:20.110
Meredith is not like that.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.880
Meredith Whitney is
an extraordinarily

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.970
charming, smart, and at that
instance, this year, 2008,

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:31.810
she was a young female financial
analyst at an investment bank.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:34.670
And that was a bit of
a rarity to start with.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.660
Meredith was sitting
at a cocktail party

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.330
with the CFO of Citi.

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:45.080
Citi was the largest corporation
in the world at the time.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.850
And the lead analyst
from another bank,

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:52.600
a man of great repute who was
the Citi analyst from, I think,

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.470
Goldman Sachs--

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:57.460
don't quote me-- said
to the CFO of Citi,

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.580
your company has become so
complicated that I don't even

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.800
bother modeling it anymore.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.230
And Meredith heard this and
said, what in the world?

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:06.804
Your job is to model
these companies.

00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:08.470
That's your duty and
your responsibility

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:09.580
to know what's going on.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.060
So she went back and redoubled
her efforts to crunch

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:12.810
the model on Citi.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.220
And of course,
she made it, data.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.780
She came out with
her model and said,

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.430
Citi can't pay its dividend.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:22.525
For a financial stock of that
size not to pay its dividend,

00:30:22.525 --> 00:30:24.650
it's the equivalent of the
company almost going out

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:25.040
of business.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.748
She also said it will
go out of business.

00:30:26.748 --> 00:30:31.340
I mean, her report hit
Wall Street like a blast

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.390
and led to stocks tumbling.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:35.350
And she was right.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:37.600
All they had to do was go
back and look at her numbers

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.700
and see that this young
analyst was correct.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:49.450
Because she was a woman, because
she was an attractive woman,

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.320
all the press began to focus
on the attractive young woman,

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.611
didn't focus on the numbers,
didn't focus on the facts,

00:30:54.611 --> 00:30:56.070
didn't focus on
her genius, focused

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:58.830
on her sex and her outfits.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.300
And so if you go
read the articles

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.750
about Meredith Whitney,
they talk about her heels.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.690
I mean, it's just
extraordinarily sexist.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:08.230
She got death threats.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.180
She was hated.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.820
And it's very clear to me
that if Meredith Whitney

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:16.380
had been a stodgy old man and
had made those predictions,

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.450
she would have been
extraordinarily

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:20.250
lauded for getting it.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:21.821
Now, she was lauded.

00:31:21.821 --> 00:31:23.820
I think she was the cover
of "Fortune Magazine."

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.361
She was considered
one of the great--

00:31:25.361 --> 00:31:27.990
and she is one of the great
financial minds of the era.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.250
But she paid a very
heavy price for it.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.270
And if it's not sexism,
I don't know what it is.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:35.640
And this being
the #MeToo moment,

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.180
it's worth understanding
the biases.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.340
This is all about biases,
the biases that go

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.120
into getting that story wrong.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.506
GUY HORGAN: So in
that same vein,

00:31:44.506 --> 00:31:46.380
for those Cassandras
who are listening today,

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.899
what would you recommend they
do to improve their messaging?

00:31:49.899 --> 00:31:51.690
RP EDDY: There are
people who are listening

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.510
to this now who believe they
know a catastrophe that's

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.170
coming.

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:57.570
Now, to be fair, some
of them are just crazy.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.190
We have a website
where people have

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:01.200
been nominating Cassandras.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.170
And we got something like--

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.840
we got a huge number of
nominations last year.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.680
And a good quarter of them were
people nominating themselves

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:14.310
because they saw 9/11 happening.

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:17.640
They weren't data-driven
experts in the field.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.370
Now, if you are a data-driven
expert in the field--

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:22.770
if you look at the Cassandra
Coefficient, the indicators

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.103
of the Cassandra-- if you are
a proven technical expert,

00:32:25.103 --> 00:32:27.570
you are data driven,
and you are effectively

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:31.380
the person that we train,
hire, and trust to warn us

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.140
on that topic, and
you have a warning

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.050
and you're not
being listened to,

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:35.580
you very well could
be a Cassandra.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.350
So what do you do?

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:38.430
It's not easy.

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:39.990
As we've seen example
after example,

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:42.840
trying to get people to
listen to your message,

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.410
there's a number of
different things.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:47.150
And one, get yourself nominated
for the Cassandra award.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:50.980
Two, understand that
your messaging is now

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.710
the second most important part
of your-- part two of your job.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.270
Part one was to get the data.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.190
Part two is to get
the story out there.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.470
You have to effectively
frame your warning

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:01.160
to the decision makers.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.300
Now, as I told, all the previous
Cassandra's believed, look,

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.080
I got the data.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:05.800
I got it right.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.880
It's been peer reviewed.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.320
Of course they'll believe me.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.420
To them, the data
told the story.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.940
The data doesn't
always tell the story.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.860
Harry Markopolos learned
that the hard way.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.080
His data on Madoff did
not tell the story.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.700
His data was inarguable.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.880
I mean, it was impossible
for Madoff not to be a fraud,

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.350
and he proved that numerically.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.570
But the data didn't
tell the story.

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:27.310
Your data will not
tell the story.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:29.110
You need to tell the story.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:31.410
Or if you don't have
a good EQ, if you

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.160
don't have a good
capacity to communicate,

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.470
find someone who does.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:38.170
A Cassandra we talk about in
the end of the book, who's

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:41.680
now giving a warning on climate
change, is Dr. Robert Hansen.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.470
Dr. Robert Hansen is the
person who taught the world

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:45.580
about climate change.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:49.000
Dr. Robert Hansen's science
is absolutely peerless,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.730
peer reviewed, and
extraordinarily accepted.

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:56.170
Robert Hansen, in 2015
or '16, wrote a new paper

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:59.300
that said things are much worse
than we thought they were.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.707
We talk about him in the book.

00:34:00.707 --> 00:34:02.540
He said, climate change
is already horrible.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.500
We already know that.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.770
But it's going to get way worse,
way faster than you believe.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.960
He put a paper out that
wasn't peer reviewed.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.009
He got slammed.

00:34:10.009 --> 00:34:11.550
This is the guy who
proved it before.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.199
Again, a totally noted guy,
put the message out and got

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:14.699
slammed.

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:17.300
He put another paper out
this time, he got slammed,

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.159
until they caught
up with the science.

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:22.100
Took two years, everyone
now says he's right.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.250
Now, Robert Hansen
has been arrested I

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.600
don't want to say the number--

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.710
I think four times.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.570
He chained himself to
the White House fence.

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:30.778
He was a government employee.

00:34:30.778 --> 00:34:33.139
Like, he has done all he can
do to get the message out.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:36.199
Robert Hansen had to
pair with Al Gore.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:39.110
Al Gore is obviously a great
personality, very well known.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:42.290
He paired with Robert Hansen,
and they created "Inconvenient

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:44.179
Truth" and got the story out.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:46.070
So sometimes the
data and the expert

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:47.840
needs to find effectively
a marketing team

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.540
to get the story out.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.540
And we want to do that
with the Cassandra Award.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.889
We want to build the marketing
team in a very light way.

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:57.194
So your data won't
tell the story.

00:34:57.194 --> 00:34:58.610
The other thing
that has to happen

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:01.319
is in the intelligence
community, going all the way

00:35:01.319 --> 00:35:03.860
back to the Pearl Harbor attack,
which was a surprise attack,

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.401
of course, the
intelligence community

00:35:05.401 --> 00:35:08.550
talks about the difference
between smoke and fire.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.842
So when you sit down with a
principal, say a president,

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:12.675
or a secretary defense,
or whatever and say,

00:35:12.675 --> 00:35:14.780
I think something horrible
is going to happen,

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.940
in lots of instances,
the intelligence analyst

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.960
only can point to general
smoke over the horizon.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.320
Again, this is just an analogy.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.437
What they need is fire.

00:35:22.437 --> 00:35:24.770
They need to say, here is
specifically what's happening,

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.270
specifically when
it will happen,

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:28.580
and here's how I can
tell you it will happen.

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:32.620
Now, intelligence analysts
need to adapt a new methodology

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.560
where they continually warn
the decision maker about what's

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.690
going to occur and
show them the things

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.750
that will happen going forward
to prove they're correct.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:45.240
A great expression is, here's
what will happen next week,

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.410
next month, next
year to show you

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.440
that my scenario is correct.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.974
Another expression
to use is, here's

00:35:50.974 --> 00:35:52.640
what could happen to
show you I'm wrong.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.230
If we see this, I'm wrong.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.970
And the final tool,
highly related,

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:59.300
is to create the boundary
conditions around the warning.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.090
If we see anything else happen
in these boundary conditions,

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:03.720
I am also wrong.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:08.900
So going forward in describing
where the smoke will turn

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.830
to fire and how is critical.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:13.730
And then penultimately,
finally, you

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:17.510
need to then direct your
collection to get the fire.

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:18.980
In most instances,
we did not have

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.104
the intelligence we needed.

00:36:20.104 --> 00:36:22.880
9/11 people believe was a
failure to connect the dots.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.690
That's not right.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:27.720
9/11 was a failure to collect
the necessary intelligence

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.515
for that specific attack.

00:36:29.515 --> 00:36:31.390
We knew generically what
was going to happen.

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:33.598
We didn't know specifically
what was going to happen.

00:36:33.598 --> 00:36:35.650
So get more intelligence.

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:40.750
And then finally, you need
to explain these things

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.340
to people in parables.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:46.420
People don't learn from slides.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.556
People don't learn from
numbers, as we said earlier.

00:36:49.556 --> 00:36:50.680
People learn from parables.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.310
GUY HORGAN: From the narrative.

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:52.476
RP EDDY: From the narrative.

00:36:52.476 --> 00:36:54.976
So one tool that we've
used before with clients

00:36:54.976 --> 00:36:57.350
is we can-- there's something
very simple on the internet

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:00.160
you can find where you
can type some text,

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.140
and it looks like a "New
York Times" headline.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.774
And when you rip it,
it looks literally

00:37:04.774 --> 00:37:06.940
like I ripped the front of
the "New York Times" off.

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:10.210
And you put it in from a client,
and it says, "CEO Johnson

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.460
fails to make necessary fix--

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.250
disaster strikes"-- you know,
whatever that narrative is.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:16.210
"President of the
United States fails

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:17.793
to understand
superintelligence risk--

00:37:17.793 --> 00:37:19.060
human species destroyed."

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.020
So find the narrative.

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.019
Put it in front of them.

00:37:21.019 --> 00:37:22.570
Make it a parable about them.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:26.410
And begin to get over
that curve of their biases

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:29.290
and their agenda inertia.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:31.910
These men and women are
running major organizations--

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:33.580
governments or
companies, whatever--

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.290
because they think they're
good at making decisions.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:36.706
Other people believe
they are too.

00:37:36.706 --> 00:37:38.730
It's hard to get them
off their set agenda.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:40.180
So you have to
make it about them.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.650
GUY HORGAN: Wonderful.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:43.300
So I'm also curious
about the project

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.170
that you mentioned
that's happening at MIT.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:47.350
So you guys are
developing great expertise

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:49.060
in chatting with
these Cassandras.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.060
They're being nominated.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.760
You're talking with
them, identifying them,

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.968
and awarding the one that
you think is most relevant.

00:37:53.968 --> 00:37:56.120
But I was wondering about
what they're doing at MIT

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.540
and specifically
regarding the scalability

00:37:58.540 --> 00:37:59.680
of these principles.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.760
Is it possible to take in
many, many possible Cassandras

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.740
and apply this in
a scalable fashion

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.169
so that you can identify
them without necessarily

00:38:08.169 --> 00:38:10.210
going through them with
a fine-tooth comb and all

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:11.842
of these experts?

00:38:11.842 --> 00:38:13.300
RP EDDY: What's
happening at MIT is

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.040
very promising but very small.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.470
And the question there
gets more to what we just

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:18.670
discussed previously.

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:20.740
What's being
studied there is how

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:23.530
to be a predictive
intelligence analyst,

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:26.885
so how to use the Cassandra
Coefficient and other tools,

00:38:26.885 --> 00:38:28.510
how to be able to
look around a corner,

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:30.100
and then how to
effectively frame that.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.683
So the cycle that
we've just discussed

00:38:31.683 --> 00:38:34.785
about moving from smoke to
fire, to effective framing,

00:38:34.785 --> 00:38:36.910
to getting the warning
across to the decision maker

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:40.330
is what was being looked at
there and hopefully still is.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.300
What really needs to also happen
with the Cassandra Coefficient

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:47.870
is the n has to increase.

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:50.830
So we have about eight or
nine examples in our book.

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:52.262
I'd like to see 50 examples.

00:38:52.262 --> 00:38:53.470
I'd like to see them studied.

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:55.350
I'd like to see false
positives studied.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:58.060
And I'd like to increase the
n so we can understand, take

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.420
these 24 Cassandra
Coefficients, characteristics,

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.391
and really build them
out and grade them,

00:39:03.391 --> 00:39:05.140
understand when they
may work or not work.

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.750
And that could get
your question of scale.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.862
But right now, this
is a powerful tool.

00:39:09.862 --> 00:39:10.570
It's a discovery.

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:14.630
I truly believe Dick and I
discovered something important.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:17.010
It was out there the whole
time staring us in the face.

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:19.030
There's an expression called
the invisible obvious.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.050
When you find it,
you go, my god,

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:21.341
I can't believe we missed that.

00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:23.320
I can't believe we've
missed this for so long.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.710
I can't believe that
these data-driven, highly

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:29.700
credentialed experts time
and time again get ignored.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.350
And by the way, it
continues to happen.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:36.470
So today, and on the
slides we used today,

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:39.084
these are disasters that
happened up till 2011

00:39:39.084 --> 00:39:40.000
might be the last one.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.350
The Grenfell Tower fire
in London, a recent train

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:47.200
crash in the Northwest of the
United States, all of these

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.690
had specific warnings
that they were

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:52.600
going to occur by credentialed
experts and were still ignored.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.540
So we just have to
get better at this.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.040
GUY HORGAN: Changing
gears slightly,

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.550
I do want to get into some
topical questions for you.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.510
But before we do, I was
wondering, for those of us

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.630
listening, I was
wondering if there

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:06.040
is a way that you
can take these ideas

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.930
and apply them to
your personal life.

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:11.680
Is there sort of the
Cassandra warnings

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:16.690
for one's personal work life,
financial life, love life,

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:18.130
whatever it might be?

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:20.940
Can you apply them in the micro?

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.940
RP EDDY: I think there's
a couple of things that

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.490
are worth understanding here.

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:29.906
As a very macro thought, we all
have to first just acknowledge

00:40:29.906 --> 00:40:31.030
two things about ourselves.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:33.170
The first one is, most of
us know the right thing

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:35.040
to do, most of the time.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.094
And it doesn't mean
we always do it.

00:40:37.094 --> 00:40:39.010
That's a self-discipline
issue, and that's not

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:41.710
the focus of this conversation.

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.560
The second thing we have to
know about ourselves is we

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.650
are, unfortunately,
largely just bags of meat

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:49.760
driven by biases and heuristics.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:54.099
So if you go back and
understand from whence we came,

00:40:54.099 --> 00:40:56.140
you have to understand
that this brain was formed

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.310
300,000 years ago then
140,000 years ago,

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:00.560
and it wasn't designed for
the world in which we live.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.740
It was designed for
groups of 140 people.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.120
Go read "Sapiens" by Harari.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.590
He describes this perfectly.

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:08.620
That's what you walk around
with all day between your ears.

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.720
And the decisions that
you constantly are making

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.905
are driven first by
your monkey brain.

00:41:12.905 --> 00:41:14.530
And then it takes a
long time to get up

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:19.900
to your more evolved brains
and let impulse not lead

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.060
automatically to your response.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.700
The Cassandra
Coefficient acknowledges

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.280
that decision makers
have monkey brains.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.370
All of us have monkey brains and
listen to them far too often.

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.040
And we as individuals
should realize that too.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.050
So I think inside--

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:37.870
I'll give you a great
example, a financial example.

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:42.400
Now, 99.9% of investors
in this country

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.640
should never buy anything
other than an index ETF fund.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.650
This is proven by
every source of math

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:49.770
you could possibly imagine.

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:51.610
99% of us should
never buy anything

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:53.409
but an ETF, an index fund.

00:41:53.409 --> 00:41:55.450
Yet, that's not the way
we behave with our money.

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:57.200
That's not the way I
behave with my money.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.930
I believe-- and it's called
magical thinking-- that I

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:01.180
have a view others don't have.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.554
I know something
they don't know.

00:42:02.554 --> 00:42:05.450
I can go buy or sell this stock,
and it's the right thing to do.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:06.960
That's foolish.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.970
The quantified experts and the
data tell us something simple.

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:12.020
We need to follow it.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.311
I'll give you another example,
highly related-- lottery

00:42:14.311 --> 00:42:15.480
tickets.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.105
GUY HORGAN: It's not
a good investment.

00:42:17.105 --> 00:42:18.880
RP EDDY: It's not as
good as you'd think.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.540
Statistically, no one
wins the lottery, ever.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.360
Yet, the amount of money
put into the US lottery

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.160
is unfathomable.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.770
And it's put in by the people
least able to afford it.

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:33.010
By the way, lotteries are
a taxation on stupidity,

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:34.630
and they are a
social injustice put

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:37.225
upon the poorest of our
class by our governments.

00:42:37.225 --> 00:42:39.390
And they are an evil.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.260
Another example
of where you just

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.600
have to listen to the experts.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.290
So are there experts
in our fields

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:45.560
who we have to listen to?

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:46.060
Yes.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.601
Will that help on a micro level?

00:42:47.601 --> 00:42:48.100
Sure.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.501
GUY HORGAN: For some.

00:42:49.501 --> 00:42:51.280
If we could dial things
back for a moment,

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.306
I'm curious about
your company, Ergo,

00:42:53.306 --> 00:42:54.680
and how you got
your start there.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.380
How did that company start?

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.377
How did you transition from the
public to the private sector?

00:42:59.377 --> 00:43:01.210
RP EDDY: I've just been
really, really lucky

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.100
to have great colleagues
and bosses all the way

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:03.725
along the line.

00:43:03.725 --> 00:43:05.309
Dick was really one
of my first bosses

00:43:05.309 --> 00:43:06.974
and has been
extraordinarily influential

00:43:06.974 --> 00:43:08.410
in my life, all
the way to today.

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:09.730
He's godfather of
our third child.

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:11.104
He was a groomsman
at my wedding.

00:43:11.104 --> 00:43:14.020
And I wouldn't be
anything of who

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.240
I am if it weren't for all
of his time and influence

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.270
and love, and I can't
thank him enough.

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.320
And after I left
government, I got

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.320
to work at some great
organizations, the Monitor

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:26.500
Group with Mark Fuller, Gerson
Lehrman Group with Mark Gerson

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:27.832
and Alexander Saint-Amand.

00:43:27.832 --> 00:43:29.290
And then from Gerson
Lehrman Group,

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.460
I created Ergo with my
partners Matthew Moneyhon

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.800
and Evan Pressman.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.690
And Ergo is now 14 years old.

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:38.200
And we came out
of-- it really is

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.670
a reflection of where we came.

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:42.700
It's a reflection of diplomacy
and intelligence and research.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.470
And that's what Ergo
does, and that's

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:46.850
where my partners
come from as well.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:49.290
And it's been a huge joy.

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:51.517
And what we do at
Ergo is part of what

00:43:51.517 --> 00:43:52.600
we're talking about today.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.650
We try to give people frameworks
to understand the future.

00:43:56.650 --> 00:43:59.020
Now, this is a framework
to understand catastrophes.

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.880
This framework works
on other things too.

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.950
But there's only a
few proven frameworks

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:05.050
about how to look
around corners--

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:09.490
scenario planning, virtual
markets, Cassandra theory.

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:12.101
So we try to bring those
frameworks to our clients.

00:44:12.101 --> 00:44:13.600
And we're a little
different in that

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:18.790
we infuse our analysis almost
entirely with on the ground

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:20.030
intelligence.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:23.740
So we've paid 36,000 people
for information in 14 years,

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.200
all around the world,
people from shop floors

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.480
to truck drivers to people
in and around cabinets

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.920
and parliaments and kings.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.570
And we collect
that intelligence,

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.500
put it into frameworks--

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.320
this is a big
difference, frameworks--

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.882
and then try to help our
clients see what's happening.

00:44:37.882 --> 00:44:39.340
GUY HORGAN: So in
a few interviews,

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.740
I've heard you
described as a spy.

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.305
RP EDDY: [LAUGHS] I'm not a spy.

00:44:44.305 --> 00:44:46.180
GUY HORGAN: Well, that's
what you always say.

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:46.980
RP EDDY: Cut.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:51.356
GUY HORGAN: But I'm
curious, you can only

00:44:51.356 --> 00:44:53.230
speak in generalities,
I'm sure, but for some

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:55.019
of the clients, who
are some clients,

00:44:55.019 --> 00:44:57.310
or what projects have you
done for clients that they're

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:58.310
particularly happy with?

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.950
What have you come and
discovered and shared?

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:04.630
RP EDDY: So what's worth noting
is, what does the CIA actually

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:05.777
do?

00:45:05.777 --> 00:45:08.110
Now, we believe it's-- well,
we saw the James Bond films

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:09.310
and saw the Jason Bourne films.

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:10.810
That must be something
like they do.

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.330
That's not what they do.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:15.370
CIA, half the house is a
group of really, really

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:17.607
smart analysts who
have, obviously,

00:45:17.607 --> 00:45:19.690
access to an extraordinary
amount of intelligence.

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:22.330
They do analysis, and they try
to give warnings and insights

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:23.844
to the executive branch.

00:45:23.844 --> 00:45:25.510
And then what's the
State Department do?

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:27.176
Well, that's a little
better understood.

00:45:27.176 --> 00:45:29.950
The State Department is a series
of ambassadors and on down

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:32.820
who represent the United
States to foreign governments.

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:35.980
Ideally, Ergo has
aspects of both,

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.230
where we help companies
and governments represent

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:40.129
themselves and operate
in foreign areas

00:45:40.129 --> 00:45:42.420
and in the United States and
give them the intelligence

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:43.200
to do so.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.040
Now, is that a spy?

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.780
No, it's not.

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:50.280
Examples that I'm proud of,
we have some great examples

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.589
of helping the US
government defeat IEDs

00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:53.880
that were killing our soldiers.

00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:57.870
There was a great
organization called

00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:02.510
JIEDDO, the Joint IED
Defense Defeat Organization,

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:03.262
out of the US DoD.

00:46:03.262 --> 00:46:05.220
It's a really cool example
of the US government

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.477
getting its act together,
realizing there's a threat,

00:46:07.477 --> 00:46:09.060
and putting a huge
amount of resources

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:12.030
at it very quickly and kind
of getting around bureaucracy.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:13.704
While working with
JIEDDO, we're very

00:46:13.704 --> 00:46:15.120
proud for some of
the work we were

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.080
able to do to help stop some
of the most potent IEDs who

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.500
were killing our soldiers in
Iraq as well as in Afghanistan.

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.020
So that gives us huge pride.

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:28.560
On a corporate side, we've had
a lot of work helping people not

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:31.481
get involved with frauds.

00:46:31.481 --> 00:46:32.730
I'll give you a quick example.

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.188
A very, very large
investment house

00:46:34.188 --> 00:46:38.490
wanted to start a whole new
fund in a non-American country,

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:41.400
and they were going to build
it around a particular team

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.050
and a team that had
an extraordinarily

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:44.430
positive reputation.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:45.660
They hired us due diligence.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.540
It's a core aspect of our
business is diligence.

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:53.190
And our diligence came back
and said, yes, by every report,

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:55.317
these people are
extraordinary and influential.

00:46:55.317 --> 00:46:57.150
The problem is we've
discovered that they're

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:59.310
under investigation
for corruption.

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:00.060
They know it.

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.080
They're lying to you.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.100
It's not public record.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.240
We were able to unearth it.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.490
So we saved that company,
by their estimates,

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:08.170
a billion dollars of
embarrassment and cost

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:09.420
by going into that enterprise.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:11.129
Because the allegations
of corruption

00:47:11.129 --> 00:47:12.420
would eventually have come out.

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.860
And there's numerous
stories like that.

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:20.200
But effectively
helping people create--

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.620
in a world of opacity, we
try to create transparency.

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:25.500
And it's no different than
what a Google search does,

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:28.797
in many instances, but just
much bigger and more specific.

00:47:28.797 --> 00:47:30.630
GUY HORGAN: I was hoping
we could transition

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:33.270
to start talking about a few
things that are going on today.

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:34.860
You mentioned North
Korea, and it's something

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:36.818
that I think everybody
here is concerned about.

00:47:36.818 --> 00:47:39.000
And I wonder if we're
almost past the point

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.820
of needing a Cassandra
here, because it's

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:42.840
a great fear by many.

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.250
So I'll ask you that.

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:49.160
And then number two, I'm
curious about the solution.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.430
So Cassandras have
alerted us to this.

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:52.680
People are worried.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.239
What is there to be done?

00:47:54.239 --> 00:47:55.030
RP EDDY: All right.

00:47:55.030 --> 00:48:01.320
So first, Alan Robock who
is just-- the human race

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:05.310
should be very thankful to
have Alan Robock amongst us.

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:08.370
And his organization, as I said,
won a Nobel Prize last year,

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:10.350
so he's not going unnoticed.

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:13.494
But Alan's work on
global nuclear winter

00:48:13.494 --> 00:48:14.910
is a warning we
have to listen to.

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:17.342
So that warning
hasn't been heard.

00:48:17.342 --> 00:48:19.800
We were talking earlier about
the amount of nuclear weapons

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.474
that would likely be exchanged
if we had a nuclear war that.

00:48:22.474 --> 00:48:24.390
GUY HORGAN: You said 30
is the starting point.

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:26.700
RP EDDY: I think 30's
your starting point.

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.560
So if you think about
this series of targets

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.020
that we would have
to hit in North Korea

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.460
to have some degree
of confidence

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:36.720
that Seoul isn't turned into
an inferno or Tokyo or Guam,

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.976
or even California or even
DC, depending on where

00:48:38.976 --> 00:48:41.100
North Korea is in it's
nuclear weapons development,

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.360
it's a large number of targets.

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.130
GUY HORGAN: And you're saying
that those 30 strikes would

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:45.030
need to happen quickly, then?

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.320
So the artillery can't be--

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.445
RP EDDY: It'd have to happen
almost simultaneously.

00:48:47.445 --> 00:48:49.560
It very much depends on
what your theory of war

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.740
is in this instance.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.740
But the one that seems
to make most sense to me,

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:55.073
and I think most sense to our
nuclear weapons planners--

00:48:55.073 --> 00:48:58.410
I can't say with huge
confidence-- is 30 at once.

00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:00.650
If we're going to do it,
we're going to do it.

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:02.310
This isn't Hiroshima
or Nagasaki where

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.020
we unveil the power of the sun--
have you ever seen it before,

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.720
which is almost
a mystical thing.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:12.240
This is a tactical strike to
take out military capacities.

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.460
So you're looking at
probably 30 minimum.

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.594
Now, do we need a
warning about that?

00:49:16.594 --> 00:49:17.760
We're separating two things.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.968
Do we need a warning about
our risk with North Korea?

00:49:19.968 --> 00:49:20.550
Maybe not.

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:21.730
I want to talk about it.

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:23.700
Do we need a warning
about nuclear winter?

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.577
Absolutely.

00:49:24.577 --> 00:49:26.160
All right, so we've
made that warning.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.130
Now, what's going
on with North Korea?

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:32.390
As we sit here today, I think
we have a general sense of ease.

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:33.450
Ah, we had the Olympics.

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:35.130
It all went well.

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:39.180
We're beginning to believe
that the North Koreans are just

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.740
like we are.

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:43.040
Don't the Russians love
their children too,

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.257
as Sting and Police at one point
in the middle of the Cold War?

00:49:46.257 --> 00:49:47.340
And we said, yes, they do.

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:48.923
And look, it all
worked out just fine.

00:49:48.923 --> 00:49:52.740
Well, the great gobbledygook
machine of Washington DC,

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:56.060
which my view is actually
Colonel Mike Sheehan's view,

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.590
Ambassador Mike Sheehan's view,
is sort of how policy really

00:49:58.590 --> 00:49:59.490
gets formed in DC.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:01.050
The State Department and
Brookings and Heritage

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:02.490
and all these guys
kind of have a view,

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:03.680
and they sort of say, ah.

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.630
So the gobbledygook machine
view of North Korea for decades

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:09.030
has been, they are rational.

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.737
Don't worry.

00:50:09.737 --> 00:50:11.070
They don't want to nuke anybody.

00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:12.090
They don't want to get nuked.

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:13.980
They know that they're
massively overpowered.

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:15.530
We got this one.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:17.100
We will negotiate
our way out of it.

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:19.730
That is the standard view.

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:21.470
I hope it's right.

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:23.430
I don't have much
evidence that it is.

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:26.000
There is some recent
evidence, and only recent,

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.180
by the third Kim that
they will be responsible

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:32.090
nuclear weapons actors, because
they said they would be.

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:35.780
If you look at the proliferation
of Israel, India, Pakistan,

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:39.110
even South Africa, and Brazil,
when they are pursuing weapons

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:42.290
programs, they all were very
clear to transmit to us,

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.830
don't worry.

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:45.030
We're not crazy.

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:47.000
We will handle these
weapons responsibly.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.434
North Korea said the opposite
for three generations,

00:50:50.434 --> 00:50:52.350
three decades, however
you want to look at it.

00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:53.766
They've said, when
we get weapons,

00:50:53.766 --> 00:50:55.370
we're going to turn
Seoul into fire.

00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:57.050
We're going to unify the
peninsula under our rule.

00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:58.730
They've said very
aggressive things.

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:03.590
Now, we want to
believe normalcy bias--

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:05.360
confirmation bias
or normalcy bias.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.840
We want to believe that there
are going to be well-behaved.

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.360
It just makes me feel good.

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:10.610
I don't have the evidence yet.

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:11.901
As I said, we've seen a little.

00:51:15.525 --> 00:51:17.650
The Trump Administration
is now grappling with this

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:20.620
and trying to understand
the question themselves.

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:23.132
North Korea has just offered
to have a negotiation with us.

00:51:23.132 --> 00:51:24.590
Everyone thinks
this is great news.

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:25.892
It's not bad news.

00:51:25.892 --> 00:51:27.850
What North Korea is very
likely doing right now

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:30.190
is trying to get the
technological advance

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:33.190
to have the ICBM move
and deliver a payload.

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:36.892
Right now, the ICBM moves
in the proper radius.

00:51:36.892 --> 00:51:39.100
But they have yet to prove
that they can successfully

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.590
deliver a payload.

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:44.819
When they prove that, which
is another technological feat,

00:51:44.819 --> 00:51:47.110
they will have the entire
set of cards in front of them

00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:49.782
that they need to negotiate,
if they want to negotiate.

00:51:49.782 --> 00:51:52.240
GUY HORGAN: So you're saying
you believe that it's possible

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:55.150
that North Korea is delaying
such that they can miniaturize

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:56.970
the payload so it
can be delivered,

00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:58.720
so that they're more
powerful negotiators?

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.330
RP EDDY: I would bet
you dollars to donuts

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:03.400
they are delaying as
long as they can to get

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.940
that final re-entry proved.

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:08.140
Why not?

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.599
Now, there is good news.

00:52:09.599 --> 00:52:11.890
There are a series of things
inside the nuclear weapons

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:14.980
complex of North Korea that may
have been built just to trade.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:18.910
Let's see.

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:20.909
Now, there have been
countries that have turned.

00:52:20.909 --> 00:52:24.094
I mean, I mentioned South
Africa changed of goodwill.

00:52:24.094 --> 00:52:25.510
They were under
sanctions as well,

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:27.310
but they got out of apartheid.

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:30.930
Burma has had an extraordinary
change out of sanctions.

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:33.850
They change to a
transparent country.

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.820
Maybe North Korea will too.

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:37.571
It has happened
before, and let's just

00:52:37.571 --> 00:52:39.070
hope it does in
this instance, or we

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:41.140
are in for a very,
very difficult puzzle.

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:42.600
North Korean
puzzle's a hard one.

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.183
GUY HORGAN: So the
Cassandras that you

00:52:44.183 --> 00:52:46.740
listen to on this subject, what
do they say about the future?

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:48.330
We agree it's a problem.

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.710
We agree it's a
potential catastrophe.

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:52.284
Is there a solution?

00:52:52.284 --> 00:52:53.950
RP EDDY: There is
absolutely a solution.

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:56.230
If North Korea decides-- look,
we have something they want.

00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:57.396
They have something we want.

00:52:57.396 --> 00:52:59.560
There's a negotiation to be had.

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.639
They want their children--
the leaders in North Korea,

00:53:02.639 --> 00:53:04.180
and there's probably
about 150 people

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.910
who matter in that country right
now, as far as decision making.

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:09.820
The leaders in North Korea,
like any good parent anywhere,

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:12.040
probably wants their kids
to work at Google someday.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.706
They probably want their kids to
play in the Stanford basketball

00:53:14.706 --> 00:53:18.430
team or the University
of Illinois soccer team.

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:20.710
Why not be part of this dream?

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:23.650
And right now, of course, North
Korea can have none of that.

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:25.090
They want to be
part of commerce.

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:26.110
They want debt.

00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:28.840
They have massive oil reserves
offshore they want developed.

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.700
They want to be wealthy.

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.239
We can give that to them.

00:53:32.239 --> 00:53:33.780
But we're not going
give that to them

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:34.860
till they give us
what we want, which

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.240
is that they denuclearize.

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:38.877
Now, there's a
number of outcomes.

00:53:38.877 --> 00:53:39.960
There's one I'm afraid of.

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.030
One outcome I'm
not excited about

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:44.490
would be if North Korea
and America strike

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:47.460
a deal that says, we're
going to keep our nukes.

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:49.470
We're going to keep our
short range missiles,

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:51.210
but we'll give up the ICBMs.

00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:54.130
So you, America, can sleep
soundly in your beds,

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:57.600
while Seoul and Tokyo
rip their hair out.

00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.060
That is one possible
negotiated outcome.

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:03.720
If this administration, or any
administration negotiates that,

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.360
it would be the absolute
end of Pax Americana,

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:09.510
of the American promise to be a
global leader in good standing.

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:12.780
It would be the end of that if
we left our allies high and dry

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:13.320
like that.

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.630
But it's going to be very
tempting, particularly

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.600
to people who don't understand
the cost of destroying

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:20.100
Pax Americana.

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:23.370
Another outcome would be
total denuclearization.

00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:25.415
That would be a dream scenario.

00:54:25.415 --> 00:54:27.540
We would have to give them
a series of guarantees--

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.550
not only let them back into
the world as I described.

00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:32.133
We'd have to probably guarantee
their security to some extent.

00:54:32.133 --> 00:54:34.594
We'd have to stop military
exercises, et cetera.

00:54:34.594 --> 00:54:36.260
Look, that would be
great for everybody.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.218
It'd be great for them.

00:54:37.218 --> 00:54:38.220
It'd be great for us.

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.761
The only people who almost lose
a little bit in that scenario

00:54:40.761 --> 00:54:43.140
is China, because
they no longer have

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.530
North Korea to keep us busy.

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:46.530
And they've got, all of
a sudden, a country that

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.870
could potentially be our
ally sitting on their border.

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:50.578
They may not want
things to go that well.

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:54.390
GUY HORGAN: Mr.
Bolton, John Bolton,

00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:56.700
has started in the White House.

00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:59.814
And of all the many
scary things that

00:54:59.814 --> 00:55:01.230
have happened in
the past year, it

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:05.394
seems like the tenor of people
positing fears about him

00:55:05.394 --> 00:55:07.560
have been a little bit
different, that this is truly

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:08.226
something scary.

00:55:08.226 --> 00:55:11.450
And it's almost like people--

00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:14.120
that his hawkish history
could be something different.

00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.620
Combining that with other people
leaving the White House who

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:19.200
are generally supposed
to be moderating forces

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:22.030
and the possibility of the
Mueller investigation coming

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:25.680
to a head, and Trump now
truly needing a distraction,

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:29.940
I'm wondering if you have any
fears about their deciding

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:33.090
together with John Bolton
encouraging what he seems

00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:34.920
to have always
encouraged and Trump

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.810
wanting to divert
attention from what

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:38.580
might be coming down on him.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:41.310
Might that be a
combination of things

00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:43.260
that would be a perfect
storm for us to have

00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:45.510
a preemptive strike
and eliminate

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:48.680
the possibility of even having
a negotiated disarmament?

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:53.040
RP EDDY: So Guy, I wish I could
give you a lot of confidence

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.910
that that's not
likely or possible.

00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:56.130
I just don't know.

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:59.550
You know, it's a reasonable
Cassandra warning.

00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:02.520
But let me offer you a
slightly different view

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:07.640
of the Bolton presence as our
national security advisor.

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.560
First of all, we're all
very mimetic animals.

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:14.030
So when the press shows
us a series of quotes

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:16.610
from John Bolton about
destroying 10 floors of the UN,

00:56:16.610 --> 00:56:19.220
or how every other
nation is just

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.610
a satellite that orbits
around our sun, et cetera,

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:26.130
or how he's talked about a
preemptive strike on North

00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:28.650
Korea, et cetera, we could
walk out of the Iran deal,

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:32.190
it's very easy to
get very concerned,

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:34.710
particularly married with some
of the belligerent language

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:37.680
we've seen from the president.

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:38.850
I'm not sure that's wrong.

00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:40.530
But I have a slightly
different view.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:45.600
My view is where we were headed
before Bolton was scarier.

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.520
So Rex Tillerson is gone.

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.710
HR McMaster is gone.

00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:54.770
Madison, Kelly are still
around, but a huge number

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:56.780
of people who were
given to Trump,

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:59.780
foisted on Trump, selected
by Trump, have left.

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:01.970
And what we're
beginning to see--

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:05.510
and I think this was no surprise
to us four months ago when we

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:08.010
began talking about this with
our clients, five months ago--

00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:11.000
we're seeing Trump begin
to get very comfortable

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.520
in his presidency
and believe that he's

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.780
able to make these
decisions on his own.

00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:20.570
So I call it TOHO,
T-O-H-O, Trump On His Own.

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:23.240
And I think any
president on his own,

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:25.490
any president making complex
decisions on his own,

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:27.170
is bad news.

00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:30.830
I think a president who doesn't
have the depth of experience

00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:33.290
or lacks experience
as this president does

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:34.770
is doubly bad news.

00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:37.070
So what I want to not
see more than anything

00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:38.940
is I don't want to
see Trump on his own.

00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:40.580
I don't want TOHO.

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:43.790
I want smart, wise counsel
around every president,

00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:45.560
particularly this one.

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:49.580
John Bolton and I have probably
wildly different opinions

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.140
on how to exercise
American power,

00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:52.650
but we want the same thing.

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:54.320
We believe in American
exceptionalism.

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.520
We believe America has either
a right or an obligation,

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:02.600
however you want to call
it, as the preeminent power.

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.900
I tend to believe more that
Pax Americana, living up

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.900
to the system of treaties we
wrote, being a positive ally,

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:11.490
being there when people believe
we'll be there, even if it's

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:14.660
a little late, is the way
America has power and benefits

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:15.950
us around the world.

00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:18.200
I think his view is less
interested in alliances

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.970
and more interested
in military force.

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:21.970
That's bad, as far
as I'm concerned.

00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:25.520
What's good is that he is part
of the mainstream conversation.

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.310
John Bolton is not Steve Bannon.

00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:29.690
I look at Steve
Bannon as the guy

00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:31.550
who wanted to tear
down the temple

00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:34.760
and had an extraordinary,
really outside the mainstream

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:35.870
point of view of things.

00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:36.980
John Bolton is not there.

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:40.460
He's way to the end, but
he's still in the mainstream.

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:44.240
He's been an
undersecretary of defense.

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:47.000
He's been a real member of the
foreign policy establishment

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:47.910
for a long time.

00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:48.960
He knows how it works.

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.420
He knows the value of
the civil servants.

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:52.100
He knows the value
of the flag officers.

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:53.600
He knows the value
of the diplomats.

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:56.280
He knows how you can extract
value from alliances.

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.520
So I'm hoping when he
sees a really crazy idea,

00:58:58.520 --> 00:58:59.130
he'll know it.

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:00.831
The second thing
about John Bolton,

00:59:00.831 --> 00:59:03.080
he's got a really strong
personality and a really loud

00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:03.830
voice.

00:59:03.830 --> 00:59:08.360
So Trump on his own maybe will
get mitigated by John Bolton

00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:09.900
because he will be in the room.

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:11.340
He won't be ignored.

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:15.050
And Trump can't
toss him out like he

00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:16.460
tossed other people out.

00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:18.380
He can't toss him out
for being a globalist.

00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:19.260
He certainly isn't.

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:21.510
He can't toss him out for
being more liberal than him.

00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:22.370
He certainly isn't.

00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:23.995
He can't toss him
out for being stupid.

00:59:23.995 --> 00:59:24.590
He isn't.

00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:28.700
So I don't think we're
going to see Trump ignoring

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.414
Bolton for very long.

00:59:30.414 --> 00:59:31.580
We'll see how long it lasts.

00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:33.580
So what that means is
Trump won't be on his own.

00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:37.270
At least he'll have Bolton
joining Madison, Kelly,

00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:39.280
giving him what we hope
is wise counsel, which

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.940
every president needs.

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:44.100
GUY HORGAN: Final
question for you.

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:45.934
This is not just a book,
but it's a movement

00:59:45.934 --> 00:59:47.016
that you're starting here.

00:59:47.016 --> 00:59:48.930
You have the awards
that you're giving out

00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:51.637
for Cassandras that you identify
as some of the most credible.

00:59:51.637 --> 00:59:53.970
But you have another one
called the White House National

00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:56.345
Warning Office that you and
Richard Clarke are proposing.

00:59:56.345 --> 00:59:58.844
So I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about that

00:59:58.844 --> 01:00:00.704
and what your vision for it is.

01:00:00.704 --> 01:00:01.870
RP EDDY: Good question, Guy.

01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:03.280
Thanks for asking about that.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:07.890
So look, I mean, I truly believe
that Dick and I found something

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:10.150
that previously existed,
was these Cassandras,

01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:11.983
there are people out
there who are giving us

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:12.964
warnings of disasters.

01:00:12.964 --> 01:00:14.130
We know what they look like.

01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:16.380
We know how to separate the
Cassandra from the Chicken

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.730
Little, and we need to do that.

01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:19.910
We have to institutionalize
this process.

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:21.540
So the Cassandra
Award is one step.

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.820
The other one is a
National Warning Office

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.830
at the White House, inside
the Executive Office

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:26.670
of the President.

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:27.952
It needn't be a bureaucracy.

01:00:27.952 --> 01:00:29.910
I'm not talking about a
large number of people.

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:32.201
I'm probably talking about
a half a dozen men and women

01:00:32.201 --> 01:00:35.070
who work within the EOP, so they
have an imprimatur of the White

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:38.430
House, and now get to work
across the interagency,

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:41.370
training people on Cassandra
theory and other theories,

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:44.820
looking for warnings, and
trying to give voice to warnings

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.260
that haven't been heard before.

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.410
It would be an extraordinarily
wise thing to do.

01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:52.380
We no longer have the
National Intelligence Officer

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:55.350
for Warning, the job
that Charlie Allen had

01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:57.780
where he foresaw Saddam's
invasion of Kuwait.

01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:59.130
That job's gone.

01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:00.760
We don't have that job anymore.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.810
We need an institution
inside government

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:08.020
that's cross-cutting and is able
to see the forest for the trees

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.200
and can find warnings
before others do.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.152
This organization could
create conferences,

01:01:12.152 --> 01:01:14.610
could create allies, could work
throughout the interagency,

01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:15.960
could task intelligence.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.360
It could take warnings,
put them through something

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.360
like a Cassandra Coefficient
or other even better models--

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.520
I don't care what it is,
no pride of authorship--

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.000
and see if those warnings
deserve more attention or not.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.650
Why not build
something like this?

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:35.845
Why not find a tool to
give voice to the warnings

01:01:35.845 --> 01:01:37.720
that we've been ignoring
time and time again?

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.780
It would cost
effectively nothing,

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.680
and the outcome could
be extraordinary.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.105
Think about the return I
mentioned on Fukushima.

01:01:44.105 --> 01:01:46.080
$50 million would have
saved $100 billion,

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.600
$50 million, $100 billion--

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.280
2,000 time return.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.760
A little bit of effort
to listen to the warnings

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.960
could serve us dramatically.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.670
GUY HORGAN: I look
forward to it.

01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:57.350
RP EDDY: You can
be the head of it.

01:01:57.350 --> 01:01:58.516
GUY HORGAN: I appreciate it.

01:01:58.516 --> 01:01:59.990
I'll look forward to joining.

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:02.275
"Warnings-- Finding Cassandras
to Stop Catastrophes."

01:02:02.275 --> 01:02:03.900
Thank you so much
for coming to Google.

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:04.580
RP EDDY: Thanks very much, Guy.

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:05.330
Great to be here.

01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:08.680
