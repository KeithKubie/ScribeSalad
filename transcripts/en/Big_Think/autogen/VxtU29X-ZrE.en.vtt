you know it is Moore's law at one point

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610
you know it is Moore's law at one point
 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.200
you know it is Moore's law at one point
eight improvements of times improvement

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210

for every two years i think is about

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219
for every two years i think is about
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.369
for every two years i think is about
what the rate is and we've we used to

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379
what the rate is and we've we used to
 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.529
what the rate is and we've we used to
fill up an entire entire room with

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539
fill up an entire entire room with
 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.890
fill up an entire entire room with
what's now in your pocket so there's

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900
what's now in your pocket so there's
 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.410
what's now in your pocket so there's
been just remarkable ability to to

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420
been just remarkable ability to to
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.759
been just remarkable ability to to
crunch data and of course the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
crunch data and of course the
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.439
crunch data and of course the
interconnectivity that's been created

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
interconnectivity that's been created
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.910
interconnectivity that's been created
because of the internet all of these

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920
because of the internet all of these
 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.099
because of the internet all of these
things are converging and it creates

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109
things are converging and it creates
 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.680
things are converging and it creates
just massive paradigm shifts and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
just massive paradigm shifts and
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.330
just massive paradigm shifts and
capabilities that heretofore didn't

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340
capabilities that heretofore didn't
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.910
capabilities that heretofore didn't
exist but on the point of bottlenecks

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
exist but on the point of bottlenecks
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.229
exist but on the point of bottlenecks
and I think this is one of the things

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239
and I think this is one of the things
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.360
and I think this is one of the things
that people need to understand generally

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370
that people need to understand generally
 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.760
that people need to understand generally
is that that regulation creates massive

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
is that that regulation creates massive
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.290
is that that regulation creates massive
bottlenecks there's you know several

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300
bottlenecks there's you know several
 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.299
bottlenecks there's you know several
areas obviously financial markets

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309
areas obviously financial markets

capital markets are highly regularly
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.900
capital markets are highly regularly
regulated and one of the things that I

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
regulated and one of the things that I
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.810
regulated and one of the things that I
am very passionate about is getting

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820
am very passionate about is getting
 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.680
am very passionate about is getting
capital into the hands of entrepreneurs

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
capital into the hands of entrepreneurs
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.200
capital into the hands of entrepreneurs
because I believe that if you you have

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210
because I believe that if you you have
 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.080
because I believe that if you you have
to fund scientists and engineers and put

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090
to fund scientists and engineers and put
 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.209
to fund scientists and engineers and put
entrepreneurship together with capital

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219
entrepreneurship together with capital
 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.240

in order to solve the major problems the
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.890
in order to solve the major problems the
next generation and those are things

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
next generation and those are things
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.500
next generation and those are things
like global warming renewable energy

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510
like global warming renewable energy
 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.410

these things are tough problems and they

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
these things are tough problems and they
 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.179
these things are tough problems and they
have to be financed and one of the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
have to be financed and one of the
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.940
have to be financed and one of the
things that has occurred is that because

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950
things that has occurred is that because
 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.100
things that has occurred is that because
of major shifts in regulation over the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
of major shifts in regulation over the
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.410
of major shifts in regulation over the
