00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.053
You and your friend Jeremy are fishing in a

00:00:03.053 --> 00:00:06.164
pond that contains ten trout and ten sunfish.

00:00:06.568 --> 00:00:09.505
Each time one of you catches a fish

00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:11.568
you release it back into the water.

00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:14.928
Jeremy offers you the choice of two different bets.

00:00:15.193 --> 00:00:18.786
Bet number one. We don't encourage

00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:20.927
betting but I guess Jeremy wants to bet.

00:00:20.927 --> 00:00:25.477
If the next three fish he catches are all sunfish you will

00:00:25.477 --> 00:00:30.044
pay him 100 dollars, otherwise he will pay you 20 dollars.

00:00:30.334 --> 00:00:34.693
Bet two, if you catch at least two sunfish of the next

00:00:34.693 --> 00:00:39.959
three fish that you catch he will pay you 50 dollars,

00:00:40.177 --> 00:00:44.647
otherwise you will pay him 25 dollars.

00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:50.243
What is the expected value from bet one?

00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:52.915
Round your answer to the nearest cent.

00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:54.146
I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:54.146 --> 00:00:55.824
and try to think about it on your own.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.458
Let's see. The expected value of bet one.

00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:06.255
The expected value of bet one where we'll say bet one is --

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:08.772
Let's just define a random variable here

00:01:08.772 --> 00:01:10.646
just to be a little bit better about this.

00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:18.086
Let's say x is equal what you pay, or I guess

00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:19.601
you could say , because you might get something,

00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:28.023
what your profit is from bet one.

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:31.391
It's a random variable.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:39.502
The expected value of x is going to be equal to, let's see.

00:01:39.502 --> 00:01:44.688
What's the probability, it's going to be negative 100

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:48.750
dollars times the probability that he catches three fish.

00:01:49.187 --> 00:01:58.281
The probably that Jeremy catches three sunfish,

00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:02.718
the next three fish he catches are

00:02:02.718 --> 00:02:05.969
going to be sunfish, times 100 dollars.

00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:09.083
Or I should, well you're going to pay that.

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:11.647
Since you're paying it we'll put it as negative 100

00:02:11.647 --> 00:02:13.832
because we're saying that this is your expected profit,

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:15.319
so you're going to lose money there.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.501
That's going to be one minus this probability,

00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:27.541
the probability that Jeremy catches three sunfish.

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:32.082
In that situation he'll pay you 20 dollars.

00:02:32.287 --> 00:02:34.002
You get 20 dollars there.

00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:35.941
The important thing is to figure out the

00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:38.613
probability that Jeremy catches three sunfish.

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.768
Well the sunfish are 10 out of the 20 fish so any given

00:02:43.768 --> 00:02:49.221
time he's trying to catch fish there's a 10 in 20 chance,

00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:52.536
or you could say one half probability

00:02:52.536 --> 00:02:54.191
that it's going to be a sunfish.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.096
The probability that you get three sunfish in a row is

00:02:57.096 --> 00:03:01.165
going to be one half, times one half, times one half.

00:03:01.165 --> 00:03:04.421
They put the fish back in, that's why it stays 10 out

00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:07.046
of the 20 fish. If he wasn't putting the fish back in

00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:10.968
then the second sunfish you would have a nine out of 20

00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:13.860
chance of the second one being a sunfish.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.397
In this case they keep replacing the

00:03:16.397 --> 00:03:17.824
fish every time they catch it.

00:03:17.824 --> 00:03:21.132
There is a one eighth chance that Jeremy catches

00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:24.834
three sunfish, so this right over here is one eighth.

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.772
And one minus one eighth, this is seven eighths.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.979
You have a one eighth chance of paying 100 dollars

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.996
and a seven eights chance of getting

00:03:35.996 --> 00:03:38.875
twenty dollars so this gets us to ...

00:03:42.732 --> 00:03:45.562
Your expected profit here,

00:03:45.562 --> 00:03:50.044
there's a one eighths chance, one eighth probability,

00:03:50.044 --> 00:03:54.997
that you lose 100 dollars here, so times negative 100.

00:03:55.504 --> 00:04:00.508
But then there is a seven eighths chance that you get --

00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:03.597
I'll just put parentheses here to make it clear.

00:04:03.597 --> 00:04:05.597
I think the order of operations of the

00:04:05.597 --> 00:04:07.301
calculator would have taken care of it but

00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:09.301
I'll just do it so that it looks the same.

00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:11.472
Seven eighths, there's a seven eighths

00:04:11.472 --> 00:04:14.456
chance that you get 20 dollars.

00:04:15.597 --> 00:04:20.098
Your expected payoff here is positive five dollars.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:27.223
Your expected payoff here is equal to five dollars.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.239
This is your expected value from bet one.

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:32.223
Now let's think about bet two.

00:04:35.323 --> 00:04:39.086
If you catch at least two sunfish of the next three fish

00:04:39.086 --> 00:04:44.211
you catch he will pay you 50, otherwise you will pay him 25.

00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:48.365
Let's think about the probability of catching at least

00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:53.131
two sunfish of the next three fish that you catch.

00:04:53.574 --> 00:04:56.257
There's a bunch of ways to think about this but since

00:04:56.257 --> 00:05:00.616
there's only three times that you're trying to catch the

00:05:00.616 --> 00:05:02.756
fish and there's only one of two outcomes you could actually

00:05:02.756 --> 00:05:06.304
write all the possible outcomes that are possible here.

00:05:06.648 --> 00:05:11.757
You could get sunfish, sunfish, sunfish.

00:05:12.506 --> 00:05:15.007
You could get, what's the other type of fish that you have?

00:05:15.007 --> 00:05:18.758
Oh, trout. You could have sunfish, sunfish, trout.

00:05:18.758 --> 00:05:22.413
You could have sunfish, trout, sunfish.

00:05:22.413 --> 00:05:25.789
You could have sunfish, trout, trout.

00:05:26.054 --> 00:05:29.476
You could have trout, sunfish, sunfish.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.975
You could have trout, sunfish, trout.

00:05:32.226 --> 00:05:35.133
You could have trout, trout, sunfish.

00:05:35.746 --> 00:05:38.024
Or you could have all trout.

00:05:38.292 --> 00:05:45.538
You see here that each of these, each time you go there's

00:05:45.771 --> 00:05:48.628
two possibilities, each time you try to catch a fish there's

00:05:48.628 --> 00:05:51.020
two possibilities, so if you're doing it three times

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.113
there's two times two times two possibilities.

00:05:53.113 --> 00:05:55.991
One, two, three, four, five, six,

00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:57.785
seven, eight possibilities here.

00:05:57.785 --> 00:06:01.423
Now out of these eight equally likely possibilities how

00:06:01.423 --> 00:06:05.194
many of them involve you catching at least two sunfish?

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:09.907
You catch at least two sunfish in this one, in this one,

00:06:09.907 --> 00:06:15.439
in that one, in this one and I think that is it.

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.238
Yep, this is only one sunfish, one sunfish,

00:06:18.238 --> 00:06:21.174
one sunfish and no sunfish.

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:24.876
In four out of the eight equally likely

00:06:24.876 --> 00:06:27.877
outcomes you catch at least two sunfish.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:36.764
Your probability of catching at least two sunfish

00:06:38.075 --> 00:06:42.857
is equal to four eighths or one half.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.699
Let's see, what's the expected value?

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.219
Let's say Y is the expected profit from bet.

00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:53.692
Let's let Y equals, another random variable,

00:06:53.692 --> 00:07:02.568
is equal to expected profit from bet two.

00:07:02.973 --> 00:07:07.026
The expected value of our random variable Y,

00:07:07.363 --> 00:07:10.911
you have a one half chance that you win.

00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:16.411
You have a one half chance of getting 50 dollars and then

00:07:16.411 --> 00:07:20.024
you have the one half chance, the rest of the probability.

00:07:20.505 --> 00:07:21.770
If there's a one half chance you win

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.761
there's going to be a one minus one half or

00:07:23.761 --> 00:07:26.099
essentially a one half chance that you lose.

00:07:26.556 --> 00:07:31.727
So you have a one half chance of having to pay 25 dollars.

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:34.316
Let's see what this is.

00:07:34.316 --> 00:07:38.286
This is one half times 50 plus one half times negative 25.

00:07:38.598 --> 00:07:48.708
This is going to be 25 minus 12.50, which is equal to 12.50.

00:07:49.618 --> 00:07:52.926
Your expected value from bet two is 12.50.

00:07:53.692 --> 00:07:55.552
Your friend says he's willing to take

00:07:55.552 --> 00:07:59.616
both bets a combined total of 50 times.

00:08:00.038 --> 00:08:03.004
If you want to maximize your expected value what should you do?

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:07.021
Well bet number two -- Actually both of them are good bets,

00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:09.801
I guess your friend isn't that sophisticated,

00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:14.740
but bet number two has a higher expected payoff,

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.902
so I would take bet two all of the time.

00:08:18.396 --> 00:08:22.301
I would take bet two all of the time.
