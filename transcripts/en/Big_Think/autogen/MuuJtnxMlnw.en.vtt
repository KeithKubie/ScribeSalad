world that is now being fed by the fact
that if we die the hereafter is going to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680
that if we die the hereafter is going to
 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.770
that if we die the hereafter is going to
be a better place then it's very

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
be a better place then it's very
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.950
be a better place then it's very
difficult to stop that but if that is

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960
difficult to stop that but if that is
 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.370
difficult to stop that but if that is
diluted and I always like to see the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
diluted and I always like to see the
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.069
diluted and I always like to see the
carpets half-full that there will be

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079
carpets half-full that there will be
 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.480

voices and that they will be strong
enough to say it's madness to commit to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
enough to say it's madness to commit to
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.780
enough to say it's madness to commit to
kill and to be killed because of this

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
kill and to be killed because of this
 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.249
kill and to be killed because of this

then things could look better but on the
very short time it looks

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
very short time it looks
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.150
very short time it looks
like things will look bad I think for

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160
like things will look bad I think for
 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.560
like things will look bad I think for
for people to understand it they should

for people to understand it they should
 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.960
for people to understand it they should
probably see pictures of Hiroshima and

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970
probably see pictures of Hiroshima and
 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.420
probably see pictures of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki and that was pretty much a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
Nagasaki and that was pretty much a
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.550
Nagasaki and that was pretty much a
primitive bomb the bombs that they are

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
primitive bomb the bombs that they are
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.320
primitive bomb the bombs that they are
trying to make now are far more advanced

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
trying to make now are far more advanced
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.720

and contain far more people and with
consequences for decades for the places

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280
consequences for decades for the places
 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.540
consequences for decades for the places
that are that will be affected that
