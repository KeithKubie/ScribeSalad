YEN-JIE LEE: 8.03 is a very,
very interesting course,

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.910
because without
waves and vibrations

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.000
we will not be able to even
recognize this universe.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.700
Doing this class, I decided
to include a lot of demos

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.670
during my lectures.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.070
Demonstrations are
particularly useful,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.550
because we first introduce
the physical situation

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.900
we are interested.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.190
Then we compare our
mathematical solution

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.290
to reality, which is
actually the demo.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.850
I hope you will be able to
enjoy this free content provided

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.680
by OCW, including
the lecture videos,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.630
the lecture notes, and
the problem solving video

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.180
from Professor Wit Busza.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.520
Yeah, it's really cool.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.160
You'll take the course, right?
