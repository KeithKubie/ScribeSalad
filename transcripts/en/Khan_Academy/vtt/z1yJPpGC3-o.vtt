00:00:00.616 --> 00:00:04.529
Let's think about how a tax on a product might affect it,

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.879
if the demand for it is very, very, very elastic.

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.259
So what I've done here -- We're going to think about flags --

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.519
the market for a certain type 
of flag that's made in China.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.650
And to think about this flag -- think about it this way.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.859
If the price -- the price right now -- the equilibrium price between

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.880
where the supply and the demand intersect --

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.880
the supply curve and the demand curve intersect --

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.416
is right about seventy dollars per flag.

00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:35.682
So this is a pretty nice flag. It's right at seventy dollars per flag.

00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:39.530
And the quantity demanded, in thousands per year,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.450
it looks like it's about twenty five thousand

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.820
flags are demanded per year.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.550
Now if at the price were to go slightly above

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.490
that equilibrium price,what's going to happen?

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.484
Well, if the price goes slightly above that

00:00:54.484 --> 00:00:55.812
equilibrium price, people are going to say,

00:00:55.812 --> 00:00:57.140
"Well, I can go by the American flags made in Taiwan,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.420
or even the ones made in America, or made in Mexico,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.810
or made some place else. [Because...]

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.439
"People won't be able to tell the difference from a distance."

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.140
So I'm going to buy one of the substitutes --

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380
[because] especially the ones from Taiwan or Mexico

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.893
or wherever else. are identical to the ones made in China.

00:01:12.893 --> 00:01:15.761
So if the price for slightly -- even slightly higher,

00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:19.068
the quantity demanded would be much, much, much lower.

00:01:19.068 --> 00:01:23.320
And if the price were even a little bit lower,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.828
then people say, "I'm not going to buy the Mexican flag--

00:01:26.828 --> 00:01:27.979
or the Taiwanese [or] American flags.

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.130
I'm going to buy the ones that were made in China."

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.060
And then the quantity demanded would be much larger.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.030
And so what you have here is a very large,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.194
a high elasticity of demand.

00:01:39.194 --> 00:01:41.359
So this right over here, this is almost perfectly elastic.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:44.329
If it was perfectly elastic, it would be completely horizontal.

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.020
So this is almost almost almost perfectly --

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.020
perfectly elastic -- elastic demand.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.630
A very small change in price leads to a huge change in quantity.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.159
In particular a very small percentage change in price

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.399
leads to a huge percent change in quantity.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:08.679
So let's say that -- that some government

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:09.960
official decides, "You know what? [I] don't like the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.930
idea of American flags being made in China."

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.770
So they decide to tax American flags made in China.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.610
So what they do is that they place a tax, they place a tax --

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.170
And once again I'll do a fixed dollar tax.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.060
It could be a percentage and if a percentage
then it'll change the sup -- the supply

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.310
plus tax curve
It'll be -- the shift will will be a percentage change

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.500
instead of a fixed change.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.180
But the fixed change
is a little bit easier to draw,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.580
so I'll do that.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.750
So let's say that there is a tax --

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.920
Let me do that in a different color
Let's say that there's a tax placed of ten dollars --

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.620
ten dollars per flag.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.430
Ten dollars, actually --
Let's do an even a smaller amount.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.100
Let's say that there is a tax placed of
of one dollar per flag -- one dollar per flag.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.290
I'll make it a little bit larger.
Let's say it's five dollars per flag --

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.040
five dollars per flag.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.080
So now what is the supply plus tax curve?
So the supplier / just to make the flags in

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.120
China and ship them to United States and get the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.840
story here even to get that first flag done

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.510
even if is that in the most efficient way
possible

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.590
looks do you need at least looks like around
fifty to fifty three dollars now

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.670
Now they're going now 
they're still going to need that

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.750
plus there's going to be a five dollar tax

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.830
on it
So supply plus tax is going to be that plus

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.440
five dollars is going to be right around there

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.950
Over here, you add five dollars.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.310
So at any given point, we're gonna add fivedollars
to essentially what the consumer would have to see.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.500
\\So you would have a curve that looks something

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.060
like this you would have a curve that looks
something

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.780
like this
you would have a curve that looks something

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.200
like this.
That dotted line right over there is our supply

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.690
is our supply plus tax.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.810
This right over here was just our supply --was
just our supply.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.550
So you're essentially --
So let's think about what happens here.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.300
Your equilibrium price was at seventy before.
Now our equilibrium price is still --

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.320
Our equilibrium price is still pretty much
at seventy.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.820
But our equilibrium quantity has gone down
dramatically.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.890
Our equilibrium quantity has gone down to
--

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.380
our equilibrium quantity has gone down to
--

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.020
I don't know.
It looks like about eighteen thousand.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.219
Eighteen thousand flags per year.

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:21.159
So who bore -- who bore the bulk of this right
over here?

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:25.810
So let's think about the tax revenue
So the tax revenue in this situation is going

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.219
to be eighteen thousand
times the five dollars.

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:33.020
So this is the five dollars right over here.
That is five dollars -- and then times eighteen

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.289
thousand --
times eighteen thousand.

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.719
So this right over here is the tax revenue.
That right over there is a tax revenue.

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:45.349
Actually, let me draw a little bit more carefully
so the tax revenue is

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:50.030
This is going to be between this line right
over here and five dollars.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.889
So just like that.
So that's all the tax revenue.

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.810
And notice.
It all came out of the producer surplus.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.210
The original producer surplus -- the original
producer surplus was --

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.039
Especially if we assume perfect elasticity
--

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:08.889
The original producer surplus was this green
rectangle plus this and plus this.

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.249
Now this is going to be --
This little area right over here is going

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:15.599
to be dead weight loss --
dead-weight loss.

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.669
And all of that came from the producer's
surplus.

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.629
And then the all the tax revenue, also --
If you especially if you assume this top-line

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:27.430
was horizontal --
also came out of the producer surplus.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.520
So in this situation where you had almost
where you

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.240
We could say, if if you do have perfect elasticity
if you have perfect elasticity of demand for

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.819
the product,
The person who's going to bear the the brunt

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.960
of the tax --
so -- is going to be the producer.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.419
The producer surplus is going to be eaten
into from the tax.

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.069
Bears -- bears the
Actually that's not -- that's not

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:51.949
(I'm not talking about the animal, "bears.")
The producer, --

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.629
You know -- I'm not -- well --
The producer gets the burden the producer

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.219
The producer gets the burden in that situation.

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.349
And this is an interesting thing to think
about.

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.650
Because when you have almost perfectly elastic
demand --

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.650
so a -- almost -- or if you said perfectly
elastic demand --

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.050
a flat -- a flat demand curve right over here
--

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.110
there's -- there's actually no consumer
surplus,

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.520
because the marginal benefit, even the incremental
marginal or --

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.539
(I'm -- I'm being redundant with the words
incremental and marginal.)

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.259
But the marginal benefit at any point for
the consumer for -- that -- for that next

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.069
unit is equal to
the price they're paying, when you have --

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:32.689
There's no -- There's --
Especially if the the especially if the demand

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:35.610
curve is perfectly elastic -- and it's perfectly
horizontal --

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.969
There is no area between the demand curve
and the price paid.

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:42.719
So there's actually --
There's isn't any -- even any consumer surplus

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:46.639
to take any --
to take any of the -- to take -- to eat into.

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.349
It all gets eaten out of the out of the producer
surplus.
