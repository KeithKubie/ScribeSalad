00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.280
We're now going to take the
California Standards Test,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.960
Algebra I released questions.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.480
In the last series, I had
done the Algebra II.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.920
I guess I'm going in
reverse order.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.110
Let me copy and paste this first
question because I think

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.905
it's good to see the
whole thing.

00:00:14.905 --> 00:00:20.860
So let me see, I
have copied it.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.800
Let me move this pointer
all the way up, and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.370
then, there we go.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.880
All right.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.060
And they're asking us is the
equation 3 times 2x minus 4

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.960
equal to minus 18 equivalent to
6x minus 12 is equal to 18?

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.770
So let's think about this.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.490
If we just distribute this
3, what do we get?

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.820
3 times 2x is 6x.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.770
3 times minus 4 is minus 12.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.480
And that, of course, is
equal to minus 18.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.890
So sure, they're
the same thing.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.290
If you just distribute the 3
over the 2x minus 4, you get

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.950
6x minus 12.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.270
So the answer is
definitely yes.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.140
It's not the no one down here.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.540
And it says yes, the equations
are equivalent by the

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.080
associative?

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.340
No.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.959
Communicative?

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:05.249
No.

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:09.033
The equations are equivalent by
the distributive property?

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:09.800
[FIRE TRUCK SIREN]

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.480
There's some type of a fire
truck going on outside.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.260
Let's see.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.540
Where was I?

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.770
Oh, yes.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.050
Yes, the equations are
equivalent by the distributive

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.760
property of multiplication
over addition.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.470
Right, that's that.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.400
We distributed this 3
over the 2x minus 4.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.950
And they say over addition
because you could view this as

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.460
a plus minus 4.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.540
Addition and subtraction is
really the same thing when you

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.180
think of the distributive
property.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.740
Anyway, let's do the
next problem.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.650
The next problem I can
just write out.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.770
This is problem number 2.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.550
They say the square root of
16 plus the cube root

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.120
of 8 is equal to?

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.975
Well, what's the square
root of 16?

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:51.680
And when you just have a square
root there, you might

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.830
say, maybe it's plus or minus 4,
but when they write it this

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.680
way is means the principal root,
so it's just plus 4.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.590
They would write a plus or minus
out front if they wanted

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.520
you to get the negative
square root.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.430
So it's 4 plus-- now, what to
the third power is equal to 8?

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.539
Well, 2 to the third power
is equal to 8, right?

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.950
So we could write 2 to the
third is equal to 8.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.510
That's the same thing as saying
the cube root of 8 is

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.170
equal to 2.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.570
You could also view this
as 8 to the 1/3 power.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.490
Anyway, the cube root of 8 is
then 2, so 4 plus 2 is equal

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.140
to 6, and that is choice B.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.390
Problem 3.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.590
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.070
OK, and they want to know--
I could copy and

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.510
paste the whole thing.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.910
There we go.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.010
And they want to know which
expression is equivalent to x

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.790
to the sixth times x squared?

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.400
So x to the sixth times
x squared, they

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.390
have the same base.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.470
When you're multiplying both of
these expressions, we can

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.390
add the exponents.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.750
So that is equal to x to
the-- 6 plus 2 is 8.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.640
That's not one of the choices
here, so we have to say, which

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.740
of these also are the same
thing as x to the eighth?

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.570
And so which two exponents when
I add them is equal to 8?

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.895
4 plus 3 is equal to 7.

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:20.330
5 plus 3, this is equal to
x to the eighth as well.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.320
So that is choice B.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.130
Next problem, problem 4.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.740
All right, let me-- this is
another one where I'll copy

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.990
and paste it.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.470
All right.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.940
They want to know which number
does not have a reciprocal?

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.900
So the reciprocal of negative 1,
that's just 1 over negative

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.930
1, which is equal
to negative 1.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.220
The reciprocal of
0, that's what?

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.700
1/0, which is not defined.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.660
So the choice is B.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.100
0.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.500
We don't know what 1/0 is.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.040
Maybe that's a project
for you to think of

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.290
what it should mean.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.000
And, of course, these
have reciprocals.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.180
1 over 1/1,000 is just equal to
1 times 1,000 over 1, which

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.590
is equal to 1,000.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.080
And the reciprocal of 3
is, of course, 1/3.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.330
Next problem.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.140
They say-- so there's a lot of
terminology here, but I guess

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.040
that's good.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.870
So they want to know--
let me just copy.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.210
Maybe I'll do the
next one, too.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.260
OK.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.080
I could probably just
do it up here.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.410
All right.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.510
They want to know, what is the
multiplicative inverse of 1/2?

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.840
So essentially, what can
I multiply 1/2 by

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.325
and then get 1?

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.630
It's the same thing as saying
what's the inverse of 1/2.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.630
So if I multiply by 1/2 by--
well, the inverse of 1/2, I'd

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.060
say 1 over 1/2.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.760
That's the same thing
as 1 times 2/1,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.230
which is equal to 2.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.140
Or another way to think of it is
2 times 1/2 is equal to 1.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.080
So the multiplicative inverse
of 1/2 is just 2.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.460
That's choice D.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.420
Problem 6.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.160
What is the solution
for this equation?

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.070
All right, sometimes these
absolute value signs can

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.360
appear daunting, but
you just have to

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.650
think it through logically.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.880
If the absolute value of 2x
minus 3 is equal to 5, that

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.730
tells us what?

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.210
That means that 2x minus
3 is equal to 5, right?

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.370
Because inside the absolute
value is equal to 5, then the

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.920
absolute value of
5 is equal to 5.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.110
So that's fair enough.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.190
But what could 2x minus
3 also be equal to?

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.680
What happens if 2x minus 3
within the absolute value sign

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.600
is equal to minus 5?

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.470
Well, then you would take the
absolute value of that and you

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.490
would get 5, right?

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.800
So 2x minus 3 could also
be equal to minus 5.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.480
When you see this absolute
value sign, you say, OK,

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.150
whatever's inside the absolute
value is either 5 or negative

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.960
5 because we're taking the
absolute value of it to get 5.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.680
So we just solve both
of these equations.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.390
If you add 3 to both sides
of this one, you get

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.200
2x is equal to 8.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.570
x is equal to 4.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.030
On the second one, you
add 3 to both sides.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.306
You get 2x is equal to-- minus
5 plus 3 is minus 2.

00:06:25.306 --> 00:06:30.645
x is equal to minus 2 divided
by 2 is negative 1.

00:06:30.645 --> 00:06:35.450
So x could be equal to 4 or x
could be equal to negative 1.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:42.160
And that is choice C, x is
negative 1 or x is equal to 4.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.060
Next problem.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.240
The Algebra I ones go faster
than the Algebra II problems.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.110
Those tend to be hairier.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.360
Let me clear all of this.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:57.880
I'll just write this one down.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:04.100
They say what is the solution
set for the inequality 5 minus

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.530
the absolute value of x
plus 4 is less than or

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.660
equal to minus 3?

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.730
So at first, this is
really daunting.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.210
I can't even do that logic that
I did last time because I

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.040
have that 5 out there.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.520
But let's think of
it this way.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.240
Let's try to simplify it, so
we have just the absolute

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.410
value of something is
less than or equal

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.200
to something else.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.540
So one thing we can do is, if we
want to get rid of this 5,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.770
remember, what we do to both
sides of an equation or

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.340
inequality-- whatever we do to
one side of an equation or an

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.540
inequality, we do
to both sides.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.690
So let's subtract 5 from both
sides of this equation.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.940
If you subtract 5 from the left
side, this 5 disappears.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.400
I'm just going to do minus--
let me write that out.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.750
Minus 5 plus, and I'm going
to do a minus 5 there.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:53.240
That's a plus.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.020
So minus 5 plus 5 is 0, so I'm
just left with minus absolute

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.690
value of x plus 4 is less than
or equal to-- now, what's

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.140
minus 3 minus 5?

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.850
That's minus 8.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.290
All right, now this next step,
this is something-- maybe it

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.510
wasn't obvious for you and
putting the inequality there--

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.050
you know, if this was an
inequality, you would just

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.970
say, OK, I'm going to multiply
or divide both sides by

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.340
negative 1 to get rid of
the negative signs.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.260
But one thing you have to
remember, whenever you

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.800
multiply or divide both sides of
an inequality by a negative

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.910
number, you have to switch
the inequality.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.850
So if this is true, then if I'm
multiplying both sides of

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.950
this by negative 1, so negative
1 times negative x

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.840
plus 4, I'm going to switch
the inequality, so that's

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.210
going to become greater than
or equal to negative 8.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.100
And I did the negative 1 on
this side, so I have to

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.480
multiply it times negative
1 on that side.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.800
And so this negative cancels
out that negative, so we're

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:59.140
just left with x plus 4 is
greater than or equal to--

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.150
negative 8 times a negative
1 is equal to 8.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.330
Now we can just use the
logic that we had

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.520
from that last problem.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.530
This tells us what?

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:12.510
This tells us that the magnitude
of x plus 4 is

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.320
greater than or equal to 8.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.110
Let me draw a number line here
because I really want you to

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.350
get the intuition of what
magnitude means.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:27.680
So if that's the number line and
you can view magnitude as

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.150
kind of the distance from, or
the absolute value, you can

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.930
kind of view it as the distance
from 0, right?

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:40.500
So if this is 0 right here and
this is positive 8 and this is

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.540
minus 8, the absolute value of
whatever this quantity was is

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.780
greater than 8.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.820
That means its distance from
0 has to be greater than 8.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.490
You can just say distance from
0 of this number has to be

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.570
greater than 8, greater
than or equal to 8.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.970
That means that this number is
definitely going to be greater

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.070
than or equal to positive 8.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.880
On the number line,
it would be all of

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.340
those numbers, right?

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.620
Or, remember, we're saying the
magnitude, so we don't care

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.850
about the direction.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:14.360
The magnitude has to be greater
than positive 8, so it

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.150
also includes the negative
numbers less than negative 8.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.100
And why does that make sense?

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.160
Well, take negative 9.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.580
What's the absolute value
of negative 9?

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:29.440
The absolute value of negative
9 is greater than 8 because 9

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.340
is greater than 8, so any number
to the left of negative

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.380
8 or to the right
of positive 8.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.540
So what does that tell us
about this equation?

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.890
So that means that-- well, the
easy one is x plus 4 could be

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.235
greater than or equal to 8.

00:10:41.235 --> 00:10:44.140
So let's write that down.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.710
Let me write it here.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.775
x plus 4 greater than
or equal to 8.

00:10:48.775 --> 00:10:51.010
And that takes into
consideration that the

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.670
magnitude is greater than
or equal to 8 there.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:11:00.160
Or x plus 4 less than
or equal to minus 8.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.060
That's the magnitude
to the left of this

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.610
negative 8 right there.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:05.570
And now we solve it.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.050
And it's very important to think
of absolute value in

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.450
these terms. Otherwise, it can
become very confusing and you

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:11.250
start testing numbers.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.630
But if you really just visualize
the number line and

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:18.000
you think of absolute value as
distance from 0, magnitude of

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.150
the distance from 0, you say,
oh, the distance from 0 has to

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.330
be greater than or equal to 8,
so that means my number has to

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:27.310
be-- this thing has to be less
than or equal to minus 8 or it

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:31.150
has to be greater than or
equal to positive 8.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.420
So let's solve.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.000
x plus 4 is greater than
or equal to 8.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.250
Subtract 4 from both sides, so
you get x is greater than or

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.480
equal to 4.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.440
I just subtracted 4
from both sides.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.920
Subtract 4 from both sides here,
you get x is less than

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.570
or equal to minus 12.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.700
So the solution here is x is
greater than or equal to 4 or

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.510
x is less than or equal
to minus 12, and

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.860
that is choice D.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.420
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
