00:00:01.774 --> 00:00:04.357
(upbeat music)

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.080
- Good afternoon.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.460
From the script, I am to
say I am William Lester,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.380
professor of chemistry

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.640
and chair of the Hitchcock Committee.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.840
We're pleased, along with
the Graduate Council,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.160
to present Professor Daniel Kahneman,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.860
this year's speaker in the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.970
Charles M. and Martha
Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.680
As a condition of this bequest,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.590
we're obligated and happy to tell you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.540
how the endowment came to UC Berkeley.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.900
It's a story that
exemplifies the many ways

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.750
this campus is linked to
the history of California

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.163
and the Bay Area.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.530
Dr. Charles Hitchcock, a
physician for the Army,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.350
came to San Francisco
during the gold rush,

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.870
where he opened a
thriving private practice.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.290
In 1885, Charles
established a professorship

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.160
here at Berkeley as an expression

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.793
of his long-held interest in education.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.860
His daughter, Lillie Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.630
still treasured in San Francisco

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.450
for her colorful personality,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.630
as well as her generosity,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.770
greatly expanded her
father's original gift

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.550
to establish a professorship
at UC Berkeley,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.988
making it possible for us to
present a series of lectures.

00:01:40.988 --> 00:01:42.317
The Hitchcock Fund has become

00:01:42.317 --> 00:01:44.060
one of the most cherished endowments

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.980
at the University of California,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.890
recognizing the highest distinction

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.360
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.770
Thank You Lillie and Charles,

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.990
and now, a few words about
Professor Daniel Kahneman.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.870
Daniel Kahneman is

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.030
an internationally renowned psychologist

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.770
whose work spans cognitive psychology,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.950
behavioral economics, and
the science of well-being.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.080
In recognition of his groundbreaking work

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.990
on human judgment and decision-making,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.550
Kahneman received the 2002
Nobel Prize in Economics,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.310
a field that increasingly
bases economic models

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.059
upon psychological models
of information processing.

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.380
Kahneman's award-winning research

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.240
show that many human decisions,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.330
especially those made in
a state of uncertainty,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.410
depart from the principle of probability.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.294
With his longtime
collaborator, Amos Tversky,

00:02:35.294 --> 00:02:37.210
Kahneman laid the foundations

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.760
for the new field of behavioral economics.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.306
Kahneman received his BA in 1954

00:02:43.306 --> 00:02:45.920
from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.540
majoring in psychology and
minoring in mathematics.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.370
He earned his PhD in psychology

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.680
from the University of
California Berkeley in 1961,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.040
and returned to the Hebrew University

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.810
as a professor of psychology

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.270
during the period 1961 to '70.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.560
Kahneman has also served as
a professor of psychology

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.967
at the University of British
Columbia, 1978 to '86,

00:03:09.967 --> 00:03:14.550
and the University of California
Berkeley from '86 to '94.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.240
He has taught at Princeton
University since 1993,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.770
where he currently serves as

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.970
a Eugene Higgins Professor of Psychology.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.070
He is also professor of
psychology and public affairs

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.910
at the Woodrow Wilson School

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.330
of Public and International Affairs.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.450
Kahneman is a member of

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.990
the National Academy of Sciences,

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.970
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.710
the Econometrics Society,
and other elective societies.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.510
He has received numerous awards,

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.730
including the Distinguished
Scientific Contribution Award

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.914
of the American Psychological Association

00:03:47.914 --> 00:03:50.990
with Amos Tversky, 1982,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.010
the Warren Medal

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.554
of the Society of
Experimental Psychologists

00:03:54.554 --> 00:03:57.870
with Amos Tversky, 1995,

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.080
the Hill Guard Award

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.050
for lifetime contributions
to general psychology, 1995,

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.160
and the Grabbe Mayer Prize in Psychology

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.810
with Amos Tversky, 2002,

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.010
and holds honorary degrees
from numerous universities,

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.210
including Harvard University,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.010
the University of
Pennsylvania, and the Sorbonne.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.442
Please join me in welcoming
Professor Daniel Kahneman.

00:04:20.442 --> 00:04:23.609
(audience applauding)

00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:27.120
- It is a pleasure and an honor to be here

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.223
as a Hitchcock Professor.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.440
It's also quite a moving occasion for me,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.130
because the I House was
the very first place

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.030
that I visited on this campus

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.840
49 years ago, almost of the day,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.010
when I came to begin my graduate work

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.500
here at the University of California,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.500
so it's nice to be here
in a different context.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.290
Now, the topic I will talk about today

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.900
is one of, on which I have worked

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.733
for many of these long years.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.050
And let me begin by saying,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.780
that I've always used
science as a conversation

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.070
which can be more or less friendly,

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.720
as when when friends try to
understand the same thing,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.320
or slightly less friendly debates,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.980
some of them even nasty ones.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.810
I've been by and large pretty fortunate.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.570
I've been engaged in quite a few debates,

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.423
but most of them have been civil.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.590
Much of my career has been engaged

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.723
in two of these debates,
both of them pretty short,

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.043
mostly quite civilized.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.860
Both started a long time ago,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.610
when Amos Tversky and I began our study

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.872
of systematic errors of
judgment, and that was in 1969.

00:05:41.872 --> 00:05:44.870
And that is Amos Tversky.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.673
He died in 1996.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.920
The first debates that we
conducted were with economists,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.670
because of the possible implications

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.900
of what we were studying,

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.020
which were systematic errors and biases

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.940
and judgment in decision-making,

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.000
implications that these
errors and biases could have

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.623
for the rational agent model.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.210
There's been a second debate,

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.140
and that's been with psychologists.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.010
Many psychologists who have deplored

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.710
their emphasis on mistakes,

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.750
and have claimed that the picture

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.350
that we drew of human
cognition is distorted

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.340
and much more negative and pessimistic

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.583
than it ought to be.

00:06:31.331 --> 00:06:36.331
In particular, there is at
least the appearance of a debate

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.890
about the quality of expert intuition.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.957
Now this is a hot topic these days,

00:06:40.957 --> 00:06:43.720
and one of the major bestsellers
of the last few years,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.570
Blink by Malcolm Gladwell,

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.460
is basically dedicated to the study

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.290
or to the description of sort of

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.130
the marvels of expert intuition,

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.720
and for a number of
years have been engaged

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.920
in a sort of malgy
adversarial collaboration

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.020
with someone we may consider
now a friend, Gary Klein,

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.640
who started from really the other side.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.430
He has argued that we
should generally trust

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.350
the intuitions of experts,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.920
and whereas you know I have argued

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.130
that we should be quite careful

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.120
in trusting the intuitions of experts,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.720
and we have been trying
jointly to figure out

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.200
what are the boundary?

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.236
That is when could we trust the experts

00:07:26.236 --> 00:07:28.940
and when shouldn't we trust the experts?

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.770
Now, let me begin by a
couple of Gary Klein's

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.210
most beautiful examples.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.620
He has one that is
particularly compelling,

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.170
and which had a big influence,

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.203
I think, in his thinking and his career,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.750
and that example is of a captain

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.150
of a firefighter, firefighting company,

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.120
and he is there on a roof.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.230
There is a sort of a fire.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.030
He doesn't quite understand
what the situation is,

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.130
and he is there with several firefighters,

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.450
and all of a sudden he almost
hears himself shouting,

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.000
let's get the hell out of here,

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.700
and they do,

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.680
and they barely have
time to get off the roof

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.903
and the house explodes.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.680
And when he tries to figure out

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.433
what it was that happened to him,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.620
there was a cue,

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.343
and the cue were that his feet were warm.

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:23.080
His feet were warm and an
inference had been made,

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.270
which he was really not
conscious of making,

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.840
that if his feet were warm,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.853
there was fire directly underneath them,

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.820
and that is, so I'm told, an
extremely dangerous situation.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.503
So, that is an expert intuition.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.970
He had another example which
I think is quite interesting,

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.560
and this is of a nurse in the cardiac ward

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.480
who shows up, comes home,
her father-in-law is there.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.790
She takes one look at him and says,

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.450
we go to the hospital right now.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.180
And he says why, I feel fine.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.883
She says we go to the hospital,

00:09:03.718 --> 00:09:07.320
and they go and they're just in time.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.563
He is about to have a major heart attack.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.680
And here again, actually it turns out,

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.060
she did not know what it
was that had worried her.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.113
It took some investigation to find out

00:09:22.113 --> 00:09:23.760
what the cues had been.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.780
It turns out that before a heart attack,

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.440
when arteries are obstructed,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.280
there is a change in the pattern

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.070
in the distribution of blood in the face,

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.960
and she had detected that pattern

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.810
without being aware of it.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.810
Now, that you can tell
that these experts do this,

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.140
this is something that you can teach.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.520
So, those stories, and
there are hundreds of them,

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.823
make you really marvel at the
powers of human intuition.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:54.273
On the other hand,

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.440
I have been worried about expert intuition

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.810
for about 50 years,

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:03.810
and that goes back to my
days in the Israeli Army,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.730
just before I came to graduate school.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.980
I spent part of my service

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.603
as a psychologist in the Israeli Army,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.560
interviewing people,

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.100
and observing candidates
for officer training,

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.100
in what was called
leaderless group situations.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.690
Those were you know, you
take a bunch of eight people,

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.970
and you take them to the obstacle course,

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.760
and there is a wall and a telephone pole,

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.170
and they are in groups of eight,

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.246
and you tell them pick up the pole.

00:10:33.246 --> 00:10:34.970
And now your task is,

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.280
say you want to get up the
other side of the wall,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.400
all of you,

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.450
without the pole touching
either the ground or the wall,

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.770
and without any of you touching the wall.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.913
Can be done, but it's not easy.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:53.110
Now, when you watch, when
you watch people do this,

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.300
as I did for a while,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.680
the striking subjective
impression is that,

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.760
you know exactly who
is going to be a leader

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.690
and who is not,

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.850
because you see people's
character really revealed,

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.060
or so it feels when you
watch the situation.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.960
You see leaders and you see wimps

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.220
and you see, you know, people
with foolish suggestions,

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.000
and you see the second-in-command,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.540
the person who helps but
doesn't really initiate.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.140
You have a feeling that you see

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.793
the truth about these individuals,

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.230
overwhelming impression of that

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.050
you can actually understand
who is going to be a leader

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.170
and who is not.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.560
But then, it turned out that
statistics were being kept,

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.040
so we would predict, you know,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.870
people's scores in
officer training school,

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.700
and occasionally, we would
get statistics on our validity

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.610
and how well we were doing in predicting,

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.340
and we weren't doing well at all.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.040
In fact, we couldn't do it.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.280
Basically, we knew nothing
on the basis of this.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.180
And the striking thing is that,

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.210
you know, it's the Army,

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.295
so you are told that you know nothing,

00:11:56.295 --> 00:11:57.610
statistics are no good,

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.810
but the next day, they bring
another batch of people

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.010
and you take them to the obstacle course,

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.160
and when you take them
to the obstacle course,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.340
once again, you see their character.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.503
You see the truth revealed about them,

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.040
and I coined a phrase for this.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.490
This was I think the
first cognitive illusion

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:16.880
that I discovered,

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.770
and I call that the illusion of validity,

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.470
because it's like a
powerful visual illusion

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.730
that you have that sense
that you can do something

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.443
that in fact, you cannot do.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.620
Now, it turns out that

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.840
when I was doing my work
in the Israeli Army,

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.100
just that was a year or two after

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.090
one of the great important classics

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.470
in the history of psychology
work by Paul Meehl,

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.710
who had done a seminal study comparing,

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:49.170
looking at all the previous studies

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:53.950
that had compared the
performance of experts,

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.200
or so-called experts,

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.020
psychologists, clinical
psychologists in various staffs,

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.580
predicting various criteria

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:05.540
to very simple linear
combinations of variables.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.220
So, you have a clinical psychologist,

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.420
he is looking at a lot of information.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.180
The subset of that information

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.900
is used by a statistical model.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.150
And now you compare,

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.830
how well do the intuitions of people do

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.460
compared to how well the
statistical model does?

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.780
And the statistical model

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.130
is based on part of the information.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.180
It's applied in a very restricted way.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.063
Those are simple linear models,

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:38.090
and the stunning result really,
another target was stunning,

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.450
of Meehl's study were that

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.950
I think in all 14
studies that he looked at

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:47.083
in that little book, in all 14,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.260
the linear equations beat
the experts hands down.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.750
There was just, people
think they can do it.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.400
They have their illusion of validity,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.620
but a very simple linear combination

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.020
of variables does better.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.510
Now, by now 50 years later,
I think at last count,

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.140
there was something like
a 160 or 180 studies

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.760
along the same lines,

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.310
and basically the conclusion is the same.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:16.530
When you compare people

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.253
to very simple combinations of variables,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.330
the combination wins
just about every time.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.363
It's hard to find any exception.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.240
I mean, there's some of the
results of this research

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.760
were really downright humiliating

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.760
for people who try to
forecast complicated events,

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.770
like whether marriages are
going to hold or not to hold,

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.220
whether people will violate parole or not,

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:48.033
and you compare their results
to results of equations.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.720
You can construct a statistical model

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.480
that will predict what the
judge himself or herself does,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.530
you have a judge making prediction,

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.290
you have a statistical model
that looks at how the judge

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.410
is making these predictions.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.430
And now, you put the statistical model,

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:10.280
and compare it to the judge
in the next batch of cases,

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.540
and the statistical model of the judge

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.160
does better than the judge.
(audience laughing)

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.143
Now the reason by the way,
it's not a big mystery,

00:15:19.099 --> 00:15:23.320
people are very clever and too clever,

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.080
so when you show them
the information twice

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.850
on the same case on two
different occasions,

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.810
they don't make the same judgement.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.480
This is the kind of mistake
that no formula does.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.090
You present the same case
to the formula twice,

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.370
it comes out with the same output.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.330
That difference in noise
or in unreliability

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.310
is enough to cause people to be inferior

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.683
to very poor combinations of variables.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.890
Now recently, there have
been many of these studies.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.090
So you know, you have Blink on one side,

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.090
and you know the marvels of intuition,

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.263
but you also have,

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.560
and that too, was actually

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.603
in a recent article by
Malcolm Gladwell, I think.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.433
You have successes of
formulas in assessing

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.250
the price that would be fetched

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.130
by paintings in an auction.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.540
You have great successes
of very simple formulas

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.620
that use the weather in the Bordeaux area

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.440
to predict the prices of
wines 10 or 15 years later.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.540
It turns out that the combination
of three or four variables

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.780
does just about as well, if not better,

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.740
than the best experts and wine tasters.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.210
So, we have that evidence

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.433
that experts are not terribly good.

00:16:40.537 --> 00:16:42.450
There is a lot of study of people

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.840
who pick stocks in the stock market,

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.400
and some of these people
are extremely confident

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.780
in the quality of their judgment,

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.730
and they put a lot of money on the line,

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.860
mostly clients', but
sometimes also their own.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:00.810
And when you see what they
do in predicting the future,

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.850
it turns out that mostly
they're predicting the past.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.230
That is, they are strongly
affected by recent trends,

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.740
and they extrapolating trends.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.020
They don't know they're doing it and,

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.570
but that accounts for a
great deal of the variance.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:18.810
Perhaps most remarkably in recent years,

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.010
remarkable of the studies in recent years,

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.530
is one by Phil Tetlock,

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.263
my friend and Berkeley colleague,

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:30.960
who studied the forecast
of political experts.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.410
And you know, people who do strategy,

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.668
and I think many of them were CIA analysts

00:17:35.668 --> 00:17:39.120
making medium and long term predictions

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.490
about various political
events in different countries.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.690
So, well they're, you know,

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.300
what will the economy look like?

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.660
Will it improve, or not improve?

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.760
Will there be a war, will there be a coup?

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.560
And people making predictions,

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.853
assigning probabilities to these events,

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.450
and these are experts.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.280
And now, these are experts in on which

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.700
we count for their expertise,

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.930
and it's very striking that by
and large, they can't do it.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.750
They cannot predict medium,

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:13.920
and medium and long term developments

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.320
in the political and strategic arena.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.350
It's not that they can't do anything,

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.040
but they cannot predict it better

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.620
than the average reader
of the New York Times.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.910
So you know, we don't have much expertise

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.610
as readers of the New York Times,

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:32.260
and the CIA experts, when
they do those kinds of tasks,

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.390
not when they're
explaining the recent past,

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:38.020
or maybe predicting that the near future,

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.910
but when they do medium and long term,

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.800
they're not better than the rest of us,

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.870
although there are a lot more
expert about the systems.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:50.870
So, the bottom line is that
we have a lot of evidence,

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.380
both for the models of expert intuition,

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.380
and for the weaknesses
of expert intuition.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:02.200
And the question that arises
is you know, what distinguish,

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.620
what distinguishes those
cases where intuition works?

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.930
And so you know, I mentioned
firefighters and nurses,

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.760
and of course, chess players.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.770
So, if you have a chess player,
you know with an expert,

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.000
he can walk by a chess situation,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.770
and just say white mates in
three without breaking stride.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.230
So they, chess masters can see situations

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.163
in ways that we cannot.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.770
Possibly, the most astonishing feats,

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.270
I think of that kind
of intuition and flair,

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.950
are to be seen among
professional athletes.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.670
That is hockey players,
basketball players,

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.220
their sense of what is
happening around them,

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.170
their ability to predict
where people will be

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.800
two or three critical seconds from now,

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.223
as as a function of that,
adjusts what they do.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:57.770
So, what do all these people
have, that CIA experts,

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:02.580
and psychologists, and stock pickers lack?

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.590
Now, to understand this,

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.330
I think we must examine the
psychology of intuition,

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.193
and that is what I'll try to do

00:20:10.193 --> 00:20:12.333
with the remainder of my time.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.500
Okay, let me begin by describing
two kinds of thinking.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.363
This is one way that
thoughts come to mind.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.010
And now, let me show you another way

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.310
that thought come to mind.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.920
Now, let's compare what
happened in those two cases.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.740
What's happening here?

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.653
Well, the product of 17 times 24,

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.050
you could get to it you know,

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.920
unless you spent a lot of your youth,

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.290
misspent a lot of your youth
with multiplication table.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.430
That's something that you had to generate

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:51.533
according to a rule.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.350
So, and this is a slow effortful process.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.310
Detecting that this woman is angry,

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.280
although it's something

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.050
that we would call an intuition actually,

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.940
but that impression simply comes to mind.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.550
She looks angry, just
as she looks dark here.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.610
And, we have predictions

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.460
about what her voice would
sound like if she speaks.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.280
We may have predictions
about what she's going to say

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.570
when she speaks,

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.120
certainly if we know
who she is talking to.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.623
Now, as you can see in this example,

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.650
I'll call this intuitive thinking.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.170
It's a very primitive example.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.300
It's a very simple example
of intuitive thinking,

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.640
but it is an example,

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.910
and it feels like something
that happens to us.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.690
It doesn't feel like something we do.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.000
So, the experience of intuitive thinking

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.130
is very much like the
experience of seeing,

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:46.690
of perceiving the woman,

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.810
and indeed, it is very hard to tell the,

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.890
to find a line that separates seeing

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.090
from interpreting rather
complicated things,

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.303
such as the mood of an individual.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.020
Now, a lot of psychological theorizing

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:10.700
has gone into describing
those two ways of thinking,

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:14.860
and as one of those simplifications

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.740
that theorists sometimes engage in,

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:21.180
we now often speak about
two systems of thought.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.223
There are two systems or two processes.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.790
It's a simplification,

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.076
but it's I think a very
useful simplification.

00:22:30.076 --> 00:22:33.920
And, we talk of two modes of thinking

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.460
or two families of thought processes.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.860
Sometimes, and I'll slip into that,

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.210
talk about intuition versus reasoning,

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:44.770
but I prefer the rather
neutral label system one,

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.300
which is the intuitive system,

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.810
and system two which is the other system.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.980
And system one is the one that detected

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.440
that this lady was angry,

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.026
and it clearly operates extremely quickly,

00:22:56.026 --> 00:22:59.390
although in some cases
intuitions can develop slowly,

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.713
but the characteristic of
system one is very high speed.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.320
System two is slow.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.763
The other aspect of it is that,

00:23:11.916 --> 00:23:14.230
you didn't really have a choice

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.030
in seeing that woman as angry.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.980
You had a choice about whether or not

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.300
to compute 17 times 24.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.263
I think very few of you actually did.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.193
So you know,

00:23:24.193 --> 00:23:26.739
you just didn't do it and
then nothing happened,

00:23:26.739 --> 00:23:28.900
but you didn't have to do anything

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.070
in order to see the woman as angry.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.380
So, one mechanism is automatic,

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.180
and the other is voluntary.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.920
It happens if you want it to happen.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.870
You can start and end without finishing.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:42.270
You can stop in the middle,

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.183
so it's controlled as against automatic.

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:51.340
Now, there are many computations,

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.270
mental computations that
have this character,

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.653
that they are performed automatically.

00:23:56.653 --> 00:24:00.380
Amos Tversky and I call
them natural assessments.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.020
And, you know when you look around you,

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.713
you make a lot of these
natural assessments.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.030
You perceive objects around
you, you identify them,

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.630
you know how far they are from you,

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.480
you know how long they
are, you know their color.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.550
You don't have to think about any of this.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.040
These are all computations,

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.040
and some of them are quite complex,

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.620
but these are computations
that the mind performs

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.360
and just delivers the
results to our consciousness

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.860
without our being aware

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.163
that we're engaging in any activity.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.450
But, there are natural
assessments which are conceptual.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:37.023
So you know, if I mention,

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.430
it's an old example as you'll see.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.160
So, if I mentioned that
Woody Allen parents

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.750
actually wanted him to be a dentist.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.890
Now, a few years ago,

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.650
this would have brought
some laughter actually.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.300
Woody Allen is no longer

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.450
quite as important a figure as he was,

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.860
but whatever Woody Allen is,

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.210
when you hear that sentence if you know,

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:01.520
you know if you know about Woody Allen,

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.625
you know that he's not going
to be a very good dentist.

00:25:04.625 --> 00:25:07.970
(students laughing)
And that computation

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.540
is performed immediately
and automatically.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.090
That is we have those two
components of the sentence

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:17.080
and we perform an
operation that links them

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.510
and compares them and
comes out with a result.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.970
This is a good fit,
this is not a good fit,

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.420
and in some cases,

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.460
the fit that is not
good in a particular way

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.633
will bring a smile.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:33.850
There are many conceptual
analyses that we perform,

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.770
you know on what we hear and what we see,

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:39.990
without actually intending to do so.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:43.960
We are constantly on the
lookout for causal connections.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.460
So, if we see, if we hear and see events

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.020
that are related in particular ways,

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.520
we look for cause and effect,

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.890
and we do that automatically.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:55.610
We evaluate similarity,

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.800
as in the Woody Allen and dentists case.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.593
We evaluate familiarity and surprise,

00:26:03.638 --> 00:26:08.638
and very importantly we evaluate emotion.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.230
That is, we have an ongoing evaluation,

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:15.080
emotional evaluation of the world

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.420
as good or bad threatening or benign.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.580
That goes on automatically.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.600
And, we can prove that
it goes on automatically,

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.910
but not everything gets computed,

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.760
so there are certain
aspects of the environment

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.013
that don't get computed.

00:26:32.805 --> 00:26:36.083
For example, if we show this
for a fraction of a second,

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:40.120
you will have seen, or would have seen

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.640
in a fraction of a second several things.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.473
You would have seen,

00:26:43.473 --> 00:26:46.870
that two of these objects are
more similar to each other

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.420
than they are to the third one.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.500
And here is something
you wouldn't have seen.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.240
You would not have seen that

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.080
there is the same number of blocks

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.690
in figure 2B as in figure 2A.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:04.930
So, you know it's there,

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.690
and you know for a computer,

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:09.080
if you program the computer to do this,

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.480
it would be no trick at all
to take that information,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.070
and it would be there,

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.460
or that you could construct the tower,

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.270
that if you constructed a
tower from the blocks on 2B,

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:22.110
it would be as tall as the tower of 2A.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.293
We don't compute that.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.730
So, we don't compute
everything that we could,

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.283
and that is it turns out quite important.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.860
So, here is a set of lines, actually.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:40.870
And now, here is a
computation that it turns out

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:42.603
from recent research actually,

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.890
by entries of my wife, and among others,

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.160
it turns out there is a computation

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.960
that everybody performs
instantly and effortlessly,

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.330
and that computation is
you get an impression

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:59.890
of the average length of
the lines in this display.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:01.810
You get that for free.

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:03.150
You don't have to work at it.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:06.390
You can do this, while
thinking of something else.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.780
It's a computation that the
mind is said to perform,

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.617
but now there is something
else that you could ask about,

00:28:13.617 --> 00:28:15.143
and that we don't compute.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:19.873
What is the total length of
the lines in this display.

00:28:21.275 --> 00:28:24.160
You have no idea you can do it,

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.110
but system two will have to do it.

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:28.300
That is you can estimate
the average length.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.240
You can assess or in
fact get an impression

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.370
of the number of lines,

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:33.743
and then you can multiply.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.950
Again, you know, actually,

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.330
if a computer were programmed to do this,

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:40.840
the computer would take the sum,

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.360
as on its way to getting the average.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.180
It turns out we have machinery

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.300
that can compute the average
but we don't know the sum.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.810
If we want to have the
sum, we need to compute it.

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.230
That turns out to be quite important.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.360
This distinction between
assessments that are natural

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.978
and assessment that are not natural,

00:28:59.978 --> 00:29:03.260
and that need to be
performed by system two,

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.393
that is an important distinction
that we'll get back to.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:12.690
Now, let me show you another example of

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:17.570
what we call the automaticity
of operations or system one.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.133
What you have to do here,

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.560
is and you know you can humor me.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.580
You can say it aloud.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.500
I'm going to show you some objects,

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.950
and say the color of the
objects in the following slides.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:30.797
Okay, so--

00:29:31.738 --> 00:29:32.983
- Red.
- Thank you.

00:29:33.827 --> 00:29:35.397
- [Audience] Green.

00:29:35.397 --> 00:29:36.230
Yellow.

00:29:37.791 --> 00:29:39.436
(audience laughing)

00:29:39.436 --> 00:29:44.010
Okay, this is one of the most the classic

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:46.260
experiments in psychology.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.640
You have no control over
what happened to you here.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.253
That is the reading was automatic,

00:29:52.253 --> 00:29:55.350
and reading it turns out is comes,

00:29:55.350 --> 00:30:00.350
you know, calling up
the colors was not hard,

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:03.660
but it's not something that
comes very, very easily.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.230
There is a lot more effort
in calling out the colors

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:07.270
than in reading.

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:08.900
When you present the two,

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.837
the reading comes out automatically,

00:30:10.837 --> 00:30:12.750
and it preempts the response,

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:16.710
so that's an example of
an automatic response.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:20.440
So, here's another characteristic of

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.193
those two systems.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.790
You can come to the
Heathrow Airport in London,

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.913
and you want to rent a car,

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.380
and they give you keys, the keys,

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.130
and they tell you please remind remember

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.733
that we drive on the left here,

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:41.280
and you do mostly.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.060
I mean if you're not very
tired, or if you can do it.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:49.740
That ability to adopt
a rule and follow it,

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.600
that is a system two operation.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.720
We can reset ourselves.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.100
System one, which is automatic,

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.170
is much harder to control,

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.320
and indeed when you get very busy

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.840
and very preoccupied,

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.290
you may find yourself driving

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:07.830
on the wrong side in London,

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.890
because you're not, well, not in London,

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.690
but that on a highway,

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.920
because you're not actually monitoring

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.763
closely enough what is going on.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.830
Now, so system two is a very quick study.

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:26.560
System two can adopt an
instruction and obey,

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.040
but it is slow in execution.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.400
System one is a slow learner,

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.760
but it's fast in execution.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.760
So, what we call
associations between ideas

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.113
are hard to learn and hard to unlearn.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.410
Now, this is important
implications for skill,

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.940
because skilled operations,

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.080
the operations of you know what happens,

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.170
with basketball players
and with chess players,

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:54.220
is skilled performance

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.510
migrates from system two to system one.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:59.950
It begins as a system two operation,

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:03.610
and it eventually, when
you become skilled,

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:07.720
you no longer have the scaffold
of remembering the rules.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.693
You just do it.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.603
Okay, now,

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:19.030
another characteristic of
these two modes of thinking,

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.600
and I've already mentioned it.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.800
Intuition is effortless, like perception.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.050
Reasoning, or system two
operations are effortful.

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:29.200
What do we mean by
effortless and effortful?

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.563
As psychologists, we
mean a very simple thing.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.685
Mostly, we mean that if
an operation is effortful,

00:32:37.685 --> 00:32:41.110
it will interfere with other
operations that are effortful.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:42.960
We have a limited ability

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.723
to do two difficult things at once,

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.900
and if we try to do two
difficult things at once,

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.900
performance will suffer,

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.340
which is not true

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.330
when we're dealing with
system one operations.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:00.900
So, that is one of the
characteristics of system one,

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.990
it is effortless, system two is effortful.

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:08.990
And, there is an important
function of system two,

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.440
which this example will show.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.670
So you can follow along.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.680
The bat and the ball together cost $1.10,

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.220
the bat costs a dollar more than the ball.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.743
How much does the ball cost?

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:24.273
Now, let me make a prediction.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.990
Every one of you, I would think,

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.490
have thought of the number,

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.093
and the number is 10 cents.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.230
That's been in everybody's mind.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:37.900
Now, that makes the problem interesting,

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.840
because 10 cents is false.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.010
You know if it were 10 cents and you,

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:46.229
and then the bat will be a dollar more,

00:33:46.229 --> 00:33:47.295
it would be $1.10,

00:33:47.295 --> 00:33:49.550
and the $1.10 and 10 cents would be $1.20,

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:51.303
so 10 cents is not the answer.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:54.450
Now, what is interesting is

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.303
when you put that question
to Princeton students,

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:01.750
half of them say 10 cents.

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:05.159
Now, and they do even
when you give them time.

00:34:05.159 --> 00:34:07.980
(students laughing)

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:12.980
And they don't when you
frighten them, that is you know,

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.930
when they're really worried
about making a mistake,

00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:19.253
they don't but otherwise they do.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.370
You know even 45 percent
of students at MIT

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:24.430
make the mistakes.

00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:29.400
So, what we learn about
people who make this mistake

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.860
is that they haven't checked.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.000
One of the functions of system two

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.578
is to monitor system one.

00:34:36.578 --> 00:34:39.330
That is we don't say
everything that comes to mind.

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:41.780
We say only a fraction
of what comes to mind,

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.870
sometimes too much,

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.360
but we do monitor ourselves.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.510
The monitoring however, is very casual,

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:52.580
and this example illustrates
how casual the monitoring is.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.620
It illustrates you know that well,

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.440
you know, that number comes to mind,

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.710
and it looks plausible,
and it is plausible.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:03.593
It's about one dollar
less and out it goes.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.420
That is it turns out very important,

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.523
and if you keep people busy,

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:13.440
if you for example, load
their memory with stuff

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.170
so that they have to
remember a seven digit number

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.270
while doing something else,

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:21.590
then I wouldn't say that
their behavior collapses,

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.140
but their behavior changes
in interesting way.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.610
So, for example they will become

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:27.950
much less politically correct.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.540
So, people who are holding

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.640
a seven digit number in their head

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.120
use words that are not quite so nice.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.540
They use lady, they use girl,

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.030
whereas you know otherwise
they would use woman

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.670
and sort of be more attuned

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:43.880
to with what they're supposed to do.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.400
People who hold a seven
digit number in their head

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.740
are more selfish than if they don't.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.560
So, system two does monitor system one,

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.940
and when you interfere with
the ability of system two

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:58.230
to monitor system one,
performance changes.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.570
This there are fades of
Freudian psychology here,

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:04.513
but this is the modern version
of Freudian psychology.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.373
Now,

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:12.430
and finally, associative
versus rule-governed,

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:14.650
that is and I'll illustrate in a minute

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.160
what I mean by by associative,

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.770
but I want to describe the mind

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:23.570
as a machine for jumping to conclusions.

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:27.130
This is, when we get very fast answers

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:30.650
to complicated questions,
we're jumping to conclusions,

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.410
and that is a very important
function of the mind.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:36.110
And, whether we do it skillfully or not

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:37.520
is a separate question,

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.511
whether we do it accurately or not,

00:36:39.511 --> 00:36:41.861
whether it's important
that this is what we do.

00:36:42.733 --> 00:36:47.733
Let me illustrate that.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:53.020
Okay, let me tell you a few of the thing

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:57.270
that happened to you
within a second or two

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:59.060
of my showing this word.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.500
And every one of the thing
that I'm going to say

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.010
has been confirmed in research,

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:06.530
so it is actually a fact that
although things happen to you,

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:08.440
and not happen actually.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:12.080
Now you couldn't help reading the word,

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.220
so you have no control of
course you read the word.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.400
Now, your mind was probably,

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.090
there were images that came to your mind,

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:21.620
images and memories.

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.720
I can predict that they were not pleasant.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:30.490
Now, your body reacted,
your pupils dilated,

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.420
your heart quickened,

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:36.420
your you know sweat, you sweated a bit,

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.280
you know, all this very weak,

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.190
but all of this has been confirmed.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.760
I mean this is part of
the reaction to this word.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.950
More than that, we could
have measured your face,

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:51.520
and it twisted a bit in
an expression of disgust.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.020
If we took a picture of
the faces in the audience

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.970
within a second or two of this word,

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:57.210
that would have been disgust.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.120
There is more, you recoiled.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.570
There is evidence that people's body,

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:06.670
that their posture reacts and is different

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.880
when a word that is shown
is pleasant or unpleasant.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.900
We approach pleasant words.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.607
We recoil from unpleasant words,

00:38:13.607 --> 00:38:17.120
and there is evidence
that this too happens.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.813
You became more alert and
more vigilant than usual.

00:38:21.739 --> 00:38:26.680
And then if we presented
words in a whisper

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.560
and asked you to recognize them,

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.710
there is a whole set of words
to which you would have,

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:36.430
you are now, you probably
still are unusually sensitive

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:40.920
at words like smells,
stinks, sick, nausea.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.540
All of these words, a
whole cluster of words,

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.450
you are now prepared to recognize

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:47.343
more than you were before.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:52.890
This is an incomplete list
of what happened to you,

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:55.480
and it illustrates one
of the basic mechanisms

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.090
of system one.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:01.870
That's the spreading of ideas
in a network of associations.

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:06.460
And the impressive aspect of
all this complex of reactions

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.480
that happen to you within a second or two

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.533
is its coherence.

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:14.700
And, this is not an accidental
grouping of reactions.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.313
It all makes sense, your
reaction to that single word.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:22.160
Now the connections between the elements

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.580
of this complex of reactions
are not necessarily logical,

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.540
but ideas that have been
correlated in experience

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.083
facilitate each other.

00:39:31.356 --> 00:39:35.890
Now, this mechanism of coherence,

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:40.890
prepares you for things then
and it evaluates surprises,

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.255
and I can't help but tell you

00:39:44.255 --> 00:39:48.563
a story of how this other system works.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.333
Well, some years ago,

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:57.150
we were spending vacation
on a resort island

00:39:58.692 --> 00:40:00.663
on the Barrier Reef, next to Australia.

00:40:02.538 --> 00:40:05.650
It's a small resort, there
40 rooms in that resort.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:08.530
And, we went to dinner the first evening,

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:12.930
and lo and behold there
was a psychologist I know.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:16.350
He's at Stanford, and we were
both really quite surprised,

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:18.710
you know fancy meeting you here.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:22.310
And, that sounded like a coincidence.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:25.330
And then two weeks
later we were in London,

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:26.900
going to the theater,

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.073
and you know we,

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:34.340
theater was dark, somebody
sat to me, next to me,

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:35.670
and I didn't see who it was

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.680
until the lights came up
during the intermission,

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.133
and it was the same person.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.720
And, the thing I want to point out is

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:48.190
I was less surprised the
second time than the first,

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:51.100
because you know what what
I computed immediately

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.730
was all oh, oh that's Crosnik,

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:54.465
Oh, I meet him all over the place.

00:40:54.465 --> 00:40:57.043
(students laughing)
I mean the point is,

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:03.080
we create those associations
very, very quickly.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:07.330
We create, we're ready to form
expectations very quickly.

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.680
This is part of the this mechanism,

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.650
of this associative mechanism.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.700
And you know, sometimes
it will work better

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.290
than at other times.

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:19.160
Now, this system guides interpretations,

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.620
so let me show you how this works.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.900
Now, you can read that silently
and you know what that is,

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:28.500
and you can read that and
you know what that is,

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:33.470
and of course that B and the 13

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:35.470
are physically identical.

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:37.620
I mean it's the same object,

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.980
but you were not aware of this.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:43.780
The context determined
how you read the words

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.130
and you were not aware
that there was ambiguity.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:48.090
You were not aware

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:49.890
that you had suppressed the ambiguity.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:52.640
You were not aware that
there was another way

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.600
of seeing what you saw.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:59.130
The way the system works,
it suppresses ambiguity.

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:04.130
Doubt and ambiguity is mostly
a function of system two.

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.150
System one doesn't have much doubts.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:10.060
It makes choices and it delivers
to a conscious experience

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.810
the choices that it has made

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.533
and we're not aware of
having made the choice.

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:20.140
Well, many of you are
familiar with the subject

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:23.870
which tells us you can see it in two ways.

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:26.720
I guess all of you are
familiar with the subject,

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.990
but the important thing is

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:31.010
you don't see it in two ways at once.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:34.010
You see it in one way, a choice is made.

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:35.360
There are two interpretations,

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.460
and in this case they alternate.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.723
So, those are some
properties of the system.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.390
This associative machinery

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:49.410
has incredible richness and subtlety.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:52.523
That is the feats of
intuition that we see,

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:57.670
attest to the subtlety
of our mental models.

00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:00.670
I mean you know, if I can ask you,

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:02.710
who is more likely to play bridge

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.620
and who is more likely to play poker,

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.910
a Wall Street banker or
an English professor?

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:10.820
Now, most of you know the answer.

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:12.700
There is an answer in the culture.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:16.080
We would expect the Wall
Street banker to play poker

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:19.790
and the professor to play
bridge, if this is what they do.

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:23.490
There is consensus on
answers of this type.

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:25.270
It's all part of the mental model.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:26.680
It is probably not a question

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.920
you have ever asked yourself before,

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.920
but through the network of associations,

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:35.240
that in this case is widely
shared within a culture,

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.650
we can come up with answers to such,

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:40.820
to an infinite number of such questions,

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.500
in you know, the twinkle of an eye,

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:46.033
literally in a blink as
Malcolm Gladwell would say.

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:50.895
We're not prepared to ask
how skills are acquired.

00:43:50.895 --> 00:43:53.970
Skilled activities that can
be performed automatically

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:56.803
are acquired through an
enormous amount of practice.

00:44:00.774 --> 00:44:03.340
For to acquire, to become a chess master,

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.800
the estimate is that it takes
10,000 hours of practice,

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.040
and about the same estimate

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.803
to become a very good violinist.

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:14.100
It is estimated that learning chess,

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.300
that a chess master has acquired

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.120
somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:23.860
discrete configurations of
pieces that are meaningful,

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.283
and that by putting
together these elements,

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:31.200
the chess master is able to construct

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.440
a representation of the situation,

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.123
but practice is not enough.

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:39.380
What is needed for the
acquisition of skill,

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:41.210
is appropriate feedback,

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:45.300
and it's feedback of success
and failure in general,

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.890
and the feedback must be
immediate and unequivocal.

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:52.250
If the feedback is very
delayed or ambiguous,

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:57.210
then learning is retarded
or doesn't occur at all.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:00.530
Now, there are some kinds
of situations in learning,

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:02.420
where feedback is not essential.

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.430
An example, in the learning of threat.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.150
So you can, you know,

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:09.410
a child does not have to be burned by fire

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:13.300
to acquire a fear of fire or
a fear of crossing the street.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.600
So, we can condition and teach emotions,

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.913
and this is part of the learning of skill.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:24.620
And now, I think we may begin to see

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:27.450
why stock pickers and CIA analysts

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:32.210
do not have the opportunity
to develop skills,

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:34.150
or at least skills that are much superior

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:36.120
to those of lay people.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.910
The feedback that they
get on their guesses

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:41.410
and their impressions and their judgments

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:45.030
is neither immediate nor unequivocal.

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:46.910
The feedback is very much delayed.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.400
The system that they're dealing with

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.240
are extremely complicated,

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.410
and especially there is
actually no feedback,

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:55.260
no immediate feedback.

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.550
And because of that,
there are no opportunities

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:01.190
to develop the same kinds of skills

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:03.240
that firefighters can develop,

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.783
and nurses, and chess players.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:12.240
Now, so I'll describe the
machinery of system one,

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:17.240
and why it can, you know I've suggested,

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:21.010
why it can acquire some skills
and cannot acquire others.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:23.410
Now, this is really wonderful machinery,

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:25.670
but it's also incompatible

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:29.720
with a basic requirement of rationality.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.220
That is and now I'm going back

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:34.710
to the first of the conversations
I mentioned earlier,

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:36.410
the conversations with economists.

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:43.330
What we find is that in
the system like that,

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.890
which is associatively coherent,

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.130
the way that you describe outcomes

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:51.170
and the way that you describe problems

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:53.600
is going to make a
great deal of difference

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.630
to how people respond to them.

00:46:55.630 --> 00:47:00.630
So if you describe the statistics
of medical interventions,

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.400
like surgery and radiation therapy,

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.750
it makes a difference whether you say

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:09.310
that during the first month after surgery,

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:11.770
there is 10 percent mortality,

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:16.760
or that survival rate after
one month is 90 percent.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.350
The first description is more frightening

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:20.770
than the second description,

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:22.980
because the word mortality is there,

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.183
and the word survival is in the other.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.860
And when you have that,

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:30.900
indeed physicians, experienced physicians,

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.710
will make different choices

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:36.840
between surgery and radiation therapy,

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:40.060
depending on which of these
formulations is adopted.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.640
We have no control over that.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:46.393
This is an operation of that
displays associative coherence.

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:49.747
You can present the same difference.

00:47:49.747 --> 00:47:52.010
It used to be legal

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:54.240
in the early days of behavior economics,

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:58.280
it was still legal to have
two prices at the gas station,

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:01.260
a different price for cash and for credit,

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:04.370
and you could describe that

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:09.370
either as a cash discount or
as a credit card surcharge.

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.850
Now obviously, one of these descriptions

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:18.220
is much more favorable to
credit cards than the other.

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:20.470
A cash discount, we can forego.

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:22.300
A surcharge, we hate,

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:26.710
and it's at that level
extremely powerful response,

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:29.720
and there is really no way to combat this,

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:33.280
but it is assumed in the
theory of the rational agent

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.410
that this does not occur.

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:39.220
So, in that sense, the
theory of the rational agent,

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:41.160
you know, in the argument
that psychologists

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:44.650
have had with economists is a non-starter.

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:46.800
It really does not recognize

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.700
the way that system one operates.

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:52.484
So these are framing it and framing it.

00:48:52.484 --> 00:48:55.610
Then there are other
kinds of effects that...

00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:01.053
Okay, this is a history
class quiz and here it goes.

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:03.130
I'll go quickly.

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:04.550
Write down the first three numbers

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:06.110
of your home phone number.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.200
Add 400 to this number.

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.830
Consider this total to represent a year

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:12.380
in the common year.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.010
Do you believe that Attila
the Hun was defeated in Europe

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:16.733
before or after this year?

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.820
Okay, and now what is your best guess

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:23.420
about the year of Attila
the Hun's defeat in Europe?

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.990
Now let me show you the results.

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:30.690
Those are the estimates
of, that people gave

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:33.492
as a function of their telephone number.

00:49:33.492 --> 00:49:35.400
(students laughing)

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.540
So, the people whose telephone numbers

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:41.560
ends with high digits end
up with a high estimate

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:45.240
of the year of the
defeat of Attila the Hun.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.760
What is the mechanism here?

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.600
Well, I've described the mechanism.

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.170
It's associative coherence.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:54.680
When you have that number in mind

00:49:56.088 --> 00:50:00.250
and you know, you're asked,
is it too high or too low,

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:01.970
you just think about that number,

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:06.073
just having that number in mind causes you

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:12.720
to bring together associations, whatever,

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:15.780
that make this number more plausible.

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:19.150
This is just part of the
way we work, our mind works.

00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:20.880
We are presented with information.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.311
We try to understand it.

00:50:22.311 --> 00:50:26.100
We don't try, system one
tries to make sense of it

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:29.070
by associative coherence.

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:32.080
And so, we end up with a
different view of history

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.951
depending on whether our telephone numbers

00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:36.713
ends with a high number
or with a small number.

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.610
Let me give you another example of this.

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:45.260
In different countries in Europe,

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.280
there are, I think, eight countries

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:54.280
where the default option
for organ donation

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.380
is that you donate your organs

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.730
in case of death in an accident.

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:01.550
There are six countries
with a default option

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:02.763
is not to donate.

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:09.680
In all 14 countries,
basically what you have to do,

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:13.930
if you want to do
something is to check a box

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:17.270
and choose something that
is not the default option.

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:18.810
What you have here

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:22.470
is the proportion of people
who donate their organs

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:24.180
in the two groups of countries.

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.750
It's an enormous effect.

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:28.640
Now, this is a highly
consequential decision.

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.660
And basically we people do

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:33.720
if they see a default
option, they take it.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:38.370
This by the way is part of
anything that is presented to us,

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:41.090
we have a strong tendency to accept.

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:42.770
We're enormously suggestible

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:46.790
and that is part of the
way that the mind works,

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:50.760
and we can be manipulated
by setting default options

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.833
to quite a remarkable degree.

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:58.310
Let me just recap and tell you a bit

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.280
about what I would have said

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.910
if I was going to waste 10
more minutes of your time,

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:04.660
but I won't actually go through it.

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:10.421
It turns out that there
is a very simple way

00:52:10.421 --> 00:52:13.960
that we go about jumping to conclusions

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.920
and this is by answering
a question that is easier

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.700
than the question we were asked.

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.507
It's a mechanism that psychologists know

00:52:20.507 --> 00:52:23.780
the mechanism heuristic thinking.

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.770
You are asked a complicated question.

00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:27.173
You answer a simple one,

00:52:28.538 --> 00:52:32.390
and usually that works very well.

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:34.360
Very often it works very well.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:38.200
Sometimes it leads you completely astray,

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.567
but that is a mechanism,

00:52:39.567 --> 00:52:42.910
and we are typically not
aware that we're doing this.

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:45.223
So, let me just show you one picture.

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.000
Okay, and the question here is

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.063
what are the size of the
figures on the screen?

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:58.330
Now, they're of equal size.

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:01.080
Now, they don't look as
if they're of equal size.

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.100
They just you know, one of them looks

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:05.620
to be larger than the other two.

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:09.360
What do we do, what's happening here?

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.933
Well, when we look at this object,

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:16.420
we see a three-dimensional scene.

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:18.630
Within a three-dimensional scene,

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:23.130
the most distant person is by
far taller than the others,

00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:25.720
so we have an immediate answer

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.960
to the question of whether
the three-dimensional size

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.310
of these three objects.

00:53:30.310 --> 00:53:32.080
That's a natural assessment.

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:34.410
Now, that's not the
question you were asked.

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:35.980
The question you were asked was,

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:38.380
what is the size on the screen,

00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:42.080
but there is an answer to an
easier question, far easier.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.740
It thrusts itself where you don't want it,

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:46.460
and that's the one you see.

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:48.800
And it turns out that this mechanism

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:53.280
is at work all over the place
in cognitive operations,

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.230
and it causes us to,

00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:57.760
it causes people to
have very quick answers

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:00.680
to question that really
baffle the experts,

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.200
and that's typically
because people are answering

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:06.090
not the question that the
experts is trying to answer,

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:09.000
but a different and
somewhat easier question.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.520
So, what have I tried to do?

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.810
I've tried to acquaint you with a way

00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:15.503
of thinking about intuition,

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.860
which distinguishes two
systems in the mind,

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:20.760
system one and system two.

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.290
I've spoken of system one,

00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:25.310
which is the system, the intuitive system.

00:54:25.310 --> 00:54:27.990
I think the principle
idea that I've proposed

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:31.500
is this notion of associative coherence,

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:33.810
which explains a great
deal of the workings

00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:35.781
of this mechanism.

00:54:35.781 --> 00:54:40.010
And, the other issue that I've raised,

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.500
not fully satisfactorily answered,

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:46.170
is that if we want to understand
what skills are required,

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:48.600
and what skills are not acquired,

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:52.490
we need to look very
carefully at the interaction

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:54.290
between the environmental,

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:55.817
the conditions in the environment,

00:54:55.817 --> 00:54:58.730
and the feedback the environment provides,

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:00.690
and the opportunities for learning

00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:02.550
in the associative network.

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.983
Thank you.
