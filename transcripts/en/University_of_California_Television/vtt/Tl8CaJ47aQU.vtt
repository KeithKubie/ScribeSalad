00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:07.962
(bright music)

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large brained.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.913
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.883
Yet, filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.243
We grow up slowly, we hand down knowledge,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.893
we empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.020
We shape the future

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.693
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.713
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.950
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.513
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.680
(techy music)

00:01:20.603 --> 00:01:23.186
(upbeat music)

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.260
- Alright, so to address this question,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.820
the impact of tool use and technology

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.580
on the evolution of the human mind,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.550
I wanna begin by addressing this question.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.300
How can we account for our species

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.120
immense ecological dominance

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.220
and our stunning technological prowess?

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.960
Now when people approach this question,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.020
they come to it with certain intuitions.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.910
Intuitions that we're smart,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.742
we're good at building causal
models of how the world works,

00:02:00.742 --> 00:02:02.630
we're good at individually figuring out,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.810
and this must be the
secret of our success.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.130
But it turns out that
that's not the best story,

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.760
and that we're actually not that good

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.190
at figuring things out.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.020
What I'm gonna try to convince you today,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.880
is that in fact there's another
way of approaching this,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.350
and there's a different explanation

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.850
for the secret of our success.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.580
Okay, so I'm gonna just begin
with a little bit of data.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.240
This comes from a battery
of cognitive tests

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.240
administered to three different species,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.050
so two and 1/2 year old humans,
chimpanzees, and orangutans,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.840
and this research is
done by Esther Herrmann

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.160
and Mike Tomasello at
the Max Planck Institute

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.033
for Evolutionary Anthropology.

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:41.860
18 different cognitive tests broken down

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.223
into three different areas.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.100
Space, subset of tests on space,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.620
quantities, causality,
and social learning.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.090
And what you can see from
this figure here is that...

00:02:55.747 --> 00:02:57.710
The humans do about as well as the chimps,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.470
they get about 70% right on the space,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.210
the chimps actually do slightly better

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.330
than the humans on quantity.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.310
So that's within the margin of error,

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.960
but the chimps do a little bit better.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.235
And same thing on causality,

00:03:09.235 --> 00:03:11.500
the chimps do marginally better.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.290
Now, if you dig into the causality test

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.774
and look specifically at the tests

00:03:14.774 --> 00:03:17.120
that try to measure
differences in tool using,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.520
the chimps actually do
much better on tool using

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.080
than the two and 1/2 year old children.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.220
Now I think the real telling point here

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.110
is that if I were to give these,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.540
this battery of cognitive
tests to you guys,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.970
you would blow the roof off the test,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.680
and you'd do much better than the apes.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.000
So between two and going
up well into the 20s,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.690
we get better and better at these kinda,

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.470
solving these cognitive problems.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.020
So something is happening
during that time.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.020
Meanwhile, if we look at the chimpanzees,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.990
there's no change over
the course of their lives,

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.970
in fact, sometimes the young chimpanzees,

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.410
the five year old chimpanzees,

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.130
are better at the tasks
than the older chimpanzees.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.230
So that's a hint to what
must be going on there.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.680
There's nothing special about
these particular measures.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.060
I could show you data on working memory,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.980
whereas chimps and humans
engaging in strategic thinking,

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.810
and you would see that there's no

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.590
particular human advantage in this.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.760
Another way of getting at this

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.890
would be to think about taking this room

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.200
of very smart people

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.780
and parachuting you into the Ituri forest,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.130
or into the Amazon Basin,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.083
and having you try to survive.

00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:19.217
(laughter)

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:20.330
You would no doubt struggle,

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.560
you couldn't start fire,
you couldn't make tools.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.730
If it was a game of survivor,

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.742
you would probably lose
to Dorothy's capuchins.

00:04:27.742 --> 00:04:28.887
(laughter)

00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:30.670
So we're clearly missing something.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.760
Humans rely on this large
body of cultural inheritance.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.400
So it's not our innate intelligence,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.750
or our problem solving abilities,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.470
or our ability to build
causal models on the fly,

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.493
but something else.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.550
So where do our fancy tools
and technologies come from?

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.420
I'm gonna make the case

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.620
that it comes from our collective brain.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.380
And particularly our
collective brain is anchored

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.770
in our cultural natures
and social natures.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.200
These are two separate things.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.910
Our cultural natures is our
ability to learn from others,

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.860
to look out into the minds and behaviors

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.510
of others in our social milieu,

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.540
and filter out and learn ideas,
beliefs, values, practices

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.180
from other members of our group.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.960
The social part is that
for various reasons,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.310
we're able to live in large groups,

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.120
and the larger the group, the better.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.960
The more we're able to generate
ideas, beliefs, and values

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.570
that are adapted to our environments,

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.403
more sophisticated technologies.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.190
Alright, now to get at this question

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.953
from an evolutionary perspective.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.050
This approach was actuality
Marcus Feldman lead us off today

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.900
in 1976 he wrote a paper with
Luca Luigi Cavalli-Sforza,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.690
in which they made the first effort

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.100
to take the logic of natural selection

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.330
of genetic evolution and to think about

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.780
how it might've shaped our
psychology for cultural learning.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.570
Our abilities to adaptively
extract ideas, beliefs,

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.960
and values from other
members of our social group.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.715
Others like Boyden
Richardson went to build on,

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:51.810
build a large research
program on that process.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.420
And since then, there's been
a great deal of research,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.860
much of it with young children,

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.240
showing that from even before age one,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.080
we keenly attend to who we learn from,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.260
so we learn from certain individuals,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.590
or particular about what we learn from

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.950
how we integrate information
across individuals,

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.731
and when we choose to use social learning

00:06:09.731 --> 00:06:12.260
over our own intuitions
or our own experience.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.610
Together, when you put all this together

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.710
in large groups over many generations,

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.100
it produces what I call
cultural adaptations,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.410
and this includes the fancy
tools and technologies

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.510
that we're so impressive
for in the natural world.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.690
Now this process can, and often does,

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.970
operate outside of conscious awareness.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.140
One of my favorite things
to do is to regale people

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.650
with many, many examples
of all the ways in which

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.970
cultural evolution
builds adaptive behavior

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.380
in ways that are unconscious
and unseen behind the scenes.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.410
I'll just give you one example today.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.950
It's something you're already
familiar with, spices.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.340
So people use spices in different ways,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.730
different cultures have
different spicing traditions,

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.560
some places use many more spices

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.540
in their recipes than other places.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.760
But once you realize that
spices are an adaptation

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.060
to the problem of food born pathogens,

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.980
you can predict a whole
bunch of things about

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.920
the kinds of plants
for which we'll harvest

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.410
their chemical properties
and put them in our foods,

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.280
which societies will tend
to use a lot of spices,

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.970
which spices they'll use,

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.780
and how they'll recombine
spices in syngenetic ways

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.920
that make it more powerful
and more anti-microbial.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.640
And you can predict which kinds of foods.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.850
And this can all happen
outside of conscious awareness,

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.160
many of you probably didn't
know that spicing was

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.070
protecting against food born pathogens,

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.440
and in some cases, it's
even possible to show that

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.970
if people understood,
they might be less likely

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.910
to do the behavior, and
it would be maladaptive.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.576
So understanding is a bad thing.

00:07:32.576 --> 00:07:34.420
(laughter)

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.463
In some cases.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.870
When you begin to build models

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.210
and think about how humans learn,

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.880
so we take what we know
about human learning,

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.650
and we allow humans to learn in groups

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.270
and are connected in different ways,

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.650
one of the robust
findings from what is now

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.580
a decent body of literature,

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.470
is that larger and more
innerconnected populations

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.560
evolve technologies and tools
and other aspects of culture

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.840
more quickly and adapting
to their environment,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.400
and their ability to hold and preserve

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.960
large bodies of different tools
and technologies is bigger,

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.170
is more, they can hold
more in larger populations.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.940
Even more interesting, and
something that you can use

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.410
to solve various puzzles
throughout human history

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.243
and around the world

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:16.360
is that a sudden reduction
in the size of a population

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.710
will cause populations
to ebb away technology,

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.083
to lose things over time.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.530
Now, one piece of evidence
that I like for this

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.780
is research done by Michelle
Kline and Robert Boyd,

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.220
and what these anthropologists did,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.810
is they went back to the ethnography

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.280
from societies all over Polynesia,

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.120
and they coded marine foraging technology.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.700
And they counted the number of tools

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.150
these different islands
around the Pacific had,

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.400
and they also assessed the complexity.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.840
And you can see here,
this is an example of how

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.280
very simple method
developed by Wendell Oswalt,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.580
in which you just count
the parts in the tool,

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.330
and you can get a number of
techno-units for that tool.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.330
Show you the results here, quickly.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.230
In this plot here on this side,

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.090
you can see this is the population size,

00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:59.470
it's a log scale.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.870
These dots are the different islands,

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.610
and this is the number of tools.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.840
So larger islands had more different kinds

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.910
of tools for marine foraging.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.100
And this is the mean
number of techno-units,

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.870
so not only did larger
islands have more total tools,

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.950
those tools were on average more complex,

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.900
they had more parts.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.320
You can see that they also
differentiated by contact,

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.650
so in addition to the population size,

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.160
they got a measure of how
connected the islands were.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.680
And islands that had more contact

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.520
with other islands in the Pacific,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.560
they're above the line,

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.110
which means that, they have
an extra boost over and above

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.720
their population size from
the interconnectedness,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.910
from being a little
bit more interconnected

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.483
with other populations.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.310
One thing that's interesting
from the point of view

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.370
of looking back at the
paleo-anthropological record,

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.350
is it's not an uncommon
practice to try to infer things

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.780
about the cognition of ancient creatures

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.440
based on the kinda tools they make.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.730
But if you were to use
that same approach here,

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.540
you would deduce that the
folks who lived in Hawaii,

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.620
traditionally, were much smarter

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.270
and more mentally sophisticated

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.970
than the folks who lived in a small island

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.393
off the coast of New Guinea.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.610
The lesson here is that it's really

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.440
the collective brain
that's doing the work,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.810
not the individual smarts
of the people in the brain.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.570
Incidentally, this was part
of the Austronesian expansion,

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.120
so it's relatively recent.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.863
We can be confident there aren't
genetic differences there.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.200
Okay.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.293
Alright, now I don't want you to think

00:10:22.293 --> 00:10:25.890
that this is just interesting
for thinking about

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.730
ancient Polynesian societies.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.140
So I put in this plot, which is US cities

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.200
and the number of innovations they produce

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.600
based on patent data.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.340
So the larger the US city, over 10,000,

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.680
the more patents they produce.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.130
That's not too interesting in that,

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.970
we would expect larger
cities to have more people

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.290
to produce more patents.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.480
But this is a super linear relationship.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.130
Which means controlling for things like

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.750
education and occupation,

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.970
the same person put into a larger city

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.750
is more likely to produce
patents and innovations.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.520
So the people get more
innovative in larger cities,

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.520
there's a number of data sets
showing the same relationship.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.163
Okay, now those are all
interesting correlations,

00:11:07.407 --> 00:11:08.870
but we can't be too confident

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.730
there's actually a causal relationship.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.580
So what researchers have done
is to go to the laboratory

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.630
and try to create micro-societies,

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.460
which allow us to get some insights.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.730
The typical micro-society that's been used

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.400
by a number of different researchers,

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.970
is to take a bunch of,
say 100 undergraduates,

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.850
and create generations.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.710
So each individual gets a
task that they have to solve,

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.520
they do their best on the task,

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.020
my tradition likes to pay
people for right answers,

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.600
and then they transmit the
information in some way

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.850
down to another generation
of undergraduates,

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.270
you know, laboratory generations.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.420
Who then takes that
information, does their best,

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.650
and passes it down.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.120
So we're gonna run this
for 10 generations.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.360
Now the key thing in this
setup is that in this,

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.630
the individual condition,

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.500
you can only learn from one teacher.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.830
So not much interconnectedness.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.470
In this condition, you could learn

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.940
from any one of the five
in the prior generations,

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.870
so you could potentially recombine ideas

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.333
from different individuals.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.320
They had to replicate this image

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.800
with a notoriously user
unfriendly image editing program,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.000
and they had a time limit.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.770
As I mentioned, they're
paid for their performance,

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:14.890
but they're also incentivized

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.350
for their student's performance.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.040
So they get more money if
they send good instructions,

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.440
which then after the task,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.940
they can write up to two pages,

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.040
which goes down to the next generation.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.290
It allows us to analyze the
kinds of things people said.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.890
In the next generation,
everybody after generation one,

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.350
they get the model's product,

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.630
which they can compare to
the target image, this image,

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.850
and they get the write-up,

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.200
and then they have a go
at the task themselves.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.330
This is the results, so 10 generations.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.300
You can see here in generation one,

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.900
they actually had a pretty good group

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.179
of the single learning tradition group.

00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:52.870
But in the more interconnected group,

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.760
they didn't have such a lucky first group.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.820
But here, accumulative cultural

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.760
evolutionary process kicked in,

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.589
where they could take from
the previous generation,

00:13:00.589 --> 00:13:01.810
they could add to it,

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.090
any lucky insights were brought together,

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.863
and then passed down so that by the end,

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.940
the 10th generation is twice as skilled

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.303
as the 10th generation
in the other treatment.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:16.660
Not only that, if you break down

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.570
and look at the data individually,

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:22.110
the worst person in the
interconnected population,

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.120
so the population that
could learn from others,

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.390
is better than the best person
in the single population,

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.410
where you just have one-to-one learning.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.120
So it makes a big difference in how

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.400
apparently smart people look.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.650
It looks like they can
just do things better.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.113
Alright.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.810
I wanna get back to the question
I began at the beginning

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.483
when I introduced the apes and the humans.

00:13:47.973 --> 00:13:50.460
This was the idea that,
so something from going

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.210
from a two and 1/2 year
old when your cognition

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.000
is not that much better than a chimpanzee,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.990
'til you're 20-something,

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.460
when you can blow the roof off the test,

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.500
what happens there?

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.660
And part of what's going on here,

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.740
is a download of prebuilt solutions

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.080
that have accumulated in our
inherited body of knowhow

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.600
over many generations.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.110
So simple things like springs, and screws,

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.740
and levers, and pulleys,

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.600
are hard to invent for the first time.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.530
But once you grow up in an environment

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.940
that has springs, and screws,
and levers, and pulleys,

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:24.820
they're easy to figure out and
then reapply to new contexts.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.480
One example that I like is the wheel.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.250
It seems relatively simple.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.410
You see Gary Larson cartoons
with ancient human ancestors

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.670
experimenting with wheels, but actually,

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.450
the wheel arrives relatively
late in human history,

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:38.970
about 6,000 years ago.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.080
It appears on carts and then pottery.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.570
Eventually it's used to transfer
power, but only in Eurasia.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.520
It doesn't appear in the North America,

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.200
South America, Oceania, Australia.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.600
So they don't invent wheels.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.460
Sometimes people have pointed to

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.070
certain kinds of animals being present,

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.470
but the dog's everywhere,

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.680
and you can see the Belgians here

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.640
are using this dog to pull their cart.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.390
So there's at least some kind
of animals that can pull.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:04.840
And then once you have wheels,

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.600
you can do all kinds of things with them.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.480
Elastically stored energy
used to make a bow and arrow,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.360
never invented in Australia.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.820
You don't see anything with
elastically stored energy.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.790
Fletching is not invented in New Guinea,

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.080
although, New Guinea folks
do have bows and arrows.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.860
We heard from Raphael
about the counting systems.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.310
So lots of societies like
Machiguenga, who I worked with,

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:25.783
count one, two, three, many.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.870
This group counts to 27,

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.635
you can see Raphael and I
read the same literature.

00:15:31.635 --> 00:15:33.380
(chuckling)

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.670
You can find everything in between,

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:38.750
so you can find groups
that count to 11, 13, 36,

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.450
some groups figure out how to cycle.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.000
But you guys have all been bequeathed

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.420
a counting system that allows
you to count without bound.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.730
Another example is the number zero.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.500
So the number zero, as a placeholder,

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.630
has only been invented
twice in human history.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.140
Once by the Mayans and
the second time in India.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.373
It diffuses to Europe
through Islamic societies.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.760
My favorite example is the abacus.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.750
So you can track the
evolution of the abacus

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.400
from babylonian counting boards,

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.856
and you can see how the
abacus is evolving culturally,

00:16:07.856 --> 00:16:11.280
the tech use of how we use
space and how we clump things,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.170
in order to exploit aspects
of our evolved cognition.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.760
But then, what's amazing to me,

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.990
is that children can train on the abacus,

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.240
the physical device, and then
with sufficient training,

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.120
they can put the abacus aside.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.680
And then you can give them incredibly

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.560
complex calculation problems,

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.560
where they're adding up large
numbers, 10 or 15 of them,

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.670
and they do it, you can
see their fingers moving,

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.250
and they're not touching
anything physical,

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.830
and they seem to be looking up in the air,

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.750
and then suddenly they
come out with the answer.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.837
They have races between the mental abacus

00:16:40.837 --> 00:16:42.140
and the calculator.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.996
So this is a whole new cognitive ability,

00:16:43.996 --> 00:16:47.301
that's kinda bootstrapped up
from this physical apparatus,

00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:51.083
which evolved culturally to
fit aspects of our minds.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.680
So this gives us a different picture

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.810
of how humans have evolved.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.300
So culture-driven genetic evolution.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.800
Sometime in our species'
evolutionary history,

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.940
I think it happened before
bout two million years ago,

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.060
we became a species with
accumulative cultural evolution.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.770
What we passed down from one generation

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.783
was built upon by the next generation.

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.980
How this happened, if you wanna know that,

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.610
you'll have to read my book,
The Secret of Our Success.

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.500
I actually favor a kind
of social explanation,

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.230
so if we became more social
and had larger groups,

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:28.220
that could push a group of
primates across this threshold,

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.490
what I call the rubicon,

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.300
and this lead to ongoing
cultural evolution.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.280
Now of course, genetic
evolution doesn't stop,

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.660
it hasn't stopped now.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.220
So we have two parallel
inheritance systems,

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.270
and these inheritance
systems have been interacting

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.180
over millions of years, potentially,

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.810
or at least hundreds of thousands.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.580
So you can produce
things like stone tools,

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.980
like Dietrich told us about,

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.270
that allow you to process food

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.210
and reduce the selection
pressure on your teeth,

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:53.900
and your chewing apparatus.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.010
It can produce things
like fire and cooking,

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.340
which allows us to externalize
our digestive system,

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.603
and shrink our colons,
shrink our stomachs.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.270
It supplies energy to allow
us to have larger brains,

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.710
gives us extra dexterity in
our hands to use those tools,

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.370
and in particular, in this world,

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.150
our brains are being selected

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.190
for their ability to
acquire, organize, store,

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.318
and retransmit cultural information.

00:18:18.318 --> 00:18:21.720
We're cultural learners,
that's because the more

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.300
our brains get better at
doing this culture thing,

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.140
the more accumulative cultural
evolution is gonna create

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.530
things that we need to learn.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.410
So now the game is that
all the valuable stuff

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.290
I need to know is in the
minds of the prior generation,

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.050
and if I can learn something from him,

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.020
and something from him,
and something from her,

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:37.990
then I can recombine them

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.640
and have an even better
cultural repertoire.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.660
So things like throwing and
finding tubers underground,

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.640
water containers can allow us to engage in

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.730
long distance running,
and persistent hunting,

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.930
this is gonna create a
pressure for even larger brains

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.210
to learn all those tools and technologies.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.420
Clothings and adhesives,
eventually projectiles,

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.430
and this can explain why we have,

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.510
what we seem to have a
specialized cognition

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.140
for learning about artifacts,

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.090
and we regard and learn about
those in a different way,

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.480
than we learn about things
in the biological world,

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.690
so plants and animals.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.900
And in particular, it helps explain

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.430
why we're willing to put faith

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.760
in the wisdom of prior generations.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.280
Developmental psychologists
call this over-imitation,

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.960
why we copy all the steps,

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.090
but it also explains
why we might be willing

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.560
to believe in invisible beings

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.140
or other magical powers.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.870
There's a lot of wisdom in the tradition,

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.650
and we can't always tell what
the useful information is

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.470
from the not-so-useful information.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.310
So the key to understanding humans

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:37.323
is to recognize this long term
period of dual inheritance.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.290
And that's it.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.540
(applause)

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:47.935
(bright music)
