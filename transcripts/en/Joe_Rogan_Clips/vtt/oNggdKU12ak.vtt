00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.880
The Joe Rogan experience,
but then there's people like Hank Shaw who is a,

2
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:10.881
also a world famous chef who is also a hunter who prefers older animals cause he

3
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:16.650
thinks there's like there's flavor to them and there's life to them like that

4
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:19.890
they're,
they're aging and all their life experience,

5
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:21.510
it comes out if you cook them correctly,

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.420
it just requires a different sort of preparation.
All right.
It's Kinda like,

7
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.300
it's Kinda like a young women versus older women,

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.940
like young women have a lot of positives about them,

9
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:34.710
but older women have just as many positives about them.
Older women,
that flavor,

10
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.610
that's what you want,
right?
You want to check who's like,
yeah,

11
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.480
who didn't give a six plus,
who hits the gym every day.
Trust me,

12
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.570
I know.
I,
I've had this conversation about the whole life.

13
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.890
If we stop working out,
it's over.
I say if we stopped working for like we,

14
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:53.330
if we stop exercising and caring about our health,
it's all there.
It's over fact.

15
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.400
No,
I mean like I wanted to sign up.
I wanted my,
uh,

16
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.760
one of my lawyer as a joke to sign a document that says if we,
if we get fat,

17
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.310
it's like a free and clear gone.
But I mean it,
if she gets fat out,

18
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.000
if I get that she should be out.

19
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.620
If either of us break this thing that we're doing together,

20
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.440
what if it brings you closer than we've met?

21
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.610
She gets fed up to worry about body image anymore.
Fuck you.
Just let yourself go.

22
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:17.910
Fuck that.
Come on.
Fuck that shit.
Hey,
hey.

23
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.060
Hey shaming right now when you realize it or not.
I am.

24
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:25.830
I know you don't want to see him
show you fat.
Fuck.

25
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.400
I can't believe you.
I just think,
I think we've made a bond together.

26
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:30.330
We made a pact.
We were like,

27
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:32.880
we both want to stay relatively healthy and take care of ourselves.

28
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.691
So in our older years,

29
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:36.750
like my parents are both in really great shape because they've cared their whole

30
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:40.290
lives.
Not to a point of like,
you know,
not having fun.

31
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.370
They still have a great fucking time,
but no,

32
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.600
but just they just stayed consistent with like caring about what you put in your

33
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:49.680
body and the way you work.
Yes.
Simple Shit.
So yeah,
if she gets fat by,

34
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.320
if I get that she's by two,
if I get fucking fat,
she's gone.
She even said it.

35
00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:56.370
She was like,
I'll leave your fat ass being fat.

36
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:59.700
It's such a weird one that people call people fat who aren't fat.
Right.

37
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.080
I need to fucking know.
But I'm just saying like as an insult.

38
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.550
It's such a weird one.
It is because like girls will call girls fat.

39
00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:11.520
Like that fat bitch look at her like you're not fat.
No.
What he's saying,

40
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.450
it's just,
it's a dig.
It's another gift for you.
You Fat.
Fuck.

41
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:18.920
Like guys will say that the guys that like barely have any fat on bed.

42
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.560
Fuck you to know their cheeseburger.
Jamie,
you fed fuck.
Fuck that it,

43
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.280
it's an easy day.
Yeah.
It's an easy insult to the how to grow.

44
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.570
Call me fat at the comp.

45
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.870
There's a video of it online who grow calling me fat at the comedy store in a

46
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.090
pull up.
My recently my six pack,

47
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.860
no wait long time now it looks like you're just crazy,
but it was like,

48
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:41.880
why am I fat?
Like what?
Where are you coming up with that?
You're fucking,

49
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:46.190
you're fat.
I bet you're we,
it's weird the the,

50
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.560
the fact that the body can carry excess tissue.

51
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.200
Yeah.
It's a mistake.
Like I get it.

52
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:58.130
It's a good way to store fuel and when it gets to a point like why are you still

53
00:02:58.131 --> 00:02:58.460
hungry?

54
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.770
What kind of Shitty do we have that you're this big and you're still hungry.

55
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.700
You should say,
hey bro,
bro,
bro Bro,
stop.
We got the fuel.

56
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.490
But it does not put to your body's working off carbohydrates.

57
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:11.830
That's a problem and it's not burning fat.

58
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.640
That's why that whole Keto genic diet works as much as people don't like to

59
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:16.474
think that it does.

60
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.990
There's so much controversy about that like from non scientists,

61
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.010
which is hilarious.

62
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.670
Have you talked to actual scientists like Dom D'agostino who talked to you about

63
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:25.990
the peer reviewed research?

64
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.190
That's been done on ketogenic states and all the different benefits and what you

65
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:34.120
know and how it can be healthy and how he does it and Ketone esters and all

66
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:37.180
these different factors you have to take into consideration the ketone testing

67
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:41.710
and blood testing it.
There's all these knuckleheads saying it's bad for you.

68
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.680
It's not a good idea.
Like Julian Michael's like it's not a good idea.

69
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.490
It's not good.
You better stop.
They say that as a benefit.
Seven pounds,
right?

70
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.720
It's a normal state.

71
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:54.190
It's a normal state for your body to burn fat and you have more clarity and

72
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:58.930
you'll also,
you're not as hungry.
You're not as hungry during the day.
My,

73
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.490
my problem with it is I don't think it's the best thing for performance.

74
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.630
I think like you have a little bit more energy if he,

75
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.280
you burn glucose too.
Cause even like the top,
uh,
there's uh,

76
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.230
Zack bitter.
He wouldn't even when the American hero brand 20,

77
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.080
he ran a hundred miles in like 11 hours around a track.

78
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.960
These guys that could do this shit.
It was some crazy record.

79
00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:27.730
Two miles and I need to chill for a minute.
Some crazy,

80
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.560
some crazy record for a hundred mile record.
He broke a 11 hours,

81
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:35.800
40 minutes or seconds.
That's insane that I met a mild,

82
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.430
say seven minutes and I'll smile hundred fucking miles.

83
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.690
Now he is on primarily a carnivore diet.

84
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.670
All meat,
all meat.
Rib-Eyes barely,
barely any meat and fat,

85
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.050
barely any Greens,
right?
Barely any greens.
But then when he competes,

86
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.670
he takes a lot of glucose.
Like he'll take like Glucose Gel,

87
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.710
like those gels,
Gel packets,
those runners use,

88
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.130
he pounds in that shed pounds in the carbs.
So he could burn that off too.
Right.

89
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.090
You know,
cause he's living off for like fat and protein.

90
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.860
But when he competes,
he doesn't do that.
And the thing,

91
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.150
I think that's the key.
You're saying when he competes,
he does use the glucose.

92
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:20.890
But when he's done competing,
he doesn't fucking,

93
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.340
he goes back to putting his body into a fat burning state.
