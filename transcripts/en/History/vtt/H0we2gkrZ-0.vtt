00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.620
- There’s a nest
right here somewhere.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.000
- Let’s roll.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.080
- I find myself at a time now

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.580
when the alligators
went from a time

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.170
when they were barely extinct

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.710
to just a population explosion.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.290
It’s almost to the point
to where it’s us against them.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.040
There’s a nest
right here somewhere.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.080
Alligator season’s
only for a short time.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.620
The egg-collecting program
is important

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.830
if you’re gonna get

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.750
the alligator population
under control.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.750
We use helicopters to fly

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.540
and find the nest
over the open marsh.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.580
We’ll mark the nest with a GPS,

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.380
and then I take those eggs
and bring them to the farm

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.830
where we could take the eggs,
hatch some,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.750
use that
as a commercial business,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.460
and return some to the wild.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.880
But even with that,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.380
these alligators
are still thriving.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.460
- Whoa!
- There she is.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.120
- Give me your paddle.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.960
- The egg collection
requires a person like me

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.670
to go up to the nest,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.880
and then you’re gonna have

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.500
to take the eggs
away from the mother.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.120
And we can’t carry a gun,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.380
so it’s you and mad mama.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.750
- Give me that paddle.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.750
- Wait, wait, wait.
Watch it.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.250
Wait, dad.
He might get in the boat.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.250
Hold on.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.250
Get your box, man.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.460
It’s a standoff,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.710
but I’m not leaving
without my...come on.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.580
- Get back!

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.670
- Come on.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.080
Come on.
Come on, girl.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.250
- Watch him, watch him!

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.710
- Hold on.
Come on, girl, come on.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.120
Whoa!

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.460
Get back!

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.540
Come on, girl, get--

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.750
Come on.
- Like a bulldog.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.330
- Give us a break!
- Man!

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.540
- Come on!

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.540
Come on.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.460
- Okay, now we got a break.
All right.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.000
- Watch it! Aah!

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.290
Get back! Come on!

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.330
Try to get the eggs.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.580
Okay,
you’re gonna have to hurry.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.540
Oh! Watch it, dad.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.380
She came over my paddle!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.290
Wait. Come on, girl.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.380
All right,
let’s get back in the boat.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.500
I don’t wanna
turn my back on her

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.790
’cause she’s mean as hell.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.290
All right, let’s go.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.540
- That’s 36 less alligators
in the wild, dad,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.540
to destroy everything.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.710
- Let’s roll.
