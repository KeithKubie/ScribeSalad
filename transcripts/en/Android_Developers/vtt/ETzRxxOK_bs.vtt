00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.180
Hey, Android Developers.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.580
I'm Joe Fernandez of the Android
Developer Relations team.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.280
Today I'll explain how to record
a video of your Android app

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.580
using the new screen record
feature of Android KitKat.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.460
To use this feature,
you'll need a device

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.460
running Android KitKat, like the
Nexus 5, and a micro USB cable.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.990
No video camera required.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.020
So why record a video
of your Android app?

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.260
Good question.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.500
A video is an effective way
to demonstrate your app.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.140
And it gives users a quick
way to see how your app works

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.720
and what it can do
before they download it.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.480
So it's a great
promotional tool.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.060
Creating a video that explains
how to use advanced features

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.521
or correct common mistakes is
also a great use of app videos.

00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:52.270
Is there a question
about your application

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.000
you get asked over and over?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.810
Record a video to show
your users how it's done.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.110
So what do you need to use
the screen record feature?

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.790
Well, you need a device
running Android KitKat,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.750
such as the Nexus 5.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.760
You also need a computer
with the Android Debug

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.200
Bridge installed.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.820
If you have an Android software
development kit installed

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.240
on your machine, then
you already have ADB.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.370
Finally, you'll need
a micro USB cable

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.490
to connect the computer
to your device.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.500
As I mentioned, you
don't need a video camera

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.710
to use screen record.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.670
However, this feature
does not record audio.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.560
So if you want to
narrate your video,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.480
you need to use something to
record your voice as you demo.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.680
I recommend using a
second Android device

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.520
with an app that does
high-definition voice

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.690
recording.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.370
Here are the steps
to record a video.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.890
First, connect your USB
cable from your computer

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.187
to your device.

00:01:42.187 --> 00:01:43.770
Then make sure it's
working by running

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.320
a test command,
such as ADB Devices.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.020
Type the screen record command
to start recording, and then

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.270
perform your demo on the device.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.070
If you're doing
narration of your demo,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.194
don't forget to turn
on your voice recorder.

00:01:58.194 --> 00:02:00.360
When you're done with your
demo, press the Control C

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.890
to end the recording.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.990
Finally, download
the recorded video

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.280
to your computer using
the pull command.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.240
Here's a video I recorded using
the screen record feature.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.590
It shows a quick walk-through
of the Android KitKat user

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.680
interface.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.870
I recorded this video using
only commands I just showed you.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.715
Notice that there are no hands
or fingers in this video.

00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:24.180
This is a direct recording
of the screen activity,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.740
including the animations
and user actions.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.160
The moving circle is
a touch indicator.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.530
I'll explain how to turn on that
indicator later in this video.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.950
Here's some pro tips for
producing a great app video.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.680
Write a rough script or outline
of what you want to demo.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.670
The script doesn't
have to be elaborate.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.570
Just listing a
few key steps will

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.080
help you create a complete
video more quickly.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.970
Practice the demo a couple
of times before recording it.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.340
Practicing will improve the
quality of your presentation

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.030
and help you discover
parts of your demo

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.710
where you can improve your flow.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.500
Pay attention to the speed
of your onscreen actions.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.450
If your explanation is lagging
behind your onscreen gestures,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.700
slow down and try
pausing between actions.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.000
Use the developer
settings to show touches.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.860
This option displays
that moving circle

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.190
you saw in my demo video.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.160
Turn this feature on
in the settings app.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.430
It's in the Developer Options
page under the Input heading.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.000
Record while you
demonstrate your app.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.900
This makes adding narration
to your video a lot easier.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.910
Also, remember to
start recording video

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.050
before you start
audio recording.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.540
That makes it easier to fit
your audio to your video

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.670
during editing.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.320
Finally, use a
separate microphone

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.890
for recording your voice.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.060
Built-in microphones
work, but you'll typically

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.790
get better audio quality with
a separate microphone that's

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.630
held close to your mouth.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.150
YouTube is a great way
to distribute your video.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.930
You can use YouTube Video
Editor to do some basic editing,

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.860
including adding a
music track, which

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.722
can make your promotional
videos a lot more engaging.

00:03:55.722 --> 00:03:57.430
If you're adding
narration to your video,

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.470
you'll need to use a
video editor application

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.130
to add your voice audio
track to your video

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.340
before you upload it to YouTube.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.090
On Windows, check out Movie
Maker for this purpose.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.620
On Apple, iMovie, and
on Linux, try Kdenlive.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.230
For more details of the screen
record feature of KitKat,

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.730
check out this link.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.370
Have a great time
making those app videos.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.319
I'm Joe Fernandez, and
thanks for watching.
