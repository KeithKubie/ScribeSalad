Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
I'm still in San Francisco.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.270
I was hanging out with Jake from the Key of
Awesome, but he just left to go to the

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.040
Big Sur,

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.389
so yeah, I'm alone hanging out with some
art and uhm,

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.110
well, doing my laundry. But it's okay, because I did
some research and found some things you

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.559
can do

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.740
online now guys. As a bonus we've got a
special guest coming up,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.010
who helped me do some research this week.
Rinry from RinryGameGame. She does

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.039
really great video game history
episodes that are quite Vsauce-y.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.449
Let's have some fun.
First things first, Cat Mario

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.510
is so difficult it's hilarious.
But Class 3 Outbreak.com

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.700
lets you create and play zombie warfare maps anywhere

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.920
in the world, even your own backyard,
using Google Maps.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.170
qKirbyp recommended Draw a stick man,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.940
as did a lot of you. Why?
Because this game is super creative.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.010
You draw your own character
and the game animates them.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.210
You have to draw items and solutions to
get them through the story.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.860
Now, when you finish, celebrate like
weeMAN1300 by doing

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.890
the Ugly Dance.com.
You can upload your own photo here,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.439
give yourself some real time moves and
even share your dancing self with a

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.140
unique

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.430
URL. As you know, I've been traveling and
it's been difficult

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.840
for me to research the DONGs that
you guys deserve. But luckily,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.979
Rinry from RinryGameGame,
right here on YouTube, whose channel

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.470
I love, has come in to save the day.
Here's an added bonus.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.250
Rinry has the cutest voice on YouTube.
Don't believe me?

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.509
Well, guess what, she's right behind me.
Hey Rinry, how do you doing?

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.549
Hey Michael, I'm Rinry.
I'm not gonna say much

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.030
right now, because my voice hurts, it's broken.
Fortunately

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.150
for you guys I recorded
the voice-over couple of days ago.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.180
Awesome. Now here's the part
that's really mind-blowing though.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.200
If you hear her voice, I'm the exact same age

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.119
as her. Yeah, can you believe that?
Maybe someday I'll do an episode on aging

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.360
and free radicals and whatnot, but in the
meantime, Rinry, give us some DONGs.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.720
Here they are.
Just like the NES, the

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.729
Internet has provided us with a wealth
of side-scrollers. Parasites gives the life of

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.070
parasitic creature

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.020
the side-scrolling treatment. There are colorful
landscapes, funny looking creatures

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.739
and so much jumping to be done.
Thank you, sadlyzombiebait.

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.440
Discover every pixel, The Small World, in
a side-scrolling adventure sent in by

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.390
louswebsite.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.879
Five small worlds to uncover and just one
small jumping stick to do it.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.870
If you've been typing all day and just wanna
relax those aching fingers,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.709
sit back with Wonderputt.
This mini putt course builds

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.910
itself as you play and all you have to
do is click and drag that mouse to

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.680
guide the ball past maze like

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.940
obstacles.
Guide the blue ball to the red ball

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.459
in 3D maze, the rotating puzzler sent in
by LyricQueen1231.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.870
Neon Maze is a cop above colors for you
to contest as quickly as possible.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.540
Guide your color coordinated buddy with your
mouse to beat each level.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.450
Just not interested in winning anymore?
You can't win in Triangulate,

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.830
but you may get addicted to manipulating
triangle, just like myself and

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.860
alltehstuffs did.
Man In the Dark has an

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.040
unlikely addiction to your mouse. He'll follow your
cursor around the window

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.030
and his body can become almost elastic in
need to keep up with it.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.470
Did you think this man was alone in the dark?
Click again.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.670
If you just don't feel like focusing on
what you're doing

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.750
the Disagreeing Internet will help.
The way it refuses to stay still will guarantee a

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.360
lack of focus on any task.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.879
The Hacker Typer will allow you to
appear to be intensely focused on

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:25.549
hacking

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.650
while actually typing whatever gibberish
you want.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.890
Just press F11 to full screen the
page and pretend to hack like a pro.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.080
Thank you so much for doing that Rinry.
I didn't have enough time this week to

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.970
research as many DONGs as I wanted to,
but you came through in the clutch

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.450
and that makes you saucy in my book.
Click here to check out her channel

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.230
and maybe later on do something
different for a change.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.430
Do nothing for two minutes.com

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.470
That's right. You win by doing nothing.
As soon as you do something, you loose.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.049
It's kind of a fun concept, so check that one out.
Subscribe to Vsauce if you haven't

00:03:59.049 --> 00:03:59.620
already.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.820
And as always,

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.040
thanks for watching.
