00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, I did say this was a bit of a trick.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If you look carefully at this regular expression, it requires words that are at least two letters long,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a through z followed by one or more a through z at least two.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So, we actually don't match a. We match quick and brown and then there's nothing in here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We just return a two-element list.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We have questions like this, because I want you to be confident in your own answer

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and not necessarily trust the structure of the problem that's given to you.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This particular phrase a quick brown comes from the sentence,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
"A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,"

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
used commonly because it typically involves all of the letters in the English alphabet

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
giving you a chance to see what each one looks like if you're testing out a font or what not.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So here is my quick brown fox, and it's jumping over a lazy dog,

00:00:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and we will say that this sentence labels both of them.
