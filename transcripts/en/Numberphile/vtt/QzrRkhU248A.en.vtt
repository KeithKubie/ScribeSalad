00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.490
PAUL SMITH: Well, I've got one
other very big difference that

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.210
you find, and it's something
that being in education as a

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.680
university lecturer I'm very
aware of, and, of course,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.590
working with the French and
working in the English system,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.300
and that's the way that
the French mark work.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.310
Here at the University of
Nottingham, we use a system of

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.810
marking out of 100.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.500
But in France, right across
the board, throughout the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.850
education system, whether it's
at university or at school

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.180
level, you're not marked
out of 100, you're

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.630
marked out of 20.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.860
And I think that this goes
back to-- and again, the

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.300
actual reasons aren't really
known, but I think it goes

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.800
back to the medieval period when
people used 20 as a base

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.620
number, as a base
for counting.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.590
And they would count
things out of 20.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.760
And nowadays in France, and
historically in France,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.100
whenever you'd get your piece
of work back, you would have

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.970
your mark expressed out of 20.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.290
So whether you're at university,
completing your

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.800
degree, whether you're doing
your baccalaureate--

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.470
that's the French equivalent
of an A level--

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.320
you're getting a mark out of--
well, if you're doing OK, you

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.630
get 10 out of 20.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.170
That's all right, but
it's not fabulous.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.930
If you get that, then you're
doing a bit better, obviously.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.513
Everybody would be pretty much
satisfied with a mark

00:01:12.513 --> 00:01:14.200
of 12 out of 20.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.350
If you're a little bit ahead
of the race, if you're a

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.730
little bit better than
everybody else,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.380
then 14 out of 20.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.740
The real high flyers are
getting 16 out of 20.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.060
The top people get
18 out of 20.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.300
But nobody gets 20 out of 20,
because there is no such thing

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.200
as perfection.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.730
-It's impossible to get 20.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.250
PAUL SMITH: You can't
get 20 out of 20.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.640
It never happens.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.640
Because you could have 19 out
of 20, but there will always

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.480
be something that is not quite
right with your work.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.470
And the reason for that is--

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.145
here in this system, we could
actually award a student 100

00:01:54.145 --> 00:01:55.480
out of 100.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.905
Not so much in the arts.

00:01:56.905 --> 00:01:59.180
It doesn't tend to happen,
but it could happen.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.350
It can certainly happen
in the sciences.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.340
But there is always going
to be something that

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.660
is not quite right--

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.760
there is just a missing touch.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.440
In a piece of work in France,
they will always see

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.940
you lose one mark.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.560
And everybody accepts that.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.470
The idea is that if you get 20
out of 20, then somebody's

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.020
made a mistake in the marking.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.970
The absolute top you can
get is 19 out of 20.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.023
And that's accepted
across the board.

00:02:25.023 --> 00:02:28.790
-Is that even the case if,
say, it was I gave my

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.060
mathematics student 20
multiplication questions, and

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.330
clearly they got all 20 right.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.480
Do you still dock
them for that?

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.160
PAUL SMITH: No, you don't dock
them in the mark in that

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.010
sense, but it will be scaled.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.290
So you would have a
scaling system.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.750
Let's say you set them 100
questions and they got 100

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.430
right, then there would be a
scaling system, which says

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.600
that a mark of 100 equals 19.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.470
And all the other marks would
be scaled to the scale

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.150
between 1 and 19.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.520
In fact, the scale
is not 1 to 20.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.220
The scale is 1 to 19.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.000
But everybody knows
what it means.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.390
That's the other
thing as well.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.410
So it's very clear that you know
what 10 out of 20 means.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.690
8 out of 20, oh, dear.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.170
When you're beginning to get
below 8, then you really

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.956
haven't put in the yards.

00:03:15.956 --> 00:03:18.800
-So, Paul, if I said to you,
I've got a test for you.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.640
What is the capital of France?

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.450
PAUL SMITH: Yup, Paris.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.110
Yup.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.970
-Well done.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.600
19 out of 20.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.050
PAUL SMITH: Well--

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.130
-Is that how it works?

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.760
PAUL SMITH: I'd say that's a
little bit easy, but yeah,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.070
that would be right.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.870
Yes, the French would say,
well done, 19 out of 20.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.340
--a word for 70.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.590
Instead, what they do is
they count to 60--

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.910
-And the traditional Chinese
character for

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:42.435
[CHINESE], which is used--

00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:43.470
PAUL SMITH: --and add 10.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.680
So whereas we go to 60 and then
go 70, a French person

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.100
goes to 60, but then
goes to 60 plus 10.
