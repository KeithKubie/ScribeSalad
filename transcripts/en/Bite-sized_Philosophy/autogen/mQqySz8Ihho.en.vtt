00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.260
I've been trying to think about a story

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270
I've been trying to think about a story
 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.650
I've been trying to think about a story
of Sodom and Gomorrah in relationship to

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:05.660
of Sodom and Gomorrah in relationship to
 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.250
of Sodom and Gomorrah in relationship to
modern sexual confusion so this is what

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260
modern sexual confusion so this is what
 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.930
modern sexual confusion so this is what
I see happening on the social justice

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940
I see happening on the social justice
 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.169
I see happening on the social justice
front let's say on the one hand since

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179
front let's say on the one hand since
 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.820
front let's say on the one hand since
the 1960's and probably has a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830
the 1960's and probably has a
 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.380
the 1960's and probably has a
consequence of the birth control pill

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390
consequence of the birth control pill
 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.900
consequence of the birth control pill
but other factors as well there's been

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910
but other factors as well there's been
 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.210
but other factors as well there's been
tremendous stress placed on sexual

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220
tremendous stress placed on sexual
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.689
tremendous stress placed on sexual
liberation and so there's this idea that

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699
liberation and so there's this idea that
 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.419
liberation and so there's this idea that
I think is associated in large part

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
I think is associated in large part
 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.099
I think is associated in large part
right now with the radical left of total

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109
right now with the radical left of total
 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.979
right now with the radical left of total
sexual freedom but at the same time

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
sexual freedom but at the same time
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.250
sexual freedom but at the same time
there's increasing emphasis from exactly

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260
there's increasing emphasis from exactly
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.470
there's increasing emphasis from exactly
the same sources on restricting sexual

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480
the same sources on restricting sexual
 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.610
the same sources on restricting sexual
interaction so you see this in the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620
interaction so you see this in the
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.299
interaction so you see this in the
campuses for example where increasingly

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309
campuses for example where increasingly
 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.760
campuses for example where increasingly
particularly heterosexual contact is

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770
particularly heterosexual contact is
 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.990
particularly heterosexual contact is
regulated by a doctrine that says you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
regulated by a doctrine that says you
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.540
regulated by a doctrine that says you
have to get spoken permission for every

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550
have to get spoken permission for every
 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.250
have to get spoken permission for every
move in the mating process and so you

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
move in the mating process and so you
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.790
move in the mating process and so you
see and I know I'm not expressing myself

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800
see and I know I'm not expressing myself
 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.590
see and I know I'm not expressing myself
very well but there seems to be in our

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600
very well but there seems to be in our
 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.759
very well but there seems to be in our
current culture there seems to be

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
current culture there seems to be
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.120
current culture there seems to be
massive sexual confusion it's it's some

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
massive sexual confusion it's it's some
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.219
massive sexual confusion it's it's some
weird combination of extreme libertinism

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
weird combination of extreme libertinism
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:18.200
weird combination of extreme libertinism
and extreme authoritarianism part of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
and extreme authoritarianism part of
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.330
and extreme authoritarianism part of
what's happening happening and is that

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340
what's happening happening and is that
 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.749
what's happening happening and is that
sex impulse of sexual gratification

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759
sex impulse of sexual gratification
 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.859
sex impulse of sexual gratification
trumps everything it's something like

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869
trumps everything it's something like
 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.030
trumps everything it's something like
that I mean I know there's more to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040
that I mean I know there's more to
 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.350
that I mean I know there's more to
what's going on and saw them than that

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
what's going on and saw them than that
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.819
what's going on and saw them than that
but there's certainly that and so well

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829
but there's certainly that and so well
 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.590
but there's certainly that and so well
I'm trying to figure out what to say

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
I'm trying to figure out what to say
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.530
I'm trying to figure out what to say
about that tonight because well there's

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540
about that tonight because well there's
 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.270
about that tonight because well there's
there's a lesson in there the lesson is

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
there's a lesson in there the lesson is
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.410
there's a lesson in there the lesson is
something like don't let sexuality

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
something like don't let sexuality
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.330
something like don't let sexuality
don't let impulse and sexuality get the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
don't let impulse and sexuality get the
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.039
don't let impulse and sexuality get the
upper hand it's something like that or

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
upper hand it's something like that or
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.929
upper hand it's something like that or
all hell will break loose which I

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
all hell will break loose which I
 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.749
all hell will break loose which I
actually happen to agree with so one of

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759
actually happen to agree with so one of
 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:54.889
actually happen to agree with so one of
the things that we haven't been able to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
the things that we haven't been able to
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.660
the things that we haven't been able to
talk about in our culture I think is

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670
talk about in our culture I think is
 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.780
talk about in our culture I think is
let's take the idea of the phenomenon of

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
let's take the idea of the phenomenon of
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.800
let's take the idea of the phenomenon of
AIDS like AIDS mutated to take advantage

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810
AIDS like AIDS mutated to take advantage
 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.590
AIDS like AIDS mutated to take advantage
of promiscuous sexuality and that's just

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600
of promiscuous sexuality and that's just
 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.779
of promiscuous sexuality and that's just
nothing you never hear that publicized

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789
nothing you never hear that publicized
 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.420
nothing you never hear that publicized
you know people had associated AIDS with

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430
you know people had associated AIDS with
 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.730
you know people had associated AIDS with
homosexuality and there was a reason for

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
homosexuality and there was a reason for
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.690
homosexuality and there was a reason for
because it's much more easily

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700
because it's much more easily
 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.220
because it's much more easily
transmitted as a consequence of

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230
transmitted as a consequence of
 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.240
transmitted as a consequence of
homosexual sex than heterosexual sex

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250
homosexual sex than heterosexual sex
 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.440
homosexual sex than heterosexual sex
because the anus is a much more delicate

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
because the anus is a much more delicate
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.810
because the anus is a much more delicate
to geological structure it's not as

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820
to geological structure it's not as
 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.820
to geological structure it's not as
robust and it can be eaten much more

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830
robust and it can be eaten much more
 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.150
robust and it can be eaten much more
easily damaged and and and with with

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160
easily damaged and and and with with
 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.340
easily damaged and and and with with
disease resulting as a consequence but

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350
disease resulting as a consequence but
 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.770
disease resulting as a consequence but
it isn't only the matter of sexual

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
it isn't only the matter of sexual
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.750
it isn't only the matter of sexual
action that's the issue it's also the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760
action that's the issue it's also the
 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.720
action that's the issue it's also the
fact that promiscuity provided the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730
fact that promiscuity provided the
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.760
fact that promiscuity provided the
evolutionary platform for the AIDS virus

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770
evolutionary platform for the AIDS virus
 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.160
evolutionary platform for the AIDS virus

it finally took and it was only through

the skin by the skin of our teeth that
we escaped a totalizing plague you know

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850
we escaped a totalizing plague you know
 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.710
we escaped a totalizing plague you know
had that emerged a hundred years ago god

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720
had that emerged a hundred years ago god
 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.960
had that emerged a hundred years ago god
only knows how many people would have

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970
only knows how many people would have
 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.530
only knows how many people would have
died

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540
died
 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.660
died
AIDS was unbelievably fatal so I know

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670
AIDS was unbelievably fatal so I know
 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.940
AIDS was unbelievably fatal so I know
that's a mishmash of ideas and I'm not

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950
that's a mishmash of ideas and I'm not
 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.620
that's a mishmash of ideas and I'm not
exactly sure how to see my way clear

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
exactly sure how to see my way clear
 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.140
exactly sure how to see my way clear
through it but there is a clear warning

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150
through it but there is a clear warning
 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.780
through it but there is a clear warning
in that story about about something

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790
in that story about about something
 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.140
in that story about about something
about size to do it with with a sexual

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150
about size to do it with with a sexual
 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.850
about size to do it with with a sexual
iniquity as in in the Bible that

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860
iniquity as in in the Bible that
 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.880
iniquity as in in the Bible that
sexuality has to two poles that define

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890
sexuality has to two poles that define
 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.350
sexuality has to two poles that define
it and it's pretty clear one one side is

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360
it and it's pretty clear one one side is
 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.890
it and it's pretty clear one one side is
reproduction and the other side is we

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900
reproduction and the other side is we
 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.030
reproduction and the other side is we
could let's say recreation okay so so

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040
could let's say recreation okay so so
 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.920
could let's say recreation okay so so
those are the two poles of sexuality in

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930
those are the two poles of sexuality in
 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.770
those are the two poles of sexuality in
a normal world so it's not just for

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780
a normal world so it's not just for
 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.960
a normal world so it's not just for
reproduction and it's not just for

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970
reproduction and it's not just for
 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.350
reproduction and it's not just for
recreation it's both like that was the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360
recreation it's both like that was the
 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.050
recreation it's both like that was the
idea I mean it's a natural idea now if

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060
idea I mean it's a natural idea now if
 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.960
idea I mean it's a natural idea now if
you if there's a balance there and you

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970
you if there's a balance there and you
 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.630
you if there's a balance there and you
know that should be had if you lose this

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640
know that should be had if you lose this
 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.810
know that should be had if you lose this
balance and it becomes just about

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820
balance and it becomes just about
 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.370
balance and it becomes just about
reproduction that's a problem if it

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380
reproduction that's a problem if it
 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.470
reproduction that's a problem if it
becomes just about recreation that's

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480
becomes just about recreation that's
 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.170
becomes just about recreation that's
another problem you know okay it's not

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180
another problem you know okay it's not
 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.030
another problem you know okay it's not
that complicated really but it's so

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040
that complicated really but it's so
 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.500

answer for that I don't know what the
answer to that is but I know that it

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240
answer to that is but I know that it
 

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.340
answer to that is but I know that it
might be something that would be worth

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:55.350
might be something that would be worth
 

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.180
might be something that would be worth
talking about and then it's part of this

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:58.190
