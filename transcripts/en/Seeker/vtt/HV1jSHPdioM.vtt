00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.270
Honey bees are just plain cool, that’s simply
a fact.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.170
They make sure our earth is full of flowers
and food for us and other animals, they have

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.560
complex social hierarchies, and it turns out,
they can do math.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.510
In particular, scientists have recently found
out that bees may understand the concept of

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.380
zero--the concept of nothing, of the absence
of value.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.449
Which is impressive because zero is actually
pretty complicated--it takes human children

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.369
a couple of years to fully understand it.

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.619
In order to fully appreciate the buzz around
this discovery, we should explore a couple

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.250
other things about both bees and the number
zero.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.400
Bees, in addition to being an essential pollinator,
are a surprisingly sophisticated model for

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.039
studying animal cognition--surprising given
they’re an insect.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.450
They can understand abstract concepts like
sameness and difference.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.750
They can leave the hive, find a new source
of food, remember where that place is in 3-dimensional

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.390
space and communicate it when they get back
to the hive.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.180
They’re just tiny intrepid adventurers,
guys!

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.710
Ok, so bees are smart.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.140
But zero’s not that hard, right?

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.390
I mean it’s just the smallest number.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.219
Or is it?!

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.030
Zero wasn’t even used as a number in mathematical
calculations until around 5th century C.E.,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.650
in India, and before we used it as a number
it was difficult to perform even basic calculations.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.840
I mean, experts herald the invention of zero
as one of the greatest breakthroughs in mathematics,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.450
and without it, we wouldn’t have higher
order math and we wouldn’t have modern computing.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.920
So, zero is a nuanced concept.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.790
The research group that uncovered these bee
mathematicians trained the bees to choose

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.700
images containing the lower number of items.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.370
For example, when presented with a 3-item
picture and a 4 item picture, they should

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.520
pick the 3-item picture.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.570
This already means that they have an understanding
of quantity and numeracy--the whole idea that

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.200
there are amounts of things and that one amount
is more than or less than another is pretty

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.860
complex in itself.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.850
But then the researchers added an image with
nothing in it, no items, which the bees had

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.799
never been exposed to before.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.960
And the bees, having been trained to choose
the image with less items, chose the one with

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.920
nothing, indicating that they understand that
nothing, i.e. zero, is less than something.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.060
This is reasoning that until now has only
been observed in animals with larger and more

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.989
complex brains, like monkeys and parrots and
well, us.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.140
The kicker here is that bee brains have fewer
than 1 million neurons.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.050
Neuroscientists are surprised that an animal
with this few brain cells is capable of understanding

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.950
and reasoning around a complex concept like
0--one that took us, human beings, many millenia

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.420
to wrap our heads around.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.700
This research opens up new questions about
how our brain perceives zero, and how this

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.790
may differ from species to species.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.830
But another unexpected result of this study
is computer-related.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.110
How do computers deal with zero?

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.940
If bees can perceive zero with brains of less
than a million neurons, it may have implications

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.950
for advanced computing.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.310
Modern computing, which is number-based, has
a notoriously difficult time with the number

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.310
zero.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.240
They can only recognize is as a number, not
a concept.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.370
In mathematical calculations, the computers
we have now may be unable to complete a command

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.680
if they have to divide by zero--it may even
actively crash the code you’re running,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.500
depending on the programming language.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.030
Maybe we could use something like bees’
seemingly simple understanding of absence,

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.540
of nothingness, in our development of artificial
intelligence.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.061
Understanding how bees perceive zero without
a number may help us circumvent the perpetual

00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:21.000
problem of zero and make some serious strides
in our computing capabilities.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.770
But also, like, bees are just really smart
and I think maybe they’re gonna be the ones

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.510
who inherit the earth after us.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.569
And frankly, I’m ok with that.

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.110

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.760
And fun fact, experts think that the concept
of zero jumped from Indian philosophical texts

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.819
to mathematical theory.

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.790
I never knew math could be so spiritual.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.260
