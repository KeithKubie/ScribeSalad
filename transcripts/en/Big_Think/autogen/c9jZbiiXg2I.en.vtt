looks like a nail but as I watched his

for why simply jumping to biofuels was
 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.370
for why simply jumping to biofuels was
not a logical conclusion because he

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380
not a logical conclusion because he
 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.010
not a logical conclusion because he

discussed the difference between oil and
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.320
discussed the difference between oil and
biofuels in terms of the amount of water

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330
biofuels in terms of the amount of water
 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.530
biofuels in terms of the amount of water
that needs to be used and for biofuels

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540
that needs to be used and for biofuels
 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.370

the plant matter that could be food and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380
the plant matter that could be food and
 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.700
the plant matter that could be food and
used in another way I was saying to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
used in another way I was saying to
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.120
used in another way I was saying to
myself if if we were thinking about

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130
myself if if we were thinking about
 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.660
myself if if we were thinking about
climate change just climate change in a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
climate change just climate change in a
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.489
climate change just climate change in a
more integrated way and we weren't just

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:22.499
more integrated way and we weren't just
 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.190
more integrated way and we weren't just
focused on carbon but if we were

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
focused on carbon but if we were
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.289
focused on carbon but if we were
thinking carbon we were thinking water

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299
thinking carbon we were thinking water
 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.539
thinking carbon we were thinking water
we were thinking food we were thinking

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
we were thinking food we were thinking
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.999
we were thinking food we were thinking
about what the relationships are with

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
about what the relationships are with
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.649
about what the relationships are with
the trade-offs are because there's tough

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
the trade-offs are because there's tough
 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.300
the trade-offs are because there's tough
choices that have to be made it's easy

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
choices that have to be made it's easy
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.120
choices that have to be made it's easy
to say we can optimize across every

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
to say we can optimize across every
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.649
to say we can optimize across every
environmental dimension while we're

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659
environmental dimension while we're
 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.629
environmental dimension while we're
optimizing you know across financial

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:41.639
optimizing you know across financial
 

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:43.999
optimizing you know across financial
performance and quality of life but

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009
performance and quality of life but
 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.529
performance and quality of life but
that's not the world we live in I think

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539
that's not the world we live in I think
 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.319
that's not the world we live in I think
in some cases we can do better on all

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
in some cases we can do better on all
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.450
in some cases we can do better on all
counts in other cases tough choices have

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460
counts in other cases tough choices have
 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.440
counts in other cases tough choices have
to be made and what what Peter's video

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
to be made and what what Peter's video
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.370
to be made and what what Peter's video
clip said to me was if we were taking a

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380
clip said to me was if we were taking a
 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.230
clip said to me was if we were taking a
more integrated view and we were looking

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
more integrated view and we were looking
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.539
more integrated view and we were looking
at data and analyzing data in a more

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549
at data and analyzing data in a more
 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.969
at data and analyzing data in a more
integrated way I think we could be

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
integrated way I think we could be
 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.509
integrated way I think we could be
making much better decisions
