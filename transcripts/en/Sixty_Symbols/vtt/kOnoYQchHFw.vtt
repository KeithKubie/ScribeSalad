00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
DR WEINFURTNER: So we are in the Black Hole Laboratory.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.900
What you're looking at

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.560
that's an analogue rotating black hole.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.140
As a first step,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.540
we fill up the space in here

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.240
in the back.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.620
We put water in there

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.320
and then we also put

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.720
what's called fluorescent dye.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.980
-makes your fingers dirty-

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.780
It's actually sort of orangey

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.880
but then it takes

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.260
the blue part of the spectrum of the light

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.900
and converts blue into green!

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.160
There are about 2000 liters of water in there.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.600
If you follow me...

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.480
here we have

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.460
two valves, which we can open

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.680
and control how much is going through

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.240
each inlet. We have two inlets in our tank

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.720
We feed in the water from this side

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.780
and also from the other side,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.180
and so we have this rectangular tank

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.720
and we fill in the water, this way.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.240
So by feeding it in this particular way,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.020
You give it angular momentum.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.900
And then we have a hole in the center

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.740
(these are exchangeable center holes)

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.160
The water is coming in

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.260
and because of the way we feed it in

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.960
it starts spinning

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.520
and it's draining in the center.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.740
So it's a 'stationary draining fluid flow',

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.880
or just a 'bath tub vortex flow'.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.160
So this is not a black hole for me or you,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.460
that's a black hole for small excitations in this system

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.240
So if you look at some waves or little ripples 
on the surface

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.080
(this is what we are interested in)

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.100
they have a certain propagation speed,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.260
and if you set up fluid flows where the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.600
background velocity of the flow

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.740
exceeds the propagation speed 
of the little ripples,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.660
you can set up what's called

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.540
'analogue horizons'.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.100
So suppose you're in a 1-dimensional
fluid flow,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.480
and you look at small excitations,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.180
and they can be moving up or downstream of the flow.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.720
But if you have a region

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.360
where the fluid flow exceeds

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.360
the speed of the little ripples on the free surface

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.580
then it means that

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.480
if you are in this region,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.200
you cannot propagate against the flow.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.440
So let's say if you would be

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.040
in this region where the flow is 'supercritical'

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.920
(so, faster than the perturbations)

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.980
I am in the region

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.380
where it's 'subcritical',

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.000
and we want to exchange information

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.100
only using the ripples on the free surface,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.780
then I can send information to you downstream,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.600
but you cannot send any information upstream,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.560
because the flow is faster going downstream

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.520
so that nothing can counter-propagate.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.660
So in the region where exactly

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.620
the two speeds

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.580
the perturbation speed of the ripple

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.360
on the surface

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.780
and the background flow are equal

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.120
that's your analogue black hole horizon.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.880
So this is more of a difficult system:

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.360
it's not 1-dimensional:

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.300
it has a 2-dimensional velocity component,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.660
meaning: it has a radial component 
(the water is draining),

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.040
and it has an angular moment
(the water is spinning)

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.180
And what you can see is there

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.400
are two horizons

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.140
And I don't know if I can visualize it

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.780
I can try

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.660
You can see, I am looking for

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.480
two horizons in there:

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.360
there's one when the total velocity

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.560
of the fluid flow

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.240
(so radial *and* angular momentum)

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.660
exceed the little ripples on the surface,

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.740
and this is what we call an

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.900
'ergo horizon'.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.700
So any fluctuation that comes inside

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.900
this ergo horizon

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.860
cannot counter-propagate against the fluid flow

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.320
it gets dragged along

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.580
(it's called 'frame-dragging')

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.100
but it can still escape.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.980
There's another point

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.740
where the radial velocity

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.500
only the radial component

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.020
is faster than the little ripples on the surface

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.940
and that's called the 'analogue event horizon'.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.240
So if you are in a flow here,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.220
you see nothing special is happening, right?

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.900
Perturbations can go in each direction.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.340
If I am going to a point

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.860
where the background flow

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.400
exceeds the perturbations,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.720
you see a little cone opening in the back

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.300
and this cone opens

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.100
if and only if the background flow

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.700
exceeds the speed of the perturbation.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.180
I don't know if you can see it, can you see it?

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.360
BRADY: Oh yeah I see it now.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.360
DR WEINFURTNER: So now, if I manage

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.080
And I need to now go up all the way here

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.240
then you see the cone nicely here

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.380
you see how the cone tilts
more, and more, and more

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.340
and at some point

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.680
this cone tilts completely inside

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.460
and once this cone is not like this,

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.660
it tilts like this

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.320
-that's where the 'effective black hole horizon' is.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.780
And between these two horizons here

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.300
there are some very interesting

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.360
scattering processes happening.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.830
A big part of that is to set up this
background flow in the best way for the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.330
purposes of of mimicking rotating black
holes, when I say that I have something

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.440
very particular in mind: a very bizarre
process that happens around rotating

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.190
black holes.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.880
So, a rotating black hole has to have a mass and an angular

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.540
momentum

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.990
what can happen, because you have these two horizons, you have this 'ergosphere', and you

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.889
have this black hole horizon, and you
have this frame-dragging region, so if

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.419
something comes into this region -a small
perturbation- it scatters with this black

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.340
hole and it extracts a little bit of
angular momentum from the rotating black

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.870
hole, and so this is what's called a
'superradiant' scattering process:

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.070
you can come out with more energy
(loosely speaking) and this energy comes

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.810
from the angular momentum of the
(in our case analogue)

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.039
rotating black hole.

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.630
What is really interesting is because
when you have a real-life setup -and

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.729
even a very controlled real-life setup-

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.539
you have to come up with ways to
actually detect this effect because they

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.190
are very small. And also this is perhaps a really

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.900
old-style fluid flow experiment
people have been experimenting with for a hundred

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.300
years probably, what they didn't have
back then and what we have now is the

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.230
technology.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.050
So what we're using is top-of-the-art
cameras with a very high frame rate

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.370
per second and a very high spatial
resolution. We are hunting for the very

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.230
small -not so small like the gravitational wave but it's still very small- and I can

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.280
tell you how small:

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.820
if you look at that flow and i'm in a
machine where this analogy should hold,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:06.330
I'm looking at small excitations on the
top like that... I can stimulate them for

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.750
example these are not very small but
it's better to see it like that and usually

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.550
what you want is that this little
amplitude of this guy that it is small

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.860
compared to the height of the fluid flow

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.740
so what we want to send in is a wave with
an amplitude of a millimeter. The change

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.800
is tiny so the increase in the amplitude is
at best a tenth, so 0.1 millimeter.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.300
what we really want to see are tiny
changes in the amplitude of those waves.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.560
What I want to see is when the wave
scatters with this vortex -with this analogue

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.320
rotating black hole- that it increases
its energy; by interacting with this

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.000
effective rotating black hole

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.410
it gains energy, and that's exactly what
should happen around astrophysical

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.220
rotating black holes: an astrophysical rotating black hole loses its

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.060
angular momentum and one way of losing
that is through this superradiant

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.950
scattering process. So, whatever comes it
scatters with it and it can actually

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.360
transfer some of the angular momentum
from the rotating black hole onto for

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.919
example a gravitational wave or other
objects. But this is more a test of

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:15.030
principle, to study this effect which has
not been seen before, in a very

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.810
controlled way and it's true we are
we are going to improve

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.910
this much further, that's just the first
step.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.320
People usually like it because it is
very hands-on. One of the huge challenges

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.690
to overcome was to measure the free
surface over a relatively large area and

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.080
you can see the area now indicated by
this light

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.660
where the

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.340
bright green is. Then what you see above
here, what we developed here is an

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.450
air-water interface sensor, and what it
does:

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:49.990
in the middle there is a
blue LED light and it projects a random

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:55.870
pattern changing with 500 frames per
second onto this free surface. And then

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.130
you have two cameras on the edges of the
sensor and then you

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.650
also take 500 images per second

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.250
the first step is you take a
series of images to find out which

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:11.170
point corresponds to the same physical
point in these two images, and you look at a

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:16.120
correlation and it works exactly the same way as the eyes

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.070
you see everything as two images but
your brain converts it into one, so this is

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.750
what we do and with this information we
can reconstruct the free surface. Here on

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:29.290
the screen you see the reconstructed
image through this process

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:33.700
it's a little bit better than our eyes
because I get exact amplitudes here.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.349
You can see all the waves coming in and
you can see how these waves scatter

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:42.520
here and how they get deformed. I have to say
that we started a year ago

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.560
so before that [this] was a storage room. What
we have put together in one year

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.730
I think it's really incredible. We
have great support here. So what we're

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.480
doing right now: we are testing. We are
testing how good the sensor is.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.570
So this is a nice stage, it's also a
little bit of a nerve-racking stage,

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.220
because we could be very close to seeing
the effect or we could maybe be a year

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.470
maybe two

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:10.630
I don't think- I hope not but we could be-
one doesn't know when we will see,

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.630
so it's an exciting time!

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.600
PROF. COPELAND: ... intricate link between the matter and the space time. Just trying to

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.990
imagine these two huge objects - what

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.740

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.279
