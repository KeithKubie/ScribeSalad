00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.580
- [Instructor] In this
video we're going to talk

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.320
about economic growth,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.380
and I wanna be very careful here.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.360
Because depending on the context,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.130
people, including economists,
might mean different things

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.610
by economic growth.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.680
In everyday language
when people are talking

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.260
about economic growth,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.010
they're usually just
talking about an expansion

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.110
in the output of an economy over time.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.360
So if real GDP is increasing,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.490
they might consider that
to be economic growth.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.070
But the context that
we're going to talk about

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.950
in this video,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.970
and this is one that you
might see in an introductory

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.070
economics class or an AP economics class,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.790
we aren't just talking about an increase

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.490
in real GDP over time.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.720
We are talking about an
increase in the full employment

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.060
output over time,
regardless of where we are

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.260
in the economic cycle.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.620
So keep that in mind as
you watch this video.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.730
If we're just talking about the increase

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.523
of real GDP, we're gonna
call that an expansion,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.640
not necessarily economic growth.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.750
And we're gonna call real GDP decreasing

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.493
as being equal to a contraction.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.730
When we talk about economic growth,

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.930
we're actually talking

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.930
about the full employment
output increasing.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.770
And this could happen
somewhat independently

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.540
of where we are in the
actual economic cycle.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.830
Let's do a little diagram to
make that a little bit clearer.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.010
So right over here I have plotted real GDP

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.280
of an economy versus time.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.170
And what you see here in
yellow is how the real GDP

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.570
is fluctuating and it's fluctuating

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.840
around its full employment output.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.540
Let's pick this time right
over here, call it t sub one.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.790
So right at this point,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.830
that is our full employment output.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.400
Let's call it y sub f sub one.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.080
But we see that our economy is performing

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.150
above our full employment output.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.170
We have a positive output gap.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.520
If we go from that point in time,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.650
fast forward a little bit to t two.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.560
So let's go to sub two here.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.660
Because the y sub f right over here,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.500
the full employment output
right over here is flat,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.710
according to this we
would not have experienced

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.280
any economic growth from
t sub one to t sub two,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.920
even though the real GDP would have grown.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.280
We would've grown from
this point to this point

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.480
right over here.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.080
So one way to think about it is,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.080
we are expanding as long as
this curve is upward sloping,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.210
but if the full employment
output is not changing,

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.430
we are not experiencing economic growth.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.290
The times where we actually are
experiencing economic growth

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.790
are times where our full
employment output is changing,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.200
so let's say from this
time right over there

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.130
to this time right over there.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.350
And notice, that is
happening, theoretically,

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.350
during a contraction.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.870
This is a contraction right over here

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.470
where real GDP is actually pulling back.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.890
But if we knew truly what the
full employment output were

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.480
and were able to plot it like this,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.610
theoretically we actually are experiencing

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.840
economic growth here,
despite a contraction.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.990
To appreciate this,

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.260
let's look at other models

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.380
that we have studied in economics.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.340
So we think about a production
possibilities curve.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.550
The ones that we typically see

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.350
only have two goods or services.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.870
A real economy's gonna
be much more complex.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.040
It would have millions
of goods and services,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.174
but it's very hard to
draw a million-dimension

00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:31.770
production possibilities curve.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.140
But what this shows us
is at a snapshot in time,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.630
what is the full employment output.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.400
And it shows us the
trade-off between these two

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.290
goods or services.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.930
Now if we're in a situation
where we're behind

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.810
the production possibilities curve,

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.850
that is a negative output gap,

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.680
and it's possible that over time,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.970
we go from this negative output gap

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.440
back to the production
possibilities curve.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.420
That would be an expansion in the economy,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.340
but by the definition that
we're talking about here,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.300
which is not what is
typically talked about

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.980
in the news or something like this,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.000
we would not call that economic growth.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.400
Economic growth happens when we push out

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.400
the production possibilities curve,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.330
when we have an increase in
our full employment output.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.655
So economic growth is maybe through

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:23.300
some new technology or some more workers

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.800
or resources or just better institutions,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.830
we're able to push our production
possibilities curve out.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.237
This is an example of economic,

00:04:34.237 --> 00:04:37.540
economic growth.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.590
So for example,

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.730
this could be our production
possibilities curve

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.760
at let's say t three

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.350
where this is t sub three right over here,

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.141
and then this is our
production possibilities curve

00:04:51.141 --> 00:04:53.010
at t sub four,

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.570
where this is t sub four right over here,

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.810
where our full employment
output has increased.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.780
We can also think about the same idea

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.460
using our aggregate demand
or aggregate supply model.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.293
When we studied that,

00:05:06.293 --> 00:05:08.640
we saw that in the short-run,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.670
because of say a demand
shock or a supply shock,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.870
we could be operating
to the left or the right

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.640
of our full employment output,

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.240
creating these positive
or negative output gaps,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.660
but over time we're going to gravitate

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.870
back to this full employment output.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.150
And so as long as our
production possibilities curve

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.330
isn't getting pushed out, isn't changing,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.150
or as long as our long-run
aggregate supply curve

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.840
is not changing,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.520
according to the definition
that I'm talking about

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.650
in this video, we are not
seeing economic growth.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.640
The analog for what we
saw in this PPC curve

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.248
is maybe this is the long-run
aggregate supply curve

00:05:42.248 --> 00:05:45.390
at t three,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.520
but if our economy has more resources,

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.170
maybe more population,
more natural resources,

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.020
better technology, better institutions,

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.890
maybe it's able to produce
more at full employment.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.660
And in that situation,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.840
our long-run aggregate
supply curve would shift

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.060
to the right.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.270
And so this could be our long-run

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.940
aggregate supply curve at time t four.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.430
So this is full employment
output let's call that sub three.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.620
This would be full
employment output sub four.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.820
The big takeaway here is,

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.370
regardless of where we
are in the expansion

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.800
or contraction of our business cycles,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.350
the economic growth is the
change in that blue line.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.190
And if we're looking at
the PPC it's a shift out

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.210
of our PPC, of our production
possibilities curve.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.520
If we're looking at the aggregate demand

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.800
aggregate supply model,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.480
it is a shift to the right of our long-run

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.690
aggregate supply curve.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.910
And once again,

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.380
what are the things that can cause that?

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.730
And these are good to know.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.430
There's a notion of capital.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.838
Traditionally people have just
thought hey more factories,

00:06:51.838 --> 00:06:54.620
more resources, more land,

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.620
maybe that will push things out,

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.870
and it definitely could.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.780
But more modern definitions
are thinking human capital.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.680
Hey if we have a better
educated workforce,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.960
a more skilled workforce,
that could also matter.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.510
People also think about
things like technology.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.210
If we can discover better
ways of putting together

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.940
the resources we have,

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.680
that can also increase our productivity,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.450
and that's what we would call technology

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.100
in an economics context.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.130
And things like
institutions matter as well.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.970
You could imagine if your bureaucracy

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.390
is really slows things down,

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.920
if it takes forever to get
a permit to do something,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.400
well that might put a hamper on what

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.300
the full employment output is.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.700
But if the institutions
become much more efficient,

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.950
well then that might allow the country,

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.340
allow that economy, to produce
more at full employment.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.160
So all of these things
could push out your PPC,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.010
could push your long-run
aggregate supply curve

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.100
to the right, or cause this blue curve

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.570
which represents your
full employment output

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.140
to move up over time.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.993
All of that would be economic growth.
