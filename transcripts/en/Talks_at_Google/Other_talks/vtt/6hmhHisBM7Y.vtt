SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE:
Nikole Hannah-Jones

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.430
is an award-winning,
investigative reporter

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.970
covering racial injustice for
the "New York Times Magazine."

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.950
She's spent the last
five years investigating

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.130
how official policy
creates and maintains

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.026
racial segregation in
American public schools.

00:00:21.026 --> 00:00:23.150
Nikole's reporting has won
several national awards,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.590
including the Peabody Award,
Polk Award, the National

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.401
Magazine Award.

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:28.900
She was named
Journalist of the Year

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.700
by the National Association
of Black Journalists in 2015

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.740
and named to The Root
in both 2015 and 2016.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.610
She is also a 2017 New
American Emerson fellow.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.220
She's in the process of writing
a book entitled "The Problem

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.010
We All Live With" to be
published on the One World

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.890
imprint of Penguin Random House.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.230
Last year, Nikole helped
found the Ida B. Wells

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.960
Society for Investigative
Reporting, a training

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.000
and mentorship
organization geared

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.400
toward increasing the number
of investigative reporters

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.480
of color.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.290
I'm so proud to be here as a
mom of two young kids of color,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.620
trying to choose a
school for my kids.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.060
And I'm so glad that we
have allies in the audience,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.250
so thank you.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.061
Nikole?

00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:14.871
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.680
So first, we're--

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.180
I'm sorry.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.471
I didn't even introduce myself.

00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:22.510
I'm Sheethal Shobawale.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.860
I work in research here on the
performance ads marketing team.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.800
And I've been here
almost seven years.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.800
So this is my first
fireside chat,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.940
so send me the good vibes.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.760
And before we start, just to put
this conversation in context,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.820
we'd like to share a
video that WNYC produced.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.572
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:42.572 --> 00:01:45.202
- Everybody needs
a dream, but dreams

00:01:45.202 --> 00:01:46.941
don't come true by themselves.

00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:50.417
You have to help them come true.

00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:50.917
All right.

00:01:50.917 --> 00:01:51.911
You ready?

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.850
- I was bussed to
very white schools.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.850
I always knew I was not
going to put my daughter

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.139
in that environment.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.729
I did not expect I
would also put her

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.354
in a segregated environment.

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:22.450
How do your friends
get to school?

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.532
Dante lives across the
street, doesn't he?

00:02:25.532 --> 00:02:26.954
Where's Dante?

00:02:26.954 --> 00:02:30.240
- [INAUDIBLE] lives
across the street.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.430
- Oh, Jacoby rides the bus.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.575
- Morning, Najya.

00:02:33.575 --> 00:02:35.645
- Was Sam cranky this morning?

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:38.880
- Um, he was OK.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.156
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.170
- I don't talk to her about
that we intentionally chose

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.770
the segregated school for her.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.960
I don't want her to notice.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.770
It was not an easy decision.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.220
I've spent my career chronicling
the way the segregated schools

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.360
harm black children.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.950
But at the same time, this is
what public education to me is.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.479
This is the one place
where the masses can mix.

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.020
This is the one
place where we're not

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.950
supposed to all going
into our own corners

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.093
with people who are
exactly like us.

00:03:17.517 --> 00:03:19.850
My daughter doesn't know that
there's a class difference

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.260
between her and her classmates.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.210
She will as she gets
older, I'm sure.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.441
But right now, these
are just her friends.

00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:27.440
And I think that that's
the most important thing

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.870
that I can give her
while also trying

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.300
to even the playing
field a bit for the kids

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.220
in the school whose parents
work hard every day,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.807
but they work jobs that
they don't have status.

00:03:37.807 --> 00:03:39.140
They don't have access to power.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.110
They can't write a 10,000-word
piece in the "New York Times

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.590
Magazine" about
their experience.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.930
But I can do that.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.380
And my presence in the
school changes the status

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.760
for those children too.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.260
I hoped, I think,
like many parents,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.720
that I would be able to
put her in an integrated--

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.220
truly integrated
school environment.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.560
But in New York
City, your choices

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.565
are often polar opposites.

00:04:00.565 --> 00:04:04.880
If those of us who have choice
and privilege and some power

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.680
keep avoiding
schools, then we have

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.470
accepted that this two-tiered
system is inevitable,

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.470
and I don't accept that.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.838
[MUSIC- KEVIN MACLEOD,
 "REVIVAL"]

00:04:24.646 --> 00:04:25.650
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.920
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE: Great.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.350
So that video really
resonated with me,

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.690
as I have been trying to look
at my neighborhood schools.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.230
I've been visiting schools
for the last six months.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.650
And it's dancing
and overwhelming.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.790
So could you talk a little
bit about that process for you

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.820
personally, how you
went through that?

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.200
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES:
Picking a school?

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.660
So I've been writing
about school segregation

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.500
from my very first
job in journalism.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.980
I started in journalism
in 2003, and I

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.230
started covering a
majority black school

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.870
system in the South that was
also very heavily segregated.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.860
And so I knew very well
what school segregation

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.180
was doing to black children,
and also Latino children.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.527
Then I had my own child,
and then when she was one,

00:05:11.527 --> 00:05:12.610
we moved to New York City.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.239
And I found myself having to
navigate an educational system

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:18.655
in the most segregated large
school system in the country.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.470
And so I decided
pretty early that I

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.230
was going to put her in one
of the segregated schools

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.129
that I write about.

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:29.420
I did not tell my husband that.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.390
So part of what I talk about
in the piece is how I told him

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.870
that this is what
I wanted to do,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.720
and the conversations
that we had,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.320
and the fears that he
had as a black parent,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.810
both of us coming from
working class backgrounds,

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.330
having worked ourselves
into the middle class,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.160
and feeling like one of the
advantages we can guarantee

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.040
our child is a good education.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.590
But also strongly,
strongly believing

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.275
in public schools, and the
concept of public schools

00:06:00.275 --> 00:06:03.440
as being this great equalizer.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.420
So I felt that I could not
write about the abandonment

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.730
of these children in
segregated schools,

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.610
and then do the same thing
when it came down to my choice.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.340
I think one of the things
that has bothered me

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.885
through all of these years
are progressive people who

00:06:18.885 --> 00:06:20.510
say they believe in
public schools, who

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.822
say they believe in equality, as
long as it's an abstract thing.

00:06:23.822 --> 00:06:26.030
But then when it actually
comes to their own personal

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.100
decisions, they
make decisions that

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.770
actually uphold inequality,
and I didn't want to do that.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.900
And so it came down to, one,
I usually win in my household.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.870
Just kidding, Faraji.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.739
Kind of.

00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:41.030
But I asked him, you know,
come to the schools with me.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.080
Let's tour the schools.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.354
Because I think a
lot of parents look

00:06:44.354 --> 00:06:45.770
at the demographics
of the school,

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.936
they look at the test scores,
and they automatically

00:06:47.936 --> 00:06:49.670
write those schools
off, assuming

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.850
that there's not learning
happening in those schools.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.760
And so we went to
the schools, and then

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.720
ultimately, he agreed that
this was the right thing to do.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.814
And understanding that when you
have two educated parents, when

00:07:03.814 --> 00:07:05.480
you have parents who
make a middle class

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.270
income, the risk and
the sacrifice for us

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.920
is actually quite small.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.000
And maybe we're
sacrificing, and maybe not.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.980
But I think the biggest
fear is, well, maybe

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.240
my kid won't get into Harvard.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.980
I don't think that that's
what public schools are for,

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.200
and that's not my biggest
concern for my child.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.520
My biggest concern is that
my child is a good person,

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.420
that she goes to a
school that teaches her

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.170
not just how to perform on
a test, but about her world,

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.540
and about justice
and being kind,

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.110
and to be part of this larger
community, not this bubble

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.240
of a community of privilege.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.940
To teach her how to
be a good citizen.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.780
So for us, anything that she
couldn't get academically

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.510
in the school, we
could get for her.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:52.010
But the sacrifice of poor
black and brown children

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.470
is whether they're actually
going to get an education

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.140
or not, whether they're
going to actually get access

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.760
to the type of instruction
and teaching and thinking

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.130
that will allow them to
graduate in the first place,

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.900
go on to college,
succeed in college.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.150
That's just a very
different sacrifice,

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.480
and I felt like my sacrifice
was actually very small.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.330
But also just morally, it
was the right thing to do.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.582
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE: So
I can relate to this.

00:08:17.582 --> 00:08:20.040
I mean, you should come to my
house and talk to my husband,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.050
because we have been spending
hours discussing this.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.540
I mean, in my personal--
so in my life,

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.210
I went to public
school, and my husband

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.130
went to a very fancy
private school.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.610
And he says to me,
that school changed

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.230
the trajectory of my life.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.700
My name is Olatokumbo, and
my dad is half Nigerian.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.330
And well, you know, I'm
middle class, but you know,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.360
this school, the guidance
that I got has now

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.280
made me this person I am.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.460
And I still struggle with it.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.560
And actually now I'm
feeling terrible about it,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.340
because in some ways, I
finally have decided now--

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.690
I'm deciding between
private and public schools,

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:03.150
and it's very
challenging for parents.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.880
So I would love
for you to, like,

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.660
talk about how you
would tell people,

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.090
like, what-- like, when
they make the decision,

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.700
what should they consider
in their neighborhood

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.850
school and the community
around [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.730
I'm in a rapidly
gentrifying neighborhood.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.280
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Right.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.550
I can't tell parents what
to do, though I kind of

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.383
am telling parents--

00:09:24.383 --> 00:09:25.611
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.840
And believe me, I
get a lot of emails

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.400
from parents who are like, we're
in the thick of this right now.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.770
Can you tell me the
right thing to do?

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.140
And on the one hand, I'm
like, if you've read my work,

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.300
you know what I'm going
to tell you to do.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.100
And I'm not--

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.070
I'm not pretending this is easy.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.434
It is unnatural as
a parent to feel

00:09:46.434 --> 00:09:48.600
like you're putting your
child in a situation that's

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.450
not giving that child
every advantage.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.090
I think what my work is
trying to do is recenter,

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.700
do we actually still
believe in a common good?

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.920
Do we actually still
believe in the public part

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.060
of public schools?

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.580
Because we have
allowed the language

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.800
of the market, the
language of capitalism

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.980
to infiltrate public schools
where now it's about shopping.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.452
I deserve to shop for
a good public school.

00:10:12.452 --> 00:10:14.160
But what that then
means is that children

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.300
stuck in segregated, struggling
schools are deserving of that

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:18.990
too.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.740
And if you're deciding
between public and private,

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.320
we are a capitalist country,
and I can't tell you

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.080
that if you want to
pay for an education,

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.710
you can pay for an education.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.700
But if you're one of these
proud public school parents,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.600
but you are only
public school parents

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.714
if you can find very particular
schools that advantage

00:10:37.714 --> 00:10:39.630
your children within a
publicly funded system,

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.046
I think that that's
morally wrong.

00:10:41.046 --> 00:10:43.560
I actually think that
that's antithetical to what

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.720
public schools are
supposed to be.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:52.220
So to me, I think
that if we are going

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.580
to say that this
system is unjust,

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.590
we can't at the
same time do things

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.630
that maintain an unjust system.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.820
And that's going to
require sacrifice.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.860
What we want is to still
get-- and we talked

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.720
about this on the phone, right?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.980
We want-- or sorry,
Google Hangout.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.320
We want to simultaneously
advantage our own children,

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.370
but have equality
for other children.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.880
Those two forces
oppose each other,

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.640
because you can't at once
have advantage and equality.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.099
Equality means that you're
going to-- if you have a lot,

00:11:25.099 --> 00:11:27.140
you're going to have to
give a little bit of that

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.970
up so that someone
who has a little

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.101
has the same thing as you.

00:11:30.101 --> 00:11:32.600
So I think we need to figure
out, do we really believe that?

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.766
Is that what we really want?

00:11:33.766 --> 00:11:36.860
And then if we do, then
it can't just be about,

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.920
I love the idea of this,
but I really need my child

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.530
to get into Harvard.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:47.000
I think it has to be about
understanding that even when

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.070
I have gone into the
segregated school,

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.860
I still have every advantage
over those families.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.400
This is like the one thing
that I can give up, give

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.360
A little bit of.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.767
And I just think we
need to either say,

00:11:58.767 --> 00:12:00.350
we're willing to
give things up, or we

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:03.380
need to stop pretending that we
actually care about inequality.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.290
Because while it is systemic,
while we have inherited

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.630
a system, and many
of us in here didn't

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.090
have to do a single thing
to create the system,

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.580
but we do do things
that sustain the system.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.580
And the only way that the
system stops being what it is

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.690
is if individual people make
decisions towards justice.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.510
And there's no
middle ground there.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.380
There just isn't.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.963
And I think that's
very uncomfortable,

00:12:25.963 --> 00:12:27.020
because people want--

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.290
you know, they want to be able
to go to a march for, like,

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.930
women's equality and
feel good about that,

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.300
or come hear me talk, which
I often feel is torture,

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.490
because I'm not letting
people off the hook when

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:38.489
I'm talking to people.

00:12:38.489 --> 00:12:40.280
And then you feel like
that's your penance.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.600
Like, you have done enough.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.984
And I'm saying, there
are tens of thousands

00:12:44.984 --> 00:12:47.150
of kids in this the who
have been promised something

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.570
that we're not giving them.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.050
And it's not just
enough to say you care.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:52.589
You actually have
to do something.

00:12:52.589 --> 00:12:54.380
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE:
And so how do you that?

00:12:56.944 --> 00:12:58.610
So I talk to a lot
of people about this.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.130
And on my block, for
example, every kid

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.770
goes to a different school.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.570
And I started my
block association,

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.472
and I love my block,
and I started it

00:13:07.472 --> 00:13:08.930
because I wanted
a community, and I

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.940
believe in it takes a village.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.070
But how do you get,
like, everybody

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.020
to sort of make that choice?

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.910
Like, how do you
persuade and convince?

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.350
Because it does
take that village,

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.575
but it also takes,
like, the community.

00:13:21.575 --> 00:13:23.677
Not just individual
choices, but everybody's

00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:25.760
choice individually together,
if that makes sense.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.843
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Yeah.

00:13:26.843 --> 00:13:29.990
I mean, I think that-- so
there's a couple things.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.780
For those of you who
haven't read the piece,

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.560
I decided to put my daughter
in a segregated school,

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.720
and then our segregated
school very quickly

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.730
becomes embroiled in
an integration battle.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.700
Because like many
places in Brooklyn,

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.230
the neighborhood is gentrified.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.570
And right down the street
from my daughter's school,

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.164
less than a mile away was a
predominately white, affluent

00:13:50.164 --> 00:13:51.830
school that was
bursting from the seams.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.620
Because in the
city, once a school

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.870
attracts a core amount
of white parents,

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.690
every white parent in that area
wants to go to that school.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.030
Meanwhile, my daughter's
school was half empty,

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.530
because her attendance
zone was just

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.720
drawn around a housing project.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:10.460
So it was half empty, entirely
black and Latino, and about 95%

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.990
low income.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.690
So the school district
decides that it's

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:19.100
going to rezone a lot of those
kids from the white school

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.460
into our school, and
those parents fought it.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.260
Fought it tooth and nail.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.870
Said lots of really ugly
things about the children

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:30.350
in the school and the community.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.680
And this helped
me to then frame--

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.430
what people say to me is, I want
to put my kid in that school,

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.394
but I just can't
be the only one.

00:14:39.394 --> 00:14:41.060
So they can't do
something individually.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.820
But then they also fight
structural change as well.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.670
Because this rezoning
was a structural change.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.380
If those parents
came, that school

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.970
would actually have
immediately turned

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.820
to a half white,
half poverty school.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.080
And they fought that too.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.290
So I think we're not
willing to do either, which

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.950
is support structural
changes for equality

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.470
or do things individually.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:06.390
So when parents ask what
they can do, I mean,

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.700
you know the answer, right?

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.610
I mean, one, you have
to go into your, like--

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.250
if you buy into a neighborhood,
go into the school.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.750
Enroll your children
in that school.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.860
Because once those of us who
have choice and privilege

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.450
go into a school
like that, it makes

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.949
it much harder for
our neighbors who

00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:25.430
say, I could never do that, it's
too scary, it's too dangerous,

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.760
to continue to say that, because
you can now say, I'm in there.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.900
My kid is just fine.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:37.046
But then we also have to fight
for structural inequalities.

00:15:37.046 --> 00:15:38.420
When the school
district is doing

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.194
things that would make
things more equal,

00:15:40.194 --> 00:15:41.360
we don't fight those things.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.140
We support them.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.650
And we actually could push
the DOE to do things more.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:46.940
And I don't see that either.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.710
I mean, the thing that
people find most surprising

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.662
is that we have the
most segregated school

00:15:52.662 --> 00:15:54.120
system in the
country, large school

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.780
system, and the third-most
segregated neighborhoods

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.947
in this country.

00:15:57.947 --> 00:15:59.780
And these are-- you
know, we all in the city

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.880
like to think of ourselves
as very progressive,

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.730
liberal people who are
sustaining a tremendous amount

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:05.690
of inequality.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.467
And that equality
does not exist,

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.800
because white people in the
city don't want it to exist.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.758
If white people in the
city wanted integration,

00:16:11.758 --> 00:16:13.230
we would have integration.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.560
So I mean, that's
what you have to do.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.030
We have to go from
saying we want equality

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.220
as a conceptual thing
and actually doing

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.770
things that bring that about.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.270
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE:
And then so you

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.860
mentioned that your daughter's
school has all these--

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.957
has a great principal, has a
lot of learning happening there.

00:16:33.957 --> 00:16:35.540
But when I went to
visit some schools,

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.350
I didn't see that same thing.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.256
And so it's very localized.

00:16:39.256 --> 00:16:40.880
So the question is,
how do you do that?

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.330
I mean, it requires,
like, a village,

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.790
I always say, to make
those structural changes.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.026
And there's a lot of
systematic issues,

00:16:50.026 --> 00:16:51.650
I think, in the
Department of Education

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.267
that makes this
also challenging.

00:16:53.267 --> 00:16:54.350
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Yeah.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.308
I mean, one, I think it's
difficult for parents

00:16:56.308 --> 00:16:58.914
to assess what's
happening in school.

00:16:58.914 --> 00:17:00.080
That's why we use shorthand.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.996
We look at test scores
and we look at the race

00:17:01.996 --> 00:17:04.482
of the kids in the school.

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:06.440
I can assess better,
because I've been covering

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.579
education for a long time.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.328
But the average parent
goes into a school,

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:12.092
and you're looking at
things, and you actually

00:17:12.092 --> 00:17:14.300
can't tell how much learning
is necessarily going on.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.550
I think we can tell,
does it look orderly?

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.170
That sort of thing.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.089
So I think that is a
challenge for parents.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:23.540
But here's-- and this is--

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.839
let me say, I know that I am
asking for a hard thing, right?

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:31.032
I know if white parents
could just go into a school,

00:17:31.032 --> 00:17:32.990
and everything about the
school was functioning

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:34.670
at the high
capacity, segregation

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:36.170
would not be a problem, right?

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.800
Segregation is a problem
because once we have warehoused

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.410
black and Latino
children in a school,

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.700
we don't do certain things.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.080
They don't get
the best teachers.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.705
They don't get the
best administrators.

00:17:46.705 --> 00:17:48.320
They don't have
the best resources.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.820
So we're saying that the
only way we will enroll

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.195
our own children
in those schools

00:17:52.195 --> 00:17:54.020
is if those schools
are already great,

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.910
well-functioning
schools, then segregation

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.370
wouldn't be a problem.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.382
That's what I'm saying.

00:17:59.382 --> 00:18:01.590
I'm saying we are going to
have to give something up.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.280
But the difference is, once--

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.740
and I've covered education
all across this country,

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.930
and what I can
tell you for a fact

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:14.780
is the reason why Dr. King, the
NAACP fought for integration

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.332
was not because there's
something magical that happens

00:18:17.332 --> 00:18:19.290
to black kids when they
sit next to white kids,

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.830
that suddenly they get
smarter and suddenly they

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:22.780
want to learn.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.370
What magically happens
is people in power start

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.650
to care about what
happens to those kids,

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:29.810
because they're sitting
next to white kids.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.060
And things that we allow for
black and brown children,

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.130
we never allow for white
kids in this country.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.820
So once these parents
go into these schools,

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.520
the entire dynamic of
the school changes.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.020
Things that are
allowed when there's

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.940
no white kids in the
school are no longer

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.930
allowed in that school.

00:18:47.575 --> 00:18:50.672
When PSA-- because of
it's overcrowdedness,

00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:52.130
the school district
finally decided

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.982
that it wasn't going to
allow 50 kindergarten kids.

00:18:54.982 --> 00:18:56.190
They put them on a wait list.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.480
50 kids in a system
of one million kids.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.520
I cannot tell you how
many elected officials--

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.190
so you had city councilmen,
you had state assemblymen,

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.770
you had the comptroller.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.310
All of these people were
coming to every single meeting

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.560
those parents had
about 50 kids getting

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.710
wait-listed in a
system of a million.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:19.160
That tells you how
power works in this city

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.370
and in this country, that
those parents whose kids still

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.710
had a spot in my
daughter's school, which

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.830
is a perfectly fine public
school, could demand that.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.010
I don't know what the
poor, low-income parents

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:35.267
in the Farragut Houses whose
children go to my daughter's

00:19:35.267 --> 00:19:37.100
school, I don't know
what they could do that

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.470
could bring elected
officials from Albany

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.490
to attend every meeting that
they're holding on an issue.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.690
That is what integration
does, is it gets people--

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:51.350
it ties the face of white
children and black children

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:52.137
together.

00:19:52.137 --> 00:19:54.470
And that is how black children
are brown children end up

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.030
getting an equal education.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:59.780
And as long as we're able
to keep them over there--

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.917
I mean, I remember
when I first started

00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:03.500
writing about school
segregation, some

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.729
of my coworkers, because every--

00:20:05.729 --> 00:20:08.270
not every-- lots of white folks,
when they moved to New York,

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.920
they moved to Brooklyn,
they moved to Park Slope.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.630
And they moved to Park
Slope because they're told,

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.536
this is where you move
if you want to get

00:20:13.536 --> 00:20:14.660
to the good public schools.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.290
And they're talking
about the PS 321.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:22.039
And they were telling me how,
like, these schools can't

00:20:22.039 --> 00:20:23.330
be segregated in New York City.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.344
Like, my daughter's
school is so diverse.

00:20:25.344 --> 00:20:28.010
And I'm like, yeah, because your
daughter's school looks nothing

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:29.810
like most of the
schools in the city.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.520
And that's how
segregation works,

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.777
is it makes it invisible what
it is like for other kids.

00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:38.360
It makes it invisible
what's happening

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.440
in other neighborhoods.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.849
Because when your school
looks like the United Nations,

00:20:41.849 --> 00:20:43.640
you can then delude
yourself into believing

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.010
that that's the experience
of every other kid.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.480
But in a school system that is
heavily segregated, in order

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.360
for some of these schools
to look beautifully diverse,

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.980
that means all the
rest of the schools

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.354
have to be entirely black
and Latino and entirely poor.

00:20:57.354 --> 00:20:59.770
That's a really long answer,
but it's a really long answer

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:04.210
to say, we're not going
to fix this problem by not

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.860
making a personal sacrifice.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.070
And honestly, I don't
think the sacrifice should

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:15.040
be black and Latino middle class
parents who ourselves have just

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.840
worked ourselves out of being
working class or poor who

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.190
generationally have no wealth
because of this history,

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:25.600
or this country's history
of discrimination.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.720
The burden should not be on
us, because we didn't create

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.840
segregation, and we actually
cannot undo segregation.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.010
But with that said, we
also can't shirk our duties

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.045
to our communities either.

00:21:38.045 --> 00:21:40.420
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE: And so I
think what you're saying is,

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.210
we all should be allies.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:46.030
I would say that's something
that I come to this.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.940
As allies, if we can
give up something--

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.440
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: I think
we have to be more than allies.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.840
We have to be actors.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.110
I think there's too many
allies and not enough actors.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.850
And I'm just going to-- you
know, I think that's true.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.000
I think one of the
things I hear people say

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.370
is, well, I can't put
my child in that school,

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.860
but I promise I'll
support that school.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.560
But they don't, right?

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.690
Because we all have to
be invested in things

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.130
to care about them.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:16.770
And we say we care
about these kids,

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.340
but I don't think
we show that we do.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.440
And so I don't think it's
enough to ally ourselves

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.315
with the right cause.

00:22:21.315 --> 00:22:23.620
I think we have to act.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.020
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE: What about--

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:30.804
they have committees now,
like parent committees

00:22:30.804 --> 00:22:31.720
where they're not PTA.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.070
I mean more just broadly--

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.590
the Board of Ed has--

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.840
now I'm blanking on the name--

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:36.580
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES:
Community Education Councils?

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.996
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE:
Yeah, exactly.

00:22:37.996 --> 00:22:38.920
The councils, yes.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.651
Is that one way for people
to get involved and act?

00:22:42.651 --> 00:22:43.150
Or I mean--

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:43.710
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES:
Yeah, for sure.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:44.320
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE:
any suggestions,

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.220
real concrete
suggestions for people

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.620
if they want to get involved?

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:47.920
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Yeah.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.210
So we have an unusual--

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.585
I don't know how
many of you guys

00:22:50.585 --> 00:22:53.080
have kids or kids in the New
York City public schools,

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.811
but is a bit of an unusual
system where there's no school

00:22:56.811 --> 00:22:57.310
board.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.870
There's no board of education.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.050
It's divided into a bunch of
small educational districts.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.510
And actually, the
way it operates

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.400
comes directly out
of the failed efforts

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.130
to integrate the city's
schools in the 1960s.

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:10.630
And black and Latino
parents who had

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.760
been fighting for integration
finally got tired of it

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.134
and instead asked for local
control of their own schools.

00:23:15.134 --> 00:23:19.390
So these Community Education
Councils crop up around that.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:21.910
And that is basically
the way that communities

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.650
can interact with
the school system is

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.630
through these community
education councils.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.640
And the one thing that they
have power over zoning.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.810
And zoning is one of the most
important tools for equity.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.540
Because just like my
daughter's school,

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.450
you can take two communities
that look very different,

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.670
and you can zone them
for the same schools.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.220
So that's a great
way that people can

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:47.200
advocate for systemic equality.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.300
But what we're
finding in the city is

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:53.080
when the DOE tries
to zone for equity,

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.719
parents, white parents fight it.

00:23:55.719 --> 00:23:57.760
You know, they're fighting
on the Upper West Side

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.884
about this thing right now.

00:23:58.884 --> 00:24:01.540
They fought in Dumbo about
this thing right now.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.550
So I think that is the problem.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.550
What the people who run
the New York City public

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.650
schools have learned is this
is what you don't touch.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.900
That's why they don't want
to talk about integration,

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.330
they don't want to put
forth plans for integration,

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.670
because they are very
nervous about losing

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.170
the small white
population that's

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.880
left in the public
schools, and they

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.090
are afraid that this is not
what white parents want.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.780
When white parents
are demanding this,

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.550
the school system will
act in a different way,

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.174
but they're not
demanding it right now.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.150
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE:
So on that point,

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:35.680
could you share a little bit
more about the broader work

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.240
that you've done
outside of New York?

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.710
I know we're all
in New York here,

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.660
but I would love to
hear more about--

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:45.520
like, I heard the
Fresh Air podcast which

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.710
you talked about Missouri.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.710
And I'd love to hear just other
states and other things that

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:54.070
are going on that you are
learning about and writing

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.730
about.

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.021
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: I mean,
what's both good and bad--

00:24:57.021 --> 00:24:59.560
I always say bad for humanity,
good for journalism is--

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:06.610
--is that school segregation
is a national scourge.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.650
There are very, very
few school districts

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.987
that are well-integrated,
and most of them

00:25:10.987 --> 00:25:12.070
are actually in the South.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.840
So I did, like, my
first big investigation

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.457
in school resegregation, and was
based in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

00:25:22.457 --> 00:25:24.040
Which, because of
federal court orders

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.530
to integrate its
schools, had actually

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.680
achieved perfect
numerical integration.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.221
And the way that
that happened was

00:25:31.221 --> 00:25:33.470
there was a black high school
and a white high school,

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.636
and a black middle school
and a white middle school,

00:25:35.636 --> 00:25:36.800
and the judge merged them.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.230
So if you were a student from
K through-- or excuse me,

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:43.057
6th through 12th
grade in Tuscaloosa,

00:25:43.057 --> 00:25:44.890
you went to the same
school, no matter what.

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.500
Or else you had to pay
for private school.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.440
And then when that court
order was released,

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.380
then the school district
took immediate steps

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:58.200
to resegregate the schools and
created an entire feeder system

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.900
from kindergarten to 12th
grade, where these kids would

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.990
only ever attend entirely back
and entirely poor schools.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:09.060
And what's interesting about the
law is if you had at one point

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.450
been found guilty of violating
the Constitution by legally

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.754
segregating kids and
you're under a court order,

00:26:15.754 --> 00:26:17.670
the judges can make you
do all kinds of things

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.470
to make sure that those
schools are integrated.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.761
But as soon as you're released
from those court orders,

00:26:21.761 --> 00:26:23.700
you can literally do
anything that you want,

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.820
as long as you don't say you're
doing it to be discriminatory.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.240
So even though they
created this entire feeder

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.144
system of all black
schools, and everyone

00:26:32.144 --> 00:26:34.560
knew that's what they were
doing, because they never said,

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.770
we're doing this to
discriminate against black kids,

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.040
it's perfectly legal.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.140
And that's what we see
all across the country.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.250
The main way that
schools are segregated

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.230
is either between
school districts--

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.770
so New York City has a very
small white student population

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.110
because of white flight.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:54.090
And so most of the suburban
districts are heavily white,

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.020
and the cities aren't.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.724
So in the North,
most segregation

00:26:56.724 --> 00:26:58.140
is actually not
within a district,

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.980
but between school districts,
even though in New York City,

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.890
our actual school district
is very segregated too.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.585
And in the South, most of the
districts were county-wide.

00:27:08.585 --> 00:27:10.710
So when the courts were
ordering them to integrate,

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.919
you only had one choice,
which is integrate or pay

00:27:12.919 --> 00:27:13.710
for private school.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.180
Because you couldn't just move--

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:15.510
I mean, I don't know.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.676
How many school districts
are in Westchester County?

00:27:17.676 --> 00:27:20.410
Like 24 or something like that?

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:22.200
In the South, there
was one per county.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.800
So you couldn't
just move a couple

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.770
of miles up the road
to a white community

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:26.940
and avoid integration.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.150
But in the North,
that's largely the way

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:30.240
that it was accomplished.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.610
So I've written about school
segregation in the South.

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:35.880
I've written about
it in Missouri.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.950
I've written about
it in the North.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.820
And for black children, the
Northeast and the Midwest

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.640
are the absolute worst places
for school segregation.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.140
And not the South,
because the South

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.180
was forced to integrate
by the courts,

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.112
and it did so when
it was forced to.

00:27:50.112 --> 00:27:51.570
In the North, there
was very little

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.840
court-ordered integration, and
we've just refused to do it.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.537
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE: And aren't
some of those orders expiring?

00:27:58.537 --> 00:28:00.870
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Yeah,
most of them are expired now.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:04.740
Or not expired, but school
districts can go to the courts

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:05.910
and get them released.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.690
And the kind of sad and
ironic thing about it

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.910
is they can get them released
without really having

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:12.775
integrated.

00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:14.400
They can just say
that they tried hard,

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.890
and courts will release them.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.640
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE:
So I want to make sure

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.960
that you guys have time
for your own questions,

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.960
so please come to the
mic if you have some.

00:28:24.732 --> 00:28:25.560
Oh, hey.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.480
Good.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.992
But before I do that,
who's doing it well?

00:28:29.992 --> 00:28:31.950
Like you mentioned in
the South, and you talked

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:33.270
about bussing in your video.

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:36.090
And school choice in New
York City, I feel to me,

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:38.464
now just moves people around.

00:28:38.464 --> 00:28:40.380
You know, and so people
aren't going to school

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.921
with the folks in
their neighborhood,

00:28:41.921 --> 00:28:44.470
and I do think
there's something to--

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:48.300
there's something really,
like, magical about the kids

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.100
on the same block going
to the same school.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.320
But because of this
segregation of our communities,

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.570
we have this issue that we
need to move people around,

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:56.180
and then choice actually
helps with that, sort of.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.138
But I would love to hear
your thoughts on this.

00:28:58.138 --> 00:29:01.080
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: So
one, in New York City,

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.460
school choice doesn't tend
to help with integration.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:11.070
What school choice does is it
allows white and middle class

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.770
parents who are in neighborhoods
with segregated schools

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:15.330
to get away from those schools.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.690
And if you look at the
best schools in the city,

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.910
they are disproportionately
white and Asian.

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.380
And black and
Latino kids, who are

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.963
the majority of kids
in this district,

00:29:23.963 --> 00:29:26.220
are not getting access to them.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.440
So choice has this, like,
nice veneer of, it's

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.300
an equal system.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.490
It allows everyone access
to all of these schools.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.640
But as some of you
may or may not know,

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.860
the best schools-- so
specialized high schools.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.780
You have to take a single test.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.760
A test that the
Department of Education

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.920
admits that what's
taught on that test

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.570
is not taught in
most of the schools

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:47.190
that black and
Latino kids go to.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.315
So they are testing
on something,

00:29:48.315 --> 00:29:50.310
but it's not actually-- a
curriculum that's not actually

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.960
being taught.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.620
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE: I feel
the same way about the G&amp;T.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:53.745
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Right.

00:29:53.745 --> 00:29:58.410
G&amp;T also allows segregation
within integrated schools.

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:01.660
So G&amp;T is very heavily
white and Latino,

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.570
even if the schools
are-- or, excuse me.

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:07.710
White and Asian, even if the
schools are black and Latino.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.590
Many of the best middle
schools and high schools,

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.090
you have to apply.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.910
You have to apply in
person during school hours.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:17.160
You have to submit a portfolio.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.410
And then you get selected
into these schools.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.540
So that's not equal
choice, particularly when

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.810
we know we have a very
segregated, unequal educational

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.150
system where kids are
coming out of high schools

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:28.080
where they have--

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.788
they don't know how
to build a portfolio.

00:30:29.788 --> 00:30:32.170
No one's prepared them
to build a portfolio.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.810
Their parents are
working hourly jobs

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.720
where if you're forcing them
to apply in person at 2 o'clock

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.910
in the afternoon, that means
they're losing that $8 an hour

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.450
that they need to
pay their kids,

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:44.220
because they're
making poverty wages.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.980
So choice here
has largely served

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.860
to benefit white
and middle class,

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.140
but gives a veneer
of equality when

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.550
that's not how it functions.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:55.550
And what happens is that most
low-income black and Latino

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:57.890
schools end up going to
their neighborhood schools

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:00.150
by default, because they
are not getting access

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.608
to those other schools, and
they stay in their neighborhood

00:31:02.608 --> 00:31:06.085
schools, which are segregated
and often low-performing.

00:31:06.085 --> 00:31:08.210
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE: I'd
like to take some questions

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.690
from the audience.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:09.580
I'll start right here.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.371
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:31:10.371 --> 00:31:12.920
Thank you so much for coming
to speak with us today.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.350
I really enjoyed
reading your article,

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:19.080
and it caused me to talk about
it with a lot of my friends.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.660
And I was pretty shocked to
hear very liberal people say,

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.210
it's not my place to hear
about school segregation.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:28.460
I'm not a parent.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:32.960
And you know, I feel like
people who don't have kids also

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.310
have a stake in the game, right?

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:37.514
Because we might become
parents, and in 10 years--

00:31:37.514 --> 00:31:38.930
you know, personally,
I don't want

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:42.050
to face a decision
like you had to face.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.810
I don't want to
live in this system.

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:47.150
But it does bring a question.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:51.050
What can childless
people do, right?

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.850
In some ways, it seems
like maybe we're better--

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.660
it's easier to fight
systemic inequality

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:00.280
if we don't have a child
who's affected by it.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.190
But what can be done,
especially in New York City?

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:04.100
Thank you.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.183
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Yeah.

00:32:05.183 --> 00:32:06.291
So one, I think--

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:07.290
this is what I'm saying.

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:08.840
Like, do we believe
in a common good?

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.960
Because a common good means
I don't fight for things only

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.880
because it will benefit me.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.320
I fight for things
because I think

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.740
it is for the good
of our country,

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.400
and it is for the
good of my neighbors.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.530
One does not have to
be a woman to fight

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:23.420
for women's rights
and liberation,

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.660
and we expect that men
will join this struggle,

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:30.939
even though it may or may
not affect them directly.

00:32:30.939 --> 00:32:33.230
It's the same thing with
Black Lives Matter protesters.

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:36.860
Like, it can't just be black
folks protesting injustice

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.420
against black Americans.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.920
Other people should have
a stake in this as well.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.922
So I think what someone who
doesn't have children would do

00:32:43.922 --> 00:32:46.130
is the same thing that
someone who does have children

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.740
should do, except you
don't have a child

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.830
to enroll in the schools.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:49.970
But it is systemic.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.680
So are we pushing--

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.190
I gave an example a few weeks
ago when I was on the stage

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.490
with City Councilman Brad
Lander, who's been advocating

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:03.120
for integration to a degree.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:08.030
And I said, you know, when
the Muslim ban was implemented

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:11.030
and you saw these crowds of
people going out to LaGuardia--

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.454
and that was
amazing to see that.

00:33:12.454 --> 00:33:14.120
And I said, what would
it have been like

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.880
if we ever saw crowds
of people descending

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.220
on City Hall and the
Department of Education,

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.740
demanding integration and
equality for our children?

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.560
That we can muster this
when we don't feel like--

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.520
you have nothing
to lose by saying,

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.100
let people into this country.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:34.850
Why can't we muster that same
amount of protest and pushing

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.730
for school integration and
equality that we do for that?

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.730
And those are things that we
can do as community members

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.620
and say, go to the Community
Education Council meetings

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.220
and advocate for zoning
that is more equitable.

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.750
Press our elected
leaders that this

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:50.041
is something that should be
at the top of their agenda.

00:33:50.041 --> 00:33:53.120
But you think, we have Mayor
Bill de Blasio, married

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.770
to a black woman,
biracial children,

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:57.140
runs on the Tale of
Two Cities and refuses

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.300
to talk about school
integration except

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.127
to say that homeowners buy
into certain neighborhoods

00:34:02.127 --> 00:34:03.710
to go to certain
schools, and we don't

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.431
have the right to disrupt that.

00:34:05.431 --> 00:34:05.930
Right?

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:07.460
That is a problem.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.760
But he has no pressure
to say anything else.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.239
And that's what people who
truly believe in this issue have

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:17.300
to make it, so that you cannot
be a politician in the city

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.910
and not talk about this issue.

00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:22.985
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:22.985 --> 00:34:26.030
AUDIENCE: What's your
perspective on vouchers broadly

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:29.190
and the DeVos
nomination specifically?

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.440
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Oh, lord.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.273
AUDIENCE: And also--

00:34:31.273 --> 00:34:32.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.630
--and also what's the
difference between school choice

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.150
and vouchers?

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.860
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: So school
choice is a big umbrella term,

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.193
and it can mean a lot of things.

00:34:41.193 --> 00:34:44.880
It can mean choice of
traditional public school.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.000
So school choice
in New York City

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.060
is within traditional
schools, I can

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.820
choose which school
I put my child in,

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.290
or I can choose charter schools.

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:56.449
So charter schools are
considered school choice,

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:59.300
and vouchers are also
considered school choice.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.570
What school choice
says is that schools

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:05.690
need to compete for children
and parents have the right

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:06.980
to shop for schools.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.050
And this feels very
natural to us now,

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.480
but this is actually
not a natural thing.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.590
That is not what public
educations were founded to do.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:16.290
What public education
was founded to do

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:18.620
it is a socialist
institution by nature,

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.870
which says that we are going
to care for all children,

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:22.161
no matter where they came from.

00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:23.936
And within the
system, every school

00:35:23.936 --> 00:35:25.310
is going to offer
the same thing.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:27.510
And it should be a
good, basic education,

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:30.260
but someone can't get
the Cadillac and someone

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.380
gets the Pinto, right?

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.350
Like, that's not what public
education is supposed to be,

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:37.550
but that is what school
choice advocates,

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:40.790
is that it's a market, and
schools should have to compete.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:43.340
One can understand,
though, capitalism

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:44.930
is not a system of morality.

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:48.350
And capitalism by its nature
means some people will win,

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:49.550
and some people will lose.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:53.360
And so when you infuse market
terminology and thinking

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.770
into public schools,
you are then

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:57.560
acknowledging that within
a publicly funded system,

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.092
there will be
winners and losers.

00:35:59.092 --> 00:36:01.050
And the winners and losers
are always the same.

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.600
Never changed in the
history of this country.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.260
So my thoughts on vouchers.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.560
One, I believe in
public schools.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.290
I believe that when
we spend public funds,

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.910
those public funds should
go to public schools.

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:15.560
Why?

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.435
One, because private schools
can choose to take you or not.

00:36:19.435 --> 00:36:20.810
Private schools
can discriminate.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.060
Now they're not supposed
to discriminate on race,

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.870
but they can decide
for whatever reason

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.757
that they don't want
to take children.

00:36:26.757 --> 00:36:28.340
Because you have a
disability and they

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.230
don't want to accommodate
you, and under federal law,

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:31.688
they don't have to
accommodate you.

00:36:31.688 --> 00:36:33.920
Public schools have to
accommodate all disabilities.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.480
They can decide they don't
like your background.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.160
They can decide--
for whatever reason.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:41.860
So I have a fundamental
problem with using public money

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.720
for organizations that operate
privately and can discriminate

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.550
against children.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:48.930
I think that you should not--

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:51.920
there's also not the same
accountability or transparency.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.160
The public system has to
tell me, who works for you?

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.075
What's your budget?

00:36:56.075 --> 00:36:57.200
What did you spend on this?

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.370
What are the test scores?

00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:59.995
Private institutions
don't have to have

00:36:59.995 --> 00:37:01.290
that same accountability.

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:04.670
But I think my biggest issue
in general with school choice

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.070
and most school reform
is it's premised

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.320
on providing an escape
hatch for few kids

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.120
that we think are worthy.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.730
And I think all
children are worthy.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:15.290
And I don't think
that, one, we should

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.500
be draining public resources
to give a couple kids access

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.690
to a great education
and the rest of the kids

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:22.940
are left behind with even
fewer resources than before.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.410
Two-part question.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:28.826
AUDIENCE: Short
follow-up to that.

00:37:28.826 --> 00:37:32.260
So even if you
eliminated school choice,

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:35.930
there's still a capitalist
dimension to the way

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:41.910
schools operate simply by, I
guess, zoning or geography,

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:42.480
right?

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:47.590
Like, I grew up in a small
suburb bordering Chicago.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:51.900
And in my suburb, we had
amazing public schools.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.570
And on the other side of the
border, they were not as good.

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:57.862
And there was no
school choice there.

00:37:57.862 --> 00:37:59.320
It was simply,
like, where you were

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.150
able to rent or buy property.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:03.260
So it's capitalist
in that sense, right?

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.530
It's based on where
you can afford to live.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:07.820
How does that operate?

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.156
Like, is it through local taxes?

00:38:11.156 --> 00:38:12.530
Like, I think
there's, like, just

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:16.449
some fundamental
structural knowledge that

00:38:16.449 --> 00:38:17.240
needs to be shared.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:25.930
Like, how is it possible that
one public school system here

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.990
can be not as good as
the one adjacent to it?

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:30.430
Is it through tax dollars?

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:31.620
Like, investment?

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:32.300
Like--

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:33.610
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Yeah,
it's a couple of things.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.235
AUDIENCE: Financially,
what's happened?

00:38:35.235 --> 00:38:37.690
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: So
school funding is largely

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.370
based on property taxes.

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:42.520
And the Supreme Court has ruled
that children are not entitled

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.780
to an equally funded education.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.010
So what often happens is even
though property taxes tend

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:50.320
to be lower in the
suburbs, property values

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.800
tend to be a lot higher.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.810
So cities-- I can give
you an example of Detroit.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.850
Detroit has the most
unequal school boundaries

00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:59.480
of any place in the country.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.420
So you can cross 8
Mile, and immediately

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.920
go into one of the
wealthiest school

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.840
districts in the country.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.380
But the tax rate in
Detroit is much higher.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.540
So over and over again, citizens
in Detroit who are much lower

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.850
income-- and as you know,
the housing market there,

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.394
housing stock is worth nothing--

00:39:14.394 --> 00:39:16.810
keep taxing themselves, trying
to raise money for schools.

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:21.425
But high taxes on
nothing produces nothing.

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:23.800
Suburbs, on the other hand,
can have a very low tax rate,

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.300
but when property
values-- you know,

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.600
the median house is $500,000,
it raises a lot of capital.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.070
So that's a huge part of it.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:32.320
It's also, look at who
lives in the cities

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.610
and who lives in the suburbs.

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:37.210
So in Detroit, you
have a population

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.300
that's largely been abandoned
by the middle class.

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.090
Low education,
low literacy rate,

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:44.920
they're earning low wages.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:48.490
And you know, the white
suburb has very high-educated,

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:50.110
high-wage-earning parents.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:52.990
So when you consolidate all
those kids in one school,

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:55.496
and then all kids living in
poverty in one school district,

00:39:55.496 --> 00:39:58.120
then you're also going to get a
great deal of inequality there.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.010
I mean, that's why I
argue for integration,

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:03.340
because it's the only way
that you can even things out.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.190
And the solutions to the problem
have to be fairly radical.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:07.960
My book is actually based--

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.060
the narrative of my
book is based in Detroit

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:13.240
because it was the site of
the Supreme Court lawsuit

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:16.270
ruling, this landmark ruling
where the Supreme Court ruled

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.370
that the white suburbs
had to integrate

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:19.600
with the city of Detroit.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.990
That they had played a role
in causing the segregation,

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:23.800
and because there were no
white kids left in Detroit

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.630
to integrate with, you
couldn't get integration

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:26.880
without including the suburbs.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.050
And the Supreme Court
struck that down.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:31.960
So because of that, it has
become very, very difficult

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.150
to integrate in the
Northeast and the Midwest

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.850
where you have urban,
high-poverty cities surrounded

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:39.100
by affluent white suburbs.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.840
So the solution would
have to be either end

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.570
the school funding
structure that

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:47.820
allows cities to fund
their own schools,

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.900
or you break down
all of these borders

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.580
and you have county-wide
school systems.

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:54.680
Which, I think is the
right thing to do.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:58.040
It's also very not
politically palatable.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.680
AUDIENCE: And have
you linked this

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.847
to the history of redlining?

00:41:00.847 --> 00:41:01.930
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Yeah.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.730
I mean, that is--
the story of Detroit

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:06.100
is the story of redlining.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:09.190
Things that we count as truism,
like that a white neighborhood

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:10.900
is going to be a
wealthier neighborhood,

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.180
or that white people are
going to be more likely to be

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.210
able to move into Park Slope
and to neighborhoods where they

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:18.700
can afford 321, it's
because of a legacy

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.010
of housing discrimination.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:23.590
The reason Detroit is all
black and the suburbs are white

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.270
is because of housing
discrimination.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:27.970
It is because black
Americans were

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:30.460
barred from these
communities when

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.590
the federal government--
so the reason

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.840
so many white Americans
were able to buy homes

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.420
was after the Great Depression,
the federal government

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.580
decided to start
insuring home loans

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.730
so you no longer had to
put 75% down on a house.

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:44.680
You could put 20%
down on a house.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.590
And this is how most white
Americans got wealth.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.440
98% of those loans went
to white Americans.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.140
The federal government
actually created redlining,

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.380
and did not insure loans
in black neighborhoods.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.150
So that wealth is
cumulative over time.

00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:59.830
And it doesn't mean
that white people

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:01.100
haven't worked for things.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.030
But what it means is they've
gotten a huge huge head start

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:06.250
the black Americans didn't get.

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.992
So what the census data
shows is that if you

00:42:08.992 --> 00:42:10.450
are black and middle
class, you are

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:13.210
more likely to live in a
high-poverty neighborhood

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:15.130
than if you're white and poor.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.960
And that is because
of a wealth gap.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:20.960
That is because black Americans
have income, but no wealth.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.010
So we might make the same
thing, but your family wealth

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:26.140
allows you to buy a
house in Park Slope,

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:29.450
and I have no family wealth, so
I'm renting in Bed-Stuy, right?

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.210
Like, that's the difference.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.142
So all of those
things are related.

00:42:33.142 --> 00:42:34.600
That's why my good
friend Ta-Nehisi

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.060
argues for reparations, right?

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.100
Is because we had--

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:42.160
in the 1960s, we passed civil
rights law that say, OK.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.390
From here on out, you can
no longer discriminate.

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:47.320
But we never made up for
that past discrimination.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.870
And if you don't make up for
that past discrimination, then

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:50.740
people just--

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.299
then inequality just
replicates itself.

00:42:53.299 --> 00:42:54.340
AUDIENCE: I'll be honest.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.100
I hadn't even heard of
redlining until I started

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.600
reading Ta-Nehisi Coates.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.800
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Yes.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.630
Yeah.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.550
It's one of those things where
you see all this inequality,

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:06.200
but we've never
learned in school,

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.140
or no one's ever taught
us how it's created.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.185
So then that's how you
get the myth of, well,

00:43:10.185 --> 00:43:12.310
if they just worked harder,
if they just wanted it,

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:13.870
they would have it.

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:16.330
And we don't understand that
so much of this was created,

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:19.710
and it was created
by our government.

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:20.210
Oh, hi.

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:21.170
Am I answering too long?

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:21.758
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE: No.

00:43:21.758 --> 00:43:22.341
This is great.

00:43:22.341 --> 00:43:23.100
This is amazing.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.955
I mean, I would also
add, what I noticed

00:43:25.955 --> 00:43:29.830
in my search was the
opportunity to raise money,

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:31.185
you know, for the PTA and--

00:43:31.185 --> 00:43:32.060
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Of course.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:32.870
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE:
I mean, that was,

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.550
like-- it was a huge difference.

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:37.850
You could have a gala, or
you could have a bake sale.

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:41.280
Like, there was a huge
difference in the opportunity

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.380
to get that extra money.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:43.700
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Because
there actually is, like,

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:44.440
federal--

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.830
there's federal
funding available

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.500
to high-poverty schools
called Title I dollars.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.345
And so it understands
that just giving--

00:43:51.345 --> 00:43:53.720
if you're going to have a
school where every kid is poor,

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.803
just giving that school
the same thing as a school

00:43:55.803 --> 00:43:58.080
where most kids are rich
is not going to be enough.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.380
The problem is that
little bit of money

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:03.530
can't outdo the power,
the financial power

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:06.110
of white middle class folks to
raise money for their schools.

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.660
So at my daughter's school,
our PTA in a good year

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.630
would raise $2,000.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:14.360
As you all know, some
schools, including PSA,

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.520
can raise hundreds of
thousands of dollars a year,

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.400
and some schools raise a
million dollars a year.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.860
And that all pays for all
of the extra things for kids

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.745
who already have everything.

00:44:23.745 --> 00:44:26.120
And one of the things that I
heard over and over from PSA

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:30.860
parents was, we can
donate $20,000 to the PTA,

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:33.380
because we're still
saving $20,000 by not

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:34.700
paying for private school.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.620
So they are getting--

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:39.470
we have allowed a system where
certain parents are getting

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:42.380
a private school education
on the public dime,

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.600
and then they are able
to infuse those resources

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.090
into the school, because for
them, it's still a savings.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:48.630
And that is why they
don't want integration.

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:49.910
They don't want to give that up.

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:51.493
They don't-- and
they threaten, right?

00:44:51.493 --> 00:44:54.170
What they say is, if you force
our kids into these schools,

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:56.330
we will pick up and put
our kid in private school

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:58.160
or move to Jersey.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.470
And so they have
this kind of ransom

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:01.790
over the school district.

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:04.760
Because I understand
why school officials--

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.250
you don't want a system that's
entirely black and Latino,

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:08.600
entirely poor.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:11.900
You do need to hold onto
enough of the base of people

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.979
who have power and
influence in the city.

00:45:13.979 --> 00:45:15.770
You want them in the
schools, because we've

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:18.260
seen other places where there's
a complete white withdrawal

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:19.280
from public schools.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.530
Then when you need to raise
a tax for your school,

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:23.690
they vote it down, because their
kids aren't in the schools,

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:24.189
right?

00:45:24.189 --> 00:45:26.730
You lose that base of support
that's necessary for all kids.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:28.110
So I understand that.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:31.010
But it just creates
a very unfair system

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:33.590
where you can fund the schools
the same with tax dollars,

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:36.740
but when you can raise a
million dollars for your school,

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.331
you can do a lot
for your school.

00:45:38.331 --> 00:45:39.804
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE: Yeah.

00:45:39.804 --> 00:45:40.786
Please.

00:45:40.786 --> 00:45:41.786
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Hi.

00:45:41.786 --> 00:45:42.480
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.670
So I first just wanted to thank
you for being here, and also

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:46.910
for your article.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:49.290
I read it when it came
out, and it's like--

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.940
just one of the most, like,
devastating and impactful

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:53.040
things I read.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:53.980
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: I'm
glad it was devastating.

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:54.688
That was my plan.

00:45:54.688 --> 00:45:55.644
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:55.644 --> 00:45:56.540
That was my plan.

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.785
AUDIENCE: Honestly, just
to see, like, the promise

00:45:58.785 --> 00:46:00.910
and the progress that was
being made and was, like,

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:04.400
consciously undone is something
that's really stuck with me,

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.190
and I think of it often.

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:10.120
So I'm a mom of a kindergartner
in a New York City

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:13.420
public school, in
District 14 Williamsburg.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.050
It's a very progressive area.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.810
It's one that has changed
radically in, like,

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:20.980
the last five years.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:24.800
Like, you know, the parents
I know who have 10-year-olds,

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.950
they sent their kids to
schools in the East Village

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.880
or they send them
to private school.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.120
Now everybody goes
to public school.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:35.721
You know, all of the moms,
all the yuppie moms, I mean,

00:46:35.721 --> 00:46:37.345
everyone's in the
local public schools.

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:46.096
And you know, one of the
things that I've noticed was--

00:46:46.096 --> 00:46:47.470
I want to call
out in particular,

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:50.560
there's a school called
Brooklyn Arbor, PS 414,

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.290
that's the hardest to get into.

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:58.450
And it is still primarily
black and Latina.

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:04.480
But what happened a few
years ago was a new principal

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:08.260
came in, and she sort of
sounded all the right notes

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.825
for a progressive community
about being progressive.

00:47:10.825 --> 00:47:16.020
[INAUDIBLE], like, a lot of
social-emotional education,

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:19.540
and they started a rooftop
garden and recycling,

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:23.337
and sort of hit all
the notes that, you

00:47:23.337 --> 00:47:25.670
know, this community of parents
want to hear these days,

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:28.000
that affluent
parents want to hear.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.430
In fact, the highest performing
schools in our district

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:32.830
are underenrolled in
terms of test scores,

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:35.470
because that's not what people
are looking for right now.

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:37.780
So really, with
very little money,

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.630
they became the most
sought after school.

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:46.120
They are integrated.

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.732
Whatever lack of
integration exists

00:47:47.732 --> 00:47:49.690
is not for, like, lack
of white parents wanting

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:50.731
to send their kids there.

00:47:50.731 --> 00:47:52.480
It's because they're
not zoned for it,

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.980
and it's just very
hard to get into.

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:55.150
It's a smaller school.

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:57.146
So I'm just wondering
if you think--

00:47:57.146 --> 00:47:59.020
and to contrast that,
there's a school, like,

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:03.280
PS 17 that is in the middle
of the most affluent area,

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.354
but everyone avoids.

00:48:04.354 --> 00:48:05.770
Nobody will send
their kids there,

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:10.060
because the administration
is seen as sort of closed

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:13.330
and doesn't open up to
community and new suggestions

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:14.750
and new ideas.

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:17.026
So I wonder if you think
there's any promise

00:48:17.026 --> 00:48:20.560
or if it's worth,
like, trying to sort

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:26.287
of press at the
district level or the--

00:48:26.287 --> 00:48:28.120
or I don't even know
what level you approach

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.850
for the sort of, like,
reforms that may actually

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:33.245
be good for kids in terms
of a progressive education,

00:48:33.245 --> 00:48:36.552
and it might also draw more
different kinds of families.

00:48:36.552 --> 00:48:37.635
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Yeah.

00:48:37.635 --> 00:48:39.970
I think-- oh, man.

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:43.750
I think we just have to
be really careful about--

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:44.680
[SIGH]

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:49.850
I think that principals-- and
I would imagine a lot of these

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:52.910
principals in these schools
are black and Latino--

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:56.330
feel very protective
of their kids

00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:58.910
when white parents come in
with their great new ideas,

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:02.224
and are immediately like,
this school seems good,

00:49:02.224 --> 00:49:03.890
but it would be so
much better if you do

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:06.601
the things that, like, we want.

00:49:06.601 --> 00:49:07.100
And I hear--

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:08.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:10.190
--I hear this all the
time, where they're like,

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:11.960
oh, we didn't like that
school, because they just

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.010
didn't seem open to us.

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:15.500
And I'm like, you can't
just show up one day

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:18.650
and immediately expect that
these administrators, who

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:21.734
have been working with this
population for a long time,

00:49:21.734 --> 00:49:23.150
need to-- you know,
because you're

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:24.191
so much more enlightened.

00:49:24.191 --> 00:49:26.120
And I think that is
often how it's presented.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.220
I mean, I can tell
you, that battle,

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.170
we're having at our
school right now.

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:32.900
This was a school that without
white parents, brought in STEM,

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:35.099
taught Mandarin,
has art, has music.

00:49:35.099 --> 00:49:37.640
And then white parents come in,
and they're like, no, no, no.

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.104
You should do this.

00:49:39.104 --> 00:49:40.520
Even the way you
framed it, right?

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.660
Progressive parents.

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:43.550
There are tons of black
progressive parents.

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:44.960
They're not new parents, right?

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:50.480
But it's this privileging that
the benefits of integration

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.592
are, like, white
privilege folks are

00:49:52.592 --> 00:49:54.050
going to come in
and show you guys,

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:57.470
like, how to do
this the right way.

00:49:57.470 --> 00:50:01.060
And so the hardest--

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:03.940
when I was doing this article,
my editor, who I love,

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.650
was like, I don't get it.

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:07.900
Like, on the one hand, you're
arguing for integration,

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:08.860
but then you're like--

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:10.270
you're also afraid that
too many white people

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:11.145
are going to come in.

00:50:11.145 --> 00:50:11.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:12.179
Right?

00:50:12.179 --> 00:50:13.000
And I'm like, yes.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:13.900
That's exactly right.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:16.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:17.290
This is not easy.

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:19.340
It's not ever going to be easy.

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:20.500
It's complicated.

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.650
It took us-- if you look
at my Twitter handle,

00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:26.590
I say that I write
about race from 1619,

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:29.410
which is the year that the
first Africans were brought

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:31.630
in this country to be enslaved.

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:33.610
And this was when we
began implementing

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:36.670
racial caste, which is
140 years before we even

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:38.530
become a country, right?

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:40.000
So this is older than us.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.850
This is embedded in the
DNA of this country.

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:45.910
And we worked very,
very hard to create

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:48.190
the inequality and
the segregation

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:50.590
that we are dealing with now.

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:52.930
We spent 400 years
perfecting it.

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:56.950
We've spent maybe 40 years
trying half-heartedly

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:57.790
to undo it.

00:50:57.790 --> 00:50:59.650
And then we somehow
just want it to be easy,

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:02.500
because we just want to
be over with it already.

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.820
It's not going to work that way.

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:06.820
When we're putting these
communities and schools

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.716
together, it's going to be
tense, it's going to be hard.

00:51:09.716 --> 00:51:11.840
It's going to-- like, we're
going to make mistakes.

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.870
I'm saying we have
to do it, but it

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:15.520
can't be the folks
who have always

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:17.080
had the privilege
all the time say,

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.910
you're so lucky that I'm here.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:21.430
And now let me tell
you that the last 20

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:25.310
years of you working with
these kids is not good enough.

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:27.242
And the only reason
that white parents

00:51:27.242 --> 00:51:29.200
are looking at that
school, which I write about

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.752
in my article, is
they already had

00:51:30.752 --> 00:51:33.430
to have had a principle
that it worked miracles

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:35.410
with that population to
even make white folks

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:37.650
feel like this is even
an option for their kids.

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:39.940
So that's the
issue, is how do you

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:42.700
go in and understand,
I'm bringing privilege,

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.590
I am bringing a lot of
assets to the school,

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:47.890
but not overrun the people
who are already there?

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:51.490
Where they can't necessarily
think about a community garden

00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:53.844
when they're just trying
to, like, you know,

00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:55.510
get their kids some
food in the morning,

00:51:55.510 --> 00:52:01.166
or when they're just trying
to get their kid's reading up.

00:52:01.166 --> 00:52:02.540
And they would
love those things,

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:04.240
but that's not going
to be the priority.

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.742
And then they fear those
things, because as someone

00:52:06.742 --> 00:52:08.200
who's living in
Bed-Stuy and, like,

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.530
watching this dizzying
gentrification that's

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:16.150
happening, watching my
neighbors, whom I love,

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:19.120
who will knock on my window
and tell me to move my car,

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.550
because I forgot to move
it, being pushed out

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:24.400
of their homes, and then being
told that this is a good thing,

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.950
because now the neighborhood's
becoming less poor, well, yes.

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:28.330
But we see these signals, right?

00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:30.496
Yo see the bike lanes going
in, and you're like, OK.

00:52:30.496 --> 00:52:32.829
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:34.870
Black folks have always
ridden bikes in Bed-Stuy,

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:36.119
but we didn't have bike lanes.

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:37.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:40.300
You see the dog run
going at our park.

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:42.970
Once again, always had
dogs in the community,

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:45.220
but no one thought we
deserved a dog run.

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:47.710
So it's complicated,
because we want the dog run,

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:49.270
and bike lanes are nice.

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:51.610
But you also
understand that there's

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:53.110
something inherently
wrong that that

00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:55.990
doesn't happen until white
people move in, right?

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:57.340
And that, I think--

00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.160
I mean, even the way you
described Williamsburg.

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.110
That progressive, new
part of Williamsburg

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:04.226
is actually a very small
part of Williamsburg.

00:53:04.226 --> 00:53:06.350
Most of Williamsburg-- I've
looked at the numbers--

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:07.410
has not flipped.

00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:10.660
Still heavily black and Latino,
as are most of the schools.

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:14.070
But if you read my
paper, Williamsburg

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:16.720
doesn't look like the
Williamsburg on the ground.

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.917
And I think that's
also the problem.

00:53:18.917 --> 00:53:20.000
It's not going to be easy.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.090
It's going to take a
great deal of humility

00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:26.610
on people who are used to
getting their way, who are used

00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:29.470
to leading, who are used
to having a system cater

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:32.290
to them to say, I'm going
to go in this school,

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:34.300
and I'm just going to
sit back for a while,

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.461
and I'm just going to let
my kid be in the school,

00:53:36.461 --> 00:53:37.960
and I'm going to
let the parents who

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:41.329
have run the school come to me
when they're ready for help.

00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:42.620
That's what it's going to take.

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:43.870
And that's a hard thing to do.

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:47.320
And believe me, as someone
who likes to run everything,

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.330
I'm a different
socioeconomic status

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:51.490
from most of the
parents at my school,

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:53.020
and I wrote about
it in the piece,

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:55.300
that even that has been
hard, and our backgrounds

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.170
are the same.

00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:59.830
So it's not going to be easy,
but it is what we, I think,

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:00.972
are charged with doing.

00:54:00.972 --> 00:54:02.680
That was like-- how
long was that answer?

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.175
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:03.175 --> 00:54:03.670
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE:
It doesn't matter.

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:04.660
It was amazing.

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:05.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:06.970
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:07.640
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES:
I'll be short.

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:07.880
We can get to--

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:08.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:10.190
AUDIENCE: I'll keep
my question short too.

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:14.110
So what advice would
you give to a parent who

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:17.770
is concerned about that
their children are going

00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:21.990
to be challenged when the
segregation gets over,

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:24.250
and the integration comes in?

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:26.290
And now the school
that used to be,

00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:31.180
say, higher socioeconomic
status, all of them,

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:35.230
90% of them would
be-- it is now 50-50.

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:40.010
High socioeconomic status,
and on the poor end too.

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.640
And the one thing
that I have seen,

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:45.620
even in my relatives' town--

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:49.170
in San Diego, their kid was
about to move to middle school,

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:52.040
and the middle school
had a bigger zone.

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.580
So that was-- and
they were worried, oh,

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:58.180
there's another neighborhood
next to us that is not--

00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.750
that their kids aren't
that's studious.

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:03.340
So I said, what's
the problem then?

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:06.370
Oh, then the whole
classroom changes.

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:10.087
Because right now, all of
them are more studious,

00:55:10.087 --> 00:55:11.920
and then in the middle
school, the classroom

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.260
is, like, a mix of
from this neighborhood

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:15.195
and that neighborhood.

00:55:15.195 --> 00:55:16.389
So then I said, so?

00:55:16.389 --> 00:55:17.180
What's the problem?

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.730
Oh, they are not
studious enough.

00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:21.145
They don't, like, value
education that much.

00:55:21.145 --> 00:55:24.850
So I said, but is that
due to that neighborhood?

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:28.284
Or is that just that
you expect that that has

00:55:28.284 --> 00:55:29.450
been happening historically?

00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:31.390
So what advice would
you give that, hey, it's

00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:35.010
actually better for your
children to be in such a school

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:36.985
where it's more of a balance?

00:55:36.985 --> 00:55:40.360
And you can go and
change them rather than

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.750
be worried about
getting changed,

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:42.959
or whatever you think is bad?

00:55:42.959 --> 00:55:45.333
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: I mean,
I think you know the answer.

00:55:45.333 --> 00:55:46.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.950
I mean, it's a real concern.

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:50.980
I don't want to
downplay the concern.

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:53.560
We all want our children
to get a quality education.

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:58.480
We don't want our children to
be harmed by our decisions.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:02.500
What the data shows
is that white kids--

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:05.260
and I don't know what
race your friends are--

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.206
but Asian American kids,
unless they're coming--

00:56:08.206 --> 00:56:11.890
Asian American kids, if
they're coming as refugees,

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:13.540
their test scores
and their experience

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:16.081
actually very much mirrors that
of black and Latino students.

00:56:16.081 --> 00:56:18.430
But the majority of Asians
in this country are coming--

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:23.500
their parents are coming on an
education visa or a work visa,

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:26.380
or they're already second
or third generation.

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.240
The data shows that
their test scores--

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:32.200
if test scores are the
measure, don't go down.

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.750
And that actually,
integration is

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:39.890
great for our ability to think
things, to problem solve.

00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:43.210
Because as you know, if you're
working with a group of people

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:45.280
where everyone thinks
the same, then you're

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.405
all thinking the same way
of how to solve problems.

00:56:47.405 --> 00:56:50.830
And it's actually that
diversity that makes us smarter.

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:53.020
I think fear is a hard
thing to overcome.

00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:55.390
But I think parents
need to understand,

00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:58.330
one, a lot of how well
your kids are going to do,

00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:00.730
if you're privileged,
is in the home.

00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:02.817
For lower income people,
they're much more

00:57:02.817 --> 00:57:04.900
dependent on what's going
to happen in the schools

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:05.890
than in the home.

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:08.020
And your kids are
going to be fine.

00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:11.010
I don't want my child
in a bubble, right?

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:12.640
Like, I don't live
in a neighborhood.

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:16.240
I could afford to live
in a neighborhood that's

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.530
not low-income.

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:20.290
But this is the real
world, and my child's

00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:22.510
not better than her
low-income neighbors.

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:24.540
And they have a lot to offer.

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:28.570
And I was a kid who was
bussed to white schools.

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:32.440
And sometimes my parents
made so little money

00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:34.450
that we were on free
or reduced lunch.

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:37.950
I was not dumber than those
kids because I was poor.

00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:40.870
And when people
say that families

00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:43.480
don't value an
education, I have never

00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:45.490
met a family who did
not want their kids

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:46.930
to get a good education.

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:48.920
They may not speak
the same language.

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:52.720
They may not talk about it
in these, like, high terms

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:54.160
that we talk about it in.

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.680
But I've never met a
family who didn't want it,

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.004
and I've never met a kid
who didn't want an education

00:57:59.004 --> 00:58:00.670
until they'd been in
schools long enough

00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:03.250
that show them that we don't
care about their education.

00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:08.684
So I think-- what I would
say is, you have to--

00:58:08.684 --> 00:58:10.600
if you don't believe in
the common good, fine.

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:11.984
Right?

00:58:11.984 --> 00:58:13.150
I'm saying, let's be honest.

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:14.370
You either do or you don't.

00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:17.170
But if you do, then it's OK to
go into those kids at schools.

00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:20.170
And if you have a good
teacher, teachers who are good

00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:21.910
know how to differentiate
instruction.

00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:23.140
That's how my
daughter's school is.

00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.500
There's some kids who
are more advanced--

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.670
and I remember this
when I was a kid.

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:27.440
We had, like, lions,
tigers, and bears,

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.110
and there were three groups.

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:34.180
And they were grouped based
on how advanced they were,

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.450
and then the teacher would
spend time with each group

00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:38.450
during the day, providing
different instruction.

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:40.575
And then most of the day,
we'd spend time together.

00:58:40.575 --> 00:58:42.790
Those are the things
that you're looking for.

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:44.980
But I don't think I
can ever, you know,

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.200
calm the fears of a
parent who's like, I

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.210
know if I put my
kid in this school

00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:51.160
where every kid is
high achieving--

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.550
and that seems very attractive.

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:56.770
But I think that test
scores are actually

00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:58.720
a pretty terrible
measure, and I think

00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.930
we need to stop
believing that kids

00:59:00.930 --> 00:59:02.560
who are struggling
a little bit are not

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.100
as valuable and as capable.

00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.850
Ooh, that was, like,
a five-minute answer.

00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:09.391
No, you're-- actually, you had
a long preamble, so that was--

00:59:09.391 --> 00:59:10.472
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:10.472 --> 00:59:12.430
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE: Long
question, long answer.

00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:12.930
OK.

00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:13.910
How about last one?

00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:15.565
This is where-- we're overtime.

00:59:15.565 --> 00:59:16.720
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
what your thoughts are

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:17.950
about magnet schools.

00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:21.880
I went to a magnet program in
a school in the suburbs of DC

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:23.860
that was very diverse.

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:28.010
To use your phrase, a UN
model nation kind of a thing.

00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:30.070
Admittedly, the classes
within the magnet program

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:32.370
weren't nearly as diverse, but
the school itself as a whole

00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:32.660
was.

00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:34.410
So what do you think
about magnet programs

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:35.630
as a potential solution?

00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:37.820
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: So
magnets are complicated.

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:40.270
So what magnet
schools are, they're

00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:43.010
traditional public schools,
but magnet programs

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:45.220
started as a
desegregation program.

00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:47.860
And typically, magnet
schools were placed, like,

00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:49.960
within segregated
black communities.

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:53.080
And then they would put
a really fabulous program

00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:55.480
in the schools, hoping
that they would then draw

00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:57.770
in white parents voluntarily.

00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:02.470
So my problem with it
is the whole premise

01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:04.270
is that if you
want white parents,

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:06.250
you'd better create
something really good.

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:08.620
And otherwise, you
know, they won't come.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.120
But what is that
saying about, like,

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.578
the kids who are
in that community,

01:00:11.578 --> 01:00:13.880
and what they deserve?

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:17.770
So I think, like,
fundamentally, I

01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:20.020
have a problem with the
way that we privilege

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:23.560
white parents and the
message that it sends,

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.860
but I also feel like,
this is really hard.

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:29.440
And if you're trying
with a magnet school,

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:34.680
I'm not going to put a
community down for doing that.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.670
But it's just not
a systemic answer.

01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:41.290
And a great example is
Hartford, Connecticut,

01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:46.360
which, because of a state
court order, had to integrate,

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:50.670
and it created this
system of magnets

01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:52.900
to draw white kids
in from the suburbs.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.700
And the magnets are amazing.

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:57.090
Like, there's one that has
a planetarium in there.

01:00:57.090 --> 01:01:00.550
Like, they spent millions
of dollars on these magnets

01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:03.880
to draw white kids in who had
a perfectly good education

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.770
in their own backyards,
and were only coming

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:08.020
because what they were able
to get through this magnet

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:11.340
program in the city was better
than what they could get.

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.870
But they were getting
good education anyway.

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:18.220
And so half of the black kids in
Hartford can go to the magnet,

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.860
and the other half of the
black kids get nothing.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.034
They don't get integration.

01:01:22.034 --> 01:01:23.200
They can't go to the magnet.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.880
Their schools are terrible.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.980
But in the name of
integration, this is the system

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:28.030
that we've created.

01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:30.040
And they actually
denied black students.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:34.570
They hold seats empty to keep
a particular racial balance.

01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:36.994
So there's actually, in some
of the schools, empty seats,

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:38.410
and the black kids
in the district

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:41.300
can't go for racial balance.

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.557
And that feels wrong to me.

01:01:42.557 --> 01:01:44.890
But I'm also like, they're
at least trying to integrate.

01:01:44.890 --> 01:01:48.270
And that's why I say,
like, there's just--

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:51.106
this is being recorded,
so I shouldn't say this.

01:01:51.106 --> 01:01:53.240
And any time someone says
I shouldn't say this,

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.670
and then they say
it's a bad idea.

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:57.370
But the system is--

01:01:57.370 --> 01:02:01.381
the entire system is designed
to produce what it's producing.

01:02:01.381 --> 01:02:03.130
And that's what my
book is going to argue.

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:04.380
Our schools are not broken.

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:08.920
Our schools were designed
to favor white students

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.760
and to provide black
and Latino students.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.759
And I mean, historically,
going all the way back

01:02:12.759 --> 01:02:14.500
to the creation
of public schools,

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:17.770
to deny black and Latino
students an equal education.

01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:20.860
And so everything that we do
is functioning around that,

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:25.604
that certain people have choice
and options, and others don't.

01:02:25.604 --> 01:02:27.520
But I think for you, I
mean, I don't want to--

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.079
I don't know.

01:02:28.079 --> 01:02:29.120
Was it a good experience?

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it
was a great school.

01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:31.434
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Right.

01:02:31.434 --> 01:02:34.540
So I think for so
many white kids,

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:37.421
our intentional integration
provided for them

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:39.670
the opportunity to attend
integrated schools that they

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:41.350
probably wouldn't have before.

01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:42.752
And I've heard from tons--

01:02:42.752 --> 01:02:44.710
I'm going to have a
chapter on this in my book,

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:46.300
because I don't think we
talk enough to white kids who

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.650
went to integrated schools.

01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:50.044
I think we always talk
about how it benefits

01:02:50.044 --> 01:02:51.460
black and brown
kids, and we never

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.260
talk about how it
benefits white kids,

01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.280
and I think we need to
talk more about that.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:00.282
But I think overall, magnets
also replicate inequality,

01:03:00.282 --> 01:03:02.740
and that you're building these
fabulous schools just so you

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:04.270
can get white kids in there.

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:06.850
And then the black kids who are
already in that neighborhood

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:09.917
deserve those kinds
of schools too.

01:03:09.917 --> 01:03:10.750
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:12.042
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Thank you.

01:03:12.042 --> 01:03:13.458
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE:
Nikole, I want

01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:14.720
to thank you so much for this.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.636
I wish I could read your
book, like, tomorrow.

01:03:16.636 --> 01:03:18.240
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: I wish
it was written by tomorrow.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:18.850
SHEETHAL SHOBAWALE: I
can't wait till 2019.

01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:19.840
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:20.380
No pressure.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:20.950
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:23.050
But thank you so
much for being here.

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:24.900
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES: Thank you.
