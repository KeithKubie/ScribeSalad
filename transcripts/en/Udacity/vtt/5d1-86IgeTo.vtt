00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.410
our personality that permanently affect how likely we are to experience

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.703
particular emotions. Some people are hostile, for example, and they experience

00:00:12.703 --> 00:00:16.755
anger and aggression more easily than less hostile people. Other people have

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:20.517
anxious personalities, and they experience fear and anxiety more easily than

00:00:20.517 --> 00:00:22.079
most people.
