00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.770
We're asked to construct
a perpendicular

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.092
bisector of the line segment AB.

00:00:06.092 --> 00:00:07.550
So the fact that
it's perpendicular

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.100
means that this line will
make a 90-degree angle

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.555
where it intersects with AB.

00:00:11.555 --> 00:00:13.120
And it's going to
bisect it, so it's

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.310
going to go halfway in between.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.580
And I have at my disposal
some tools I can put out.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.990
I can draw things
with a compass,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.770
and I can add a straight edge.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.730
So let's try this out.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.260
So let me add a compass.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.780
And so this is a
virtual compass.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.946
So in a real compass, it's
one of those little metal

00:00:27.946 --> 00:00:29.880
things where you can
pivot it on one point,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.900
and you can draw a
circle of any radius.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.620
And so here I'm going to draw--
I'm going to center it at A.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.340
And I'm going to make the radius
equal to the length of AB.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.260
Now I'm going to add another
circle with my compass.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.290
And now, I'm going
to center it at B

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.000
and make the radius equal to AB.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.950
And now, this
gives me two points

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.640
that I can actually use to
draw my perpendicular bisector.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.840
If I connected this
point and this point,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.360
it is going to bisect
AB, and it's also

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.590
going to be perpendicular.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.600
So let's add a
straight edge here,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.310
so this is to draw a line.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.580
So I'm going to draw a
line between that point

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.724
and that point right over there.

00:01:12.724 --> 00:01:14.140
And let me scroll
down, so you can

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.630
look at it a little bit clearer.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.450
So there you go.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.740
That's my construction.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.395
I've made a perpendicular
bisector for segment AB.

00:01:22.395 --> 00:01:23.650
Check my answer.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.670
We got it right.
