00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.401
- So we have something
interesting going on.

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:05.821
I have this ring of conductor
right here, this square ring,

00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:09.733
it has a resistance of two
ohms, we see that it is

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.682
two meters by two meters so the area

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:15.723
of this ring would be four square meters

00:00:15.723 --> 00:00:18.324
and we see a magnetic field going through

00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:21.040
the surface defined by the
ring and it's constant,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.455
it's a constant magnetic
field of five teslas

00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:26.183
and it's going exactly perpendicularly to,

00:00:26.183 --> 00:00:30.362
perpendicularly to the
surface of the ring.

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.962
Now what we're going to happen, what we're

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:35.761
going to see happen is
over the next four seconds,

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:38.744
and this is going to
happen at a linear rate,

00:00:38.744 --> 00:00:40.659
it's going to happen at a constant rate,

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:43.120
we're going to see the magnetic
field over four seconds

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.226
go from five teslas to 10
teslas so it's going to

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:48.704
double over those four
seconds and by doing so

00:00:48.704 --> 00:00:50.573
we're going to have a change in flux.

00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:51.955
Let's think about what the change

00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:54.660
in flux is over this four seconds.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.875
So our initial flux, let
me write it over here,

00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:01.915
so flux, let me use a different color

00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:03.703
and at any time if you are so inspired

00:01:03.703 --> 00:01:04.956
I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:07.679
and figure out what our change in flux is.

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:11.785
So our flux, flux initial

00:01:11.785 --> 00:01:14.725
is going to be, well it's the

00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:16.937
it's going to be the
constant magnetic field,

00:01:16.937 --> 00:01:18.493
you could say the average magnetic field

00:01:18.493 --> 00:01:19.898
over the surface but since it's constant

00:01:19.898 --> 00:01:23.980
that's just going to be
five teslas, so five teslas

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.818
and it helps for, it
helps us in this problem

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:28.046
that the magnetic field
vectors are exactly

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:30.555
perpendicular to the
surface, to the surface

00:01:30.555 --> 00:01:32.436
defined by the ring, if
they weren't we would

00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:35.013
have to find the component
that is perpendicular

00:01:35.013 --> 00:01:36.499
but we have that right
over there so we have

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:38.739
the five teslas, that's
the average magnetic field

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:41.558
or the average component
of the magnetic field

00:01:41.558 --> 00:01:43.990
that is perpendicular to the surface,

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.680
so five teslas times
the area of the surface.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.969
So times, well two meters
times two meters is four

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.509
square meters so that
is going to be equal to,

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.470
that is equal to 20

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.180
tesla meter squared,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.051
tesla meter squared, fair enough.

00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:08.858
Now what's the final,
what's the final flux?

00:02:08.858 --> 00:02:13.641
The final flux, flux final
is going to be equal to,

00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:16.695
well now the average magnetic field or

00:02:16.695 --> 00:02:18.332
the average components
of the magnetic field

00:02:18.332 --> 00:02:19.460
that are perpendicular in the way

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.486
I've defined this magnetic field,

00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:22.388
the vectors are already perpendicular

00:02:22.388 --> 00:02:26.078
is 10 teslas, so 10 teslas.

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:29.048
The area of our ring hasn't changed,

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:31.741
it's still four square meters,

00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:34.552
so times four square meters,

00:02:34.552 --> 00:02:36.653
and so what is this going to be?

00:02:36.653 --> 00:02:40.870
So our final flux is going to be

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.422
final flux is going to be 40,

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:48.590
40 tesla meters squared.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.003
So what is our, what
is our change in flux?

00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:56.471
Let me write this over here,
our change in flux, change in

00:02:56.471 --> 00:03:00.381
flux, which is going to be our final flux

00:03:01.161 --> 00:03:05.667
minus our initial flux is going to be

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:09.149
40 tesla meters squared minus
20 tesla meters squared,

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:13.863
which is just going to be
20 tesla meters squared.

00:03:14.223 --> 00:03:16.846
So we figured out the change
in flux, we actually know

00:03:16.846 --> 00:03:19.319
the change in time is
going to be four seconds

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.001
and actually using that
we can now figure out

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.857
what the voltage induced is going to be,

00:03:24.857 --> 00:03:27.306
the voltage induced, or
the voltage that's going

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:29.814
to now induce, induce a current.

00:03:29.814 --> 00:03:32.809
And if you were to look up
Faraday's law on the internet,

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:34.991
you were to look up for a
formula for Faraday's law

00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:36.693
you would see something
that looks like this,

00:03:36.693 --> 00:03:39.963
you would see voltage
generated is equal to

00:03:39.963 --> 00:03:42.797
negative and, at least
if you're not using the

00:03:42.797 --> 00:03:47.797
calculus version of it, negative
N times our change in flux,

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.897
change in, let me write
change in flux not just flux,

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:54.889
change in flux, delta flux

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.599
over change in time.

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.112
So one way to think about
this, and to do this problem

00:04:00.112 --> 00:04:02.357
right we're assuming we have a constant

00:04:02.357 --> 00:04:05.267
or the rate of change
is constant in our flux

00:04:05.267 --> 00:04:09.040
so you have your average
rate of change of your flux

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.617
and then you're going
to multiply it times N.

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:14.086
N is actually the number of
loops you have, or you can

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:16.562
think of it as the number
of surfaces defined by it.

00:04:16.562 --> 00:04:19.197
In this exact example,
in this exact example

00:04:19.197 --> 00:04:21.380
N is just going to be
one, we just have one loop

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.563
so that simplifies it right over there

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:25.803
and then, so this is going
to be, and you might say

00:04:25.803 --> 00:04:27.359
what is this negative
because it's a bit of

00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:29.210
a strange thing because
you know, how are we

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.935
defining direction, you
know what's in the--

00:04:30.935 --> 00:04:33.530
and all of that and that's
why I'm a little bit,

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.625
I'm not a huge fan of this negative sign.

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:38.063
This is, you know if you
look it up in a textbook

00:04:38.063 --> 00:04:39.920
they'll often say, and
you're not using calculus,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.579
they'll say, oh this
reminder to use Lenz's law,

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:45.424
they'll write literally Lenz's law

00:04:45.424 --> 00:04:47.013
and I would say if they
want a reminder to use

00:04:47.013 --> 00:04:48.337
Lenz's law why don't they just remind you

00:04:48.337 --> 00:04:50.159
to use Lenz's law instead of putting

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:51.982
a kind of bizarre negative sign there.

00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:53.619
And the negative sign
actually does make sense

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:56.574
if you were, if you were doing kind of the

00:04:56.574 --> 00:04:58.947
using the vectors here and taking the,

00:04:58.947 --> 00:05:00.607
and using a little bit of the,

00:05:00.607 --> 00:05:03.405
well, doing more sophisticated mathematics

00:05:03.405 --> 00:05:05.831
but this is just saying
that the voltage induced

00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:08.002
is going to be in a direction so to

00:05:08.002 --> 00:05:11.004
induce a current whose, whose induced

00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:13.275
magnetic field will go in the direction,

00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:15.746
will counteract the change in flux,

00:05:15.746 --> 00:05:17.510
so that's just Lenz's law there.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.903
So the real key here, at
least for this example

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:22.142
is to find our change in
flux over change in time

00:05:22.142 --> 00:05:25.068
or our average, our average
rate of change in flux

00:05:25.068 --> 00:05:26.600
and what is this going to be?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.769
Well this is going to be
20 tesla meters squared,

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:34.312
20 tesla meters squared,
that was our change in flux

00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:37.362
right over there divided
by our change in time,

00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:41.008
which is four seconds, over four seconds,

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:42.829
which is going to be equal to, and I'll,

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:45.295
I could throw that negative
there if we want to,

00:05:45.295 --> 00:05:49.475
that negative 20 divided by four is five,

00:05:50.445 --> 00:05:55.228
five tesla meters squared or square meters

00:05:55.228 --> 00:05:59.904
per second and this actually
turns out to be a volt,

00:05:59.904 --> 00:06:02.576
so we could say this
is negative five volts,

00:06:02.576 --> 00:06:05.991
negative, negative five volts,

00:06:07.511 --> 00:06:09.462
negative five volts.

00:06:09.462 --> 00:06:13.223
So if you have a voltage of,
well let's just say five volts,

00:06:13.223 --> 00:06:15.266
we can think about the negative later,

00:06:15.266 --> 00:06:18.545
if you have a voltage
of five volts across a,

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:22.162
across a circuit that has
a resistance of two ohms

00:06:22.162 --> 00:06:25.529
what is the current, what
is the current going to be?

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:27.665
Well we just have to remind ourselves

00:06:27.665 --> 00:06:30.288
V is equal to I-R

00:06:30.288 --> 00:06:32.842
or voltage is equal to
the current divided by

00:06:32.842 --> 00:06:34.584
the resistance, or voltage is equal to

00:06:34.584 --> 00:06:37.444
the current times the
resistance or you could say

00:06:37.444 --> 00:06:41.151
that the current, the current is equal to

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.461
the voltage divided by the resistance.

00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:46.351
So in this case the
current, the current induced

00:06:46.351 --> 00:06:47.570
is going to be the voltage
and I'm just going to

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.172
focus on its absolute value now, we can

00:06:49.172 --> 00:06:51.053
think about its direction in a second.

00:06:51.053 --> 00:06:53.132
It's going to be its voltage, five volts

00:06:53.132 --> 00:06:57.032
divided by the resistance, so two ohms,

00:06:57.032 --> 00:07:01.757
two ohms, which is going to be equal to,

00:07:01.757 --> 00:07:06.418
this is going to be equal to 2.5, 2.5

00:07:06.418 --> 00:07:10.974
amperes, 2.5 amperes.

00:07:11.914 --> 00:07:13.865
So we now know the
magnitude of the current

00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:15.316
that's going to be induced while we

00:07:15.316 --> 00:07:16.744
have this change in flux, remember this

00:07:16.744 --> 00:07:18.961
is going to happen while, over the course

00:07:18.961 --> 00:07:21.724
of those four seconds, as
we have this rate of change

00:07:21.724 --> 00:07:24.139
of flux, this average
rate of change of flux,

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:26.716
which we'll assume is the
actual rate of change of flux,

00:07:26.716 --> 00:07:30.257
we're assuming that it's
changing at a constant rate

00:07:30.257 --> 00:07:32.777
and so while it is changing we
were just able to figure out

00:07:32.777 --> 00:07:36.398
that it would induce a
current of 2.5 amperes.

00:07:36.398 --> 00:07:37.954
Now the next question
we should ask ourselves

00:07:37.954 --> 00:07:40.020
and this is where this
little negative comes in,

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.015
is a reminder for us to
use Lenz's law is, well

00:07:43.015 --> 00:07:45.256
which direction is that
current going to go in?

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:48.135
Is it going to go in, let
me pick two orientations,

00:07:48.135 --> 00:07:52.279
is it going to go in a,
is it going to go in a,

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:56.853
in a clockwise direction,
is it going to go that way

00:07:56.853 --> 00:07:59.451
over the course of this change in flux

00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:01.450
or is it going to go in a
counterclockwise direction,

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.609
is it going to go that way?

00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:05.316
And to think about that
we just have to use

00:08:05.316 --> 00:08:07.615
the right hand rule, take our right hand,

00:08:07.615 --> 00:08:08.729
point our thumb in the direction

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:12.850
of the proposed direction of the current

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.636
and so if we went with
this one, our right hand,

00:08:15.636 --> 00:08:17.169
our right hand would look like this,

00:08:17.169 --> 00:08:19.758
I'm literally taking
my left hand out and--

00:08:19.758 --> 00:08:22.753
I mean my right hand
out and I'm drawing it

00:08:22.753 --> 00:08:25.411
and I'm looking at it to
think about what would happen,

00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:27.954
so that's my right hand
so if I use the right hand

00:08:27.954 --> 00:08:29.718
if the current went in this
direction then it would

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:33.539
induce a magnetic field that went,

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.022
that went like this and
so if the current went

00:08:36.022 --> 00:08:38.448
in this direction the
magnetic field it induces

00:08:38.448 --> 00:08:42.510
inside the surface would only
reinforce the change in flux

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:45.541
so it would only add to
the flux so, and it's going

00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:47.445
in the same direction
as the change in flux,

00:08:47.445 --> 00:08:49.629
which would just keep us, you know as we

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:51.985
talked about in the Lenz's law video,

00:08:51.985 --> 00:08:54.921
that would turn into just
this source of energy

00:08:54.921 --> 00:08:56.991
that comes out of nowhere and defies

00:08:56.991 --> 00:08:59.391
the law of conservation of energy so this

00:08:59.391 --> 00:09:01.632
absolutely not, is not
going to be the direction

00:09:01.632 --> 00:09:03.129
and so we know that the direction

00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:06.391
is going to be in a clockwise one.

00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:10.049
So the current, the 2.5 ampere current

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:14.936
is going to flow, is
going to flow like that,

00:09:14.936 --> 00:09:15.982
and we're done!

00:09:15.982 --> 00:09:17.768
By thinking about our change in flux

00:09:17.768 --> 00:09:20.811
and how long it's taking us,
we were able to figure out

00:09:20.811 --> 00:09:22.873
not only the magnitude of
the current, we were able

00:09:22.873 --> 00:09:24.826
to figure out the
orientation of the direction

00:09:24.826 --> 00:09:26.817
that it's actually going to flow in.
