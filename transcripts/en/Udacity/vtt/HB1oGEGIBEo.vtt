00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.150
So it seems that the variable audioPlayer is defined within, and

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.730
is local to this function viewDidLoad.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.100
And I'm trying to use it here, in the playSlowAudio function.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.330
To fix this, I can declare it as a global variable at the top here.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.780
And I can remove the initialization from within viewDidLoad.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.750
So the variable AudioPlayer is of type AVAudioPlayer.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.420
It's being declared here, initialized here, and used here.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.600
All right, let's run this project.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.890
I'll go to the second scene and then click on this button.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.590
&gt;&gt; My mama always said, life was like a box of chocolates.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.650
&gt;&gt; All right, we have sound.
