00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.830
Peering between two ISPs involves inter-domain routing, as

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.030
does peering between a university network and its

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.820
ISP. Or any peering at an Internet exchange

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.370
point, for that matter. Routing between multiple data

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.660
centers typically involves routing in a wide area,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.840
and hence may involve inter-domain routing. Routing within

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.160
a single data center concerns routing in a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.580
single domain and hence does not concern inter-domain routing.
