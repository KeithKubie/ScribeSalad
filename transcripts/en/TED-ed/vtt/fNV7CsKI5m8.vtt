00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:12.812
Which is the hardest word
to translate in this sentence?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.390
"Know" is easy to translate.

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:19.975
"Pep rally" doesn't have a direct analog
in a lot of languages and cultures,

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:21.794
but can be approximated.

00:00:21.818 --> 00:00:26.326
But the hardest word there
is actually one of the smallest: "you."

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:27.944
As simple as it seems,

00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:31.268
it's often impossible
to accurately translate "you"

00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:35.293
without knowing a lot more about
the situation where it's being said.

00:00:35.982 --> 00:00:40.386
To start with, how familiar are you
with the person you're talking to?

00:00:40.723 --> 00:00:44.108
Many cultures have different levels
of formality.

00:00:44.132 --> 00:00:45.308
A close friend,

00:00:45.332 --> 00:00:47.267
someone much older or much younger,

00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:48.441
a stranger,

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:49.621
a boss.

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:52.161
These all may be slightly
different "you's."

00:00:53.097 --> 00:00:56.248
In many languages, the pronoun
reflects these differences

00:00:56.272 --> 00:00:59.486
through what's known
as the T–V distinction.

00:01:00.062 --> 00:01:01.427
In French, for example,

00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:04.855
you would say "tu" when talking
to your friend at school,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.935
but "vous" when addressing your teacher.

00:01:07.453 --> 00:01:09.922
Even English once had something similar.

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:12.366
Remember the old-timey "thou?"

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.367
Ironically, it was actually
the informal pronoun

00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:16.819
for people you're close with,

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:19.945
while "you" was the formal
and polite version.

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:21.611
That distinction was lost

00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:24.396
when the English decided
to just be polite all the time.

00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:28.449
But the difficulty in translating
"you" doesn't end there.

00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:31.007
In languages like Hausa or Korana,

00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:33.676
the "you" form depends on
the listener's gender.

00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:37.778
In many more, it depends on
whether they are one or many,

00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:40.469
such as with German "Du" or "ihr."

00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:42.220
Even in English,

00:01:42.244 --> 00:01:46.250
some dialects use words
like "y'all" or "youse" the same way.

00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:49.560
Some plural forms, like the French "vous"

00:01:49.584 --> 00:01:50.900
and Russian "Вы"

00:01:50.924 --> 00:01:53.110
are also used for a single person

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:56.557
to show that the addressee
is that much more important,

00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:57.913
much like the royal "we."

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.344
And a few languages
even have a specific form

00:02:01.368 --> 00:02:04.057
for addressing exactly two people,

00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:05.743
like Slovenian "vidva."

00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:08.139
If that wasn't complicated enough,

00:02:08.163 --> 00:02:13.163
formality, number, and gender
can all come into play at the same time.

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:17.341
In Spanish, "tú" is unisex
informal singular,

00:02:17.365 --> 00:02:20.210
"usted" is unisex formal singular,

00:02:20.234 --> 00:02:23.270
"vosotros" is masculine informal plural,

00:02:23.294 --> 00:02:26.526
"vosotras" is feminine informal plural,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.042
and "ustedes" is the unisex formal plural.

00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:31.738
Phew!

00:02:31.762 --> 00:02:32.913
After all that,

00:02:32.937 --> 00:02:34.190
it may come as a relief

00:02:34.214 --> 00:02:37.238
that some languages often leave out
the second person pronoun.

00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:40.386
In languages like Romanian and Portuguese,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.616
the pronoun can be dropped from sentences

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.036
because it's clearly implied
by the way the verbs are conjugated.

00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:50.040
And in languages like Korean,
Thai, and Chinese,

00:02:50.064 --> 00:02:53.189
pronouns can be dropped
without any grammatical hints.

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.378
Speakers often would rather have

00:02:55.402 --> 00:02:58.124
the listener guess
the pronoun from context

00:02:58.148 --> 00:03:01.846
than use the wrong one
and risk being seen as rude.

00:03:02.457 --> 00:03:04.522
So if you're ever working as a translator

00:03:04.546 --> 00:03:07.617
and come across this sentence
without any context:

00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:09.167
"You and you, no, not you,

00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.706
you, your job is to translate
'you' for yourselves" ...

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.134
Well, good luck.

00:03:14.698 --> 00:03:17.822
And to the volunteer community
who will be translating this video

00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:19.205
into multiple languages:

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:21.649
Sorry about that!
