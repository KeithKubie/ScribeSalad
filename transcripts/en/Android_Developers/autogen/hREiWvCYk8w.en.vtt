00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:06.800
 
so now that we've created our

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810
so now that we've created our
 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.480
so now that we've created our
achievements let's look at how we can

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490
achievements let's look at how we can
 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.280
achievements let's look at how we can
start unlocking these things within the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290
start unlocking these things within the
 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.009
start unlocking these things within the
game now I'm going to go back into my

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019
game now I'm going to go back into my
 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.740
game now I'm going to go back into my
game and maybe the best way for me to do

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750
game and maybe the best way for me to do
 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.349
game and maybe the best way for me to do
this is put all the achievement

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359
this is put all the achievement
 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.200
this is put all the achievement
unlocking logic into a second class so

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210
unlocking logic into a second class so
 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.029
unlocking logic into a second class so
I'm going to create a new objective c

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039
I'm going to create a new objective c
 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.210
I'm going to create a new objective c
class we're going to call it achieve it

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220
class we're going to call it achieve it
 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.170
class we're going to call it achieve it
manager this looks like a good place to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
manager this looks like a good place to
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.069
manager this looks like a good place to
put it and we're all done now I'm going

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079
put it and we're all done now I'm going
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.560
put it and we're all done now I'm going
to start off by declaring just one

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
to start off by declaring just one
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.850
to start off by declaring just one
public method here and we'll be unlock

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860
public method here and we'll be unlock
 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.389
public method here and we'll be unlock
achievement with ID and it will take an

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399
achievement with ID and it will take an
 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.939
achievement with ID and it will take an
NS string that is our achievement ID and

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949
NS string that is our achievement ID and
 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.650
NS string that is our achievement ID and
to implement this it's actually pretty

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660
to implement this it's actually pretty
 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.389
to implement this it's actually pretty
straightforward let's jump into our

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399
straightforward let's jump into our
 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.150
straightforward let's jump into our
achievement manager m-file here once

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160
achievement manager m-file here once
 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.889
achievement manager m-file here once
again warning us that this method is not

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899
again warning us that this method is not
 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.440
again warning us that this method is not
found and still looking for that hotkey

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
found and still looking for that hotkey
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.060
found and still looking for that hotkey
where you can create a stub method to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070
where you can create a stub method to
 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.620
where you can create a stub method to
implement this someone help me out

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
implement this someone help me out
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.140
implement this someone help me out
someone tell me in the comments but in

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150
someone tell me in the comments but in
 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.289
someone tell me in the comments but in
the meantime we've got some very easy

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
the meantime we've got some very easy
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.690
the meantime we've got some very easy
tab completion and we're going to assume

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
tab completion and we're going to assume
 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.980
tab completion and we're going to assume
that in this method we're going to be

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
that in this method we're going to be
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.499
that in this method we're going to be
passed in that achievement ID that

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
passed in that achievement ID that
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.510
passed in that achievement ID that
string that the developer console gave

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
string that the developer console gave
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.510
string that the developer console gave
us to uniquely identify our achievement

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
us to uniquely identify our achievement
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.609
us to uniquely identify our achievement
within the system so the first thing

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
within the system so the first thing
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.960
within the system so the first thing
we're going to want to do is take this

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970
we're going to want to do is take this
 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.480
we're going to want to do is take this
achievement ID string and get an actual

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
achievement ID string and get an actual
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.090
achievement ID string and get an actual
achievement object out of it and so this

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
achievement object out of it and so this
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.490
achievement object out of it and so this
achievement is represented as a GP g

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500
achievement is represented as a GP g
 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.770
achievement is represented as a GP g
achievement object and we'll call it

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
achievement object and we'll call it
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.999
achievement object and we'll call it
unlock me and we can recreate it by

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009
unlock me and we can recreate it by
 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.870
unlock me and we can recreate it by
using the gpg achievement helper method

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880
using the gpg achievement helper method
 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.420
using the gpg achievement helper method
achievement with ID and we'll pass in

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
achievement with ID and we'll pass in
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.060
achievement with ID and we'll pass in
our achievement ID and at that point

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070
our achievement ID and at that point
 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.969
our achievement ID and at that point
this unlock the object which is an

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
this unlock the object which is an
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.620
this unlock the object which is an
achievement object associated with

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
achievement object associated with
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.609
achievement object associated with
particular ID we can now call its method

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619
particular ID we can now call its method
 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.569
particular ID we can now call its method
unlock achievement with completion

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
unlock achievement with completion
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.530
unlock achievement with completion
handler within our completion handler we

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540
handler within our completion handler we
 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.779
handler within our completion handler we
get back two parameters the first is a

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789
get back two parameters the first is a
 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.400
get back two parameters the first is a
boolean saying whether this achievement

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410
boolean saying whether this achievement
 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.460
boolean saying whether this achievement
has been unlocked before and the second

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
has been unlocked before and the second
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.510
has been unlocked before and the second
is an error object so you know we can

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520
is an error object so you know we can
 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.250
is an error object so you know we can
just add in some tests for those if

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260
just add in some tests for those if
 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.560
just add in some tests for those if
error NS log oh no got an error and you

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570
error NS log oh no got an error and you
 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.390
error NS log oh no got an error and you
know we can see the error localized

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400
know we can see the error localized
 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.260
know we can see the error localized
description something like that

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270
description something like that
 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.470
description something like that
otherwise if newly unlocked again we

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480
otherwise if newly unlocked again we
 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.030
otherwise if newly unlocked again we
could probably unlock something that

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040
could probably unlock something that
 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.110
could probably unlock something that
says hooray achievement unlocked and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120
says hooray achievement unlocked and
 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.380
says hooray achievement unlocked and
otherwise we can just log something that

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390
otherwise we can just log something that
 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.230
otherwise we can just log something that
says looks like you've earned this one

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240
says looks like you've earned this one
 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:07.730
says looks like you've earned this one

information both the fact that the
 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.150
information both the fact that the
achievement has been unlocked will be

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160
achievement has been unlocked will be
 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.150
achievement has been unlocked will be
recorded on the server and that little

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160
recorded on the server and that little
 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.800

congratulations achievement unlocked

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100
congratulations achievement unlocked
 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.640
congratulations achievement unlocked
here's the icon and description that's

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650
here's the icon and description that's
 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.410
here's the icon and description that's
handled for you automatically by the

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420
handled for you automatically by the
 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.229
handled for you automatically by the
games library so there's not actually

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239
games library so there's not actually
 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.300
games library so there's not actually
anything I need to do here I'm just

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310
anything I need to do here I'm just
 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.310
anything I need to do here I'm just
demonstrating that you know we do get

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320
demonstrating that you know we do get
 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.870
demonstrating that you know we do get
some interesting information back to us

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880
some interesting information back to us
 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.100
some interesting information back to us
by the system so now let's call this and

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110
by the system so now let's call this and
 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.630
by the system so now let's call this and
so I'm going to go into our game model

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640
so I'm going to go into our game model
 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.770
so I'm going to go into our game model
and I guess the first thing we need to

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780
and I guess the first thing we need to
 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.310
and I guess the first thing we need to
do is let's import this gmn achievement

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320
do is let's import this gmn achievement
 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.259
do is let's import this gmn achievement
manager and we're going to make a

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269
manager and we're going to make a
 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:06.140
manager and we're going to make a
property non-atomic strong achievement

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150
property non-atomic strong achievement
 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:13.130
property non-atomic strong achievement
manager and I suppose we can we can

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140
manager and I suppose we can we can
 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.300
manager and I suppose we can we can
perform some lazy instantiation here so

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310
perform some lazy instantiation here so
 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.620
perform some lazy instantiation here so
let's do our we can say if

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630
let's do our we can say if
 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:31.460
let's do our we can say if
not two managers nil then achievement

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470
not two managers nil then achievement
 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:40.550
not two managers nil then achievement
manager equals alloc init and then we

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560
manager equals alloc init and then we
 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.680
manager equals alloc init and then we
can return she would measure there we go

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690
can return she would measure there we go
 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.230
can return she would measure there we go
some nice lazy instantiation and now

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240
some nice lazy instantiation and now
 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.430
some nice lazy instantiation and now
that we have our achievement manager

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440
that we have our achievement manager
 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.040
that we have our achievement manager
what we can do is in our player guest

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050
what we can do is in our player guest
 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.610
what we can do is in our player guest
area if it turns out that you know the

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620
area if it turns out that you know the
 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.800
area if it turns out that you know the
player guess correctly let's unlock the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810
player guess correctly let's unlock the
 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.530
player guess correctly let's unlock the
first time or achievement so achievement

we're going to have to go back to our

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300
we're going to have to go back to our
 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.840
we're going to have to go back to our
developer console here and we're going

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850
developer console here and we're going
 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.060
developer console here and we're going
to have to copy and paste this first

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070
to have to copy and paste this first
 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.150
to have to copy and paste this first
timer code now this is admittedly

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160
timer code now this is admittedly
 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.580

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590
terrible style hard coding this string
 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.520
terrible style hard coding this string
right in the middle of all of our code

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530
right in the middle of all of our code
 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.740
right in the middle of all of our code
and we'll fix this up in a little bit

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750
and we'll fix this up in a little bit
 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.420
and we'll fix this up in a little bit
but for now I just want to get something

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430
but for now I just want to get something

unlock an achievement I suppose if I

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400
unlock an achievement I suppose if I
 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.909
unlock an achievement I suppose if I
wanted I could just embed all that code

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919
wanted I could just embed all that code
 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.400
wanted I could just embed all that code
right here in the game model but I kind

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410
right here in the game model but I kind
 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.510

to access it from a bunch of different
classes but for now we've got this in

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150
classes but for now we've got this in
 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.150
classes but for now we've got this in
let's see it in action and see what

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160
let's see it in action and see what
 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:07.920
let's see it in action and see what
happens I'm going to run this

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930
 
 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.560

achievements it looks like I haven't
 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:19.700
achievements it looks like I haven't
earned any yet let's play an easy game

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710
 
 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:25.409
 
and 50 lower than 75 I've gotten really

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419
and 50 lower than 75 I've gotten really
 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:32.100

in the 53 we think 52 or 51 252 hey and

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090
in the 53 we think 52 or 51 252 hey and
 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.420
in the 53 we think 52 or 51 252 hey and
look at that we got our achievement

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430
look at that we got our achievement
 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.950
look at that we got our achievement
unlocked toast that appears right on

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960
unlocked toast that appears right on
 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.900
unlocked toast that appears right on
screen and then fades out after a little

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910
screen and then fades out after a little
 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.650
screen and then fades out after a little
bit we can go back to our main menu here

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660
bit we can go back to our main menu here
 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.080
bit we can go back to our main menu here
and view our achievements and there it

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090
and view our achievements and there it
 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.719
and view our achievements and there it
is unlocked and it's now moved to the

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:51.729
is unlocked and it's now moved to the
 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:53.879
is unlocked and it's now moved to the
top of my list because the unlock

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:53.889
top of my list because the unlock
 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:55.260
top of my list because the unlock
achievements generally pair at the top

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270
achievements generally pair at the top
 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.200
achievements generally pair at the top
and I've now been informed that i have

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210
and I've now been informed that i have
 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.550
and I've now been informed that i have
unlocked a total of one out of four

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560
unlocked a total of one out of four
 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.710
unlocked a total of one out of four
achievements so there you go that's

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720
achievements so there you go that's
 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.749
achievements so there you go that's
unlocking achievement now that we're

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759
unlocking achievement now that we're
 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:05.339
unlocking achievement now that we're
able to do that maybe the next step is

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:05.349
able to do that maybe the next step is
 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:08.100
able to do that maybe the next step is
to increment an achievement and we can

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110
to increment an achievement and we can
 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.510
to increment an achievement and we can
look at incrementing the send a guess or

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520
look at incrementing the send a guess or
 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.400
look at incrementing the send a guess or
achievement in the next lesson so I'll

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.410
achievement in the next lesson so I'll
 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:20.040
achievement in the next lesson so I'll
see you shortly

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050
 
 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.690
 
hahahaha

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:21.700
hahahaha
