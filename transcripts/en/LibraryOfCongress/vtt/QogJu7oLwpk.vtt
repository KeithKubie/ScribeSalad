00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.540
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Good morning, and
welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.490
My name is John Cole.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.410 position:56%
I'm the director of the Center for
the Book in the Library of Congress,

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.240
which is privileged to be able
to host this program today.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.650
I'm going to say a few words
about both the Library of Congress

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.400 position:56%
as an institution and the Center for
the Book's program in just a couple

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.080
of minutes, but in
order to get us started

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.900
and to get some important
logistical information,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.430
I'm pleased to introduce Lisa Cone.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.210
Lisa is the director
of program expansion

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.790
for the National Campaign
to Stop Violence.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.590
Let's welcome Lisa.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:16.250
[ Applause ]

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.350
&gt;&gt; Lisa Cone: Thank
you, and good morning.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.080
I would like to welcome you on
behalf of the National Campaign

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.430
to Stop Violence and to thank
Mr. John Cole from the Library

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.060
of Congress for hosting this event.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.620
It's always such a
highlight of our program.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.370 position:56%
As he said, my name is Lisa Cone,
and you've all met me at this point,

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.640
a lot, but this morning, as we get
started, I wanted to make mention

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.940
of several people who are here.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.440
I wanted to recognize them.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.510
First of all, Dan Callister,
if you just want to stand up.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.850
[ Applause ]

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.260
All of you have had the chance
yesterday to hear from him

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.130
and meet him, and again,
just wanted to let you know

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.340
that he is the chairman and
founder of the National Campaign

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.680
to Stop Violence and the
visionary behind this program,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.200
so we thank him.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.360
We also have with us today
Dr. Hassan Al-Ebraheem,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.890
who is the chairman and founder.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.270
Dr. Ebraheem.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.070
Dr. Hassan.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.690
[ Applause ]

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.150
He is the chairman and founder
of the Kuwait-America Foundation,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.410
and Dr. Hassan, we'd
especially like recognize you

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.590
for all the work you've done in
education, especially education

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.990
for children both here
and in Kuwait.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.510 position:56%
And completing our distinguished
guests today is Mr. Fawzi Al-Sultan.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.900
[ Applause ]

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.670
Mr. Al-Sultan's business acumen
has led him to hold many positions

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.290
with international cooperation in
agency, and he is a board member

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.500
of the Kuwait-America Foundation
and has been a strong advocate

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.590
of our program, and we thank you
for that, and thank all of you

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.310
for joining us this morning
in spite of the wet weather.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.660
You know, presenting the National
Book of Writing to the Library

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.780
of Congress, as I mentioned, is
always such a great privilege

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.020
and such a great highlight
of our week.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.620
I don't know if many of you
had a chance when you walked

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.530
into the library today
to see anything.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.900
We are going to give
you time afterward,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.970
but I'm sure you can feel the
magnificence of this building

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.580
and gotten a glimpse of just what
an awesome place this is, and now,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.760
your writings are going
to be here in the library,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.800
so I just think that's
the coolest thing ever.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.910
You are going to be doing
something that I have never done.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.980
You are going to be here along with
all the great writers of America,

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.080
and yesterday, when you
received your business cards,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.530
as Judge Woodruff said,
on those business cards,

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.210
it says that you were
a national ambassador.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.420
And you really are
national ambassadors,

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.460 position:56%
because you are representing your
city, you're representing your peers

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.510
and all of the stories that
they have to tell as well.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.900
And now, on that business card,
you can add the title of author,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.760 position:56%
because you are going to have your
writings in the Library of Congress,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.600
and years from now, you can
come back and look for them

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.750
with your children,
with your grandchildren,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.950
with your great-grandchildren,
because they will be here

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.090
for all time, here in the library.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.250
Mr. John Cole, who
started the program,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.550
has really made this a
reality, and so we thank him.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.530 position:56%
John is a librarian and a historian,

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.530
and he has dedicated his career
toward forwarding the role

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.980
of the Library of Congress in
both American society and culture.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.840
His career began at the
library, and he's still here

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.100
and is currently the director
of the Center for the Book.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.200
John's favorite two
projects, he tells me,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.450
are to oversee the National Book
Festival, which happens here

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.620
in Washington in September,
usually in the fall,

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.940
and the Young Readers Center.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.740
John also tells me that he has
two heroes, Thomas Jefferson

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.020
and George Washington,
and Thomas Jefferson

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.160
because he was actually one of the
first people who was instrumental

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.490
in getting the library
started, and George Washington

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.780
because John has quite a history
with the name of Washington.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.730
He was born in Washington state.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.880
He attended the University
of Washington.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.770
Then he moved to Washington, DC.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.190
He attended George
Washington University.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.160
And so I think that qualifies
him to be a Washingtonian.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.510
Anyway, John, we would love
to turn the time over to you.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:34.950
[ Applause ]

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.590
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Thank you, Lisa.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.370
I would just like to say a
couple of words about the Library

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.620
of Congress itself and about
the Center for the Book,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.170
and I will add another favorite to
my list of favorites that I gave

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.570
to Lisa, and that is I'm also
fortunate to be the chair

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.430
of a new Library of
Congress program,

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.570
the Library of Congress Literacy
Awards, and the literacy part

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.120
of that effort is very close to
what the Center for the Book does.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.430
We were created in 1977 by Daniel
Boorstin when he was the Librarian

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.390
of Congress as a public-private
partnership to use the Library

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.410
of Congress, and its prestige,
and its size, and its resources,

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.830
and its wonderful staff to
stimulate public interest

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.480
in reading and in books.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.690
This was before there was a
lot of attention to a subject

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.120
such as literacy, so it's
natural that now as the work

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:38.280
of literacy grows more
and more important

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.280
that we take on this
literacy effort.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.090
Lisa did mention the
Young Readers Center.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.100
That is a part of what we do.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.230
We administer the first
place in the Library

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.000
of Congress dedicated
to serving young people.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.210
It's actually in this building,
and I hope you get a chance

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.670
to at least walk by it
when you tour the building.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:06.270
It's three beautifully redesigned
rooms that are aimed not only at

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.310
but for kids, people 16 and under,
as long as they're accompanied

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.020
by an adult, and we feature
programming and school visits,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.090
and it's an important
part of what we do.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:24.780
We also have chapters or
affiliates in every state,

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.780
and one of my hopes is that
we can combine our partnership

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:34.290
with this program on occasion with
cities or with programs that are

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:40.380
in cities around the program, but
that is really for the future,

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.790
but we're very pleased that we
can have a part in hosting you

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.190
and have a role in making
certain that your writings,

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.370
as Lisa has already mentioned,
are part of this great collection.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.290
I'll conclude with
just a couple of words

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.950
about the Library of
Congress itself.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.930
It really is part of
America's history.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.230
We were the first federal
cultural organization

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.800
to be created in our country.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:11.880
We were created in 1800, before the
capitol even came to Washington.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.670
Congress created us while
they were in Philadelphia,

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.530
but they knew they
were headed for DC,

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.590
and the very first building
we were in was the US capitol.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:26.220
In fact, the Library of
Congress was part of the capitol

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:32.310 position:56%
for our whole first century, from
1800 until the building that you are

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:37.370
in today, named the Thomas
Jefferson Building, was opened.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.710
Congress needed books,
Congress needed information,

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.790
so they needed the Library, but
what's unique about the Library

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.720
of Congress -- a couple of things.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.320
One is it is the largest
library in the world.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.620
It, along with the Smithsonian,
and today, the National Archives,

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.080
really are the three big cultural
institutions that watch over

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.210
and promote American
culture and American history.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.510
We're a little different

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.770
in that we're also the
parliamentary library,

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.240
and there's something
wonderful about that,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.570
because Congress recognized it
needed books and information,

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:20.720 position:56%
but when Thomas Jefferson, one of
my favorite people, as you now know,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.420
realized that the British had
burned the capitol in 1814,

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.720
as part of the War of 1812,

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.680
and it had destroyed the little
tiny Library of Congress,

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.860
he asked Congress to purchase
his great private library,

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.530 position:56%
which covered, many, many
different subjects, and Congress did

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:45.140
so to get us started again in 1815.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.220
But Jefferson had an idea
which has come to fruition.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.150
He said not only would this
be the best place for Congress

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.620
to get information as a
parliamentary library,

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.700
but by the way, this great
collection should be open

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.120
to the American people as well.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.940
We're a democracy.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.260
Everyone needs information,
everyone needs to know what is

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:11.180
in this organization, and it turned
out that after the Civil War,

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.800
the Library of Congress
was able to develop

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.100
into a great public institution
as well, and it's the public side

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.670
of the Library that the
Center for the Book is really,

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.990
in a sense, most concerned about.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.450
It's the outreach.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.850
It's educating people about
the importance of the role

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:35.060
of the Library of Congress and
the role it can play in reaching

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.490
out to people of all ages, you
know, to be part of society

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.100
and to facing some of the
difficulties and wonderful

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:48.690
but difficult situations
we are facing as a culture

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.100
as our civilization grows and
matures and as our country grows.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.080
And it's through literacy,
and through reading promotion,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.890
and through program support of a
program such as Do the Write Thing

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.090
that the Center for the Book is the
vehicle of reaching out on behalf

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:10.220
of the Library of Congress to
let you know that we are here,

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.420
that we have these magnificent
resources that are paid

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.460
for basically by the
American taxpayer.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:21.630 position:56%
And one of our big tasks is to share
these resources, and a sub part

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.860 position:56%
of that is letting people know about
them through programs such as this.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.180
So again, it's a great
pleasure to have you here

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.740
and it will be a great pleasure

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:36.370
to help facilitate bringing your
writings into the collections

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:41.150
of the largest and most
diverse library in the world.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.120
I am now turning it
back over to Lisa.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.920
Thank you very much.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.040
&gt;&gt; Lisa Cone: So yesterday, Dan
Callister had the chance to meet

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.710
with the students and get to
know them a little better,

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.670
and as he just told me,
many of you told him,

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.140
at least half of you
told him that one

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.550
of your favorite activities
was reading, so we're delighted

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.970
to hear that, and I'm sure
John Cole is delighted

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.280
to hear how much reading is a part
of the things that you like to do.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.210
We've had many very
exceptional writings this year,

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.700
and I wish that we could hear
from all of you, but as you know,

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.100
life is just full of choices,

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.430
and so we had to make
some very difficult ones

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.920
in selecting the essays that
are going to be read today.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.760
First, we are going to hear from
Jason Woods, who is an eight grader

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.760
from Charlotte, North Carolina.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.670 position:56%
Next, we will hear from Maya Monson,

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.890
who is an eighth grader
in Palm Beach.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.260
She will be followed by Safi Ghani
[phonetic], who is an eighth grader

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.830
from Beaumont, and then
concluding will be Fabiola Paloma,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.010
who is a seventh grader
from Chicago.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.510
So Jason, we'll ask
you to come up first.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:17.530
[ Applause ]

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.260
&gt;&gt; Hello. Okay.

"Do the Write Thing" by Jason Woods.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.380
Drugs are everywhere -- schools,
work, business and even churches.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.980
There is not a place in America
that doesn't have any type

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.230
of drug-related violence resource.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.120
For example, ask an older adult
about the drug and violence

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.190
that occurred during their
period of growing up.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.430
Nine times out of ten, they
will tell you a very long

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.860
and breathtaking story,
and it's only getting worse

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.040
as each day goes by.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.430
Almost every child in America has
had a drug-related experience.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.050
Drugs are everywhere,
even in video games.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.910
With these drugs being very
common in people's everyday lives,

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.810
kids and teenagers
often get exposed to it,

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.050
whether it is at a party
or social gathering.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.180
The most common drug is tobacco.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.280
Once a child is exposed, they
will consider smoking as well.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.240
As they get older, they will
get exposed to marijuana,

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.110
which will lead them to think it's
just like smoking a cigarette.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.410
How do I know this?

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.910
Because I was that kid at
elementary school along

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.370
with the other 500-plus students.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.990
Even if you sit down and talk
to children and adults about it,

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:25.040
that doesn't mean that
they don't do drugs

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.410
or that it doesn't
even cross their mind.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:31.110
As much experience as I've had with
drugs, that doesn't necessary mean

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.170
that the thought of it does not
run through my mind as well.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.440
Growing up in a single-parent home

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.010
where our mother is doing the
best she can to raise me not to be

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.350
like my father is very difficult.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:46.640
On April 2nd, 2005, my father
committed suicide due to drugs.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.990 position:56%
In fact, he died by taking a
prescribed drug given by the doctor.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.430
I heard stories about my mom having
to go into the crack house just

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.500
to find my dad at the
late hours of the night,

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.070
having breathtaking moments every
time the phone rang and he wasn't

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.590 position:56%
at home -- and saying a short prayer

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:08.770
to herself every time the phone
rang and he wasn't at home.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:10.070
I'm sorry.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.650
Hold up. I kind of
just mixed up that.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.890
Having breathtaking moments every
time the phone rang and he wasn't

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.120
at home and saying a
short prayer to herself,

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.950
hoping it wasn't the police
calling saying he was found dead,

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.040
or having to keep looking
out the window,

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.250
making sure the police
weren't at the door looking

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.020
for him to have a drug raid.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.580
This really took a toll
on her and my family.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.870 position:56%
Me being young at the time, I didn't
really know what was happening.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.860
At his funeral, I remember standing

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.270
in the chair during the
21-gun salute and staring

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.890
at the casket waiting
for him to wake

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.200
up because I thought he was
just pretending to be asleep.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.960
It seemed very surreal.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.200
While this was happening, I
was wondering why everybody

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.890
around me was crying while wearing
black, with their faces puffy

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.680
and colors purple mixed
with blue under their skin.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.420
Now, it seems just
like a faint memory.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:02.350
That was the past, and it
cannot be taken back or undone.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.710
Because of this traffic incident
that occurred, I try my best not

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.880
to fall under peer pressure
or get taken advantage of.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.650
During my adult years, I'm
going to be the best role model

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.650
for my nephew that I can be.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.600
My nephew was born a
prenatal exposed infant,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.590
better known as a crack baby.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.100
During the nine months he was
developing during his mother's

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.890
pregnancy, she was raped
and also sold her body

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.120
for drugs such as cocaine.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.800
With this affecting
his mental growth,

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.150
he still cannot talk fluently,
acts like a baby, and still demands

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.160
for the bottle known as Similac.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.960
Now he has to undergo continuous
mental and physical therapy.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.690
Due to this, he will always
be different than his peers.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.310
That's why I'm going to be
there whenever he is down,

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:49.010
in need of comfort and steer him in
the right path so he will not have

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.790
to rely on the use of drugs
just for him to get by in life.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.180
Take a moment and actually
think to yourself:

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.660
What have you actually
done to prevent the usage

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.030
and consumption of drugs?

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:02.420
Besides -- I'm sorry.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.640
Take a moment to actually
think to yourself:

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.630
What have people actually done to
prevent the usage and consumption

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.860 position:56%
of drugs besides giving an
hour-long speech about why it is bad

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.160
for your health and all the
cancerous diseases it can cause?

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.520
Though it is 100 percent correct,
just by talking to people,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.910
that does not mean they will have
to listen to what you have to say.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.320
The only way to actively change a
person's personal opinion and point

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.240
of view is by getting
physically involved

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.570 position:56%
in the community and in their lives.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.230
Many of the ones holding
seminars and protesting

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.860
about the harmful drugs and
intakes do not really do anything

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.100
that could change someone's mind
besides speak and hold up signs.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.180
What I mean by changing someone's
mind is actually showing them what

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.900 position:56%
it's like to live a drug-addicted
life by taking them to a crack house

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.250
and showing them the reality of
what it's like to be addicted

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.620
to such a life-consuming product.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.970
The experience I've had with these
drugs is very graphic and a hard

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:57.860
and emotional topic to talk about.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.810
The only thing I can do right
now at this age is tell my story

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.840
about my life-consuming
encounters and pray

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.240
that the person I'm telling listens

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:10.260
about all the problems just one
little consumption of drugs can do

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.730
and how it can ruin your
life with just one puff

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.910
of smoke or snort of cocaine.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.660
Actually, this essay that I'm
writing right now helped my friend

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.540
last night while she was
on the verge of suicide.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.960
Just by me telling my story

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.430
and how it is affecting
my life helped save hers,

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:28.330 position:56%
and now she thanks me every time
she sees me because she did not know

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.960
that I went through these
incidents growing up.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.590
Every day I wake up,
put a smile on my face,

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:36.170
and try not to let the
past experiences degrade me

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.710
and make me feel any
less than myself,

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:43.370
all because of one little intake
of cocaine that my father consumed.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:44.830
I try to see it as a cry for help.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.940
Just because he did not get the
attention he needed does not make

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.600
him any less of a true hero he is.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.090
I never knew that this common drug
could affect my life like it did,

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:58.240
and now I will continue my life,
growing up happy and drug free.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.040
Thank you.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:13.300
[ Applause ]

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.640
&gt;&gt; Hello. "Do the Write
Thing" by Maya Monson.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.300
I watched as he hit her over
and over, pounding his fist

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.310
into her face, back, arms
-- anywhere he could reach.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:23.710
The sound was sickening.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.250
She yelled out in pain,
trying to grab

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.060
or hit him, but she was too slow.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.890
Tears streaked down her face, and
she went limp and just gave up.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.580
I was shaking and crying,
screaming and pleading

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.610
for him to stop hurting my mom.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.930
All that did was make him
focus his attention on me.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.440
He yelled at me and then started
hitting her again while I ran

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.740
up to my room.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.040
This was my life.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.340
I wasn't even six years old.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.100
One day, I went to the
neighbor's and was molested.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.470
I was told not to tell anyone.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.060
I felt absolutely disgusting,
but I was told not to tell,

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.500
and that's what I saw my mom
did every -- every day, yeah.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.800
So why was I to be ashamed?

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.060
I was only six.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.800
I remember when my mother
slit her wrists with a knife

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.990
and blood was pouring out of her,
but her boyfriend wasn't helping.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.740
Once again, I wasn't even six, and
I was crying and trying to help,

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.490
but my eyes were blurred, and
she wasn't able to speak properly

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.330
because of the substance abuse.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.390
I was put in my room
by him and stayed

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.800
up crying until I fell asleep.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.350
I guess you could say I've been
dealt a pretty repulsive set

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.990
of cards, and though it has
affected my life negatively,

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.290
it has also helped me grow.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.320
I have depression, anxiety and
borderline personality disorder

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.570
as well as a bunch of bad habits
that are hard to overcome,

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.490
though I am working
on overcoming them.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:33.830
However, thanks to my
past, I can help others

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.330
with problems of all kinds.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.250
I want to be a psychologist
for severely abused children.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.740
Bullying has taken
a toll on my life.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.450
It is inevitable, no
matter who you are.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.970
However, it amazes me how low
people will stoop to engage

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:48.290
in unacceptable behavior
to satisfy their own needs.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.640
I mean we are all going
through the same things.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.080
Our bodies are changes, our voices,
our interests, our friend groups.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.560
How does that make anyone
better than anyone else?

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.330
Youth violence as well as any other
type of violence is routed back

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.500
to many things -- broken homes,
social networking, gangs,

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.360
substance abuse, poverty, peer
pressure, ignorance, and many more.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.610
All violence is routed
back to something.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:09.920
Teens with mental illnesses tend

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.740
to show a marked propensity
for violent behaviors.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.230
Once you start, I know how
hard it can be to stop.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:16.530
Violence overcomes you.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.010
According to the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention,

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:22.610
about 32 percent of teens have
been bullied or have been bullies.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.620
Those teens are more likely to
skip school and start fights.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.770
Without knowing the causes, how
are we to stop youth violence?

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.910
First, we need to be educated.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.100
Violence is hard for
you to stop by yourself.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.840
Trust me. I've tried.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.330
There are a few things
that you could do to help.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.710
Violence is a serious issue.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.970
If you see someone
getting bullied, step in.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.570
Now, I'm not saying
go get yourself hurt.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.640
I'm saying if you see
a situation escalating,

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.890
get someone to go help the person.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.490
Give respect so you get respect.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.990
If 70 percent of people
remembered this,

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.610
there wouldn't be nearly
as many fights.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.350
Think "What would your family say?"

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:01.060
as a big part is as parents, adults
need to be there for the children.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.820
Though my mother couldn't take
care of herself much less a child,

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.740
she always tried to care for me.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.880
Though this isn't the best, she
worked at a gentleman's club,

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.250
and she split up half of the money
for drugs and half of the money

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.170
for me, but she loved me
and she showed it somehow.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.320
Teachers should always teach
the benefits and practices

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.510
of leading a nonviolent lifestyle.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:20.120
Without this, students may
never learn, considering most

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.250
of us assume we already know.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:27.860
Know that youth violence has caused
738,000 young people ages ten to 24

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.000
to be treated with assault-related
injuries, according to the CDC.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.220
Though youth violence is a huge
problem -- we all know it is --

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.510 position:56%
I feel we can come together and
reduce the percent of violent teens.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:04.050
&gt;&gt; Okay. Every day -- sorry.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.590
Every day, wherever I go,
whether it is the mall, school,

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:10.690
or movies, I experience violence.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:14.050
Though the level of violence I
experience may be very minor,

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:17.320
like a dispute between neighbors,
there are much worse cases

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.430
of violence around the world.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:24.060
In my opinion, the biggest issue
of violence is Islamic terrorism.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.700
I believe terroristic violence
is a result of religious

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:31.150
and cultural misunderstandings
between different diverse groups.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.200
These differences have
led to so much violence.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:39.130
For example, al-Qaeda
purpose is to destroy America

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:42.440
for they believe the way America
governs and their standard

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.140
of living wasn't just or righteous.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.900
They have no idea how
great a place America is

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:53.530
to live and raise a family.

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.390
I'm sorry.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:03.090
One sec. Okay.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:05.890
They have no idea how great
a place America is to live

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:09.650
and raise a family, so they
carried out 9/11 to show America

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.730
that they were superior and
to try and break America.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:16.010
Can you imagine having a loved
one killed for no reason at all?

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:19.260
That's what thousands of Americans
had to go through that day.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:24.110
Even though I did not lose a loved
one, my life was changed forever.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.520
How could someone in the
name of my faith, Islam,

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.130
do something so terrible?

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.190
I know from what my parents and
religious teachers have taught was

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:37.480
that Islam is a religion of
peace, acceptance and respect.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.470
My dad has always taught
me to try and understand

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:43.260
and respect people's
differences of faith.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.630
Instead of practicing
Islam as it was meant to

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.710
or respecting the differences
between American culture

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:54.660 position:56%
and their own twisted view of Islam,
Osama bin Laden, leader of al-Qaeda,

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.430
considered his culture superior,
and on 9/11, al-Qaeda carried

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.100
out their attacks on
the Twin Towers.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.740
Being an American Muslim,

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.440
these terrorist groups are
impacting my life greatly.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.270
At school, I would
always get bullied

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:11.240
and teased because of my religion.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:15.600
Towel-head, camel jockey, and other
more vulgar names have been told,

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.500
or more like yelled at me.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.630
When walking through the mall,
people would stare at my family

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.860
and give us dirty looks because
of my mother's head scarf.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.830
We even flew an American
flag, but many people

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.540
in our neighborhood would
still give us dirty looks.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:34.710
Did they not realize that I am as
upset about what happened also?

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:38.620
These terrorist groups are
attacking my complete way of life.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.940
I am an American and Muslim.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.970
Just as al-Qaeda is not trying to
understand America's way of life,

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:49.300
a lot of people here are
guilty of the same thing also.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.840
The television news and
newspapers are selling headlines,

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.410
only worried about getting
ratings, but not caring

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.460
that they are misinforming
the public.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.620
If people would research
the religion on their own,

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.700
they would realize that these
terrorists are crazy people acting

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.550
barbarically, hiding
under the banner of Islam,

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:10.140
just like the KKK hid under
the banner of Christianity.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:14.720
I know that no God-fearing
Christian would agree with the KKK.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.030
Despite all these hardships
I go through,

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:20.880
I never stop being a proud American
and a strong practicing Muslim.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.720
And please don't get me wrong.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.870
There were a lot of good
people who provided support

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.830
and stuck up for my family.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:31.110
I realize that I can't stop
the violence that is happening,

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.630
but I can try being a
bridge between Muslims'

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.610
and Americans' misunderstandings.

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:40.520
Having an understanding of both
an American way of life and Islam,

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.440
I am in the perfect position to
teach both Americans and Muslims.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.510
It is my job to properly
explain and teach people

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:51.510
that Islam is not the
enemy, but the crazy people

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:52.810
who are committing violent acts

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.450
under the misrepresented
view of Islam.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:58.930
Also, I can explain and teach
Muslims how great this country is

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:01.370
to live in and the
freedom that we have.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.750
It is in this freedom that
has made practicing Islam

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.050
so great in America.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:09.440
I can only imagine what
would happen to me if I were

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.210
to express these thoughts as
a student in the Middle East.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:17.530
I can also help start interfaith
conferences, where all types

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.300
of people can get together
and learn about each other.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.820
I know that these violent terrorist
groups will always be around,

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.660
but I will do my best
to try and teach people

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.290
that there are better ways to live.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:29.090

printed in Braille so that

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:01.140
when he gave them out, it would
bring attention to this area

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.010
of education, and I thought
that was a pretty cool idea.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:08.700 position:56%
He has worked as a special
education teacher, an administrator,

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:12.180
a lobbyist, a congressional
aide, and a Peace Corps volunteer

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.300
in North Africa, which he says was
the best two years of his life.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.040
He said he thought that because he
didn't have a care in the world,

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.860
but I think he enjoyed that time
so much because in the Peace Corps,

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.270
he was fully engaged in
serving others, and this service

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.620
from the time of the Peace
Corps until now is something

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.920
that has been a hallmark
of David's career.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.720
So David?

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:41.790
[ Applause ]

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.320
&gt;&gt; David Esquith: Thank you, Lisa.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.010
Thank you, and good morning to
everyone, and as I was coming

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:50.910
in on the train this morning, I was
remembering this is my fourth year

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:54.790
of doing this, and it
really is a pleasure,

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.620
and I've read through
all of the essays.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:02.300
I really admire and
congratulate all of you.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:07.230
The essays are so candid, so
honest, and the resilience of all

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:12.690
of you is just quite admirable, so
I want to congratulate all of you,

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:19.010
and to share a few thoughts,
a few thoughts on character,

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.680
and I wouldn't be in the
Department of Education

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.000
if I didn't start with
a bit of a quiz.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.530
I know it's summer
break, but this is a quiz

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:33.170
or just a question that'll give
you a little insight into, perhaps,

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:37.390
who you are or kind of what
character you have, and so,

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:41.010
you know, it's a bit
of a parlor game.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.220
The question is if
you had a super power.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:47.800
You can have a super power,
and I'm giving you two choices.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:52.710
You can be invisible,
or you can fly.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:54.620
Okay, so think about
that for a moment.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.790
You can have a superpower.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:58.790
You can be invisible,
or you can fly.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.430
Just want to take a
poll, a raise of hands.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:05.390
How many people would
like to be invisible.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:08.150
Raise your hand.

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.170
A lot of adults, and I think

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.320
that probably has something
to do with the kids.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.590
As a parent of two nine-year-olds,
for any number of reasons,

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:21.770
I often wish that I were invisible,
both not to be there as well

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.920
as to find out what's going on.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.140
And then how many people
would prefer to fly?

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.120
Yeah, lots of kids,
lots of young people.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:35.330
All right, so when you
process this question,

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:38.700
what you're doing is thinking
about kind of who you are,

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.310
and if you had this superpower,
what life would be like,

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:43.680
and how good it would feel.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.570
So we all have, everyone
has, a unique character,

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:51.340
and I'm going to run through
some slides on character,

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.350
and there are some
questions built in here,

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:56.820
and I think there's one question
at the end that I really want you

00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:01.980
to come away with and think about,
and I want to credit two people.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:09.750
I want to credit Tiffany Schlain,
who is kind of the founder

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:13.140
of The Moxie Institute, and
there's a film called The Science

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.440
of Character.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.030
I encourage you all to go online.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:20.210
You'll see a lot of the concepts
from my presentation today

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:23.430
from that film, and I also
want to credit a person.

00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:26.320
Someone who's been here for
four years who has seen some

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.350
of my presentations before,
and I see some familiar faces,

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:33.970
will know that this is really
an upgrade for me in terms

00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:37.880
of my slide presentation, and
I want to credit Eric Sherwin.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.220 position:56%
Eric, can you stand up for a moment?

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.510
Who's with the Department
of Education this summer.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:46.780
[ Applause ]

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.960
So you'll see that I
couldn't have done these.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.840 position:56%
I don't know how Eric did it, but --
so we're going to talk a little bit

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.890
about character, and
the question is, "Well,

00:34:56.890 --> 00:34:58.190
what determines character?

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:00.490
What determines who
we are as people?"

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:07.370
and people, and science, and
philosophers have been kind

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.320
of asking this question
for an awful long time,

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.280
and there's some new thinking
on it, and some thinking

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:18.160
that I think has a lot of
implications for stopping violence,

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.600
and preventing violence,
and how we treat each other,

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.200
and the answer is "you do."

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:32.000
You determine your character,
and it is a very powerful,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:39.690 position:56%
powerful idea that you have control
over the kind of person who are you.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:42.710
The other component to
this is that the people

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:47.680
around you help determine your
character, and the converse

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.160
to that is that you help determine
the character of other people

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.360
by the way that you
interact with them.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:36:02.930
And so the idea here is that
if you focus on certain parts

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:06.000
of who you are, you can
develop your character.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.540
We all have many different
parts, right.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.840
We all are good.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.140
We all are bad.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.890
We have good moments, we have bad
moments, things we're proud of,

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:19.300
things we're ashamed of,
and part of this comes

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:23.190
down to what you focus
on as a person.

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:28.040
For a long time, and this is
still kind of prevalent in a lot

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:32.900
of the ways that we deal with
people, in particular people

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:36.420
at school and issues
around disruption --

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.540
is we focus on what's wrong with
someone, what's the problem,

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:46.330
what's wrong with that person, how
can we fix what's wrong with them,

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:54.250
and in 2004, Christopher
Peterson and Martin Seligman came

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:59.590
up with kind of a different
paradigm, and it's not something

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:03.510
that was totally new, but
they said, "Why don't we focus

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.560
on what's right with a person?

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.790
When we're talking to a person, why
don't we focus on their strengths

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:13.800
and what's right with them,
and what impact will that have

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:19.470
on how society deals with
everyone in the society?"

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:25.420
And so scientists being what
they are came up with a table,

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.940
so science kind of organizes
things by tables, right,

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:34.450 position:56%
and so there was a Periodic Table of
Character Strengths, and I want you

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:38.100
to kind of take a look at the
headings across the table,

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.340
and then take a look at
the parts underneath,

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.370
and start thinking about yourself.

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:47.660
What are your strengths
under these categories?

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:52.890
And the categories are wisdom,
courage, humanity, justice,

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.660
temperance, and transcendence.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.900
And so take a look
at kind of the boxes.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.510
I hope you can all --
can everybody see those?

00:38:00.510 --> 00:39:01.060
[ Inaudible Audience Response ]

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:04.060 position:56%
But I don't want to take up too
much time going through all of them,

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.150
but under those categories,
think of your strengths.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:11.440
Think of people in your life
and their strengths that fit

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.700
under these categories, and
what science has learned is

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:21.900
that there are seven that really
keep coming up over and over again

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:25.940
in terms of people who
are successful and happy,

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:29.930
and those seven are optimism,
gratitude, social intelligence,

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:33.370 position:56%
curiosity, self-control, enthusiasm,
and perseverance, and that people

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.420
who have one or more of
these qualities and who focus

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.640
on strengthening those qualities
are the people who are more likely

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.940
to become successful and happy.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.240
So think about, again, those parts
of yourself, where you have one

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.540
or more of those characteristics.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:43.840
Think about other people that
you know, and think about ways,

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.140
and here's one of the keys here, of
what you can do to increase that,

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.440
to improve that, to build
out those character traits.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.740
So see, this is Eric.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.040
I never would have come
up with this slide.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.340
I got to give Eric credit here.

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.640
And so we're all -- I mean we're
all kind of this patchwork quilt,

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.940
but everyone has a unique
combination of traits,

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.240
and if we focus on
building strengths,

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.540
then that has a lasting
impact if we focus on,

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.840
"What are the strengths
of this person?"

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.140
So I'm the principal.

00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.440
Some kid comes down.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.740
He's been sent down to
the principal's office.

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.040
He's disrupted the class.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.340
What happens when the principal
goes, "I know this student.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.640
What are his strengths?

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.940
What can we do to kind of
improve his strengths?"

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.930
Then we end up having a much more
lasting impact in our interactions

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:12.620
with people than if we start
working on what's the problem,

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:18.050
what's wrong with them, what do
I need to do to fix what's wrong,

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:20.920
and we help shape others'
characters, too.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:25.890
So this is, again, this idea that
it's not just us, but what we do

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:31.120
as we interact with people
helps shape their character,

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:36.770
and that the key to human
relationships is appreciating

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:41.590
others' strengths, and I'll
let that sink in for a moment,

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:44.970
because it's really quite a
kind of a profound thought

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:48.320
about genuinely appreciating
other people's strengths,

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:53.480
people who we don't like,
people who rub us the wrong way,

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.620
where there's friction, where
there's kind of conflict.

00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:00.640
What happens if the lens that
we look through is about,

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.890
"What are the strengths of
this person, and what can I do

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:07.290
to kind of appreciate them?"

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:12.880
And so if you improve your
character through mindful striving

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:19.560 position:56%
or let your character worsen through
negligence and obliviousness,

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.400
then what we know is
that happiness comes

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.570
from practicing virtuous
character strengths,

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:29.650
and this idea of practicing
them is very real.

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:31.860
How do we practice
character strengths?

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:35.450
And I'll give you an example,
and this is kind of something

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:38.770
that it's an exercise that I
go through living in Washington

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:46.000
on a regular basis, and it's
little moments like these

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.360
where we're really kind of
practicing our character strengths,

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.280
but in Washington, unfortunately,

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.600
there are a lot of
homeless individuals.

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:58.090
There are a lot of individuals
who are out asking for money,

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:04.030
who are panhandling, and it
always makes me uncomfortable.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:07.580
I'm always faced with
kind of a moral dilemma

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:10.890
when I see these individuals
on the street of,

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:14.960
"Do I take out a dollar
and give it to them?"

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:19.020
and this is kind of where
my character is surfacing.

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.890
These are kind of the little
moments in the course of the day

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:26.680 position:56%
where your character is surfacing,
and I've always struggled with this.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.200
It's that, you know,
kind of typical dilemma.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.930
Well, if I give them a dollar,
am I reinforcing this behavior?

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:37.110
You know, I start going through
all these mental exercises of,

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:38.410
"Is this the right thing to do?

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:42.890
You know, this person,
am I encouraging them?

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:45.760
You know, they're making
me uncomfortable.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.060
That's not right.

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.360
They're invading my space."

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.280
Just, you know, in just a moment's
time, you go through this kind

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:56.440
of continuum of emotions
about something

00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:06.130 position:56%
that is basically pretty simple, and
I was in a course at our synagogue,

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:10.270 position:56%
and the rabbi was talking about
this, and what he said was that part

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:15.890
of the Jewish tradition in terms
of giving alms to the poor is

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:21.070
that you should always do it
when you least want to do it,

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:25.730
that at that moment, when this
is the last person that you want

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:29.500
to give a dollar to or some money
to who is begging for money,

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.800
that's when you should
give it to them.

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.800
And I've tried to live by
that, and it's just kind of one

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.550
of those moments, as I said,
in the course of the day

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:42.990
when our real character not
only kind of exhibits itself,

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:47.740
but it's kind of an opportunity
to develop it, an opportunity

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.900
to do something that kind of fits
within those seven categories

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.960
that they identified earlier.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:00.870
So going back to the science here,
there's a science that, you know,

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:05.960
there's kind of a fixed mindset,
and there's a growth mindset,

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.610
that we're all kind of, once we're
born and through the first kind

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:12.860
of the formative years of
our lives, we are who we are.

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.230
We are who we're going to be.

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:20.200
There's another, I think, approach
to this, which really resonates

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:26.070
with me, which is to have a
growth mindset, that every day,

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:29.770
no matter how old you are, no
matter what your circumstances are,

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:36.120
you can grow as a person, that
we all can grow as a person.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.120
And so with the fixed mindset,
as I said, it's kind of belief

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.400
that we're born with certain
abilities, intelligence,

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.760
and talents, and we're
stuck with it,

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.820
and I think a lot of
people believe that.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:49.100 position:56%
A lot of people, when they deal with
other people, particularly people

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:52.990 position:56%
who they're having a conflict with,
they go, "That's who that person is,

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:57.180
and it's not going to change,
and I'm writing them off."

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.820
The growth mindset is I can change.

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:05.740
If I set my mind to it, I can do
anything, and that even failure

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:13.280 position:56%
for me is something that I can learn
from, and that we can all develop.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:18.310
So, you know, again, going back
to the science, they're kind of,

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:19.610
as they're studying the brain,

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:23.160
there's a lot of interesting brain
science coming out these days.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.480
They talk about kind of executive
functions, and there's a part

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:30.810
of a brain where, you know, we've
got organizing, and prioritizing,

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:34.290
and sustaining efforts, and
accessibility, and memory,

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:37.490
and recall, and focusing on
tasks, and managing frustration

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:40.530
and emotions, and self-regulating
actions,

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:42.450
and this part of the
brain is dynamic.

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:46.830
It is constantly changing,
constantly growing,

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:51.810
and so here's an adage that I
hope you'll kind of keep in mind,

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:56.260
because again, kind of our
own personal experience,

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:59.190
how many of us kind of
perseverate on things?

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:02.200
We just kind of -- there's
this movie going on in our head

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.520
of something bad that's
going on in their lives,

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:11.440
and we spend an awful lot of time
kind of playing this movie over

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:17.440
and over again, and the takeaway
here is that has an effect on you.

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.440
It has an effect on who you are
and the character that you have.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:26.040
And so this adage is that you
need to watch your thoughts.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.160
They become your words.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.480
Watch your words.

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.120
They become actions.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.420
Watch your actions.

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.400
They become habits.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.930
Watch your habits.

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:39.160
They become your character.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.010
Watch your character.

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.660
It becomes your destiny.

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:47.930
And when you kind of follow
this sequence of just beginning

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:50.190
with your thoughts and
what we're thinking about,

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:54.950 position:56%
and what we're focusing on, and the
ability to kind of stop those movies

00:46:54.950 --> 00:47:00.200 position:56%
that are negative, that are focusing
on what's wrong, what the problem is

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:04.780 position:56%
with someone rather than the movie
of, "Well, what are their strengths?

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.080
What are my strengths?

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.690
What can I do to kind
of grow my strengths?"

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:13.760
By the time you kind of
finish the sequence of events,

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.390
your character kind of
determines your destiny,

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:22.310 position:56%
and kind of the journey that we're
all on in life, and where we end up,

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:26.010
and you know, quite frankly,
I'm grateful that the journey

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:28.890
that I'm taking has given me the
opportunity to present to people

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:33.860
like you, to be exposed to kind
of the courageous good work

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:38.490
that you do, and so all of us
have control of our destiny,

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:43.950
and sometimes, it just begins
with our thoughts and our words.

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:48.970
So character strengths can be
learned, practiced and cultivated.

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.690
That's a takeaway here.

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:58.480
Focusing on your strengths
makes them stronger.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:02.540
Focusing on your strengths
makes them stronger.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:07.330
Focusing on others' strengths
makes them stronger, too.

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:15.150
And then the final thought, the
question that I try to ask myself

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:17.760
on kind of a regular basis
throughout the course of the day,

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:21.620
throughout the course of every
small interaction that I have

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:25.400
with other people, because that's
really kind of who I am, right.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:30.990
We all are kind of the aggregation
of every small moment in our lives,

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:39.790
and so the question that really
I encourage you to ask yourself,

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:46.350
to take a moment and think: "Is
what I'm about do a reflection

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:49.830
of who I am and who I want to be?"

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:57.190
And if you do that, then I
can encourage you to think

00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:01.460 position:56%
that we'll all be a lot happier, and
safer, and it'll be a better world

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.180
for all of us to live in.

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.510
So thank you again
for this opportunity.

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:09.460
