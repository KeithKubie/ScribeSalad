[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:08.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: So Ken, you
were one of the first Maps API

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.155
developers out there, right?

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:12.260
So tell us a bit about that.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.550
KEN HOETMER: I suppose I am.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.940
Yeah, that's true.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.390
So I started developing with
the original Maps API v1 back

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.610
in 2005, which actually
only lasted about six months

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.514
before the v2 came out.

00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:27.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: Why
the sudden change?

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.120
KEN HOETMER: Why
the sudden change?

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.836
Well, I think Google wanted to
put some more support behind it

00:00:30.836 --> 00:00:31.960
I believe is what happened.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.550
But I remember at
the time, when I

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.310
got started with it, that when
you put a marker on a map,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.920
you actually had to
specify the longitude

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.160
before the latitude in v1.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.690
And then v2 came
out shortly after.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.520
And I had to change all of my
code to say latitude-longitude.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.890
And it's been
latitude-longitude ever since.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.519
But a few old timers may
remember the days before.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's a great
example of breaking changes,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.100
right?

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.340
KEN HOETMER: Breaking
changes, that's right.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.882
That's right.

00:00:56.882 --> 00:00:58.881
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now, I
know also back then you

00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:00.810
worked on this-- it
became a pretty famous app

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.470
at the time, the Quick Maps?

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.220
KEN HOETMER: I
suppose at the time.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.510
At the time, I was just kind
of an independent developer

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.565
working out of a
bedroom in Canada.

00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:12.720
And I launched an app
I called Quick Maps.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.560
And the tagline was,
Doodle on Google.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.220
And what it let you do
is a bit of a merger

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.120
of Microsoft Paint tools--
editing tools-- and Google Maps

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.130
API.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.370
And so you could draw on
Google Maps and label things

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.140
and save your creations and
send a link to your friends

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.240
or put an iframe
on your website.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.060
And it turned out that
this became rather popular.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.670
Nothing like this
existed at the time.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.720
It reached the front page
of Digg and Slashdot.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.497
This was in 2006.

00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:43.080
LAURENCE MORONEY:
You got Slashdotted?

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.080
KEN HOETMER: I got Slashdotted.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.170
And I had been experimenting
with Ruby on Rails

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.690
at that time, which was
also a new technology.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.590
And my server collapsed in a
heap at the time on a weekend

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.250
when I was away.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.130
And we had to, you know,
fight to get it back up.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.940
But yes, my moment of fame.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.632
LAURENCE MORONEY: But now you're
here of Google working on Maps.

00:02:04.632 --> 00:02:05.590
KEN HOETMER: I am, yes.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.740
So at the time--
I guess that was

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.979
2006-- I was invited to
interview for an engineering

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.960
role at Google, which
I failed miserably.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.380
LAURENCE MORONEY: Don't
worry, I failed twice.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.826
KEN HOETMER: You failed twice?

00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:17.490
LAURENCE MORONEY: If at first
you don't succeed, right?

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.573
KEN HOETMER: That's right.

00:02:18.573 --> 00:02:19.230
Try, try again.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.230
You have second chances.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.810
I'm proof.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.310
I ended up taking a job with
Lonely Planet, a travel company

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.440
based in Melbourne,
Australia, at the time working

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.980
on digital maps for them.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.740
And in 2011, I became a Googler.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.580
And I joined the Google team as
a product manager, this time.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.112
So if you can't code, you
become a product manager.

00:02:40.112 --> 00:02:43.310
And I joined the Google
Maps team then in Sydney.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.694
And I've been there ever
since, as the sandals suggest.

00:02:45.694 --> 00:02:46.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: I like it.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.620
You're bringing a bit
of Australia with you.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.703
KEN HOETMER: That's right.

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:50.380
That's right.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: So you're
working on, what is it?

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.302
So it's like the services
for Maps, that type of thing?

00:02:54.302 --> 00:02:55.760
KEN HOETMER: So
the Google Maps API

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.890
is generally what I work on.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.900
So we have a whole
suite of services now

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.580
and the Google Maps API is
beyond-- the original Google

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.910
Maps API was a JavaScript API.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.800
But we've since expanded
to Android and iOS

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.950
as well as we have a
series of HTTP web services

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.281
that folks can use to
develop across platforms.

00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:18.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.310
So like what kind of things
do these services offer?

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.260
KEN HOETMER: So maps, of course,
I guess what we're known for.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.190
We're still called the Maps API.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.630
But increasingly as we've moved
into an area that is heavily

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.440
driven by mobile and by
connected devices that

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.403
are in the world and
know where they are,

00:03:38.403 --> 00:03:41.610
the maps are becoming
a secondary piece

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.460
to what is more primarily
location information that

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.510
is derived from these
devices and making decisions

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.920
and building applications
and deriving value

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.630
from that location information.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.680
So we've had a few launches
recently along these lines.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.790
One is Places API.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.300
Places API has been
available as a web service

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.240
for a number of years.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.360
But last year we launched a
native version of Places API

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.310
for Android and iOS.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.840
And Places API does
a number of things.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.790
But for the mobile use case
and the primary use case,

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.516
it is, where am I now?

00:04:17.516 --> 00:04:19.390
The method is called
Get Current Place, which

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.399
would seem obvious, right?

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.930
Where am I now?

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.740
The device can do that.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.370
It has a GPS.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.480
But the GPS returns a number.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.450
And a number doesn't
mean anything to a user.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.480
And turning that number into
a meaningful label for a user

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.410
is actually a very
difficult challenge

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.700
and requires access to a
database of place names

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.560
that, you know,
not everybody has.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.910
And so we've built
that into Places API.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.850
You can use Places
API to gain access

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.597
to Google's knowledge of
places around the world.

00:04:45.597 --> 00:04:48.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: And also like
when you get the lat-long back

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.552
from a GPS-- I mean, it's
not pinpoint accurate, right?

00:04:51.552 --> 00:04:53.260
And there may be
multiple places near you

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.815
that you could be
in one of those.

00:04:54.815 --> 00:04:55.898
KEN HOETMER: That's right.

00:04:55.898 --> 00:04:59.150
So Places API uses a combination
of both latitude and longitude

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.110
as well as actually sensing
Wi-Fi signals in the area

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.040
to be more accurate,
which is why

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.290
it's better to use than, say,
a reverse geocoding call.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.930
We've also launched a new API
called Roads API recently,

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.510
as well-- within
the last year or so.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.960
What it does is-- anyone
who's used, I guess, probably

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.550
an older GPS tracking app or
has developed with the GPS

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.000
on a mobile device knows
that, if you attempt to trace

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.534
a route, it bounces, right?

00:05:29.534 --> 00:05:30.450
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yup.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.690
KEN HOETMER: It bounces
all over the place

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.230
because, well, it
has to go to space

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.550
and come back down, right?

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.870
KEN HOETMER: This is actually
fascinating technology.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.911
But on the way to space
and on the way back down,

00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:40.427
you get a jitter.

00:05:40.427 --> 00:05:42.260
LAURENCE MORONEY: It
depends on the weather.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.240
KEN HOETMER: It
depends on the weather.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.948
Of course, right?

00:05:43.948 --> 00:05:45.950
So what our Roads
API does is allows

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.070
you to pass in a set
of raw GPS lat-longs,

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.330
like a raw GPS trace.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.820
And from that we will snap
it to the road network

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.910
and give you a normalized
path as well as an identifier

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.035
that you can use to interrogate
properties of the road network,

00:06:02.035 --> 00:06:02.536
as well.

00:06:02.536 --> 00:06:03.785
LAURENCE MORONEY: Interesting.

00:06:03.785 --> 00:06:05.790
KEN HOETMER: And a
newer feature launched

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.500
as well within the last
year-- Directions API

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.990
web service has been available
for quite a number of years.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.130
But what we've launched
recently is something

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.450
we call predictive travel time.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.366
LAURENCE MORONEY: Ooh.

00:06:16.366 --> 00:06:17.074
KEN HOETMER: Yes.

00:06:17.074 --> 00:06:19.330
And with predictive travel
time, what you can do is,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.680
when you ask for directions
between point A and point B,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.830
you can specify
either time equals now

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.550
or a time equals
sometime in the future.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.050
And we will give you
an estimate travel time

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.430
and actually routes
that we have derived

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.710
based on our understanding of
traffic conditions either now

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.070
or what they will
be in the future.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.850
And so for folks who are
developing applications

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.380
around moving objects--
and the sharing economy

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.080
is popping up quite
a lot of these, Uber

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.560
being the classic example--
this is a very useful API

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.352
for doing logistics
planning, for instance.

00:06:52.352 --> 00:06:53.809
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So a lot of this,

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:55.280
like, location-based
intelligence,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.810
there must be some
fun use cases.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.930
There must be some great stuff
that people are doing with it.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.140
Can you share any of them?

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.322
KEN HOETMER: Yeah.

00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:02.440
Well, I mentioned Uber.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.320
Uber is the classic example.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.860
And there are a lot of sort
of Uber-like applications

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.610
that we're seeing pop
up around the world.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.950
One of my favorites is
called GO-JEK in Indonesia.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.710
And they are a
similar type service

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.910
but for motorcycles
OK Indonesia.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.250
So you can hail a motorcycle
using GO-JEK in Indonesia.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.000
And they're using a
number of our services

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.070
to decide which motorcycle
should come to you.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.690
And so you can see which
motorcycle is coming.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.300
LAURENCE MORONEY: And you hop
on the back of the motorbike?

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.050
You don't drive it yourself?

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.490
KEN HOETMER: That's right.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.800
You hop on the back
of the motorbike.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.390
And it takes you to
where you need to go.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.486
KEN HOETMER: So another
interesting one,

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:35.890
Dash Labs was our Roads
API launch partner.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.950
And they're using
Roads API, which

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.970
snaps GPS traces to
the road network,

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.900
to help you with
smarter driving.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.890
And there's a very
fascinating one

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.880
in Sydney around the
Directions API feature

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.270
I mentioned earlier.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.320
In Sydney, when
you're driving down

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.500
the motorway-- in a lot of
cities, you will see this.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.920
There's a sign on the motorway
that says, time to exit 1, 2, 3

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.462
is five minutes,
for instance, right?

00:08:00.462 --> 00:08:01.461
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:03.270
KEN HOETMER: And in
Sydney, this is now not

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.280
derived from a sensor
on the road that

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.090
is tracking car
movement across the road

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.200
but simply by calling our
Directions API for the time

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.734
and traffic between
the sign and the exit--

00:08:12.734 --> 00:08:13.900
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right now.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.110
KEN HOETMER: --right now.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.151
And then they just put
them straight on the sign.

00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:18.840
And they've done some
tests before they

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.943
launched this feature and proved
that, actually, our Directions

00:08:22.943 --> 00:08:25.833
API is as accurate as
the sensors on the road.

00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:26.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:27.570
KEN HOETMER: Yeah.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.060
The city of Sydney is
very excited about this

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.530
because the cost savings.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:31.780
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.000
I mean, the cost of like
putting and maintaining

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.130
those sensors on the road.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.250
And now what?

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.817
The sign itself
just calls an API?

00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:38.900
KEN HOETMER: That's right.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.816
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:08:39.816 --> 00:08:40.740
That's really cool.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.905
So all of this stuff is
available to developers?

00:08:42.905 --> 00:08:45.632
KEN HOETMER: Yes,
developers.google.com/maps.

00:08:45.632 --> 00:08:47.090
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Easy to remember.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.340
KEN HOETMER: Easy to remember.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.830
And just pick your platform
that you're developing for.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.750
All of our APIs are free to
try, in some cases completely

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.270
free depending on your
use cases or with what

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.209
we feel are moderate charges
for usage above the limits

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.000
should you need it.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.416
LAURENCE MORONEY:
OK, sounds good.

00:09:05.416 --> 00:09:06.687
So developers.google.com/maps?

00:09:06.687 --> 00:09:07.770
KEN HOETMER: That's right.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:08.160
LAURENCE MORONEY: All right.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.910
Well, thanks, Ken.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.140
And thanks, everybody.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.395
If you have any questions
for me or if you

00:09:11.395 --> 00:09:13.200
have any questions for
Ken, just please leave them

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.116
in the comments below.

00:09:14.116 --> 00:09:15.040
And we'll get to them.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.430
