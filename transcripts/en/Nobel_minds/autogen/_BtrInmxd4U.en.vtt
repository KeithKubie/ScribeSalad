okay another comments on this point I

00:13:25.769 --> 00:13:25.779
okay another comments on this point I
 

00:13:25.779 --> 00:13:28.309

were going to ask me about the Higgs

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:13.260
were going to ask me about the Higgs
 

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.389

bosons I think you know common theme and

in science is we do science best when we

in science is we do science best when we
 

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.510
in science is we do science best when we
don't have an application in mind

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520
don't have an application in mind
 

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.730
don't have an application in mind
because it limits our imagination and

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:25.740
because it limits our imagination and
 

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:30.230
because it limits our imagination and
creativity but in the end we feel most

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240

you don't just think about solving

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:22.140
you don't just think about solving
 

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.810
you don't just think about solving
tomorrow's problems today you want to

tomorrow's problems today you want to
 

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.430
tomorrow's problems today you want to
solve think about problems that have you

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440
solve think about problems that have you
 

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.620
solve think about problems that have you
even been designed yet and then you'll

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:27.630
even been designed yet and then you'll
 

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.240
even been designed yet and then you'll
have a massive impact and I think this

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:29.250
have a massive impact and I think this
 

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.769
have a massive impact and I think this
is a very critical thing because we

00:24:30.769 --> 00:24:30.779
is a very critical thing because we

increasingly want you to solve

increasingly want you to solve
short-term problems and I think it is

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580
short-term problems and I think it is
 

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.090
short-term problems and I think it is

perhaps high energy physics doesn't have
a very direct practical application but

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:41.100
a very direct practical application but
 

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.310
a very direct practical application but
it's really hard to imagine the

know maybe that's why we have so many

know maybe that's why we have so many
 

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.650
know maybe that's why we have so many
people on earth but it's all part of the

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:19.660
people on earth but it's all part of the
 

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.780
people on earth but it's all part of the
success of science so it seems to me

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:21.790
success of science so it seems to me
 

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:24.230
success of science so it seems to me
that we don't have to justify every

I mean is scientific illiteracy more

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:33.790
I mean is scientific illiteracy more
 

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.730
I mean is scientific illiteracy more
acceptable than other forms of

probably one of the biggest mistakes we
 

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:19.639
probably one of the biggest mistakes we
as scientists have made because we

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:19.649
as scientists have made because we
 

00:34:19.649 --> 00:34:22.250
as scientists have made because we
haven't communicated the magnitude of

somebody there PhD student and molecular

00:39:02.509 --> 00:39:02.519

biology there are a lot of women in

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680

science now as someone else's pointed

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:06.630
science now as someone else's pointed
 

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.660
science now as someone else's pointed
out and I don't think that there are

out and I don't think that there are
 

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:10.400
out and I don't think that there are
less opportunities for women in science

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:10.410
less opportunities for women in science
 

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:11.900
less opportunities for women in science
I think that if you want to have a

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:11.910
I think that if you want to have a
 

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:13.759
I think that if you want to have a
family on a career that's your choice

00:39:13.759 --> 00:39:13.769
family on a career that's your choice
 

00:39:13.769 --> 00:39:15.559
family on a career that's your choice
and I think that there are many examples

00:39:15.559 --> 00:39:15.569
and I think that there are many examples
 

00:39:15.569 --> 00:39:18.170

may be able to stand table in the future
 

00:39:22.469 --> 00:39:24.410
may be able to stand table in the future
and I I think that the future will

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:24.420
and I I think that the future will
 

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.939
and I I think that the future will
reflect that but I think that the

00:39:25.939 --> 00:39:25.949
reflect that but I think that the
 

00:39:25.949 --> 00:39:29.029

that may not be as much an issue in
 

00:39:43.529 --> 00:39:46.029
that may not be as much an issue in
Sweden but in the United States the

00:39:46.029 --> 00:39:46.039
Sweden but in the United States the
 

00:39:46.039 --> 00:39:48.799
Sweden but in the United States the
individual states have decreased their

think this has been much to the

think this has been much to the
 

00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:03.650

mobility in the United States is now
lower than Europe and that sort of puts

lower than Europe and that sort of puts
 

00:41:38.199 --> 00:41:40.769

it on so we always used to be that

00:41:40.769 --> 00:41:40.779
it on so we always used to be that

getting a position in five years it can
 

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:28.019
getting a position in five years it can
take 15 years and I think this is a huge

00:44:28.019 --> 00:44:28.029
take 15 years and I think this is a huge
 

00:44:28.029 --> 00:44:30.420
