00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.360
Plot points corresponding
to the maxima, minima,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.150
and intersections with the
midline in the graph of y

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.256
is equal to 2 sine
of 1/4 x minus 1.

00:00:09.256 --> 00:00:11.005
And they give us this
neat tool here where

00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:13.900
we can sit here and pick as
many points just by clicking.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.920
We can move the points
around, drag them around.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.350
If we want to get
rid of a point,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.290
we just have to drag
them to the trash.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.951
Now to work through
the math, I've

00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:25.450
copied and pasted this problem
right here on my scratch pad,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.950
and I rewrote the function.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.450
And I want to think
about, when does

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.840
this hit its maximum
points, its minimum points,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.720
and its intersections
with the midline?

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.780
Well this is going to hit
a maximum point whenever

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.920
sine of 1/4 x is maximized.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.580
And when is sine
of 1/4 x maximized?

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.630
Well the maximum value that the
sine function can take on is 1.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.710
So we're dealing with maximum
points whenever sine of 1/4 x

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.880
is equal to 1.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.260
Now what about minimum points?

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.970
Well we're dealing with minimum
points whenever this thing--

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.280
the minimum value that the
sine function can take on

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.420
is negative 1.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.210
So we're hitting minimum
points whenever--

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.680
let me write it here-- so
minimum points whenever sine

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.830
1/4 x hits the minimum value
that the sine function can take

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.510
on, hits the point negative 1.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.540
And of course, when
it hits this point,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.150
we're then going to
multiply it times this 2,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.810
so the maximum value of
this part of expression

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.330
is going to be 2 times 1.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.420
The maximum value of
the whole function

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.700
is going to be 2
times 1 minus 1.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.020
The minimum value is going to
be 2 times negative 1 minus 1.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.750
But we'll get to that.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.510
Now what about when we
intersect the midline?

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.430
We intersect the
midline whenever

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.684
this part of the
function is equal to 0.

00:01:44.684 --> 00:01:46.600
And we're essentially
just left with that part

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.639
right over there.

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:48.930
So let me write this-- midline.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:00.240
And this is going to be 0 when
sine of 1/4 x is equal to 0.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.940
So when do these things happen?

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.620
When does the sine
function hit 1?

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.090
When does the sine
function hit 0?

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.600
When does the sine
function hit negative 1?

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.289
And to think about that, I will
draw ourselves a little unit

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.930
circle to help us
visualize things.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.360
So a little unit circle, I
don't want to make it too little

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.140
so that we can-- so
a little unit circle

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.550
right over there,
that's our y-axis.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.492
That is our x-axis.

00:02:24.492 --> 00:02:25.450
And it's a unit circle.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.940
It's centered at the origin, has
a radius 1-- so just like this.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.640
And this, of course, is
the point negative 1.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.690
Sorry, this is the
point 0, negative 1.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.430
This is the point 1 comma 0.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.240
This is the point 0 comma 1.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.670
This is the point
negative 1 comma 0.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:57.910
Now let's start with
an angle of 0 radians.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.070
So we're going to intersect
the unit circle right

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.340
at that point, at
the point 1 comma 0.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.440
And remember, the
sine evaluated there

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.440
by the unit circle
definition of trig functions

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.220
is going to be the y value.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.430
So we see sine of 0 radians
is equal to 0-- and not just 0

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.580
radians, any integer multiple
of 2 pi plus 0 radians.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.579
So we could add 2 pi.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:23.620
We would go around again.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.160
We would get to the same point.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.951
Add 2 pi again-- well
now we've added 4 pi.

00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:26.710
We go again.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.660
We could subtract 2 pi,
and we're back there again.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.170
So this is going to
happen whenever--

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.440
whatever we input
into the sine function

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.980
is equal to 0 radians plus
some multiple of 2 pi radians.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.950
So when is this going
to be equal to 0?

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.490
Well, when 1/4 x
meets that constraint.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.910
So that's going
to happen whenever

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.350
1/4 x is equal to 0
plus or minus-- I guess

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.610
I could say-- some
multiple of 2 pi.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.330
Note and remember,
all I'm saying here

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.880
is, if you input anything like
this into the sine function,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.060
you're going to be at this
point on the unit circle.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.620
And when you evaluate the
sine of the function at any

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.220
of those points, you
are going to get 0.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.550
Why did I write k here?

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.959
Well this is just
for some integer k.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.019
So this is just saying 0 plus
2 pi, 0 plus 4 pi, 0 plus 6 pi,

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.370
0 minus 2 pi.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.260
This encapsulates all of that.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.590
So let's solve for x.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.320
Well to solve for x, we just
multiply both sides by 4.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.575
We get x is equal
to 4 times 0 is

00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:35.840
0, plus or minus 4 times some
multiple of 2 pi would get us--

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.460
or 4 times 2 pi k is
going to give us 8 pi k.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:47.690
So when x is 0 plus or minus
any integer multiple of 8 pi,

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.520
this whole function is going
to intersect the midline.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.310
Why?

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.270
Because when x is any of these
things, when you input any

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.310
of these x values there,
you multiply it by 1/4,

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.432
you evaluate sine there,
then this whole expression

00:05:01.432 --> 00:05:02.140
is going to be 0.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.075
We're going to hit the
midline, y equals negative 1.

00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:06.700
So let's just go with
the simplest one.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.350
Let's just go with x equals 0.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.960
When x equals 0, all
of the stuff is 0.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.850
y is equal to negative 1.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.110
So we have the midline
right over here. x equals 0.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.620
y is equal to negative 1.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.650
And we're also hitting the
midline right over there.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.460
Now let's think about
a maximum value.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.570
So if we increase
our angle right

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.640
over here all the way
to pi/2 2 radians,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.530
we get to this point
right over here.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.310
Sine hits its maximum
value whenever

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.700
we're taking the sine of pi/2
plus or minus any integer

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.800
multiple of 2 pi.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.500
So this is going to
hit a maximum whenever

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.240
what we input into
the function is

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:56.160
equal to pi/2 plus or minus
some integer multiple of 2 pi.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.240
Well once again,
multiply both sides by 4.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:10.420
You get x is equal to pi/2 times
4 is 2 pi plus or minus 8 pi k.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.744
Now which x value
would we want to do?

00:06:12.744 --> 00:06:14.410
Well and actually,
even in the last one,

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.300
I picked x equals
0 for simplicity.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.237
But if I did x
equals 8 pi or 16 pi,

00:06:19.237 --> 00:06:20.570
those aren't even on this graph.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.849
Or if I want to do x is
equal to negative 8 pi,

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.140
those aren't even on the graph.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.800
So this is actually the only
one that sits on this graph.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.650
Likewise over
here, x equals 2 pi

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.620
is the only one that's
actually on this graph.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.870
If I added 8 pi, I
would go off the graph.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.770
If I did 2 pi minus 8
pi at negative 6 pi,

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.690
that's off the graph.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.580
So I'm going to
do x equals 2 pi.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.410
When x equals 2 pi,
1/4 of 2 pi is pi/2.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.250
Sine of pi.2 we've
already saw is 1.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.346
2 times 1 is 2, minus 1 is 1.

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:59.570
So when x is 2 pi, we're at
the point y is equal to 1.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.310
That is a maximum point.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.750
And then finally-- same
logic for the minimum point.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.520
We need to see when
this 1/4 x hits

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.660
not pi/2, but now negative pi/2.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.630
We could have also picked
3 pi over 2 if we wanted.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:21.850
So negative pi/2 is equal to
negative pi/2 plus or minus

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.960
any integer multiple of 2 pi.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.340
So once again, multiply
both sides times 4.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:34.790
x is equal to negative
2 pi plus or minus

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.210
8 pi-- some integer
multiple of 8 pi.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.110
So once again, the only of these
that's actually on our graph

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.910
is x is equal to negative 2 pi.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.880
When x is equal
to negative 2 pi,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.520
what does our function equal?

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.030
Well, when x is equal
to negative 2 pi, 1/4 x

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.580
is going to be equal
to negative pi/2.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.590
Sine of negative
pi/2 is negative 1.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.010
2 times negative 1 is
negative 2, plus negative 1

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.380
gets us to negative 3.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.210
So it's that point
right over there.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.470
So those are our points.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.970
And if we actually
wanted to graph--

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.800
they just ask us to
graph these points--

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.200
but if we wanted to give a
little bit more texture here,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.260
we could draw the
midline, right over here,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.364
at y is equal to negative 1.

00:08:22.364 --> 00:08:24.030
And if we wanted to
actually try to plot

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.930
this function, or at least
the part that we can graph,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.720
it would look
something like this.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.470
But actually, let's
just get the tool out,

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:37.159
and it would keep going if
we had more real estate.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.530
We're not even plotting
a complete period here,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.950
but let's go back to our
tool and plot these points

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.760
and make sure that
we got it right.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.700
So we want a
point-- that's where

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.430
we intersect at the midline.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.200
This is our minimum point.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.900
That's our maximum point
based on what I just did.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.970
Check the answer.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.000
We got it right.
