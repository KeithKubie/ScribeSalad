00:00:01.882 --> 00:00:04.299
(soft music)

00:00:36.164 --> 00:00:38.331
- I don't know how many
other Jefferson lecturers

00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:39.164
(audience laughs)

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:41.330
put on their Revolutionary War hat,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.330
but I will deliver part of
the lecture with my hat on.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.273
So I'm gonna talk about three things,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.180
and they will get increasingly speculative

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.590
as we move along, so
I'll give you some facts

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.770
about the inequality and globalization

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.520
and the ways that I think
they challenge our democracy,

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:08.640
and then, the most speculative part

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.430
will be how we're gonna
meet these challenges,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.370
or how we can meet them.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.080
And there is Hamilton, actually,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.640
on the $10 bill, and I
thought about putting

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.010
Jefferson, he's on the two dollar bill,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.563
and he's also on the nickel.

00:01:27.784 --> 00:01:31.160
This is basically the
theme I wanna go through.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.160
The threat we see from
inequality is that wealthy people

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.320
can use money to protect their money,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.650
and that was a deep concern
of Mr. Jefferson, indeed,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.990
and then, globalization, the concern is,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.550
it doesn't matter what the state does,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.490
the state can't tax as much,
'cause capital is very mobile,

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.260
so it can't redistribute income

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.260
from the upper income groups
to the lower income groups,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.610
and those are the two principle specters,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.950
that inequality weakens the democracy,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.065
and then even when the government
might wanna do something,

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:15.462
the globalization says, No, you can't.

00:02:15.462 --> 00:02:19.713
And then, the word feudalistic is more

00:02:19.713 --> 00:02:23.703
of a word used in Jefferson's time,

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:27.160
when we think about multi-nationals

00:02:28.423 --> 00:02:29.950
and super wealthy folks making decisions,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.760
and then I had to add in to this quote,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.920
the potential villains in this piece

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.950
are people like many of the academics

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.610
and people at Berkeley, and myself.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.630
It's people who go around the globe

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.690
and are not particularly
tied to the country

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.327
in which they live,
academics are prone to this,

00:02:51.327 --> 00:02:54.180
and so are a lot of multi-national firms.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.530
And I know my university
does not consider itself

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.530
an American university, we
are a global university,

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.620
just the way IBM does not
consider itself an American firm.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.763
And the question is how this
can also weaken the things.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.487
So these are some things just to show you

00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:20.840
the historic and the Jefferson
and we have Hamilton,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.170
and the word here,
aristocracy is not a word

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.100
we use particularly nowadays to refer

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.757
to things but Jefferson's concern,

00:03:31.757 --> 00:03:34.627
"The aristocracy of our
moneyed corporations."

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.883
De Tocqueville was also worried

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:39.190
that we would create this

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.768
permanent inequality and aristocracy.

00:03:43.768 --> 00:03:48.120
Interestingly, Jefferson
was for free trade,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.900
so on the globalization debate,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.362
he would've been for globalization,

00:03:52.362 --> 00:03:55.010
but that was because the fear was

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.700
that tariffs and other
protections from trade

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.030
were gonna strengthen
the moneyed corporations.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.300
The farmers were not moneyed corporations,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.530
they were just the individuals working.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.650
And Hamilton also, and that reflects

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.130
the Hamilton Project that
the Brookings Institution,

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.730
which I'll say more about,
'cause I really saw that

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.861
as very interesting at
a Jefferson lecture.

00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:21.980
But it was not just more
aristocratic things,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.150
it was more expert decisions,
and we now have that,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.380
in large part, the Federal
Reserve will make some decisions

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.677
today and tomorrow,
unelected set of people,

00:04:35.373 --> 00:04:37.120
experts, I personally have great faith

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.960
in that Ben Bernanke will do good things

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.740
and will try to make the best decisions,

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.280
but nonetheless, it's very interesting

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.640
that a lot of how the economy will operate

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.990
over the next, at least short term period,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.990
will depend upon experts, you
could call them aristocratic,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.780
but folks who were certainly not elected

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.260
by anybody in our country,
and then John Jay,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.863
who was part of the
Hamilton gang, or group,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.730
people who own the country
ought to govern it.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.410
That is not very helpful to democracy,

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.343
so we'll now see the double specters.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.350
So this, I'll go very
quickly over the inequality,

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.790
because I think there's
just widespread agreement

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.040
and there can be no arguments about this.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.410
I started off with all the good things

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.970
the US economy's done, and
we've been very successful

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.240
in many ways, and we had excellent growth

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.240
of GDP per capita over the
last, it's 16 years here.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.830
And then the skeleton is
our distribution of income.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.463
We have got an extraordinary
unequal distribution.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.910
So let me give you some figures here,

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.260
just so you see the nature of it.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.260
The figure to the left
is, that's a 90/10 ratio,

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:03.880
that's at the bottom, and at
the top is a GINI coefficient.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.490
90/10 ratio takes the wages of the people

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.960
in the 90th percentile and
divides it by the wages

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.710
of people in the 10th percentile.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.250
It's a measure of labor market.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.640
GINI coefficient is for the
overall income distribution.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.090
The dots are different
countries, advanced countries.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.970
So Japan, Canada, Britain, Germany,

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.520
and we're out there, obviously,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.210
number one in both of those metrics.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.620
The straight lines, the
bar graphs to the right,

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.110
are to me the most remarkable indication

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.050
of how unequal our country is.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.814
The first one is a standard
deviation of log earnings,

00:06:43.814 --> 00:06:46.490
which is an indicator, which
is a measure of earnings.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.790
Inequality, so higher
numbers are more unequal.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.790
So that's a 0.88, that's all Americans.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.980
Then you'd go and you'd take Americans

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.980
who have the same score
on a global literacy test,

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.710
which was done by the
OECD, was done in a lot

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.623
of the, a number of advanced countries.

00:07:10.623 --> 00:07:14.320
And so those are people
with similar abilities,

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.710
at least measured by a literacy score.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.180
And you can narrow that further,

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.710
you can do it by similar ability,

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.238
exactly the same gender,
pretty much the same age,

00:07:26.238 --> 00:07:29.420
you could even look
within broad occupations,

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.200
and you basically will get
similar results to this.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.818
Anybody at Labor Conference who worked

00:07:35.818 --> 00:07:36.920
with earnings distributions, you know

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.670
that you put in all the controls you want

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.850
and you're left with a lot of variability.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.240
And I like thinking about that as,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.690
you have students in
exactly the same class,

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.840
all scoring reasonably well on an exam,

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.720
and look at them 10 years later.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.167
You will see, again, the same degree

00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:58.757
and the same university, I'm
thinking of my own students

00:07:58.757 --> 00:08:01.490
in the 10 year class of
economics at Harvard.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.970
And when they graduate
and go 10 years later,

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.340
you'll have the investment
banker making huge sums,

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.140
you'll have the graduate student

00:08:13.024 --> 00:08:16.060
not making huge sums, as we know,

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.090
and you'll have a just
incredible dispersion.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.410
Then, because of this dataset,

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.640
we were able to get figures
for Germany, all workers,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.500
Netherlands and Sweden,
and the stunning thing

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.530
is the inequality in the US of people

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.540
with the same scores, and I say,

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.810
you could break that down more,

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.820
exceeds the inequality in earnings

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.860
in those three European
countries of everybody.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.730
That's people who can't read
and people who can read.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.367
People in good jobs
and people in bad jobs.

00:08:45.367 --> 00:08:47.420
That's just indication, yeah,

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.360
we're really far out in this inequality.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.633
Then I have some figures
from the CIA World Factbook.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.090
There are other figures I could've chosen,

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.128
but I chose that one because I thought

00:08:59.128 --> 00:09:01.380
some of my conservative
friends might be very critical,

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.400
and I would say, well,
it's from the CIA, guys,

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.500
so what do you expect?

00:09:07.556 --> 00:09:10.140
So there is the GINI coefficients,

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.360
and you know, higher GINI
coefficient is more inequality,

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.380
so India was lower than
I would've expected,

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.640
and maybe the figures are
not so accurate, 0.33,

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.330
China is 0.44, the US is 0.45.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.243
US and China have basically
the same inequality of income.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.460
In the 118 countries for
which the World Factbook

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.160
gave data, the US was 84th.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:43.995
So that's not, that's 84th, is
meaning very low in equality.

00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:47.023
We're very unequal, yeah.

00:09:47.952 --> 00:09:50.440
And the bottom half of
developing countries.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.470
I was stunned at that as
well, but this is all just,

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:58.310
this is that we have a
serious inequality problem

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.750
or issue or facts, at least.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.343
We've also seen, over the last 30 years,

00:10:06.626 --> 00:10:07.750
and 30 years, meaning it's been

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.120
through Republican administrations,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.020
it's been through
Democratic administrations,

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.390
it's not a partisan kind of fact.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.640
The facts aren't partisan, in any case.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.350
And the blue line with the dots

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.670
is the growth of, is the
level of real hourly earnings

00:10:25.256 --> 00:10:28.290
from the series that's the longest

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.180
and the most extensive that we had.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.410
The top line with the little triangles,

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.960
that's productivity growth.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.245
Productivity growth, and
it's all centered around,

00:10:38.245 --> 00:10:41.280
19, I think, 70 was the year I picked,

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.280
for just locking it as 100,
and then it just grows.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.960
You see it just spanning out,

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.880
and you see the productivity
growth has been very good,

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.910
and real wage growth is not.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.230
The intermediate lines
are different measures

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.650
of different real wage serieses.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.540
So there's a number of different series

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.739
that one can look at, some include

00:11:04.739 --> 00:11:09.739
non-wage compensation such
as pensions and healthcare,

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.280
et cetera, but whichever one you pick,

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.810
it's clearly that productivity growth

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.460
has been very good and
none of the real wages

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.440
of American workers
have gone up that much.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.442
So we've had a rising,

00:11:24.442 --> 00:11:28.630
this obviously produces rising inequality.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.410
Well, productivity growth
has helped some people,

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.260
and hopefully these gentlemen

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:39.260
will contribute money to our
university, our universities,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.750
and we'll have a naming
ceremony for this room

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.800
or something, and I don't know how much

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.137
they would change this
from the Jefferson Lecture

00:11:48.137 --> 00:11:51.569
to the Big Bucks Lecture if Mr. Big Bucks

00:11:51.569 --> 00:11:53.430
would give the money, but it's clear

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.800
these people have done extremely well,

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.450
these very wealthy people.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.160
So I wanna give you some extreme views

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.960
of the American income distribution.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:07.170
And the perfect payday, CIOs reap millions

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.060
by landing stock options
when they are most valuable.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.063
Luck, or something else?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.470
Great CEO Pay Heist, you can read them.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.400
And then the one that I was stunned at

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.143
when I saw, in late September 2001,

00:12:22.143 --> 00:12:26.720
right after the World Trade
Center and Pentagon attacks,

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.540
I didn't realize scores
of companies ladled out

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.330
options to executives worth millions.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.210
So they immediately said,
the stock market falls,

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.930
we know it's gonna bounce back

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.850
because right now people are in a panic,

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.460
so what do we do, the first thing we do

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.160
is we give options to ourselves

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.300
dated now that the stock
market is way down.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.950
So this particular gentleman calls it

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.850
sleazeballs and profiteering ghouls,

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.520
is that what business is about?

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.060
And then the last one is another,

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.350
these are very radical statements.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.143
I would regard these as
incredibly extreme statements.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.944
Where are they from?

00:13:03.944 --> 00:13:07.410
You might've been guessing, Jones?

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:11.090
It's the Wall Street
Journal, Fortune magazine,

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.870
the story that had not really,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.480
far as I know, gotten very much attention

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.230
was these executives writing these options

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.070
for themselves right after the attack,

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.650
that was the editor of the
Harvard Business Review,

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.913
and this was on a PBS broadcast.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.080
And then Forbes magazine.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.430
So this is reading of,
prior to what's happened

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.980
in the inequality in the country,

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.320
from, you can't get more conservative

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.580
than these four organizations,

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.990
you know, and conservative
and honest and reputable

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.110
and so on, you know, Forbes,
Fortune, Wall Street Journal,

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.820
exclusive of the editorial page

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.520
is a pretty accurate place,

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.450
and the Harvard Business
Review, that's pretty accurate.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.730
So that's some striking, if I say,

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.280
I don't think there can be any argument

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.902
about what's happened to
the income distribution

00:14:02.902 --> 00:14:07.902
in the country and that
something is awry with this.

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:11.850
And then there's another
radical commentary,

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.530
and this is from Warren Buffett.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:14.800
You may have noticed that he's been making

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.960
a number of comments since he's given away

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.810
his 40 billion dollars or so
to the Bill Gates Foundation,

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.870
or 30 billion, and this
was a statement though,

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.785
he made to his shareholders,

00:14:26.785 --> 00:14:29.570
in which, the best line in this

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.527
is the one right towards the end,

00:14:31.527 --> 00:14:34.477
"If class warfare is
being waged in America,

00:14:34.477 --> 00:14:37.430
"my class is clearly winning."

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.410
And then he goes on and points out

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:45.410
that he paid a lower tax
than his receptionist,

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.310
and of course, what's going on there

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.160
is it's Social Security,
which is top coded,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.355
so you stopped at the
top, and she's paying that

00:14:56.355 --> 00:14:59.240
and he's not, on the margin,
so his marginal tax rate

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.400
is actually lower than
hers, and he's quite upset

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.130
about this, so I think
if we got all these,

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:09.786
the Wall Street Journal, and the Forbes,

00:15:09.786 --> 00:15:11.090
and the Harvard Business Review,

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.189
and we have one of the country's second,

00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:15.150
he was till he gave away all his money,

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.100
a lot of his money, the country's
second wealthiest person.

00:15:21.901 --> 00:15:23.264
You don't have to be very radical

00:15:23.264 --> 00:15:24.240
to say this is a problem.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.340
Okay, so that's my first fact.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.278
And then, what I wanna
do, in the lectures is go,

00:15:30.278 --> 00:15:33.590
we take that as given, if
you want more evidence,

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.450
there's multiple people,
including many economists

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.460
at Berkeley have studied,

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.080
we can just give you that evidence.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.638
And then we wanna, later we'll wanna know

00:15:42.638 --> 00:15:43.970
and say, what does that
mean for our democracy?

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:47.040
It's happened, it's here, we
have a very unequal society.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.180
Now, the globalization.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.580
And so, these are made up quotes.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.340
I didn't search the web
to find business people

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.732
saying this, but certainly,
they say this all the time.

00:15:58.732 --> 00:16:01.133
You can find this very easily.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.870
And I'd said the devil made me do it,

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.780
but what we say is, it's
the market made me do it.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.230
Globalization made me do it.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.380
And the reason is, we got
cheap labor over there,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.002
we can move and how
could I stay in business

00:16:19.002 --> 00:16:24.002
if my competitor moves to
hire the cheaper labor?

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:29.027
And that's a big and
giant issue, a threat.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.420
The globalization, we'll
give couple of facts

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.560
about the globalization, so
we understand where that is.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.460
What we have had in the
1990s and the 2000s,

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:49.156
is basically, post the whole
NAFTA discussion and debate,

00:16:49.156 --> 00:16:54.010
is a huge increase, I called
it the Great Doubling,

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:58.050
because the global workforce
basically doubled in size

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.950
when China and India and
the ex-Soviet joined us.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.250
When China was behind the iron curtain,

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.230
the ex-Soviet were
behind the iron curtain,

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.520
and India still had made its
own curtain around itself

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.480
and didn't really deal
in the global world,

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.480
that meant that basically
1.5 billion workers

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.960
were out of the global capitalist system,

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.170
and so, and there were about 1.5 million

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.990
in the global capitalist system,

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.734
and so the doubling is just about right.

00:17:28.734 --> 00:17:32.380
What happens, any economist will tell you,

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.693
if you increase the labor
force by twice as much,

00:17:35.693 --> 00:17:40.058
and don't increase the
capital stock by that much,

00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:43.610
you are going to have
a shift in market power

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.670
towards capital, and I
just phrased it here as

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.573
it's more difficult for
market forces to help workers.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.170
Now those, I'm thinking now of workers

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.830
in the already advanced

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.320
or the capital war world, in our world.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.909
Obviously, this is extraordinarily good

00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:04.670
for the Chinese and the Indians,

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.630
and it would be great for the ex-Soviets,

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.080
if they, even, they get their
act together reasonably,

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.690
and I know that's, they've
had more troubles I think,

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.530
but the ones, the countries
that have joined the EU,

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.890
certainly, are gonna be
doing very very well in the,

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.530
Poland, for instance, was
one of the larger ones,

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.294
is doing very very well.

00:18:24.294 --> 00:18:26.870
So we have this globalization,

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.130
which suddenly, it's
not just globalization,

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.680
it's globalization with
people who have much lower

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.133
capital labor ratios than we have.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.010
And we have global capital flow,

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.805
so it just moves overseas.

00:18:39.805 --> 00:18:41.930
And then, I think it's more important

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.470
what's going on in our sector, actually,

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:48.450
or as important, is
many of these countries,

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.270
and particularly China, but India as well,

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.890
and Brazil, and you just
go down the country list

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.720
and you see this, they've
made large investments

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.103
in university education.

00:18:59.198 --> 00:19:02.130
So we see many graduate students

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:06.200
from foreign countries
here, a big reason for that

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.990
is that there're many
many more undergraduates

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.240
in foreign countries than
there were 20 years ago.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.530
So if we thought that
bringing these countries

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:22.120
into our, the same
global, capitalist world

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.970
was gonna mean that they did all the,

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.690
those guys do all the low level work,

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.570
they make the shoes, and we
do all the educated work,

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.840
which was the promise, you may remember,

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.470
of the NAFTA debate.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.108
NAFTA was, we get to get
all the education stuff,

00:19:38.108 --> 00:19:42.792
we're gonna shift over the
bad jobs to the Mexicans.

00:19:42.792 --> 00:19:46.870
Well, nobody bothered to ask the Mexicans,

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.510
who also increased their
education system a lot.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:51.000
The Indians, or the Chinese

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.096
who are sitting there saying hmm.

00:19:53.096 --> 00:19:56.350
Higher education seems
to be really important

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.960
in modern economic life, here
are these multi-nationals,

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.920
you can get a job with IBM, with Cisco,

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.910
whatever it is, get your skills.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.770
So they've made a huge
investment in higher education,

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.610
and the multi-nationals are
spreading modern technology.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.780
If you go back to the 50s and 60s,

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.520
the vision of globalization would've been,

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.760
we have a monopoly of modern technology,

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.270
those other guys are using old old stuff,

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.920
and our workers,
therefore, have a big edge.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.490
We have a big edge in capital,

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.410
and we have a big edge in technology.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.250
And that, both are going away,
and so we see the results.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.300
Lotta trade, offshore and the
immigration tech transfers,

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.260
not of the kind that they promised us

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.780
during the NAFTA debate.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:44.780
That's just fact, I think,
and people worry about this.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.539
Now, I put unless we screw up,

00:20:49.539 --> 00:20:54.522
I tend to be very favorable
to the globalization.

00:20:54.522 --> 00:20:57.560
I think we got about 40, 50 years,

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.981
in which these countries
have gotta come up quickly

00:21:00.981 --> 00:21:04.030
and grow rapidly and their wages go up,

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.980
and it's a transition to
where they are gonna be

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.476
comparable to us in their education,

00:21:10.476 --> 00:21:13.650
in their use of technology, and so on,

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.020
and I think everybody, for the sake

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.450
of the vast bulk of humanity,
everybody should have access

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.690
to modern technology,
everybody should have

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.410
capitalist market economies,

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:27.200
because that's what works and
the other things don't work,

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.460
and they should all
have advanced education.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.270
But if they're all gonna get that,

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:34.270
it's gonna be, they're
starting from very low wages,

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.683
these places, it's gonna be an interesting

00:21:36.683 --> 00:21:40.490
and difficult transition, I
think it's a transition process.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.420
And I say it through trade
and all these things.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.070
What has happened, and interestingly,

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.810
is global economic
inequality has declined.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.110
It's declined fairly substantially

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.173
since the 19, basically 1990.

00:21:54.072 --> 00:21:57.540
Since these countries have
joined the modern world,

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.230
if I can phrase it that way.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.690
Basically, it's because China and India

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.840
have had such rapid
growth rates, nine, 10%,

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.670
well, for China and India, six, 7%.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.967
The very poorest people in the world,

00:22:12.967 --> 00:22:14.420
and the people in China and India

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.320
had lower incomes per head
than the people in Africa,

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.440
on average, and than the
Latin Americans, certainly.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.790
So they moved up, the
very bottom moved up.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.030
At the same time, within every country,

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.280
I exaggerate, within most countries,

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.280
just like the chart, and
the chart's more accurate

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.080
than I am, inequality has gone up.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.510
And I want to point out that's
not strictly globalization,

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.470
that's not the only cause,
lotsa things going on.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:46.173
I mentioned the change in
unionization has gotten weaker.

00:22:46.173 --> 00:22:48.817
But during the period of globalization,

00:22:48.817 --> 00:22:50.933
within country, inequality has risen.

00:22:51.849 --> 00:22:53.600
It's rose in the US, it's risen in China.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.110
It's just been rising over
the last five, six years,

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.048
very sharply, in Germany.

00:22:59.048 --> 00:23:02.780
It had risen in England earlier.

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:06.520
It's just across the world we see that,

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.260
which is an interesting phenomenon

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.910
if you start thinking about
the political aspect of this.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.030
The world is getting less unequal

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.360
because the poorest people are coming up,

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.170
but within every country,
including those countries,

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.640
inequality is getting bigger,

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.940
and that creates, I
think, interesting issues.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.831
Now, I wanna point out, there's one thing

00:23:28.831 --> 00:23:31.000
that didn't come out on this slide.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.620
The telephone call
there, wherever that is.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.480
It's a change, it means change, different.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.513
On my computer it came out
as a little Greek delta.

00:23:42.636 --> 00:23:45.620
The US, and it could
just, that's just the US.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.739
We could pick Australia, Canada,

00:23:48.739 --> 00:23:51.650
Britain, all the advanced countries,

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.600
but we try to focus on the US.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.670
We grew greatly during this period,

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.750
so between 1990 and 2006, I show you,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:02.005
our GDP per capita, in
purchasing power parity

00:24:02.005 --> 00:24:04.053
is 1.9%, China grew at 8.9%.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.870
So he says to me, "Oh my god,
China's really doing better."

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.470
But then I show you the
absolute dollar amount

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.740
of what that growth amounted to,

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.550
and we actually had, basically
twice as rapid of growth

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:20.854
in real GDP per capita as China.

00:24:20.854 --> 00:24:22.950
And the reason, of course, for that is

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.710
that China had such a low level of income

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:27.230
at the beginning that even though

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.610
they're growing much more rapidly than us,

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:34.610
that actually added less
real income to China.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:42.250
So, we had a lot of income
that we could distribute.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.610
Had we distributed the GDP per capita

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:52.090
over this period evenly,
everybody's income gone up

00:24:53.103 --> 00:24:54.870
a percentage thing, or
if we had done it evenly,

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.000
excuse me, just in lump sums to people,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.470
we could've given every family $11,300.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:02.300
That's what we bid, and the question was,

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.310
how do we distribute it,
and we've already seen,

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.730
we did not distribute it
remotely evenly among families

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.460
or among individuals, that's
per capita, individual.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.250
And then I said, we've remained a mecca

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.400
for immigrants, skilled and unskilled.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.195
So, my view is that globalization

00:25:19.195 --> 00:25:24.195
is certainly not harming
the US economy writ broadly.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:28.780
It is probably contributing
somewhat to the rise

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:33.780
of inequality, and therefore,

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.720
it's something that we can deal with

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.180
if we deal with our own problems.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.970
I wouldn't wanna be blaming
the Chinese or the Indians.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.890
There's Tom Jefferson
again, and I don't know,

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:48.030
some of you people may
remember the guy over there.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:51.267
And you might say, what that is,

00:25:51.267 --> 00:25:53.440
is a current American student.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.630
If you've read a lot of the reports

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.440
about American students not doing well

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.410
and da da da da da, turns out,

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.170
the most recent look at that
says that American students,

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:05.600
they're not reading Mad
Magazines in their high schools.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.890
They may not be as
intellectual as Tom Jefferson,

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:09.040
but they're doing fine.

00:26:12.109 --> 00:26:14.029
At the same point that we've
had this globalization,

00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:17.133
labor standards around
the world have gone up.

00:26:18.053 --> 00:26:19.791
You've all heard about race to the bottoms

00:26:19.791 --> 00:26:22.130
of the globalization, one of my themes

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:27.130
is gonna be globalization is
not the cause of problems.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.970
The cause of problems is
something internal to us

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:32.900
and therefore internal to our politics.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.140
It's how we're dealing
with something that is,

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:39.330
has not affected, yeah, our
GDP growth's been excellent,

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.210
it's just who it goes to.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.280
You say, well, there's gonna
be these race to the bottoms,

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.703
it turns out, no there isn't.

00:26:45.703 --> 00:26:47.753
We've got now, very good evidence,

00:26:47.753 --> 00:26:49.951
there were a set of experiments

00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:52.670
by one of my colleagues in
the Government Department,

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:55.480
Michael Hiscox, who's been auctioning off

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.720
coffee on the web, and
then he's auctioning off

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.070
T-shirts on eBay, and he finds,

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.240
definitely, people are
willing to pay more money

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.570
if you can guarantee something

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:06.440
is made under good conditions.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.460
So he has things made
under good conditions,

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.340
and then he removes the
labels on some of it

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.060
and sells it without that label,

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.610
and you see it's worth about 20, 25% more

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.350
people are willing to pay for this.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.427
They're making such good money doing this

00:27:20.427 --> 00:27:22.330
that I think his graduate student

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:24.268
may be leaving the university

00:27:24.268 --> 00:27:28.209
to sell good products on the web,

00:27:28.209 --> 00:27:30.617
set up an internet store.

00:27:30.617 --> 00:27:33.612
Similarly, I give the example of Nike,

00:27:33.612 --> 00:27:36.340
when they were targeted by activists

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:40.560
and they were very very
rough nasty company

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.940
in many ways, they've done
a complete about face,

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.580
so now they're very good.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.212
And China's introduced a new labor law.

00:27:47.212 --> 00:27:49.520
The only country I know that has reduced

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.310
its labor standards
during this period of time

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.630
is Australia, and on November,

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.640
I think it's 24th or 26th, if
there's some Australians here

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.880
you would know the date, John
Howard will be out of office,

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.191
precisely because he
introduced a labor law

00:28:05.191 --> 00:28:09.037
that reduced the standards
of Australian workers.

00:28:09.037 --> 00:28:12.660
And it's the only time I
know where a labor law thing

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.190
is turning over a prime minister.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:17.760
And he's just lost the, whatever it is

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.170
that the Australians felt, faith in him.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:26.170
So this globalization does
not, driving us down and so on.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.220
And we have these two
facts, rising inequality

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:33.550
and we have globalization,
and the globalization,

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:36.040
our income's gone up, it's just gone

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.470
to some people and not others,

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:40.730
labor standards, not only in
the US but around the world

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.630
have not been driven down by this,

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.555
indeed, they're going
up in lots of countries.

00:28:44.555 --> 00:28:49.555
Now, what is the question
for the democracy?

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.710
And that truly is the
Jeffersonian question for this.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:56.680
And I put, the challenge,
it's to democracy

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.520
and to what I think of
as how well we manage

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.426
this 40 to 50 year transition.

00:29:02.426 --> 00:29:04.535
40, 50 years, what I say,

00:29:04.535 --> 00:29:05.853
what is that number outta your hat?

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.070
Change hats for the moment.

00:29:11.647 --> 00:29:13.440
But, no it isn't, if it's based,

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.470
one, upon very simple modeling

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:21.210
of and the analysis of how
quickly Chinese growth is

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:24.510
and what point they will
reach a level relative to ours

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.300
if they keep growing very rapidly,

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.470
and India, and then it is based upon

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:33.130
how long it took Japan and
Korea to get up to the level.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.600
Korea was the poorest country in the world

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.300
after the Korean War,
they had no resources

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.483
and they just hard work and,

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.860
and education, really, is what made Korea,

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.239
and some US help, but
Korea did a lot of things

00:29:47.239 --> 00:29:51.890
on their own, and so the
best you could hope for

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.840
in a country that started very poor

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.420
is in 40, 50 years they can
get up to the first rank

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.613
of places, so this is the
challenge to democracy.

00:30:00.978 --> 00:30:03.070
And I'm gonna give you some
evidence in a little of these,

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:07.350
if you're not wealthy, it turns out

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.143
people who are not wealthy vote less.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:16.040
You've got less chance of getting elected,

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.400
less chance of having influence,

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.560
and that means something,
I gave a talk recently

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.120
and some more radicalish person than I,

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.970
jumped on me for having
said that US GDP growth

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:29.820
was very good, which it has been.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.717
And then he said, "Well, what
difference does that make?

00:30:32.717 --> 00:30:34.887
"Most people haven't had
real income increases,

00:30:34.887 --> 00:30:37.100
"or had very small real income increases."

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.220
And then, that is the point here.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.913
You got growth of GDP,
which economists like,

00:30:43.201 --> 00:30:44.473
the privileges that we should see,

00:30:44.473 --> 00:30:46.020
good growth of GDP, that's
what we always look for,

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:48.725
for the papers, and it
can be very different

00:30:48.725 --> 00:30:50.220
than growth of citizen wellbeing.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.860
And that's partly the story of the US

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.770
over the last, I think, 30 years.

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:57.550
And, I said, in reducing
the scope for government

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:02.550
to operate, and if we go
through this transition period

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.060
of adjusting to China and
India catching up with us

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.780
in education, catching
up with us in technology,

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.610
catching up with us in lots of stuff,

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:14.900
can be a very difficult transition

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.940
without, I think, democratic oversight

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.482
and I call it the fair
distribution of benefits and costs,

00:31:20.482 --> 00:31:22.360
which is important.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.231
I'll talk about the
inequality in politics.

00:31:25.231 --> 00:31:29.790
In voting, we've had a generally,

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.590
turnout has dropped over time.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:33.710
It came up a little bit
in the last election,

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:36.350
and hopefully it'll be
higher in the next election.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.880
But, in fact, there was a large drop

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:43.513
in turnout over the period, '64-2000,

00:31:43.513 --> 00:31:46.280
and the drop was really big among

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.890
less educated people
and lower paid people.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:53.560
So today, we have a more unevenly,

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.240
inequality in voting has increased.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.820
Now here you might say, well,
it's just, it's their choice.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.588
Everyone says the less
educated decided not to vote

00:32:02.588 --> 00:32:07.394
and the lower paid decided not to vote.

00:32:07.394 --> 00:32:10.480
And what can we do about that?

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.060
Well, there are things
we could do about it,

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.189
and I think some, many of the states

00:32:14.189 --> 00:32:17.640
are trying to do things, I
think it's been a fair effort

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.410
by many of our states, but right now,

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:22.187
the voting has shifted from what it was

00:32:22.187 --> 00:32:26.750
in the 1960s, so more and
more, disproportionately,

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.410
the number of the voters,
tend to be higher educated,

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:33.220
which some of us here might like,

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.600
then I just got some counts
on how many millionaires

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.135
there were in the Senate and the House.

00:32:38.135 --> 00:32:39.920
There were two different counts,

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.378
so I don't know if the Senate's 44 or 50.

00:32:42.378 --> 00:32:46.590
There's the House, and then
I put in different things,

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.200
but it's been worse in US history.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.360
We have a history of our
leaders being way wealthier

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.650
than the average citizen.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:56.740
Abe Lincoln was very
strange in that sense.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.640
And then we've had some
political campaigns,

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.570
both by Democrats and Republicans,

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.610
remember Mr. Bloomberg who's been on,

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:06.472
who's now an independent,
where Mr. Corzine,

00:33:06.472 --> 00:33:09.390
the governor, he was senator now governor

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.150
of New Jersey, basically bought

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:13.430
the state of New Jersey election.

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:16.250
And he's a Goldman-Sachs ex-executive,

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:20.030
and he decided he wanted
to become senator.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:23.190
So, he spent whatever,
60 million, 80 million,

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.900
100 million, whatever it
was, and anybody wants

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.738
to run against him has got a real problem.

00:33:28.738 --> 00:33:33.720
Mr. Kohl is the senator from Wisconsin,

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.277
and he says to the voters, "Don't worry,

00:33:36.277 --> 00:33:38.067
"I'm so rich I'm not taking any money,

00:33:38.067 --> 00:33:40.517
"so I'm gonna do whatever
I want for you people."

00:33:43.403 --> 00:33:45.044
And well that's defined.

00:33:45.044 --> 00:33:47.010
And Mr. Bloomberg, we know,
spent huge sums of money

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:49.070
and there was one point earlier this year,

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:50.790
some discussion, he
could run for president

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:53.080
because he could just write a check

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.478
for one or two billion dollars.

00:33:55.478 --> 00:33:56.980
And if you have a one or
two billion dollar campaign,

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.105
you would outspend both political parties.

00:33:59.105 --> 00:34:02.759
And that's a big thing.

00:34:02.759 --> 00:34:05.950
And one of the interesting things

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:10.713
is when people spend, well, in politics,

00:34:10.713 --> 00:34:11.620
they spend a lot of time seeking funds,

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.230
and we look at the contributions,

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:17.250
it's clear, a lotta rich
people and a lotta companies

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.920
regard that as a really good investment.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.240
So there's an economics question,

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.560
how come they're not spending more money

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.860
on these elections, because, in fact,

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:29.840
the return you get from being close

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.620
to the White House when the government

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:35.070
starts giving away contracts and so on,

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.841
that really pays off.

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:39.070
So I say, economics are things,

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:41.590
how come the politicians
aren't charging more money,

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.882
or the campaigns aren't more expensive

00:34:43.882 --> 00:34:46.800
than they would be?

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.050
Well, this is an American history,

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:51.310
it's not quite Jefferson's time,

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.570
but what the heck, it's
old enough to show,

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:56.700
and this is, you may
not be able to read it,

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.980
it says, None but millionaires need apply,

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.670
and it's called The Coming
Style of Presidential Election.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:07.800
And so, all the rich
millionaires are saying,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.700
I wanna run for president,
I wanna run for president,

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.735
and of course, if you do
wanna run for president,

00:35:12.735 --> 00:35:17.660
and you do not have 100
million or 500 million

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:21.740
or something, gee, you wanna think twice.

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.928
You better find someone
with that kind of money,

00:35:23.928 --> 00:35:27.470
'cause it is clear that this has become

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:31.405
a very much of a rich person's game.

00:35:31.405 --> 00:35:35.238
Now, since the Halloween, I
give you the monster over there,

00:35:35.238 --> 00:35:39.020
this is how many lobbyists we have.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:44.020
K Street, 35,000 registered
lobbyists, et cetera,

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.880
and then, the way to understand

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.840
how interlinked this is with our politics,

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.754
43% of the guys who left Congress,

00:35:53.754 --> 00:35:57.400
and I don't have, since,
it says since 1998,

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:02.400
so that's pretty recently,
so probably it's just 2005,

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.993
2006 number, they became lobbyists.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:12.500
So, what you do, is you get into Congress,

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.130
you're likely to be a millionaire,

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:18.150
or certainly, you're certainly
dependent on rich folks,

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.970
and then when you leave,
you become a lobbyist.

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:22.140
And so, you start thinking, well,

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.530
that's the way they think
democracy should be operating,

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.133
with these kind of characters?

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.700
Now, I've got no strong evidence

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:32.370
that, of course, they're
doing crooked or bad things,

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.210
but we, I think we've
heard of some of these guys

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:36.810
in K Street, and we know some

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.083
of them have been caught and et cetera.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.570
And then, there's the list of how many

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:47.017
of the former members or heads
of agencies were lobbyists.

00:36:48.031 --> 00:36:50.620
American people believe
lobbyists have too much power,

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.588
believe it's common for them
to bribe members of Congress.

00:36:53.588 --> 00:36:55.528
I don't think that's that frequent

00:36:55.528 --> 00:37:00.528
or because, I think it's
been one California guy

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.580
and somebody from Ohio have been caught

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.083
in real bribe kinds of
stuff, but it's much more

00:37:05.083 --> 00:37:07.010
when you get all those huge contributions

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.962
to your political campaign
that are presumably legal,

00:37:09.962 --> 00:37:13.260
but that clearly affects
your, what you do.

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:17.680
And people can, worried about
corruption in Washington.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.720
So money has clearly played
a substantial role in this.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:26.720
We then have our own world,
and I don't know what,

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.410
how much Berkeley or the
citizens of California,

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:34.363
whether you could change your name,

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:38.690
if some million-billionaire
offered you enough money,

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:40.450
I list here a bunch of foundations,

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:45.450
they were informed, basically
reflect very favorable

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:49.000
to wealthy folks, they're
right, right winged foundations.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.730
I've taken money from Smith
Richardson Foundation,

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:55.157
and I have worked for
the Heritage and the AEI,

00:37:56.127 --> 00:37:59.180
so I don't wanna, that may be good

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.670
or bad about these foundations,

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:03.690
the Ascherman Professorship,
which is what I hold,

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:06.080
was originally, this
title of the professorship

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.920
was for the preservation of capitalism

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.500
and defeat of European
social welfare states,

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.680
and we had to explain to
the man giving the money

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.540
that really the university,
this was not the appropriate

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:23.270
title of the professorship,
and I tried to explain

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.410
to the man giving the
money that the one thing

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:28.040
he should absolutely never allow,

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.650
do the university to
give this professorship

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:33.750
to an existing professor,
'cause what he wanted

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.043
was somebody to do empirical work

00:38:36.043 --> 00:38:38.800
but from a fairly
conservative perspective.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.157
And I say, "If they give it to somebody

00:38:41.157 --> 00:38:43.427
"on the professorial, we'll
just go off and hire some

00:38:43.427 --> 00:38:47.267
"mathematical economist, and
we'll just shift the resources,

00:38:47.267 --> 00:38:49.710
"so you can't ever let them give you."

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:52.980
I left for a year and
in that period of time,

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.290
the university dean got to have,

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:56.707
and lo and behold, I
was called up and said,

00:38:56.707 --> 00:38:57.667
"Oh, you're the professor."

00:38:57.667 --> 00:39:00.230
And I said, "But I'm not
what this guy really wants."

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:02.130
He says, "Don't worry, we fooled him."

00:39:03.395 --> 00:39:07.620
And now we can appoint
some mathematical economist

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.610
who would previously have been the money

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.520
that went for my chair.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.730
But point is, this has
been a big movement,

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:17.510
so that when you have wealth,

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:20.190
it doesn't simply buys politicians,

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:24.190
and buys, in a, I don't mean
it in the bribery sense,

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:25.840
it also affects universities.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.410
And it affects think tanks
and it affects professorships,

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.410
because they give you lots of money.

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:34.050
So money tends to do that.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:37.170
Now, we bring the Hamilton Project,

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:40.050
in which the, I
understand, I've worked on,

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.120
and I've got a paper, and
I may have a second paper

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.988
coming along in the Hamilton Project.

00:39:43.988 --> 00:39:48.548
This, I found in checking
Jefferson and Hamilton

00:39:48.548 --> 00:39:51.500
on the internet, this popped up.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:56.230
And this, poor Tom's grave, and supposedly

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:59.540
he's turning over in his grave
on this Hamilton Project.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.410
So, I apologize to him.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:06.590
And what the Hamilton Project is,

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:08.620
is according to this particular critic,

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:11.791
a thinly veiled pursuit of
moving party policymaking

00:40:11.791 --> 00:40:16.200
from the grassroots of
voter primaries and caucuses

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.113
to the golden financial
roots of Manhattan.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.920
Meaning, the Hamilton Project is funded

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.903
by Wall Street money,
which I believe it is,

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:27.949
and it is an effort of,

00:40:27.949 --> 00:40:32.240
basically conservative Democratic groups

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.750
to influence politics
and political outcomes

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.710
in the directions that they would like,

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:40.690
and I think it is correct

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:42.670
that the naming it after Hamilton,

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:46.020
I said, "Gee, is he a great
icon of the Democratic party?"

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.200
The history is, of course, he was not,

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.260
he was the opposition
to the Democratic party.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:54.486
He was the Federalist party.

00:40:54.486 --> 00:40:58.590
And this particular gentleman
who was a very distinguished

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:02.590
analyst of US politics, Kevin Phillips,

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.820
just thought this was awful.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:09.560
So I apologized to Tom
Jefferson for doing,

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.942
for the paper that he was referring to,

00:41:11.942 --> 00:41:14.390
but to be clear, it was a paper

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:17.995
for redistribution of
income to graduate students

00:41:17.995 --> 00:41:21.143
and not towards the money elite.

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:26.090
And I took a lot of flak from
the Hamilton Project people

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.770
as to why we just
shouldn't hire immigrants

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:29.890
to do the science and engineering,

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:32.656
why should Americans be
doing this, this work?

00:41:32.656 --> 00:41:34.620
And I thought, maybe in
the back of their heads

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.310
is they want all the bright Americans

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:37.880
to get in work for Wall Street firms,

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.420
they don't want any
competition offered to them,

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:43.040
I don't know, so that's the, this thing.

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.135
And then I just think
of, if it's the level

00:41:46.135 --> 00:41:49.950
of the way in which money can
incredibly affect policies.

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:51.550
I had this nightmare.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.560
Oh, I suppose I shoulda
just put some cartoon,

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.583
some Halloween things there.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:58.550
Think Bill Gates, he's done wonderful.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:01.750
I think he's, the Gates
Foundation is just wonderful,

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:05.400
they're spending money probably
faster than they should,

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.350
but they have to under tax laws,

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:08.183
they're doing great things,

00:42:08.183 --> 00:42:10.540
but just imagine if he had different view.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:15.373
If he took 40 billion dollars
to fund policy and research

00:42:15.373 --> 00:42:18.620
focused on preserving wealth?

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.713
He could've, there's no
question, he could've done that.

00:42:23.356 --> 00:42:24.650
Via control of the media, he coulda said,

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.430
Rupert Murdoch, you're a left wing creep.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:30.090
I'm gonna buy CBS and NBC.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:32.810
And I'm gonna have, really show people

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:34.888
what they should think.

00:42:34.888 --> 00:42:39.270
He could've set up a
university that would destroy

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:43.063
Harvard and Berkeley, Gates University.

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:45.620
He would've offered every professor

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.359
half a million dollars, and
we'd all be gone, out the door,

00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:54.359
and et cetera, and this
could've incredibly affected,

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:58.750
their level of power that
exists with the moneys

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.970
is just, to me, remarkable,

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:02.650
intellectual debate and policy.

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:05.010
Thank goodness, he has not done that,

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:09.610
and he has done, his
foundation does not do that,

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:12.090
but that's certainly a danger we would've,

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:14.290
that would exist, and
some next billionaire,

00:43:15.281 --> 00:43:16.260
who knows what the next multi billionaire

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.923
will decide to do with their money?

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.252
I should say, just make one comment,

00:43:22.252 --> 00:43:24.520
about the American multi-billionaires,

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.930
when I was in Australia,
excuse me, Argentina,

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:29.307
Argentina's doing very badly, and I said,

00:43:29.307 --> 00:43:32.487
"Where is the Ross Perot of Argentina?

00:43:32.487 --> 00:43:34.107
"Where is the businessman who thinks

00:43:34.107 --> 00:43:35.687
"he can save the country?"

00:43:35.687 --> 00:43:37.280
And in Argentina, they looked at me

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.657
and they said, "In Argentina,
you don't use money

00:43:40.657 --> 00:43:43.297
"to get politics, as you do in the US.

00:43:43.297 --> 00:43:46.937
"In Argentina, you get into
politics to make money."

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.640
And that's a different thing.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.230
And then I give a
statement that shocked me,

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:55.400
'cause I was telling one of my friends

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.188
I was giving this talk here, and I said,

00:43:57.188 --> 00:43:58.757
"Hey, what do you think about da da da,"

00:43:58.757 --> 00:44:01.427
and he first said, "Oh, you've gotta quote

00:44:01.427 --> 00:44:03.100
"Jean Jacques Rousseau."

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:06.450
And I said, "Does Jefferson
know very much about Rousseau?"

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:09.937
And he said, "Well, Jefferson,
needed to read French."

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.150
It turns out, Jefferson did not think

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:15.510
all that much of
Rousseau, but nonetheless,

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:18.930
this is a statement
about how money gets in,

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:22.543
and then the stunning thing
is they pay mercenary troops,

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:27.267
and then at the bottom,
this friend of mine said,

00:44:27.267 --> 00:44:29.187
"Do you know there's
more private contractors

00:44:29.187 --> 00:44:31.570
"in Iraq than US military personnel?"

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.810
I said, "That can't possibly be true."

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:36.310
And so he sent me the site,
I give the site to you,

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:37.790
and then you get the numbers.

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:39.770
The contractors, by the
way, were all being paid

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:43.257
out of taxpayer money, these
are the Blackstone guys

00:44:43.257 --> 00:44:45.451
and the independents, and boy,

00:44:45.451 --> 00:44:48.170
that's mercenary troops, more mercenaries

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:51.900
than American soldiers, and
they cost us more money,

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.860
as far as what one can see.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.471
So you just sorta sit
there and you just wonder,

00:44:55.471 --> 00:44:58.990
I will put down money
that we will find out

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:00.730
that the Blackstone
guys and a lot of these

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:03.179
private contractors
made large contributions

00:45:03.179 --> 00:45:07.310
to the political parties, probably more

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:10.930
to the Republicans, and this is the US

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:12.900
having a mercenary army out there,

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.790
which fits with the Rousseau stuff.

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:19.100
That's bad, okay, so I
think there is a challenge

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:22.163
in the politics to this.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.600
I imagine you know, it occurs,
you have young Abe Lincoln

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.900
there, and he's saying, Dad or mom,

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:31.610
can I run for president?

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:35.030
And what advice would you
give young Abe Lincoln?

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:37.690
I would say, go to Wall Street,

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:41.513
get yourself a partnership
in Goldman-Sachs.

00:45:41.513 --> 00:45:44.880
Make a few billion, and then, yes, son.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.930
Anyone can run for president,

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:50.150
as long as they have that kind of money.

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.340
And then I would say,
of course, you could,

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.480
if you wanted to, go around
and spend all your time

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.220
as a politician, getting
money from the wealthy folks

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.840
and that really drives
some politicians mad

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.390
that they spend all their time doing that.

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:05.180
So it has to be corroding our democracy.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.329
Okay, so now I'm gonna
give you some solutions.

00:46:07.329 --> 00:46:10.790
I called it first The Jefferson Way.

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:12.803
Jefferson was a big states rights guy,

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.690
and he was against the
national government.

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:17.540
Hamilton was for national government.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.980
I've been working on some
things with some colleagues,

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.320
something we call progressive federalism,

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.350
which is very much states' rights,

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:29.220
and see, then I will talk
about the other things,

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:32.858
the shared capitalism, so
these are my solutions,

00:46:32.858 --> 00:46:35.623
if I can phrase it
right to this challenge.

00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:40.020
Oh, and then I pointed out, I
didn't bring that hat with me.

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.210
He was a member of the
secret club called Flat Hat.

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:45.670
I do have a Flat Hat, but
I just didn't carry it

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:47.670
with me on the airplane.

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:49.830
'Kay, what do I mean by states rights?

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:52.075
You don't normally think of as a solution

00:46:52.075 --> 00:46:56.320
to inequality problems
or things like that,

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.280
globalization, and so I'll give you

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:02.333
what I think are the
positive things about this.

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.403
Most social services are state,

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:11.820
there's a lot of diversity,
and I think it is great

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.990
that California has chosen
some energy policies

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:18.363
that the state of
Arkansas does not choose.

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.220
We don't wanna be locked
in, everybody's gotta do

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.460
exactly the same thing,
the states have done well

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.098
at delivering services, experimentation,

00:47:28.098 --> 00:47:30.210
and then the fifth one
is something I don't know

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:32.163
of any real evidence for,

00:47:32.163 --> 00:47:33.210
but it's an interesting proposition,

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:36.400
'cause you notice that Republican
governors and legislatures

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.490
in states often make what seem to be

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:42.360
more rational decisions,
thoughtful decisions,

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.470
than the administration in Washington.

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:48.462
And you sorta sit there
and say, well, why is that?

00:47:48.462 --> 00:47:53.462
Well, I think ideology
gets lost a little bit

00:47:53.477 --> 00:47:57.270
when you're dealing with real
problems at a state level.

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:00.297
Whereas in Washington, you can
have ideology running wild,

00:48:00.297 --> 00:48:03.940
but I have no real evidence for that.

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:05.370
This is just a listing of states

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:08.823
that have enacted progressive
laws as of March 2007.

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:14.610
So states rights as a
vehicle for preserving

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:17.560
Democratic things,
minimum wage laws we know,

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.990
they've been widely studied, indeed,

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:22.820
that's been the heart
of our great increase

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.190
in knowledge that minimum wage laws

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:27.340
don't have much effect on employment,

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:29.734
and that's because states have this right.

00:48:29.734 --> 00:48:34.260
But state supplements the federal EITC,

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:37.600
renewable energy, you go
down the list of legislation

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.150
and of things, and the
governor of California

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:40.720
has been very good at this, of course,

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:45.720
pushing with world leaders
for energy and energy things,

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:50.390
and in my state before he, Mr. Romney,

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:53.730
who has a medical, or with
the Democratic legislature

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:56.740
passed the medical plan, which he now,

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:59.620
I think, thinks is socialistic and evil

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:01.580
and he was never really in the state,

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:06.580
and it wasn't him who
signed the bill and so on,

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:10.717
but notice these are, we
have much bigger set of this,

00:49:10.717 --> 00:49:13.140
and it just lists the states
that have done things.

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:14.820
Now the interesting is what

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.380
the national response to this is.

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:21.450
And the, limiting the healthcare program,

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:24.010
okay, they don't want to
pass anymore spending on it,

00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:26.000
but they're also using as
many administered rules

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.630
as they can to limit healthcare.

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:35.140
So we do know that in
one sense, the states

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.270
are actually a bulwark for democracy

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:39.400
against, would have been
a federal government

00:49:40.787 --> 00:49:42.607
that has not been good.

00:49:42.607 --> 00:49:46.380
And then, these are just
remarkable, I think.

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.540
The key doctrine that the
federal government uses

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:51.990
to limit state democracy,
and therefore, I think,

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:55.280
to limit all of our democracy
is federal preemption.

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:59.130
Federal preemption means
that you can't do anything

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:01.530
once the federal government
has stepped into an area.

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:04.120
And what we've seen in
the last several years,

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:07.084
it's come to an end, 2000,
with the change in election,

00:50:07.084 --> 00:50:10.180
the Democratics winning,
we've seen that Republicans

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:13.480
who supposedly are
devoted to, conservatives

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.670
who are supposedly
devoted to states rights

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:18.570
doing everything they can to
remove the rights of states,

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:20.500
to make decisions that run counter

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.060
to their particular views, which,

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:24.480
Democrats have done this too, so I,

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.213
but right now it's Republicans doing it.

00:50:26.213 --> 00:50:30.030
So I give you energy
policy, they wanna make sure

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:33.600
that any private utility
that has a federal permit

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:37.080
can seize any land they want,
and no state can stop them.

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.560
The Class Action Fairness,
and there's the statement

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:42.725
from the National Conference
of State Legislatures,

00:50:42.725 --> 00:50:44.860
undermines our system of federalism

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:46.880
and disrespects our
state courts, et cetera.

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.656
Then, the one that was the scariest to me,

00:50:48.656 --> 00:50:51.200
is the Law Enforcement Safety,

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.936
I didn't know this was passed.

00:50:52.936 --> 00:50:54.440
Does anyone here got a gun?

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.300
Carrying a concealed weapon?

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:59.780
You do have a right to
carry a concealed weapon,

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:02.127
and the state of California
cannot stop anyone

00:51:02.127 --> 00:51:05.770
if they are a current,
off-duty, or retired

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:07.334
law enforcement agent.

00:51:07.334 --> 00:51:12.334
This was a special federal
law designed to stop states

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:16.940
from not allowing people
to carry concealed weapons.

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.269
That just, you know.

00:51:18.269 --> 00:51:19.220
And then we have a statement
for the International

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.100
Association of Chiefs of Police,

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:23.970
that the police want this, of course not.

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:25.390
They don't want random people,

00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:28.400
even ex-police officers, carrying guns.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.510
The reason this cuts to me, was in a class

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:32.210
at Harvard many years ago, we did have

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:37.210
a policeman from Texas who
came to the class with his gun.

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:40.465
And so we said to him,
"Sir, we don't allow,"

00:51:40.465 --> 00:51:41.357
"I don't know if Harvard has a rule,

00:51:41.357 --> 00:51:43.423
"but I assume we have
a rule, we don't allow

00:51:43.423 --> 00:51:46.969
"people to bring guns to our classes."

00:51:46.969 --> 00:51:49.197
And he said, "But what happens

00:51:49.197 --> 00:51:50.647
"if there's some bad guys here?

00:51:50.647 --> 00:51:53.507
"I gotta do that then."
(audience laughs)

00:51:53.507 --> 00:51:57.270
And I explained to him
that maybe we could tackle

00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:59.950
the bad guy or something.
(audience laughs)

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:02.090
And he put his gun away, but I realize now

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:05.800
if someone came to the thing,
and this was a police officer,

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.970
he was, you know, you couldn't stop him.

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:11.758
You couldn't legally say,
No, that's not allowed.

00:52:11.758 --> 00:52:12.591
It is remarkable.

00:52:12.591 --> 00:52:14.680
This is removal of states' rights,

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.320
states' rights as a thing.

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.660
So, I think one of the things, and I hope

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.500
the next presidency, whichever,
Democrat or Republican,

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:23.980
has greater respect for states' rights,

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:26.280
where we still have some democratic,

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.102
where we have some democratic procedures.

00:52:28.102 --> 00:52:30.940
Second thing that I offered
as a solution to this,

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:32.870
was, I call it shared capitalism.

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:35.590
And this is very simple, if capital

00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:37.050
is gonna be in the driver's seat

00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:39.356
for this 40 or 50 year transition,

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:41.740
we'll wanna make sure we're capitalists.

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.230
Let's make sure we have some money.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:47.330
Turns out, we paid for some questions

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:49.939
on this general social
survey every couple of years.

00:52:49.939 --> 00:52:52.290
Almost half of private sector workers

00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:54.480
actually are paid in some way

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.793
that you would consider
to be capital related.

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:00.039
So, hey, they're covered
by profit sharing,

00:53:00.039 --> 00:53:04.180
gain sharing, they own university stock,

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.190
and they hold company stock options.

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:08.510
I took this fact to the Harvard,

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:10.998
and I said, "I wanna be paid a share

00:53:10.998 --> 00:53:14.908
"of the Harvard Fund, Harvard Endowment,"

00:53:14.908 --> 00:53:18.625
which does extremely well as you may know.

00:53:18.625 --> 00:53:23.625
The university refused to
change my pay to this way.

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:27.554
While I explained to them
how it actually increased

00:53:27.554 --> 00:53:30.530
the devotion to the employer,

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:32.773
and I would work harder and so on.

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.150
So we have moved into this.

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:39.140
And somewhere on the order of 35%, 40%

00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:43.572
of the stock market are owned
by pension funds, workers.

00:53:43.572 --> 00:53:48.470
And so, this is going on in a lot of,

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:50.670
and that means we will benefit,

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:53.240
even though we may not
benefit in our wages,

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.540
if profits go up, we benefit as profit,

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.470
and I think that's positive.

00:53:57.470 --> 00:54:00.280
The internet, I don't know too much about,

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.190
but I gather that if we can
have a good YouTube movie

00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:05.825
showing you combing your
hair for half an hour,

00:54:05.825 --> 00:54:10.040
you're gonna lose a lot
of support from people

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:13.720
who wonder about you,
so, and that does offer,

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:16.023
I think, average citizens
a way of combating money

00:54:16.023 --> 00:54:18.670
because you couldn't get as many people

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:22.490
tapping into YouTube, with
whatever advertisements you do,

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:24.270
I hope that's the case.

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:28.690
The last thing is the
more, is the globalization.

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:32.977
How do we deal with footloose
capital and things like that?

00:54:32.977 --> 00:54:37.977
Turns out, there's a lot of
local bias in the economy.

00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.111
People do spend in their local area,

00:54:40.111 --> 00:54:43.614
firms prefer to have
products, intermediate goods,

00:54:43.614 --> 00:54:45.537
that's where there's a lot, I and S means

00:54:45.537 --> 00:54:49.300
investment savings are highly
correlated across countries.

00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:52.140
There's no evidence that
that has weakened over time,

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:54.656
even with globalization, people are,

00:54:54.656 --> 00:54:56.850
I can offer some of the people here

00:54:56.850 --> 00:55:00.350
would you like to come to
teach in, I don't know,

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:04.810
Little Rock University, how much more

00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:06.920
would I have to pay you to leave Berkeley?

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.550
If you're a grad student, how
much would I have to pay you

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:13.810
to go to, I don't know,
some small university

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:15.620
and get your degree in Mississippi

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:18.220
or Idaho, I mean, what the heck,

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:20.345
I don't wanna be discriminatory
against the South.

00:55:20.345 --> 00:55:24.910
And, yeah, people are willing
to take differentials,

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:26.160
they're willing to pay more rent

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:29.130
to live in certain places, so it is clear

00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:30.910
there are local things that matter a lot,

00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:32.470
and then I just have these two questions,

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:34.543
I'm not sure what the answer is,

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:39.740
because we would like to
keep the country ahead

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:42.310
during this transition, as the technology

00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:45.210
and education is growing up elsewhere,

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:47.850
we don't wanna take big losses.

00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.780
But to our people, so we'd
like to be able to say

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.350
we can do some good things here

00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:53.160
and that'll keep some good industries

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:57.450
and good jobs here, and I just don't know,

00:55:57.450 --> 00:55:59.010
how, we don't have good evidence

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:01.695
on how much we can do with that.

00:56:01.695 --> 00:56:05.378
And then I said, well,
there are these dangers.

00:56:05.378 --> 00:56:08.265
I won't ask you to
identify the two people,

00:56:08.265 --> 00:56:11.530
except neither of them is President Bush

00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:15.375
nor Dick Cheney dressed up for Halloween.

00:56:15.375 --> 00:56:18.673
We can have all these
disasters in this period,

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:22.823
and then I do have a
statement for you here,

00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:28.380
this does come from the administration,

00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:30.343
that I'm obviously very dubious about,

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.839
and they're still looking for the WMDs,

00:56:33.839 --> 00:56:37.727
and then, I wonder what Rumney found.

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:42.530
Oh my god, so we now
know where the WMDs are,

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:47.304
and who the enemy of
the country really is.

00:56:47.304 --> 00:56:50.700
But I think, let me phrase it this way,

00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:53.333
'cause I'm no Greek, I mean,

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:56.586
the administration is what it is,

00:56:56.586 --> 00:56:59.959
and it is though, through
education, research

00:56:59.959 --> 00:57:03.450
and things like that that
we're gonna cure our problems,

00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:05.880
not through other strange things.

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:09.350
So I am a very positive person at the end,

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:12.227
I say, "Well, I think we
can overcome this challenge

00:57:12.227 --> 00:57:15.767
"to our democracy, part of
it is that the millionaires

00:57:15.767 --> 00:57:17.457
"and billionaires are not evil people,

00:57:17.457 --> 00:57:20.207
"there's a lot more cooperation

00:57:20.207 --> 00:57:24.070
"than we anticipate from economic models."

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:26.970
We now have brain scans that show

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:29.270
this, it's hard wired fairness into us,

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:30.710
so as people, I don't think we're,

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:33.520
we're not there to be totally bad,

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.490
and I loved it when Warren Buffett

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:37.693
said he should pay higher taxes,

00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:40.020
and he thought all the corporations

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:41.730
should pay higher taxes,
all the rich people

00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:43.810
should pay higher taxes,
and then one of my friends

00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:47.243
said, "Can't he wait till I
make my 40 billion dollars,

00:57:47.243 --> 00:57:49.527
"and then pay the taxes?"

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.300
And it is true, that Mr. Buffett

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:55.060
for all his being a great millionaire,

00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:58.810
he didn't say these things
while he was making his money.

00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:00.800
He waited till retirement.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:04.320
That also says maybe that's
people should respect elders,

00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:06.600
that they have a different perspective.

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:09.690
Okay, this was brought to
you by the Hat Company,

00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:12.303
and then, for Halloween,
I had some assistants,

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:18.277
and this is a great movie,
if you've never seen it,

00:58:18.277 --> 00:58:20.540
Vincent Price, that's the Halloween stuff.

00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:22.103
Okay, I'm done.

00:58:22.103 --> 00:58:24.742
(audience applauds)

00:58:24.742 --> 00:58:27.242
(soft music)
