00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.570
Okay,
so this is what we did last time.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.900
We looked at a game involving an entrance and an incumbent in a market,

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.070
and the entrance had to decide whether to enter that market or not.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.890
And if they stayed out the incumbent remainder monopolies and the monopolists

5
00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:22.080
made 3 million in profit.
All right?
And if the entrant goes in it,

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.300
than the incumbent can decide whether to accommodate the entrance and just

7
00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:31.290
settled for duopoly profits making a million each or the incumbent can fights,

8
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.380
in which case the incumbents makes no money at all and the entrance loses $1

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.480
million.
And we pointed out to a number of things about this game.

10
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.380
One was that when we analyzed it in a matrix fob,

11
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.470
we've quickly found that there were two nash equilibria that Nash Equilibria

12
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:52.520
what in and not fights and out and fights.

13
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.130
But we argued that backward induction tells us that the sensible answer is in

14
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.350
and not fight.
Once the incumbent knows the entrance is in,

15
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.650
they're not going to fight because one is bigger than zero.

16
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.560
And then an entrant anticipating this will enter.

17
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.220
And we talked a little bit more.
We said this other equilibrium,

18
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:12.810
this out fights equilibrium.

19
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.190
It is an equally rim because if the entrance believes the incumbents going to

20
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:17.850
fights,

21
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.850
then the entrance is going to stay at house and it's costless for the incumbent

22
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.080
to quote fights if they,

23
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:28.320
if in fact the entrant does the out because they never get called upon to fight

24
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.470
anyway.
So yeah.
