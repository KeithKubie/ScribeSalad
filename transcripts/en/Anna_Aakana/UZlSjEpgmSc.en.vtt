00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.760
thank you for inviting me to your girls night.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.840
after my lovers untimely, and suspicious death,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.840
I needed a place to lay low.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.700
he wasn't vile enough for you.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.220
has his spirit entered the ghost realm?

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.860
dude, his flesh hasn't even started rotting yet!

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.300
I was merely curious!

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.060
I've got a game. it's called bang, marry, kill.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.940
I name a guy and then you have to say whether you want to kill him, marry him and then kill him or have sex with him and then kill him.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.180
do we need to choose just one?

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.840
yes.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.720
oh.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.880
I thought his good guy thing was an act,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.700
but it wasn't.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.100
He was ACTUALLY a good guy! (amazed)

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.080
(make various sound of disgust)

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.540
I know. It's just that-

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.340
you can't change men, they have to-

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500
WANT to be homicidal maniacs

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.700
I miss sir heathecliff.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.900

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.300

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.520
You've haunted him twice today already!

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.860
all we do is talk about the men we wanna murder suicide with.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.240
i'm tired of it!

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.960

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.280

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.800

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.500
(knocking at door, doorbell rings)

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.480

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.480

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.980

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.720

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.540

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.040

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.100
games, gossip and a ginger sacrifice.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.360
(chuckles)

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.180

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.860
I can't believe I ate the whole thing

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.040
don't shame yourself, kagari

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.860
She's right.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.860
No man would ever feel guilty for consuming a whole person in ritual sacrifice.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.740
i'm so glad i can call you guys my mortal and immortal enemies

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.580
respectively

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.360
would you girls care to watch a horror movie?

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.960
(screaming)
