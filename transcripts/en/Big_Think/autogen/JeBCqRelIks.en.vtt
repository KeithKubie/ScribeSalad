00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.410
Hi Bill.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.529
My name is Sam.

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.230
My question for you is why are we trying to
live on Mars and re-create Earth there by

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.940
making an atmosphere and soil and water we
can drink and such?

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.599
Why can't we take those ideas, that motivation
and direct it at our own planet that we clearly

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.610
need the help with?

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.800
Why is it easier to start fresh on another
planet than to get people talking about our

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.800
own?

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.800
Sam.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.410
Sam, you are my man.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.500
Sam, you're thinking as I do.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.860
I meet a lot of people.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.690
I am the CEO of The Planetary Society.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.719
We advanced space science and exploration.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.329
I encourage you to join.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.239
And as I say about The Planetary Society,
we are not crazy.

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.470
You meet a lot of people.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.469
I meet a lot of people who want to go to Mars
and make it like Earth, just as the very idea

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.390
that you're questioning.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.239
And I think people, first of all, just don't
grasp the scale of it.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.570
It's a planet.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.160
It's a whole planet.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:17.860
It's not a wetland that you can reclaim and
build a parking garage on top of, it's a whole

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.860
planet.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.130
Furthermore, this planet where you and I are
from is perfectly suited to us.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.440
We, our ancestors and their ancestors and
so on grew up here tuned to these environments,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.810
to these climates that we have here on earth.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.720
And so people want to go to Mars in the spirit
of adventure.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:46.280
Now, as you may infer from my accent I'm from
the United States and a lot of my ancestors

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:54.000
came here from Denmark and Europe and they
set up shop in what the colony of Massachusetts

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.479
and then they went all the way across North
America through Wyoming, the state of Wyoming

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.600
and now to the West Coast to Washington state
and California.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.410
And they did that in this great tradition
of a pioneering spirit is keep going, keep

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.150
expanding, keep spreading out and humankind
has done that.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.530
Everybody is from Africa.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.060
Our ancestors are all from the continent of
Africa and we spread all over the world.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.950
Spread to Australia across an open ocean.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.010
The Polynesians in canoes were like we're
spreading out man.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.010
We're going.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.860
So people think well let's spread out and
go to Mars.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.400
It's a whole other thing to go to Mars.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.980
I tell people this all the time.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.480
There's hardly any water.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.360
There's a little bit.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.200
There is nothing to eat.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.060
There is no air.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.560
There's no air.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.400
We can build a bubble and cook the Martian
rocks and get the oxygen out of it.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.090
Okay, it's just not so easy.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.760
Just as you asked Sam why don't we do that
here on earth or use that same technology

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.760
here on earth?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.310
And this is part of my little mission as a
human, not CEO of The Planetary Society is

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.650
reminding everybody that we've got to take
care of the earth in order for us all to live

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.650
here.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.650
There's 7.3 billion people as we're recording
right now.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.191
By 2050 there will be nine maybe even 10 billion
people by the middle of this century.

00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:23.931
And they're all going to want to eat something
and drink something, water and wash and a

00:03:23.931 --> 00:03:29.790
carry on and that's going to require us to
take much better care of our own planet.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:37.240
Now, with that said, I like to remind everybody
also, although you don't want to go to Mars

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:45.210
and have a permanent settlement there, a colony,
you do want to have a base there just as humankind

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.790
has a base in the Antarctic where scientists
go and study the Antarctic, learn about the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.991
environment, learn about our planet, learn
about ice and the Earth's history and the

00:03:56.991 --> 00:04:02.880
climate today and the greenhouse gases and
the effect of industrial emissions and so

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.069
on, all these discoveries are made in Antarctica.

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.990
If we were to discover evidence of life on
Mars, something that was once alive there

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:20.000
the equivalent of what geologists call stromatolite,
fossilized bacteria that have turned to stone,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.400
it would be astounding if we found something
still alive there.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:33.120
There are these recurring slope lineae, which
is geology expression for what look like rivulets,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.880
look like little rivers.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.500
They may be just rock falls like turned over
gravel that has a slightly different color

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.080
than the surrounding rock, but everybody thinks
right now that it's water.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.750
Everybody's pretty sure – by everybody we're
talking about people at the National Aeronautics

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.220
and Space Station NASA and the European Space
Agency ESA, JAXA Japanese Aerospace Exploration,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.220
Roscosmos.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.280
Everybody believes that if there's recurring
flows of water every Martian summer there

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.890
must be some subterranean, some under sand/ice
melts.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:13.600
And if you have liquid water anywhere on earth
there's something alive.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.180
Everywhere there's liquid water there's something
alive.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.530
If there's something alive on Mars, and we
could prove it, show it to ourselves with

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.810
our spacecraft or with human explorers walking
around, it would probably change the world.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.260
It would be equivalent to the discoveries
that Copernicus made that the earth goes around

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.550
– all the planets go around the sun, not
the other way around.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.680
Or Galileo, we're not the only body out in
the cosmos.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.090
We've got the moon.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.650
In fact to Jupiter has its own moons and these
other discoveries that were so profound.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.800
If we were to find life on another world it
would change this one.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:56.820
And there's one more element that we at The
Planetary Society celebrate, these discoveries,

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.080
this discovery of life on Mars or on the moon
of Jupiter that has twice as much seawater

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.080
as the earth.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.080
It's called Europa.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.030
You can see it with binoculars at night.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:14.900
If we make this discovery of life, it would
not have been done by an individual, by Galileo

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:22.860
or Copernicus or Irene Curie, it would be
done by a society who invested its intellect

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.940
and treasure in this quest let's go see what's
out there.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:31.990
Let's learn more about ourselves, our past
and we all want to know whether or not we're

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.229
alone in the universe.

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:39.420
So if we look on these two worlds, the earth
and mars and find a life on both of them,

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.730
that would suggest that life is very common
in the cosmos.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.960
And this would affect the way each and everyone
of us feels about what it means to be a living

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.600
thing in the cosmos; what it means to have
this place in space.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.680
That's a great question.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.810
Carry-on!
