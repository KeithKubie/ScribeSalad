00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.520
Uhg, did you smell that guy?

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.000
Yeah, he reeked of marijuana.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.380
Middle of the morning, what a shame.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.800
This is just our culture now.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.920
People think it's okay to just drug any time, any place.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.760
Sick.  That's what they are.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.080
I actually just finished a lengthy dissertation on this exact topic just last night.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.840
How do you bang out these topical discourses so quickly, Oliver?  It is impressive.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.880
"Bang out" is a rather violent way to describe my work, Jane.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.160
True.  I apologize.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.160
It's okay, but to answer your question, I just upped my Adderall dosage and then I just get my work done.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.020
Genius.  I should actually try that.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.680
You know I used to do that cause felt like so focused, you know

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.900
but then I lost my prescription--

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.300
Oh my god!  Look at that painting!

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.120
(gasps)

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.920
I once went to an art gallery and I took acid to like open up my mind--

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.720
Now see, doing drugs to open one's mind is totally acceptable.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.760
Like I'll smoke a little J before going on stage to do an acoustic set

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.040
but it's not really for me, it's for the audience.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.540
Soy Grande Mocha Latte Double-Shot Expresso with extra sugar.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.680
Double Mocha coffee House Blend, one inch soy foam.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.400
That's us.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.500
(blowing)

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.220
It is disgusting when people use drugs as like "oh recreational activity."

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.440
Or like when they build like a dependency.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.540
Exactly right.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.340
Pathetic.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.220
I'm sorry, uh, Atticus, did you not order something?

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.260
Oh, actually I was recently introduced to these caffeine pills.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.360
They do the same thing coffee does but they don't waste the Earth's resources on water and cups.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.000
What do you mean?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.080
You guys both drink a cup of coffee a day, right?

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.040
Twice a day.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.800
Three times!

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.380
So we're wasting all this water washing our cups

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.380
I mean think about it.  3 cups a day.  There's 3 of us.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.420
There's 9 cups.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.780
365 days in a year.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.240
Since the invention and emergence of calculators I don't believe in wasting brain space on mathematics

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.940
but I will tell you that number is probably well in the thousands.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.880
Uhg.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.120
Weed man.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.260
Pathetic.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.720
Quit the addiction.
