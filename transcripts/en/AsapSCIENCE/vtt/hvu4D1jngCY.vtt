00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.760
I'm gonna read you a list of 15 words

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.420
and after I'm done reading them, I want you to write down as many as you can remember.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.660
Ready to listen? Okay.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.920
Sour

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.860
Nice

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.720
Candy

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.500
Honey

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.340
Sugar

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.260
Soda

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.180
Bitter

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.120
Chocolate

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.880
Good

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.900
Heart

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.900
Taste

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.800
Cake

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.920
Tooth

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.820
Tart

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.800
Pie

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.060
Okay, now pause this video and write down as many as you can without cheating.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.180
Even when you hit the point of getting stumped, close your eyes and think and you'll likely recall a few more.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.240
Ready to reveal?

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.000
Now some of you likely got the last few words that I said like

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.840
Tooth,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.400
tart

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.920
and pie.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.460
But did you remember the word

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.200
sweet?

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:48.520
Be honest because surprisingly the majority of people are actually likely to write down the word sweet, even though it was not on the list at all.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.220
And this is what we call

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.280
a false memory.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.160
It's a psychological phenomenon where a person remembers something that didn't occur.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.480
Like, how many people vividly remember the Monopoly man having a monocle?

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.740
He never has.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.600
Or recall hearing the phrase, "Luke, I am your father."

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.160
when he only says, "No, I am your father."

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.120
Or the evil witch saying, "Mirror mirror on the wall..."

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.520
when she says, "Magic mirror on the wall..."

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.180
Memories are first formed in the hippocampus of the brain, one of the only areas where brand new neurons are made regularly.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.920
This information is saved by altering neurons, and creating synapses in connections.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.020
But it's often only focusing on the major details of your experience.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.420
So you might remember the time, place, and person, but not necessarily the colour of their hat.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.060
However, your memories aren't perfect.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.700
If you're introduced to new information between the time of you experiencing something,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.300
and when you try to recall it,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.200
for example, if somebody else gives you a slightly different account of how things were,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.500
it can alter, or even completely replace, your memory.

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:50.000
And eventually these new memories gradually migrate further into the cortex, becoming your truth.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.120
And each time you think about, or misremember an event,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.120
the further you cement this new truth.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.880
This simple effect can have pretty incredible consequences,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.720
like eyewitnesses for crime, or accidents recalling false details.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.120
In fact, one study found that if they showed people a car accident,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.580
and then asked two groups, either, how fast were the cars going when they bumped into each other,

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.940
or, how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.580
those who heard the word "smashed" , were more likely to report higher speeds.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.540
This same verb also made them more likely to report that they saw broken glass in the accident, even when there was none.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.400
In a similar study, a car was shown going through a stop sign, causing an accident.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.560
But if a question was asked suggesting it was a yield sign, many witnesses would confirm that it was, a yield sign.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.100
This is why eye witness accounts are less often used as evidence now, unless they are corroborated and verified.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.260
Finally, some studies have been able to successfully implant false childhood memories into test subjects.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.500
Researchers would give the subjects four short narratives describing childhood events that happened to them,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.520
but without the subjects knowing, one false memory was included about being lost in a shopping mall as a kid.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.680
and yet, 25% of the test subjects reported remembering the false event.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.320
Think your memory is better?

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.140
How did this video even start?

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.000
I mean, other than our logo which plays at the beginning of every video we make,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.920
can you remember what happened after that?

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.680
Except, we didn't play the logo at the beginning of this video.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.200
And if you thought we did, I just gave you a false memory.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.500
