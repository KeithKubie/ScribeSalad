00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.050
there's the chemical makeup of the

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060
there's the chemical makeup of the
 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.519
there's the chemical makeup of the
classic psychedelics you see they all

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529
classic psychedelics you see they all
 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.769
classic psychedelics you see they all
have the same fundamental structure this

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779
have the same fundamental structure this
 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.930
have the same fundamental structure this
is serotonin that's the one of the major

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940
is serotonin that's the one of the major
 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.759
is serotonin that's the one of the major
brain neurotransmitters and so what

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769
brain neurotransmitters and so what
 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.350
brain neurotransmitters and so what
happens with the psychedelics is that

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360
happens with the psychedelics is that
 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.460
happens with the psychedelics is that
they they alter the they alter the brain

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470
they they alter the they alter the brain
 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.380
they they alter the they alter the brain
function by altering the neurochemical

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390
function by altering the neurochemical
 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.460
function by altering the neurochemical
utilization of serotonin

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470
utilization of serotonin
 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.870
utilization of serotonin
they changed the manner in which the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880
they changed the manner in which the
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.630
they changed the manner in which the
serotonergic systems work and the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640
serotonergic systems work and the
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.460
serotonergic systems work and the
serotonin system is a very basic system

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
serotonin system is a very basic system
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.560
serotonin system is a very basic system
because when you're an embryo and your

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570
because when you're an embryo and your
 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.299
because when you're an embryo and your
brain is developing it's the serotonin

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
brain is developing it's the serotonin
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.490
brain is developing it's the serotonin
projections that basically orchestrate

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500
projections that basically orchestrate
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.410
projections that basically orchestrate
the development of your brain so they're

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
the development of your brain so they're
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.450
the development of your brain so they're
and they're very archaic circuits very

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460
and they're very archaic circuits very
 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.790
and they're very archaic circuits very
very archaic circuits so and this is the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800
very archaic circuits so and this is the
 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.470
very archaic circuits so and this is the
paper I think I stole this from

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
paper I think I stole this from
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.900
paper I think I stole this from
psilocybin Griffiths who's been doing a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910
psilocybin Griffiths who's been doing a
 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.459
psilocybin Griffiths who's been doing a
lot of this research psilocybin can

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
lot of this research psilocybin can
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.200
lot of this research psilocybin can
occasion mystical type experiences

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
occasion mystical type experiences
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.729
occasion mystical type experiences
having substantial and sustained

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739
having substantial and sustained
 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.049
having substantial and sustained
personal meaning and spiritual

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
personal meaning and spiritual
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.540
personal meaning and spiritual
significance so why that's a good

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
significance so why that's a good
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.580
significance so why that's a good
question right like so so here's a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
question right like so so here's a
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.599
question right like so so here's a
question for you

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609
question for you
 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.700
question for you
it is beyond dispute that human beings

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710
it is beyond dispute that human beings
 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.260
it is beyond dispute that human beings
are capable of religious experience why

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270
are capable of religious experience why
 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.990
are capable of religious experience why
why is that exactly and like you can

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
why is that exactly and like you can
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.850
why is that exactly and like you can
associate it with psychosis but that

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860
associate it with psychosis but that
 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.920
associate it with psychosis but that
doesn't work as the theory doesn't hold

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
doesn't work as the theory doesn't hold
 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.109
doesn't work as the theory doesn't hold
a theory doesn't hold water it's not the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119
a theory doesn't hold water it's not the
 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.030
a theory doesn't hold water it's not the
same thing so why is it there exactly

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040
same thing so why is it there exactly
 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.590
same thing so why is it there exactly
and it's not an easy thing to figure out

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600
and it's not an easy thing to figure out
 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.730
and it's not an easy thing to figure out
like I've been trying to figure I'm

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
like I've been trying to figure I'm
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.109
like I've been trying to figure I'm
always trying to figure out a biological

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
always trying to figure out a biological
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.490
always trying to figure out a biological
explanation for everything right because

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
explanation for everything right because
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.350
explanation for everything right because
if you want to find something to stand

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
if you want to find something to stand
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.609
if you want to find something to stand
on you want to make sure that it can

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
on you want to make sure that it can
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.890
on you want to make sure that it can
resist a challenge and so if I can find

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
resist a challenge and so if I can find
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.300
resist a challenge and so if I can find
an explanation for something that's

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
an explanation for something that's
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.160
an explanation for something that's
reductionistic and materialistic and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170
reductionistic and materialistic and
 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.020
reductionistic and materialistic and
biological then I'm going for that

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
biological then I'm going for that
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.550
biological then I'm going for that
that's a tough one

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
that's a tough one
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.039
that's a tough one
consciousness is a tough one the the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
consciousness is a tough one the the
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.749
consciousness is a tough one the the
moral sense is a tough one they're not

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759
moral sense is a tough one they're not
 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.789
moral sense is a tough one they're not
easy things to crack the Big Bang is a

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
easy things to crack the Big Bang is a
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.840
easy things to crack the Big Bang is a
tough one so you know I mean a cynic

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
tough one so you know I mean a cynic
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.399
tough one so you know I mean a cynic
might say that maybe sometimes when

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
might say that maybe sometimes when
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.410
might say that maybe sometimes when
people are close to suicide they'll have

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
people are close to suicide they'll have
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.870
people are close to suicide they'll have
a mystical experience you know and you

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880
a mystical experience you know and you
 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.550
a mystical experience you know and you
maybe you say well it's a last-ditch

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
maybe you say well it's a last-ditch
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.190
maybe you say well it's a last-ditch
attempt of your brain to delude you into

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
attempt of your brain to delude you into
 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.630
attempt of your brain to delude you into
thinking that your life has some

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
thinking that your life has some
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.270
thinking that your life has some
significance you know and that's a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280
significance you know and that's a
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.610
significance you know and that's a
plausible theory but

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
plausible theory but
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.470
plausible theory but
I don't think it counts for the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480
I don't think it counts for the
 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.270
I don't think it counts for the
generality of the phenomena so so I

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280
generality of the phenomena so so I
 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.910
generality of the phenomena so so I
don't buy it
