00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.190
Today,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.389
pretty much every economy in the world is organized along capitalist lines

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.539
but at the same time, capitalism is almost everywhere regarded

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.270
with disappointment, frustration and suspicion.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.150
Interestingly, none of the criticisms are
new. They've been dogging capitalism

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.349
since its inception. So let's look back
in time

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.550
to figure out how capitalism got its bad
name and what might be done

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.579
to improve it. Padua, Italy, 1304.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.860
0n the wall of a church in Padua 
near Venice, the painter Giotto makes a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.480
fresco:

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.379
Jesus and the Money Lenders. It restates for
his own times

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.760
an idea that had by then already been
well established for centuries in the West:

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.770
the notion that a good spiritual life
and the pursuit of business

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.640
and money are sworn enemies. Jesus
goes to the temple in Jerusalem,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.920
sees merchants and small-time bankers
crowding the forecourt and gets furious.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.810
This sacred place is not a fitting arena
for the polluting activities

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.110
of buying and selling. The Christian
attack on the immorality of money

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.689
is deeply influential and severely holds
back the development of capitalism

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.090
for centuries. Venice, 1450.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.330
A Franciscan friar, Luca Pacioli,
publishes the first ever book on

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.080
accounting:

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.869
Summa de arithmetica. It's the single
most important capitalist invention

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.180
until the birth of the joint stock
company and the modern factory.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.009
In the book Pacioli introduces the
principle of double-entry bookkeeping

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.450
which gradually become standard practice
in all companies.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.049
Pacioli's textbook proposes that
dealing well with money

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.780
doesn't depend on faith anymore. Money
isn't a divine punishment or reward;

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.520
it's a kind of science that can be learnt
through patience,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.400
reason and hard work.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.610
Geneva, 1555. In powerful sermons to his
congregations in Geneva,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.330
the Protestant theologian John Calvin
emphasizes to his Swiss

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.970
audiences the importance of what have
become known as the Protestant

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.500
virtues: hard work, self-denial, patience,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.820
honesty and duty. These will turn out to
be extremely useful qualities

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.730
for capitalism. Calvin along with many
other preachers who share his

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.700
outlook explains that you must never
indulge yourself not spend money having

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.720
a lavish life.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.450
You must simply put any surplus income
back into your business

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.220
as an investment. Calvin adds that
being good at business

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.890
is far more pleasing in the sight of God
than being an aristocratic

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.320
warrior or even a monk. Perhaps more than
technology,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.959
it's this new mindset that will
accelerate the progress

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.640
of capitalism. 1670,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.910
Delft, Dutch Republic. The newly
independent Dutch Republic is the world's

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.990
first explicitly capitalist nation where
lazy aristocrats

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.300
are looked down upon and hard-working
merchants revered.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.590
In the churches, Protestant sermons about
thrift and hard work are heard.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.250
In the arts outgo glorifications of
kings and queens.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.440
Johannes Vermeer finishes painting
The Lacemaker,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.060
a depiction of the intricate careful and
homely tasks

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.620
of manufacturing lace. In his painting The Little Street,

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.440
the suggestion is that living peacefully
and quietly in your own home

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.630
running a business is far more glamorous
and noble

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.299
than fighting in a war or going to a
monastery.

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.299
1776. 141, the Strand, London.

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.349
These are the offices and shops of Strain &amp; Cable, publishers

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.040
who have a big success with a new book:
an inquiry into the nature and causes of

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.400
The Wealth of Nations

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.500
written by a Scottish philosopher called
Adam Smith.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.659
Smith demystifies wealth creation by
explaining how capitalist economies grow.

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.159
He reaches several important conclusions.
Slavery

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.180
is remarkably inefficient. Violence is
less of an incentive than money

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.689
for a worker and the cost of buying and
maintaining slaves

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.560
far exceeds the cost of wages. Capitalists
will make far more money

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.650
by treating their workers legally and
humanely.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.099
It's by specializing that economies grow,
says Smith.

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.010
Smith focuses on the pin making industry
and concludes that while

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.650
one worker could make up to 20 pins
a day, a team of

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.699
10 workers well arranged could make not 200 but 48,000 pins,

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.889
thanks to what Smith terms the Division
of Labour.

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.130
Smith also tells us that capitalism is
guided by an invisible hand.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.169
By maximizing one's own profit,
individuals

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.699
inadvertently benefit society providing
goods that people want and need.

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.110
As Smith puts it: "It is not from the
benevolence of the butcher, the brewer,

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.710
or the baker that we expect our dinner,
but from their regard

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.370
to their own self-interest." These ideas
further remove the moral suspicion

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.139
that once surrounds capitalism. But not all
will be won over.

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.660
1854, London. The British economy

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.449
is now the largest in the world thanks
to its enormous industries of cotton,

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.389
shipbuilding, steel and coal. Vast cities
have chewed up the countryside of

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.130
the Midlands and northern England.
Merchants and the newly rich capitalist

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.630
class

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.130
have triumphed. But many are furious.
Charles Dickens,

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.020
one of Victoria England's most passionate
critics of unrestrained capitalism

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.560
publishes a novel: Hard Times. Set in the
fictional town of Coketown,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.389
a version of Manchester, it takes aim at
heartless capitalists

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.510
like Mr. Gradgrind who abuse their
workers, exploit young children in mines

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.240
and chimneys

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.280
and use their relentless capitalist
logic to blind them to their desecration

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.720
of nature and human life.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.310
Here is Dickens' writing on Coketown: "It
was a town of red brick, or a brick that

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.350
would have been red

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.610
if the smoke and ashes had allowed it;
but as matters stood

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.220
it was a town of unnatural red and
black like the painted face of a savage."

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.639
Dickens argues that capitalism is evil
because it encourages appalling

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.310
conditions for the producers.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.070
Under the sway of capitalist logic
otherwise quite nice people

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.080
will keep coming up with reasons why it's okay to employ

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.090
a child in a factory or to let poor people
starve once they've reached the end of

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.310
their working lives.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.259
1860, London. The English reformer John
Ruskin

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:16.490
publishes Unto This Last, a furious
track against capitalism

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.860
that takes aim not so much at the
production side of capitalism

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.169
as the area of consumption. Like Dickens

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.169
Ruskin is incensed that people are being
exploited

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.060
and the environment ruined. But he asks a
further question:

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.770
In the name of what? Ruskin notes that
large capitalist fortunes

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.300
are built up on selling people absurd
things: knick-knacks, fancy plates,

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.570
embroidered napkins,

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.979
bonnets carved sideboards. The whole of the
suffering of the cotton factories of

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:45.630
Manchester

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.389
are being fed by our appetite for very cheap
shirts with delicate collards.

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.250
We are ruining our lives for trinkets,
whereas for Ruskin

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.270
money shouldn't only be made morally, it
should be spent morally

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.510
on the truly noble and beautiful things
that humans need.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.060
He contrast the beauty of Venice with
the ugliness of modern Britain

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.590
to make his point. Berlin, 1963.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.930
The leader of communist East Germany,
Walter Ulbricht

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.840
launches an ambitious new scheme: the
Neues Ökonomische System

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.490
or NÖS. It aimes to solve for East Germans

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.840
the two major failings of capitalism in his
eyes.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.259
One: It will guarantee workers good
conditions with a huge expansion in the

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:27.590
number of

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.210
state schools, housing blocks and holiday
camps. And secondly:

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.310
It will focus not on the fripperies of
capitalist production

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.970
like blue jeans and pop music; it will
give people the works of Plato and Marx

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.580
and uplifting television programs about
track to production.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.970
1976, Dresden, East Germany.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.139
The fatal flaws of communism come to a
head in January

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:50.510
with a massive riot

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.820
about the unavailability of coffee.
East Germans love drinking coffee

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.840
but a huge rise in global prices means
that the German Democratic Republic

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.170
can no longer afford to import it in the
necessary quantities.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.420
The Politburo decides to remove all coffee
from shops

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.780
and replaces it with "mich Kaffee", mix coffee

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.040
which is 51 percent coffee and 49
percent a range of fillers including

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.540
chicory, rye and sugar beet.
Dissatisfaction with this

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.510
eventually has to be quelled with the
use the Stasi or secret police.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.740
It's an inadvertent tribute to capitalism
which is especially good

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:30.670
at providing us with life's little luxuries.
Edeka hypermarket near Hamburg,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.919
November, 1989. East Germans who have
recently breached the wall

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.850
head straight for West German
supermarkets like Edeka near Hamburg.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.960
They marvel at the productive capacities
of capitalism

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.310
and the ability that it has to provide such
modest but very important things as

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:51.230
olive oil, party hats, ice spuns and coffee.
The old East German elite

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.250
who had believed that the people could be
satisfied with philosophy,

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.690
athletics, sauerkraut and TV programs
about farming

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:04.450
are hounded out of office.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.630
1999, Seattle, USA. The World Trade Organization,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.360
a capitalist body dedicated to removing
protection from industry

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.320
and liberalizing markets gets together
for its next round of talks,

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.660
10 years since the fall of communism and
after a decade

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.720
of unprecedented economic growth. But though
the mood of politicians is

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.850
upbeat, out in the streets hundreds of
thousands of anti-capitalist protesters

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.640
have gathered to call an end to the
iniquities of global capitalism.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.110
The complaints are strikingly similar to
those made

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.800
by Jesus Christ. Capitalism doesn't look
after the producers

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.980
and capitalism downgrades the important
spiritual

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.910
ends of life for the sake hamburgers,
unsustainably cheap clothes

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.350
and garish distracting mass media. With
their beards and guard figures

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.580
many of the protesters look a little
like Renaissance's renditions of Jesus.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.320
The police take a very heavy hand, fired
tear gas into the crowds,

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.120
arrest 2000 and call in the National
Guard. The protest remind the world

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.270
that besides the winners of capitalism
there is an enormous

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:09.730
army of the disenfranchised and the angry
who see more sense in Jesus, Dickens and

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:10.270
Ruskin

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:14.850
than in Adam Smith and Bill Clinton.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:18.530
2015, Cupertino, California. Apple Computers

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.650
officially becomes the largest
corporation in the world. It's a giant

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.880
success story.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.540
But the very same challenges remain. It
turns out that Apple are

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.380
indirectly responsible for the suffering
and abusive of workers in the supply chain

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.230
in China

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.280
by the Foxconn corporation and with the
launch of the Apple watch,

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.410
a gadget that seems to have no
particularly urgent purpose,

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:42.440
questions are once again raised about
why we are exhausting ourselves and the

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.000
planet

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.940
for ends that are so out of proportion
with the costs they impose on

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.440
all of us. To generalize: Capitalism is
amazingly productive

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.280
but it has two big flaws. Firstly, it
systematically inclines to ignore the

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.420
sufferings of workers

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:02.510
unless regularly prodded not to. And the
wealth of companies is often built up on

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.350
satisfying

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.450
what are not the essential needs of human
beings. Fortunes are made

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.590
on making unhealthy food or bad
television programs.
