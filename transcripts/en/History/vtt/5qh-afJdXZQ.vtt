00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.540
NARRATOR: Egypt,
Valley of the Queens.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.380
January 26, 1909.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.210
13 years before the discovery
of King Tut's tomb, artist

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.880
and playwright
Joseph Lindon Smith

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.710
and Egyptologist Arthur
Weigel perform a theater

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.750
piece for Howard Carter's team.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.580
The play tells the
story of a curse that

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.000
was placed on the
pharaoh Akhenaten

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
by the priests of Amun,
who he had defied.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.420
According to the
curse, Akhenaten

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.540
would not be able to
travel to the other world,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.000
but would be doomed to
walk the earth as a ghost.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.670
Now, some very
interesting circumstances

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.210
unfortunately took
place when they

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.330
went through with this play.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.000
This storm comes
up out of nowhere,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.420
blinds one of the actresses.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.380
One of the playwriter's
wives is befuddled

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.580
with this unknown sickness.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.580
Really raises a lot of questions
as to disperse around Akhenaten

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.250
actually being real.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.460
Right in front of me is
the sarcophagus of the king.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.790
Now, there's a lot of debate
about the middle coffin.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.580
It has different facial
features than the rest,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.580
and it also seems like
the cartouche where

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.580
the name of the king
would be was replaced

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.580
with King Tut's name instead.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.460
Now under further
analysis, they were

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.540
able to read the
name on the cartouche

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.120
underneath King Tut's name.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.290
And that read Ankhkheprure.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.170
Ankhkheprure was not King Tut.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.120
NARRATOR: Why was a sarcophagus
that was made for Ankhkheprure

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.460
used to hold the
mummy of King Tut?

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.080
His death at 19 was definitely
a problem for the tomb makers.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.920
It ended up being a rush job.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.000
He got the smallest
tomb in the valley.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.790
NARRATOR: But who
is Ankhkheprure?

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.960
Every ruler in ancient Egypt
was given a throne name that was

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.620
different from his birth name.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.830
The throne name of
Ankhkheprure is believed

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.750
to have belonged to a very
important and mysterious

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.460
member of King Tut's family.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.540
Ankhkheprure could have
been the throne name of Prince

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.710
Thutmose, who was allegedly
Akhenaten's brother

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.790
and was supposed to rule
before or after Akhenaten,

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.830
but never got to.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.380
NARRATOR: There are numerous
theories regarding Akhenaten's

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.620
mysterious brother, Thutmose.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.540
But the most profound comes
from an unexpected source--

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.540
Sigmund Freud.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.880
Who in addition to being the
founder of psychoanalysis,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.710
was also a scholar of
Judaism and ancient Egypt.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.170
Sigmund Freud, the famous
psychoanalyst, in 1939 first

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.540
suggested the monotheism
began with Akhenaten.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.250
And he thought that someone
in Akhenaten's court, perhaps

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.580
his brother, Thutmose, could in
fact be the historical Moses.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.420
NARRATOR: Could Sigmund Freud's
audacious conclusion be true?

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.920
That Akhenaten's biological
brother was, in fact,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.330
the Hebrew leader Moses?

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.830
According to Freud,
the events depicted

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.420
in the Bible surrounding
Moses' birth, exile,

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.000
and most importantly, his
introduction of monotheism

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.120
perfectly coincide with the
historical record of Thutmose.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.290
The name Thutmose means
son of the god Thoth.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.120
If you take away the
Tut element in his name,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.750
it simply means son of.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.790
Mose means the son of.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.790
Now the name Moses is
very similar to Mose,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.790
and it just so happens that
the story of Moses in the Bible

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.420
is set at exactly the
same time that Thutmose

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.620
disappears from history.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.790
And we are told in
the Bible that Moses

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:38.000
grows up as the brother of the
prince apparent to the throne.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.170
In other words, the
historical Thutmose

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.790
could be the biblical Moses.
