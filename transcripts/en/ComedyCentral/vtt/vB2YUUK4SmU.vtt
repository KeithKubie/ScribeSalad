More cocaine wine?

- Yes.
- A little bit more won't hurt.

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:05.839
Any lady in Newport society

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.008
needs to know how
to hold her liquor.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:09.843
Well, I can hold my liquor
better than anyone!

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.211
Me, too!

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.347
Oh, my goodness,
that sounds like a challenge.

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:14.781
Shall we see who can drink it
the fastest?

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.049
- Oh!
- Yes! Yes!

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.885
Helen, other person!

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.486
- Let's race.
- One, two, three go!

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:23.490
Wait! I have to tell Helen
we're doing a contest.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.459
Come on.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.996
(Marquis de Sainsbury)
Go, go, go, go, go.

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:31.131
Aah!

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.165
You are all piles of trash!

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.534
I am a mountain of gold!

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:36.136
I won! I took the egg!

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:38.405
Aah!

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.341
I won, you dumb haybag!
You don't count.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.311
Second place.
Why am I always second place?

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.046
You're not second place.
Lillian's second place!

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.514
I'm first place.
I won.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:50.017
No one asked you to play, Hore!
You're fat!

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:51.985
"Other person"?!
"Other person"?!

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.254
I'm the one that taught her
to communicate!

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.056
Without me she'd be nothing!

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:58.425
You're nothing
without me, Keller!

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:01.995
Nothing!

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:03.564
I love you, Annie!

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:04.765
Aah!

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:06.066
[screams]

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.835
That's a Ming vase,
you deaf bitch!

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:11.572
We only have 17 of those!

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:14.074
[screams]

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:17.311
[screaming]

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:27.688
I wasn't totally sure
what was happening...

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:29.523
Aah!

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:31.992
but I knew I wanted
to stab someone.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.761
[screaming]

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:36.864
Let go of my sister!

00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:40.100
[screaming]

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:45.873
You heathens!

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:47.841
What is this, Baltimore?!

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:48.842
[gunshot]

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:49.843
[screams]

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.345
Intruder!

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:51.745
Wawa.
