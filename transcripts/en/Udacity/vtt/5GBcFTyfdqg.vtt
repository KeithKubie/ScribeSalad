00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The bitcoin protocol relied on using proofs of work to provide scarcity in producing new blocks.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
For this question you are asked to order a list of tasks by how much expected work they require.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Assume that H is a strong cryptographic hash function that produces 128 output bits

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
from any length input.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Comuting H(x) takes 1 unit of time.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
E indicates RSA encryption. K sub U is a known public key.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But the corresponding private key is not known.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Computing E(x) takes takes 1000 units of time.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
There are no memory limits, but the task has no access to precomputed values.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Using those assumptions, order these by how much work they prove

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
from the least expected work to the most expected work.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
For example, enter cebad if you think c requires the least amount of work

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and d the most amount of expected work.
