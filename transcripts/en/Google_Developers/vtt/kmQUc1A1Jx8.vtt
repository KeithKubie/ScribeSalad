00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:16.760
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.050
PAUL RASHIDI: Hello, my
name's Paul Rashidi.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.590
Thanks for joining us
again for another

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.960
third party hang out.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.420
Today, we have ADvendio, who is
a key partner with the DFP

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.810
API for many publishers
who utilize the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.960
Salesforce.com platform.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.470
They simplify order management,
as well as many

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.120
other processes for
publishers.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.490
And I apologize, I didn't
introduce the other DFP API

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.500
member on the conference
today.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.100
Vincent, would you like
to introduce yourself?

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.180
VINCENT TSAO: Sure.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.360
My name is Vincent Tsao.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.530
I'm a Developer Programs
Engineer on the DFP API team.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.280
I work primarily on the
PHP client library.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.070
PAUL RASHIDI: Thanks
Vincent, and sorry.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.830
So with that, I'll go ahead and
introduce Nadja Streiss,

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.470
sales manager for ADvendio.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.470
And she'll let us know what
ADvendio does for their

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.980
publishers.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.645
NADJA STREISS: Hi.

00:02:09.645 --> 00:02:12.090
Well, so hi.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.920
Yeah, thank you Paul.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.950
My name is Nadja.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.300
I'm one of the sales reps
here for ADvendio.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.940
And let me introduce my team.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.000
To my left is Freddy, the
project developer.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.420
And--

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.320
FREDERIK LADEWIG: Hi.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.500
NADJA STREISS: --on the
other screen is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.840
Reno, our project manager.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.740
Say hi.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.550
Yeah, that's it.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.430
I would be the one who's going
to introduce you to the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.710
company, ADvendio itself.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.010
And we can get started, I think,
if you're ready, Paul?

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.100
PAUL RASHIDI: Yeah,
sounds great.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.595
NADJA STREISS: So let me just
switch to our presentation.

00:02:59.307 --> 00:03:00.557
So, just a second.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.740
Yes, we are correct.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.800
So ADvendio.com, as a complete
sales and order management

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.020
app, was an additional invoice
management model especially

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.190
designed for online
publishers.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.900
Powered by Salesforce.com, you
receive all benefits of the

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.670
innovative cloud platform.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.230
ADvendio's main goal is to
simplify your complex online

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.260
advertising business by
providing one system where all

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.670
relevant information
is stored.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.280
Ans advertisers, inventory
campaigns, and proposals,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.340
orders, reports, and invoices
can be managed within this

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.206
application.

00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:51.390
As ADvendio.com seamlessly
integrates with DFP,

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.070
publishers can process almost
everything in that venue.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.360
This solution is particularly
designed for digital

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.120
publishers who want to make the
most of the premium sales.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.300
So just a brief overview
also of what's planned.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.680
And this is our flier.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.570
As you can see, ADvendio.com
includes all tools you need to

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.010
manage your ad sales
efficiently.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.170
Not only does it contain an
inventory database that you

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.940
can organize, mass update, and
easily search with [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.940
lookups, but also a powerful
CRM, which helps your team to

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.700
see all customer information and
interaction at a glance.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.440
Thanks to the integration with
DFP, you can easily create and

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.520
configure campaigns, and
immediately request

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.040
availabilities, and submit the
order on DFP from within

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.328
ADvendio.com, without even
having to enter everything all

00:04:49.328 --> 00:04:51.360
over again.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.890
Furthermore, the analytics tool
gives you the opportunity

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.610
to create and customize any
report you might need to

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.020
evaluate customer inventory
or sales rep performance.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.430
I will tell you more about the
billing functionality on a

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.940
separate slide later on.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.700
We just move forward.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.900
Yes, benefits.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.160
Thanks to the embedded network
integration, ADvendio's main

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.220
benefit is that you can manage
your business in one system.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.200
ADvendio is built and operated
on Salesforce.com's innovative

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.940
cloud infrastructure.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.360
You can access your business
data anywhere, anytime, on any

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.580
device, and benefit from low
initial costs, and continuing

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.490
free updates.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.660
You don't have to worry about
IT maintenance or about your

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.590
company's growth, ADvendio's
multi-tenant solution fits

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.240
company size.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.290
With the chatter of the
integrated communication tool

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.570
from Salesforce, you can also
easily just collaborate with

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.820
your coworkers.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:05.440
On this slide, as I have already
mentioned, ADvendio

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.420
includes a complete CRM, an
[INAUDIBLE] with its tasks,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.160
and activity tracking, a great
management cockpit with 360

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.260
degrees customer visibility.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.490
You can not only create
proposals for your online

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.050
mandatory, but for
print, as well.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.230
Thanks to the handy inventory
search and media integration,

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.955
you can quickly create and
optimize your campaigns.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.890
Now the promised billing
and accounting slide.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.880
The new billing and accounting
tool allows you to create

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.100
automated invoices that you
are running, or completed

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.340
media campaigns, within
just a few clicks.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.250
With the help of comprehensive
billing rounds, you can even

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.930
generate, for example, all
months invoices, and merge

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.480
them into one file for
immediate print shop.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.860
If an invoice has to be altered,
you can cancel

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.840
invoice position, and
automatically create credit

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.110
notes for the changed
position.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.520
Furthermore, the accounting
tool offers you the

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.790
possibility of creating reports
of the actual account

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.570
inventory performance
after invoicing.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.760
Via the admin's web service
API, it's possible to

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.723
integrate with the
ERP systems.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.500
Now the embedded DFP
integration.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.290
Thanks to the of connection to
the DFP, data can be exchanged

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.470
automatically between
the two systems.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.670
Basically, the integration
allows sales ad ops and

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:45.160
campaign management to use DFP
functions, such as forecast,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.190
booking, and delivery data
within ADvendio, so that

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.570
information just has
to be entered once.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.680
During the campaign planning
process, sales rep can enter

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.820
targeting information
linked with DFP.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.060
So if they want to request
availabilities for the

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.790
configured campaigns, targeting
criteria is

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.240
considered during the
forecast, as well.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.680
They can see immediately if and
how the entered amounts

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.620
have to be altered.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.350
Once the proposal is confirmed,
they can upload the

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:20.130
creative and push the media
campaign with all relevant

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.450
information to DFP
with one click.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.740
As soon as a campaign is
running, you get the actual

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.120
delivered impressions and
clicks-back the media

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.270
campaign, where they
can be used for be

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.250
reporting or billing.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:39.039
With ADvendio and the
integration to DFP, CRM, order

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:42.289
management, billing, and order
operations don't have to be

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.175
coordinated separately
anymore.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.560
So this was--

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.845
just change.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:04.310
This was a brief company
overview on ADvendio, and the

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.740
packages, order management,
and the

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:07.965
invoicing management part.

00:09:07.965 --> 00:09:11.507
And I'll just go and give over
to Reno, who's going to

00:09:11.507 --> 00:09:13.920
introduce you to the
live system.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.580
And show you around how the
integration works exactly.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.510
RENO MILEWSKI: Hi, everybody.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.290
OK, now everybody can see me?

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.200
Hi, everybody.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.570
Thank you, Nadja.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.800
I'm Reno, and as a product
manager of ADvendio, I'm

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.500
responsible for evaluating,
planning, and implementing new

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.600
features, so making our solution
even more efficient.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:44.020
Thanks to the flexible cloud
architecture, almost every

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.020
enhancement can be realized,
and all these updates are

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.590
usually for free.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:55.370
So I'm going to give you a brief
overview of the basic

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.420
features of ADvendio.com.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.720
We'll take a quick tour through
accounts, contacts,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.560
customer care, create
a media campaign

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.100
using the media search.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:14.150
Of course, see how the
connection to DFP works, and

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.730
creating a proposal, and
finally, an invoice.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.605
So let's take a look
at our live system.

00:10:20.605 --> 00:10:25.345
I just need to show
my desktop here.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.570
All right.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:32.820
So now you should
see my screen.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:43.250
This home screen is exactly what
every user can see if he

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.050
accesses to ADvendio.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:51.700
He has immediately his planned
events and tasks at a glance,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.240
as you can see it here.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.850
So every user can schedule his
own tasks, his own meetings,

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:05.470
and so can define the
collaboration.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.190
He also can assign tasks
to other users, and

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.010
create his own tasks.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:14.430
You can see dashboard here,
where he can make reports a

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.160
little bit more visible.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.270
But let us go through
the system.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.210
In ADvendio, you have everything
in one system.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.890
So you have your accounts and
contact information, as you

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:34.180
can see here, which are your
advertisers and your agencies.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.170
You have also the whole
inventory management, with the

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:42.480
aspects and size placement
ad types.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.290
The report engine and the
dashboard engine.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.160
And what your ads have,
the media campaigns.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:55.627
So if you go to the Accounts
tab, you just see here the

00:11:55.627 --> 00:11:58.990
client account.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.800
In the top page, you see
the account's details.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.580
So all needed business
information, like an annual

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.980
revenue, or the phone number.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.580
In the bottom, you see
all related lists.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.640
So all records which are
connected to this account,

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.590
like the contact persons, and
the media campaigns, which you

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.660
have for this account.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.520
So let's go through to see
one media campaign.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.520
If you want to create a new
media campaign, just click on

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.470
your Media Campaigns tab,
and click on New.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:41.020
So I've already created
one media campaign.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:48.420
So I've already created
a campaign.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:53.810
And in the top again, you see
all basic information to this

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:56.830
media campaign, like the media
campaign name, the advertising

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.900
agency relationship.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.957
You can also define stage with
the media probability, and the

00:13:03.957 --> 00:13:07.020
close date.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.550
In another section, you see all

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.180
calculations and discounts.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.390
You can grant quantity,
customer, and agency discounts

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.980
on a media campaign level.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.460
And what your ads can
do is see, on a

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.310
later stage, all amounts.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.300
And campaigns start and ended
were calculated in the

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:30.200
background by the system,
depending on the given

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.570
information in the related
list campaign items.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:41.160
So here comes the media campaign
management with the

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.620
inventory management together.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:48.220
So if you just click on Add
Items, you come to the

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.160
products search--

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.800
the media search.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.870
Here you can filter the results
of all the inventory

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.480
you have stored in the system.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.930
So for example, you can
define a site, the

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.620
placement, the ad type.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.980
You can search for the
billing category.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:10.850
And in this case, just let us
search for Friday News.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.990
It's just a demo site here.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:19.780
And it's taking some seconds.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.810
And the ad type wide skyscraper,
for example.

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:28.380
And we will see that there's
just one product in the system

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.910
with these criterias.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.100
The Friday news home
page skyscraper.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.070
If you mark this and get add
it to the basket, you will

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:42.620
come to the next screen
to the basket.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:46.235
You now can set up a new search,
if you want to, and

00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:50.590
add another more products
to your basket.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.590
What you now can do is start
your media configuration.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:58.440
So you want to have some
basic information to

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.750
this campaign item.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:04.150
Just pick on Start Media
Configuration, and you come to

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.020
this screen.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.950
So the Friday News home page
white skyscraper, the name of

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:09.930
this ad spec.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.090
What you now can do is select
the from and until date.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.920
So we need to define
the period.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.680
Let's make it in March.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:22.420
Define your pricing.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.880
On different tabs you have
different information.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.375
So let's take 100,000
impressions.

00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:33.610
You also can change the sales
price if you want to.

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:37.120
You have your frequency capping
information, which are

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.660
also submitted to
your ad server.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.580
Your time targeting,
browser targeting--

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.520
I'll just skip those tasks
at the moment.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.640
Your geo-information which you
can pull out from DFP with

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:56.640
just one click, and everything
is stored in your system.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.420
And this geo-targeting tree will
pop up automatically if

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.310
you click this button
here on Edit.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:07.510
For example, you can now define
your geo-targeting

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:14.440
information let's make it in
Arizona, in Arizona City, and

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.390
click save.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.470
And all this information is
stored here in these boxes,

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:23.030
and were also pushed to
your DFP network.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.080
You can define your key value
information and content

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.650
information, but skip
it for the moment.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:37.390
Just click on Save, and you
come to the next screen.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:41.650
Here, come back to the
media campaign.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.530
So you now have one campaign
item in this

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.610
media company here.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.970
What you now can do is to
check availability.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.590
So just mark it and check
availability.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:59.280
Since this system is connected
to our test environment for

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.940
DFP, we have no availables in
the system because we have no

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.849
live campaigns running
in the system.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:09.859
So I would like to skip the
check availability for the

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:16.349
moment, and show you the submit
to ad server directly.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:17.599
It's nearly the same
procedure.

00:17:22.152 --> 00:17:29.035
But first of all, we need to
sign the proposal or send it

00:17:29.035 --> 00:17:30.610
out to the agency.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:35.580
So we need to generate
the PDF.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.020
With just two clicks, you
will have your PDF.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.940
Sent it directly to the
agency, and the

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.090
agency signs it.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.300
And you're able to push the
campaign to the ad server.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.960
Or, make some changes,
and push it after

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.210
you make your changes.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.980
OK, so let's put it to the ad
server with just one click.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.000
Oh--

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.200
that was a button arrow.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.560
I'm not quite sure what it is.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:13.910
But if you now see it in here,
we have a live campaign.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.060
In this live campaign,
you will see--

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:22.800
just let me skip it
to another tab.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.565
And in this live campaign, you
can see, if you have pushed it

00:18:26.565 --> 00:18:33.680
to your ad server, then the ad
server auto ID and ad ID were

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.370
filled out automatically.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.080
You have also delivery status
updates with the delivered

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.110
clicks and impressions with
the last delivery update--

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.700
when was the last
delivery update.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.110
So this is the German
time here.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:52.700
Let's take the deliveries
for this campaign here.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.200
Just click on our--

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.370
just mark this item, and get
delivered clicks and

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.690
impressions here.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:07.332
So we come to the new
screen, and--

00:19:07.332 --> 00:19:09.190
illegal session.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.060
PAUL RASHIDI: I think those
pop-outs timed you out.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:14.370
RENO MILEWSKI: I'm
not quite sure.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.290
Maybe Freddy can [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.530
can tell you something
more about it.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:27.350
I think I need to refresh
it, and then it will

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:31.110
work, because I have--

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.350
just one moment.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:38.110
OK, so now we have
a fresh session.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.385
And let's get delivered
clicks.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:52.610
Now it takes some seconds for
the connection to a DFP, and

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:56.730
get out the new delivered clicks
and impressions and for

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:57.730
this ad ID.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:04.390
And you can now see it in your
campaign item that the last

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:08.987
delivery status update will be
popped up automatically here.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.910
So here's our time,
and it works.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:22.120
So, the next thing I want to
show you is the billing.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.240
So if you now have some
campaigns running on the

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.720
system, and everything's fine,
and the deliveries are coming

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.560
back to your system, you just
need to start the billing run.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.690
So just click on your
billing information.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:47.870
You have some campaigns in the
billing run, which are, for

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:49.660
example, for January.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.210
We want to start the billing
run for February--

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.210
January, sorry.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:58.170
And you are able to show all
records which are relevant for

00:20:58.170 --> 00:20:59.450
this billing run.

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:04.440
So I just want to show you
this pre-invoices.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.830
I hope there are some.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:11.450
Yeah so now we have three
campaigns, which

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.060
are ready for invoice.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:17.180
You see that there are also
some records in there.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.750
And I can invoice with these
records with just one click.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:29.650
There will be created a new
billing run record with the

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:35.460
invoice sys, and the
invoice numbers.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.100
So these invoice numbers are
generated by the system

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.270
automatically.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:44.530
And you can see all needed
information in these records

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:51.610
here, directly pulled out of
the campaign items and the

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.110
media campaigns, which they
are connected to.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:22:01.460
And you can see the invoice as
a PDF here with this title.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.560
And we can just click of View,
and you see this invoice

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.990
number here.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:09.470
And you have your invoice,
and you can send

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:13.560
it out to your agency.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:18.910
So, yes, that's on my side.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:25.360
I hope this quick overview
helped you get a better

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.700
understanding of how
ADvendio works.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.870
So now I can see me.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.980
I'll hand over to Frederik, and
he will show you a little

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.320
bit more about the API.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.750
FREDERIK LADEWIG: Yes.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:43.490
Hi everyone.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:44.110
I'm Frederik.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:48.930
I'm a software developer at
ADvendio, and responsible for

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.980
the ad server integration
of the DFP ad server.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.020
I'm going to show you
some more detailed--

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.000
some more technical information
about how we

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.080
integrate with the DFP server.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.280
Wait a moment.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:17.390
So basically, we have three
parts of our ADvendio server

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:18.350
integration.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.630
We have the ADvendio app,
which is [INAUDIBLE] in

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:26.260
Salesforce, as you have seen
in Reno's presentation.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:31.530
We have on the other, of
course, the DFP server.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:36.660
And between these two, we have
our middleware, or our ad

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.010
server interface.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:48.890
So you have already seen what
information may be passed from

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:55.300
ADvendio to the web server,
and what functionality is

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:59.120
available for integrating
with the ad server.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:07.510
First of all, we have some
buttons, as you have seen in

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:08.710
Reno's presentation.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.900
We have to check availability
check.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.420
RENO MILEWSKI: Freddy, I think
you have a presentation.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.910
Could you share your
screen with us?

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.080
FREDERIK LADEWIG:
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.270
Wait a moment.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.980
OK, I hope you see my
screen right now.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.236
PAUL RASHIDI: Yes.

00:24:41.236 --> 00:24:43.130
RENO MILEWSKI: Thanks
a lot, Freddy.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:49.320
FREDERIK LADEWIG: OK, then
again, you see the three parts

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.642
of the ADvendio solution.

00:24:53.642 --> 00:24:57.936
We have the ADvendio app on the
left side, the DFP server

00:24:57.936 --> 00:25:03.800
on the right side, and our
middleware in the center.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.470
So what do we do when--

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:12.925
what a customer has to do when
you install ADvendio?

00:25:12.925 --> 00:25:21.340
We have first to set up an
installation [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:27.470
where we transfer all or a lot
of data from the ad server to

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.260
use it in our ADvendio app.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.540
For this, we use, of course, the
company service, or custom

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.050
targeting server or T-values.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:45.360
The inventory service to import
accurate placements and

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:55.450
labels and countries and
regions and cities.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:58.110
We import by using
the publisher

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.510
query language service.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:05.810
So that's our first set-up.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.190
PAUL RASHIDI: I'm
sorry, Freddy.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.800
We're having a little
problem seeing your

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.390
slide on the broadcast.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:12.840
Could you unshared
and reshare?

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:16.860
FREDERIK LADEWIG:
Wait a minute.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:38.430
OK, better now?

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.280
PAUL RASHIDI: It's not.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.330
But go and speak to it.

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:43.920
We'll try and correct
it later.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.750
We can see the slide,
it's just blurry.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:49.640
FREDERIK LADEWIG: OK, maybe
you see the slide now.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.960
But OK, I hope it's--

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.210
OK.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:05.510
OK, let me just show you how
this works together.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:11.680
And we have, as you've seen,
buttons in ADvendio.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:16.820
And I'm going to show you an
example of the forecast of how

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.310
this works in detail.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:23.200
So what happens first-- the user
clicks on this button.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:30.500
And the button calls, via HTTPS,
our Java [INAUDIBLE],

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:35.910
which is hosted of course
in the cloud.

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.240
The Java [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.460
connect back to Salesforce,
loads all data we neat, all

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:46.990
media campaign data, and all
line item and account data

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:49.560
that we need.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:55.550
And when all data is loaded, we
transfer a media campaign

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.240
to a DFP order.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:04.280
And of course, all campaign
items to DFP line items.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:10.010
So when we have down this, we
use of course the forecast

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:16.490
service, and call to the
forecast operation.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:20.290
This message-- this do
forecast message--

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:27.070
gives us back a forecast
object where we get all

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:31.530
available impressions, and
some more information.

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:35.860
We save this information back
to Salesforce through our

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:41.010
ADvendio app, and send
an email to the user.

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:48.538
And the submit to ad server
works almost the same.

00:28:48.538 --> 00:28:54.630
And almost every operation
works in the

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.800
same way like this.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:08.610
Now let's come to the new API,
and how it is compared to

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.820
other APIs from other ad
servers, and especially

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.960
compared to the old DFP API.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:23.920
And what do we like on
the new DFP API.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:29.130
First of all, it's very good
structured, and you can really

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:33.300
intuitively use this API.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.260
Yes, every function and
object [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.600
is understandable.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:44.530
And you see it and know
what it's for.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:48.540
So it's, of course,
state-of-the-art technology

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:51.470
that the API uses.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.945
We have a good data model--

00:29:54.945 --> 00:29:55.430
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.370
data model--

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.390
yeah, it just makes sense.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:06.550
We have no situation where
you're saying, oops, where do

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:08.210
we get the information now?

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.410
I can't find it.

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:19.040
Everything makes sense,
and it's just clear.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.780
And then we have the complete
API documentation.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.852
We have [INAUDIBLE] for every
service, for every function,

00:30:26.852 --> 00:30:28.940
every object that we use.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:34.140
We have documented, and
it's a great help.

00:30:37.038 --> 00:30:41.100
We have test networks--
that's another part.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.440
You don't need to have
a premium account.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.380
You don't really need
to contact Google.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:52.770
You just, as a developer, you
can just create your own test

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:57.180
network and text whatever
you like.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:01.274
Especially at the beginning,
these test networks are a

00:31:01.274 --> 00:31:02.524
great help.

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:13.180
The new DFP API is on some sites
very much more faster

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.840
than the old API.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.890
Especially if you want to do a
targeting, you have to do less

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:26.400
calls to the ad server, and it
makes everything faster.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.613
And of course, we have a
community, we have a forum

00:31:29.613 --> 00:31:34.960
where we can ask and
find answers and

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.550
problems of other users.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:48.652
OK, yes, that was my part.

00:31:48.652 --> 00:31:52.950
And I think you might have
some questions now.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:53.620
PAUL RASHIDI: Great.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.270
Thanks, Freddy.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:58.235
Vincent, did you--

00:31:58.235 --> 00:32:00.190
I know you had a
few questions.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:01.440
Do you want to ask him first?

00:32:06.043 --> 00:32:08.020
NADJA STREISS: I think
he's on mute.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.600
PAUL RASHIDI: Yeah,
I think he is.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.730
So, while he works through
that, I'll just ask--

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:16.810
it seemed like, from a reporting
perspective, you can

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.986
report on campaigns before and
after the upgrade, which I

00:32:19.986 --> 00:32:24.620
know is very important for the
pubs that are upgrading.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.670
Could you talk a little bit
more about how your

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:30.460
reporting does that?

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:31.010
FREDERIK LADEWIG: Oh, yes.

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.020
That's quite easy.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:39.330
Since we just replaced the IDs
of the old campaigns and the

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:45.490
old orders by the new ones, we
just have the nudge columns in

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:52.680
the report where we get the
delivery data before the

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.570
update, before the change.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:03.410
And together with the new,
more recent data.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.690
And so, yeah, it's quite easy.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:10.550
We only have to use these nudge
columns, and get all

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.920
report data we need.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.540
PAUL RASHIDI: Great, great.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.100
So it's just one continuous
report.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.380
You deal with the data.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.600
The data changes on
your side, right?

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.400
FREDERIK LADEWIG: Right.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.910
PAUL RASHIDI: Perfect.

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:26.620
The only other thing I wanted
to mention is during Reno's

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:33.090
presentation, he went through
the geo-targeting selection,

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:37.170
and then also showed us the
key value selection.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:40.120
So one of the things that I
think you guys do in the

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.600
background is you actually
cache all those values in

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.422
order to basically make the
UI as fast as it was.

00:33:48.422 --> 00:33:49.910
Can you just verify that?

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:51.360
I thought that was true.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.350
I just wanted to make sure.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:54.960
FREDERIK LADEWIG: Yes.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:02.030
We provide the functionality to
import key values and geo

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:08.230
data from the DFP ad server, and
so we can store it in our

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.730
Salesforce app.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:18.150
And the user can access every
data they have in the ad

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.530
server, in the DFP server.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:20.889
PAUL RASHIDI: Perfect.

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:23.060
So there's no double-syncing
going on, or

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.370
anything like that.

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:26.429
You just pull all the data,
and make it immediately

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:29.150
available on Salesforce.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.139
NADJA STREISS: Yes, we have.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:32.389
Basically it.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:36.260
PAUL RASHIDI: Vincent,
have you got

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.130
your audio issue resolved?

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.920
Maybe not.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.410
FREDERIK LADEWIG: Oh,
I don't think so.

00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:47.270
NADJA STREISS: Doesn't
look like.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:49.706
PAUL RASHIDI: All right.

00:34:49.706 --> 00:34:52.440
So I'll just ask a quick--

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.350
one of his quick questions.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:57.550
So I think he had--

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:02.720
on chat he's telling me, what
was one of the most difficult

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:08.300
API services to work
with, and why?

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:12.150
FREDERIK LADEWIG: I don't
think that we had much

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:17.460
difficulties with
any ad service.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.110
In the beginning, we had
some problems with

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.370
the line item service.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:25.930
But right now, all problems
were changed.

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:29.970
We had some problems that not
all features were supported.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:36.620
But right now, I think every
service is active.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:37.614
PAUL RASHIDI: Great.

00:35:37.614 --> 00:35:38.400
FREDERIK LADEWIG: --usable.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.570
PAUL RASHIDI: I always like to
ask to see how we can improve.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:48.130
So I think one of his other
questions was, are there any

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.570
features you'd like to
see us add to the

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:51.830
DFP API in the future?

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:58.100
FREDERIK LADEWIG: I personally
would like to see a feature

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:04.576
where you can ask over the API
what features are available in

00:36:04.576 --> 00:36:06.090
what network.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:11.850
For example, I think you have
some features that you have to

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:15.060
activate for every network.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:19.190
And the networks are
somehow different.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:22.890
Sometimes we have problems
with different network

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:24.050
configurations.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:31.290
So I think we would like is a
better functionality to ask a

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:36.760
network what feature
is activated.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.140
PAUL RASHIDI: That
sounds fair.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.290
That way, you could essentially
do an initial

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:44.580
check when you connect to a
network to make sure that you

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.880
have all the permissions you
need, and things like that.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.130
Correct.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.070
OK, great.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.600
I don't think we got
Vincent back.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:59.380
So I don't have any
more questions.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.630
Oh, we can--

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.190
Great.

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:10.290
All right.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:15.120
Well, thank you very much for
joining us, ADvendio, Nadja,

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.750
Reno, and Frederik.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.940
So I guess we'll go ahead
and sign off.

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.380
FREDERIK LADEWIG: Yes.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.010
PAUL RASHIDI: Thanks
a lot, guys.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:24.850
NADJA STREISS: Have
a good day.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:26.100
FREDERIK LADEWIG: Bye.

00:37:32.915 --> 00:38:51.747
