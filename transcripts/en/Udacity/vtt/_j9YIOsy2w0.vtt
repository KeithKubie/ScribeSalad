00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.737
Based on this long division we just did then, we can see that we divide x cubed

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:11.729
minus 4x squared plus x plus 6, by x minus 2, we get what we wrote up here. x

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:15.496
squared minus 2x minus 3. I wonder then, if there's a new way that we can write

00:00:15.496 --> 00:00:19.516
this original expression, the one we started out with. So, think about what we

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:22.996
could do to both sides of this equation right here, to get our original

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:28.476
expression, the cubic polynomial, by itself on the left hand side. What that

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:31.220
would be on the right hand side of the equation? This will be a new way of

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.833
expressing what we have on the left.
