00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:17.000
When it comes to anxiety disorders, there is no 'one type'. Each form of anxiety has its own set of symptoms and treatments

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.440
It is important to remember that, while some symptoms will overlap. No two anxiety disorders are alike

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.709
This list aims to bring attention to the five major anxiety disorders, and what they mean for the sufferers

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.508
We at psych2go hope to bring awareness to the growing number of anxiety sufferers and their needs

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.029
So, without further ado, here's five anxiety disorders as well as their symptoms and treatments

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.900
Number one: obsessive compulsive disorder or OCD

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.659
Obsessive compulsive disorder technically has two components: the obsessions and the compulsions

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.768
Obsessions can encompass anything from a severe fear of germs to the placement of things around the home and many things in between

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.330
The compulsions are what the sufferer does to rid themselves of those obsessive thoughts

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.320
Someone who has obsessions about germs may ritually wash their hands or carry hand sanitizer everywhere they go

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.440
Someone who has obsessive thoughts about the placement of objects might arrange and rearrange their belongings until they feel just right

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.800
These obsessions and compulsions can become very intruisive and disrupted to the sufferers daily life

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.100
As far as treatments for OCD go, there are a couple:

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.180
There are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine sertraline

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.720
These medications are meant to help alleviate the symptoms for the sufferer so that they are at a manageable and less destructive level

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.880
The other widely used treatment is psychotherapy

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:42.920
With this, you might run into cognitive behavioral therapy that will be used to help the sufferer essentially reprogram their response to obsessions and compulsions

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.560
For the most part, medications and therapies are used in tandem to get the best results

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.480
Number two: generalized anxiety disorder

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.750
Generalized anxiety disorder or GED is a bit unlike the other anxiety disorders on this list

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.560
Those who suffer from GED aren't always able to give a reason for their symptoms

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.200
In fact, one of the symptoms is a general feel of restlessness or an ease

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.760
They may also experience worry as one of the symptoms

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.420
Everyone worries from time to time, but GED causes the sufferer to eternalize those worries and take them to an entirely new level

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.100
They may think of them in an obsessive manner which will cause a downward spiral of other symptoms such as a disturbance in sleep patterns

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.320
The treatments available for GED are similar to those of OCD

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.540
Medications and therapy. Though in this case the medications may be benzodiazepines and antidepressants rather than the run-of-the-mill SSRIs

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.070
Cognitive behavioral therapy is used with GED as well as relaxation techniques and mindfulness

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.459
Number three: social anxiety disorder

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.340
Those with social anxiety disorder experienced panic attacks related to social situations

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.540
This can manifest in a fear of public speaking or stage fright, and can be so severe that they avoid going into public altogether

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.130
Social anxiety can also have symptoms of severe self-consciousness and a general fear of being around others

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.760
Someone with social anxiety might find it hard to speak when other people are present even if they aren't addressing the crowd as a whole

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.520
Social anxiety is mainly treated with SSRIs and therapy

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.260
As we stated before, just because a treatment option looks similar from one anxiety to another it isn't going to be the same

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.980
Each sufferer presents their own needs that must be taken into account. Each therapy isn't going to work the same for each individual

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.240
Personalization of treatment is key in these situations

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.580
Number four: panic disorder

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.769
Unlike the other anxiety disorders on this list, panic disorder rests solely on panic attacks

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:45.209
With many other anxiety disorders, panic attacks are just another symptom when it comes to panic disorder those attacks are the symptom

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.660
Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent panic attacks

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:55.220
The sufferer may experience heart palpitations, erasing pulse an intense fear and the feeling that they are hopelessly out of control

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.820
There isn't a rhyme or reason to many of these attacks, so the sufferer is essentially lying in wait for the next one to come

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.300
Panic disorder can be treated in many ways

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.460
The medications used are some that we've heard of such as benzodiazepines and SSRIs

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:17.260
We are also introduced to serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or SNRIs and beta blockers

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.980
These medications, as with OCD, are often used in conjunction with therapy to help maximize the usefulness of each

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.360
Number 5: post-traumatic stress disorder

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.560
Post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD can be diagnosed in anyone

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.120
For the most part you have probably heard it, when someone speaks about veterans or police officers

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.040
While those careers have a higher rate of PTSD, it is in fact true that anyone can be diagnosed with it

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.940
PTSD is the result of a very traumatic event or series of events

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.340
This leaves the sufferer with flashbacks and night terrors where they feel as if they are right back in the event again

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.700
The sufferer may also suffer from panic attacks as well as phobias associated with people places or even sounds

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.180
Medications such as fluoxetine venlafaxine may be used in the treatment of PTSD

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:12.020
Therapies such as prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy, and brief eclectic psychotherapy may be utilized as well

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.980
Again, this is a situation where the use of medications and therapy together can help give a better outcome than just one alone

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.719
It is important to note that those with PTSD can lash out in certain situations

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.180
But there is no need to be afraid of the sufferers

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.940
There is nothing inherently dangerous about them

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.960
In fact those with mental illness are exponentially more likely to be the victims of violent crimes than they are to be the perpetrator

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.120
This is not a complete list of the different anxiety disorders out there by any means, nor is it completely comprehensive in each description

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.830
There are many kinds of anxiety, these just happen to be the most talked about and diagnosed at this particular moment

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:56.270
Regardless of which anxiety disorder the diagnosis is for, it is important to remember that the sufferer is in need of help and acceptance

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.450
You don't have to understand anxiety to be able to offer an ear to talk to, or some words to keep them grounded in the moment

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.000
Remind the sufferer that they are alright, that what they are feeling are just symptoms of their anxiety and that it will pass if given the time

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.640
Aside from that, just make sure that they know you are there with them and wait it out

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.520
Do you suffer from one or more of the disorders listed?
