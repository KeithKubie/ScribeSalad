00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.230
Again quickly reviewing because
this is so key to what follows.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.850
US healthcare is highly uncoordinated
because so many specialized physicians

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.800
are involved in the care of patients
with multiple chronic diseases.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.079
One reason is that we have
such a small percentage,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.369
only around 12% of
primary care physicians.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.028
Other countries, such as Australia,
France and Canada,

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:28.730
have around 50% of
primary care physicians.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.470
The resulting problems
are not theoretical.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.352
The more physicians they see, 4 or
more versus 1 to 2 physicians,

00:00:36.352 --> 00:00:40.816
more chronic disease patients
report being seen by a physician

00:00:40.816 --> 00:00:44.230
with an incomplete or missing record.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.370
There's similar data for medical errors.
