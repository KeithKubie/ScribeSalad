00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:32.100
- We are the paradoxical ape, bipedal,
naked, large-brained, long the master of

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:39.720
fire, tools, and language, but still
trying to understand ourselves. Aware

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:48.830
that death is inevitable, yet filled with
optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand down

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:56.110
knowledge. We empathize and deceive. We
shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.510
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.320
to exchange insights on who we are and how
we got here, an exploration made possible

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.048
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:27.555
- [Elizabeth Hadly] I particularly
appreciate being invited because

00:02:27.555 --> 00:02:31.761
I'm not a paleoanthropologist, and
I don't really study climate specifically.

00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:36.040
Instead what I'm going to do is give you
the perspective of the other

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.386
animals that occupy the earth,
these small animals,

00:02:39.386 --> 00:02:43.700
large animals, and I'm gonna definitely
delve us into the future and ask some

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.450
tough questions about our population. So I
titled my talk somewhat provocatively

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.920
about tipping points, and tipping points
are ...they're situations of a state where

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.180
you have a non-linear kind of system, and
when you move beyond some particular point

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.310
in that non-linear system, you can't go
back to where you started. I'm gonna

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.050
advocate that we're poised on the edge of
tipping point for planet earth. So when

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.810
some threshold is crossed and the question
is are we about ready to cross it or have

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.890
we already, the system is gonna move into
a new state, and the example I put up here

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.320
is an egg about ready to go off the edge.
Ice melting in the Arctic might be another

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.380
one to think about. So mass extinction is,
I've been asked before whether or not the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.450
earth has shown tipping points, we know
they happen in tons, they happen in small

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.430
ecosystems. But mass extinctions in fact
can happen on the planetary scale. We

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.230
already saw this mass extinction graphic.
They're labeled there. The old divisions.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.650
Silurian, the late Devonian, the Permo
Triassic where we lost 95% of all the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.010
species on the planet. The Triassic
Jurassic and the KT where we

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.920
lost dinosaurs and a lot of marine
reptiles. The point is that these are mass

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.730
extinctions, and you'll see in every case,
there's a drop, a drop in diversity. This

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.570
is generic marine diversity. So this is a
marine record, not a terrestrial one. But

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.740
the point is, is that when it recovers,
and it takes between five and 10 million

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.990
years for life to recover after these mass
extinctions, life is completely different.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.580
We've lost these organisms that founded
the diversity on the planet prior to the

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.720
extinction, and they don't come back. So
it reassembles. It is in fact a new state.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.590
So the Earth is warming rapidly. You've
seen many versions of this, but I'm

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.560
providing here a little bit of a
perspective about ...from our perspective.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.150
So we're here on this graphic, all of
those different color squiggles showed

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.720
difference in areas depending on what
models are used by IPCC. We will be here.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.780
Now you've heard a lot about the evolution
of humans, modern humans. By the time we

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.080
get to that point in 2050, we will have
planetary, global planetary temperatures

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.400
warmer than our species has ever
experienced on its time on Earth. And if

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:21.550
we happen to make it to 2100 and to
temperatures somewhat above four degrees,

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.520
Earth has not been as hot as that
projected temperature in 14 million years.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.480
Now the perspective is, and this is one
I'm giving you, mammal species don't live

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.340
that long. We don't have mammal species on
the planet that are 14 million years old.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:46.150
So the memory of this climate in the
genomes of this species is gone. World

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.950
population is still growing. Now there
will be 9 billion people on the planet by

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:00.770
2045. So 2045 here, there will be nine
billion people, and if we don't, if we

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.960
continue at ...these are current fertility
rates shown in that upper blue, current

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.460
fertility rates, you can imagine, I mean
15 million people on the planet.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.740
Unbelievable. In fact, fertility rates are
slowing, but not fast enough. We would

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.100
have to, instead of replacing ourselves a
male and a female with two children, we

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.820
would have to go down to just point five
children per person to follow the lower

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.410
blue curve. So human population growth is
the elephant in the room. It is

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:39.240
tremendously terrifying. So even though
the late Quaternary transition from the

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.920
Pleistocene, the cold era Pleistocene to
the warmer, more wetter Holocene, is not

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.110
exactly analogous, and in fact very
different in many ways to the kinds of

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.970
climate we're experiencing today. In fact
there are two similar features. One, we

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.520
are warming the environment as we move
from the Pleistocene to the Holocene, and

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.680
we're also expanding as humans. We're
colonizing the globe. So those two

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.340
features are in fact something we share
with what's happening today. So you heard

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.260
a little bit about these dramatic warming
and cooling events. Here's the bowling

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.580
arrow rod and then followed by an abrupt
younger dry as a cooling event that saw

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.850
the extinction, for example, of Irish elk
in Ireland as that environment cooled

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.500
rapidly. And then we end up into what's
called the Holocene are really about the

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:33.450
last 10,000 or so years of relatively
constant temperatures. However, we

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:39.620
expanded in this latter part of the
Quaternary. We left Africa around 200,000

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:47.470
years ago. We colonized Europe and Asia.
We colonized Australia, somewhere between

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.130
40 and 60,000 years ago. And then we made
it to the Americas last, somewhere between

00:07:52.130 --> 00:08:00.480
13 and 35,000 years ago. Now with our
colonization of these isolated areas, we

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.850
caused extinctions. This is a photo. This
beautiful image is the menagerie of

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:11.860
animals that used to roam in North
America, and are now no longer here. There

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:17.820
are gopathirs, giant ground slogs,
glyptodons. There's the giant bison.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:24.020
Camels, which basically evolved in North
America, left, colonized Asia, colonized

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.580
South America, and went extinct to North
America. And then horses, which again have

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.800
millions of years of history in North
America, and went extinct, only to be

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.800
recolonized by Spanish explorers
historically. About half the world large

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:45.560
animals, animals larger than 44 kilograms
or about 100 pounds, went extinct at this

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:52.250
time. Incidentally, humans are about that
size. So it's not just our impact that

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:58.350
caused change in animal distributions and
abundance. In fact, there are some small

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:04.760
mammals, like this bog lemming that went
extinct at this Pleistocene-Holocene

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:14.250
transition. So we know that ice covered
much of Canada, and there was no place for

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:19.620
these bog lemmings to live. Every one of
those black dots you see in North America

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.990
were occupied by bog lemmings during the
Pleistocene. They're no longer found

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:29.930
really in the lower 48. In fact, what they
are, they're occupying this orange range

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:35.420
up here. They are really an ardic
sacamordic [sp] species. So they responded

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.820
as you'd expect a species that likes a
relatively cold environment. As the ice

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.840
left, they tracked that environment
northwards. But not all species responded

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:50.690
that way. These are two images of two
species that are found in a cave called

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.300
Samwel Cave that I excavated several years
ago in Northern California shown by the

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.850
black dot there. These two species didn't
really respond north. In fact, they

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:06.750
contracted their ranges to higher
elevation but also much weather

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:12.290
environment that's currently found in
Samwel Cave today, which is located on the

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:17.060
shores of Lake Shasta. So these animals,
the mountain beaver, it's not confined to

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:23.350
mountains, nor is it a beaver. It is the
remnant, the last species of what was a

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:29.250
very large group of species in the family
Aplodontia, which is a very ancient North

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:35.720
American family of rodents, and it is the
only species left in the family today. It

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.580
cannot ...it's very primitive, and it
cannot concentrate its urine. And so it

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:46.500
has to be by running fresh water all day,
all the time. And so you find them

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:52.130
confined into very dense, old growth
Douglas fir forests along the coasts in

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:56.620
the Pacific northwest, a very ancient
lineage that is threatened by warming

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:04.190
temperatures and dry conditions. The other
animal you see is the white footed vole.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:08.860
Very little is known about this animal,
except the fact that it is somewhat

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:14.210
arboreal, and it's found in deciduous
trees and probably up in this old growth

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:19.080
Doug fir forests. Again this animal
contracted with the Doug fir forests and

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:25.180
warm weather condition, not so much higher
up in elevation. Animals today are moving

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:31.440
northward, just like they did in the
Pleistocene. This is a range map of the

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.880
current distribution in 2013, the black
line is the current distribution of the

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.370
armadillo. The armadillo is related to
that glyptodon, that giant thing I showed

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:46.910
you in the previous slide. It's a South
American animal, and it is expanding. It

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:54.060
made it across the Rio Grande in 1850, and
it's expanding northward. It's limited by

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.490
winter temperatures, so if there are 24
freeze days or more, this animal can't

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:04.520
survive. Its young can't survive. And
what's happening is as our North American

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.300
climates are warming, this animal is
progressively colonizing further and

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:15.310
further north. And so what you see not the
excess, but every other symbol on this are

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:21.040
instances where armadillos have advanced
beyond their 2013 static range. Be

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.380
interesting to know where there are after
this winter. However, the thing about this

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.870
that I wanna point out is not just that
animals respond the way you predict they

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:34.010
would based on what we know from fossils,
but the other thing is this particular

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:38.770
animal, the armadillo, is the only mammal
we know about in the world that carries

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:45.260
leprosy. And so this is an example of this
unexpected synergistic things that can in

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:51.210
fact impact humans in ways we don't
anticipate. Actually they got leprosy from

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:59.510
us. Leprosy evolved in Asia, most likely
India, and they contracted leprosy from

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:05.400
us, probably somewhere around Louisiana,
but this animal can transmit leprosy to

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:11.350
humans as well. So similarly to what I
explained to you about the mountain beaver

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:16.670
and the white footed vole, animals will
find their proper environments. And so

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:21.040
it's not just that they moved further
north, they ...as warming conditions

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:26.640
prevail and as drying conditions prevail,
they'll also move up an elevation. So many

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.670
of you might have heard about the pikas.
This is one of the Asian species. There

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:37.820
are in fact 28 Asian species of pikas.
They're related to rabbits and hares.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:42.690
They're just most wonderful thing to work
with. They have this enormously

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:47.260
interesting physiology. They have a
resting body temperature of about 104

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:55.380
degrees, and they live really high in the
Himalayas. They live above 15,000 feet.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.630
Now the problem with ...so we've been
studying these particular animals all

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:05.280
along the Himalayan front in India and
Nepal, and it turns out that only some of

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.570
these species can tolerate the hypoxic
conditions that are characteristic of that

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:15.050
high elevation. So these particular
animals, and in fact they've shown to be

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:20.890
moving up much more rapidly than American
pikas, of which have moved up around a 150

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:27.250
meters. In the Himalayas, they have moved
up at least a thousand meters, and they're

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:32.590
pinched, right, from above because of
those hypoxic conditions, and from below

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:37.920
from warming, and also human alteration of
their environment. Now another kind of

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:43.120
unexpected example, and again to
demonstrate just what ecosystems mean in

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.260
terms of how species are connected. This
is the map you see on the left is a map of

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.370
the distribution of, on present, the
whitebark pine distribution in North

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:59.850
America. White bark pine is a high
elevation pine. It's the last conifer that

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:03.700
until you get to tree lines, which the
thing you often see in krummholz in the

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.220
Rocky Mountains. It's a five-needle pine,
and it has this really, really nice

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:14.230
calorically rich nuts in the cone.
If we just look at climate models for the

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:19.852
distribution of the whitebark pine and you
can go to 2030, 2016, 2090, you can see by

00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:27.016
2090, there's barely any whitebark pine
left in the lower 48. Now that projection

00:15:27.016 --> 00:15:29.120
was made before we saw what happened with
the mountain pine beetle. For those of you

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:35.899
that have traveled anywhere in the Rocky
Mountains, you know that in the last

00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:42.151
decade, conifer forests, all the way up to
tree line, have been decimated. In the

00:15:42.151 --> 00:15:47.982
Yellow Stone region, in some of these
areas, white bark pine are down 80%. This

00:15:47.982 --> 00:15:51.558
is a photo from one of the high elevation
areas that I worked in in Yellow Stone,

00:15:51.558 --> 00:15:57.410
and you can see a lot of standing dead
trees. Now, okay, so that's because the

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.430
beetles are allowed to survive over the
winter. It's not killed off. It's a native

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:06.120
beetle. The climate is definitely,
definitely implicated in expansion of this

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.960
beetle. It's now goes all the way up to
tree line. It's not killed off, and it

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:15.220
probably reproduces several times per
year, instead of having to recolonize

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.840
every year. But why is that? Why do I have
a picture of a grizzly bear? It turns out

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:26.250
that the number of whitebark pine cones in
a tree is directly correlated with over

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:33.050
winter survival of adult bears and their
cubs. And it's indirectly correlated with

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:38.470
problem bears the following summer. So
when there's not a lot, in some cases they

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:44.010
may eat 40 to 50% of their fat is a result
of eating these middens of

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:48.520
cones. They're mostly ...again, another
player in this sort of Clark nut crackers

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.930
and the red squirrels here, but these
grizzly bears need this to pack on the

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:56.930
fat. And what happens is they come out of
hibernation earlier, and they start

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:02.030
getting into trouble looking for food in
human dwellings. So again, an

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:08.870
unanticipated and kind of surprising but
very major impact from climate change. The

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:13.440
other thing that happens in ...these are
data I'm not showing you the actual data,

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.230
but during the Pleistocene-Holocene
transition, one of these ...there were

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.770
lots of different small mammals in the
Samwel Cave site in Northern California I

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.760
talked about, but the animal that just
took over that site is the deer mouse,

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:32.860
Peromyscus maniculatus. And in fact this
animal has dominated the entire Holocene

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:40.330
assemblage. So the community structure of
small mammals change just ...and this is

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:45.960
not due to human hunting. This is due to
the fact there are many more disturbed

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:51.310
environments in the Holocene. This animal
has very high intrinsic rates of growth.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.970
They don't care what the environment is.
They don't mind if it's just been burned.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:59.250
They don't mind if it's the edge of a
field or if it's an old growth forest.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:04.880
They like disturbance. This animal is the
most commonly trapped small mammal in

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.980
North America. So if you lay a trap out
there anywhere outside of human

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.670
habitation, you're likely to catch this
guy. It also tends to carry a lot of

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:19.380
diseases. So this is a witty species, and
it thrives with human environments. And

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.850
the specialist species are the ones that
take a nosedive. Now I'm sure there are

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.560
some of you that are gardeners here, and
they don't consider this pocket gopher as

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:32.170
a particularly favorable friend in their
garden, but in fact these guys took a hit

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:38.080
at the end of the Pleistocene. This is the
pocket gopher. It has fur-lined cheek

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:44.190
pouches, and it stores its seeds and digs.
In fact this is a specialist species. It

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:49.270
is so energy expense ...energetically
expensive to live underground. It takes

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:55.610
between 360 and 3400 times the energy to
do this and to move the same distance

00:18:55.610 --> 00:19:01.340
above ground. This is by any account a
very specialist species. So they declined.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:06.640
Humans are directly causing the extinction
of animals. We've lost, or threatened to

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.940
lose almost a quarter of our species. I
just read an article that said we're

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:14.050
...about a third of our bird species in
Europe are threatened. Most of these are

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:18.900
from hunting. We're about ready to see the
loss of elephants in the next decade or

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:24.600
two. One out of every 12 elephants was
killed in just the last three years. This

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:31.750
is a crisis. 51% of humans, of the
terrestrial land has been co-opted for

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:36.170
human use. The only places left on this
map that aren't shown in purple are

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:42.870
deserts and tropical forests. Those are
the least easily farmed land on the

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.690
planet, but they're also in some ways,
especially the tropical forests, some of

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:52.310
the most important. Everywhere else, we
have made a mark. We have an extinction

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:57.190
debt and we will lose a lot of
biodiversity in the near future. I get

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:02.670
asked a lot, can speciation rescue
biodiversity? Absolutely not. Species take

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:08.480
between two and five million years, this
is mammal species, to evolve, so we can

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.450
cause them to disappear in a decade or
two, but it takes millions of years to

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:16.990
accumulate the diversity we might have
lost. So how do we avoid this tipping

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:22.300
point? This planetary tipping point? We
increase energy conversion obviously. We

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:28.260
stall habitat loss. We increase global
cooperation. This has got to be done

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:33.760
globally, and we stabilize population
growth. And finally, how do you stabilize

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.270
population growth? I get asked what is the
most ... In my opinion, the single most

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:44.750
important thing for us to do is to educate
women globally. And the reason is because

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:52.210
as education goes up, fertility rate goes
down. The more girls that are in school,

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:56.540
secondary school, the number of years is
really important, the more fertility rates

00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:05.510
go down. And interestingly, GDP and
poverty rates also go up. Human innovation

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:09.830
is remarkable. We can see the origin of
the universe. I can't believe we can't see

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:13.010
the origin of the universe, and we can see
ourselves in our beautiful planet from

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:17.890
space. Why can't we avoid the next tipping
point? Thank you.

00:21:27.923 --> 00:21:31.510
- [Naomi Oreskes] I'm often told that my
talks are very depressing. So I'm pleased

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.622
to follow Liz Hadly, who's talk was
even more depressing than mine.

00:21:35.397 --> 00:21:36.899
If we didn't already have enough to worry

00:21:36.899 --> 00:21:40.251
about, now we have to worry about
armadillos carrying leprosy.

00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:46.009
So I was given an assignment for this

00:21:46.009 --> 00:21:50.810
meeting, and it was very upbeat question.
Will we survive the future? So I'm happy

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.010
to say that I actually have a positive
answer to that question. The answer is

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:59.340
yes. I do believe we will survive. As Liz
just showed us, we're a much greater

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:04.090
threat to other species than other species
are to us. And short of a meteorite impact

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:08.890
hitting ours I think that the odds that
humans as a species will survive are

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:13.010
probably very great at least for the
foreseeable future. It seems to me the

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:17.180
more relevant question though is how will
we survive, and particularly in what

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:21.720
condition? Anthropogenic climate
disruption and its companion threat of

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.420
ocean acidification threatens to reverse
the developmental gains of the past 50

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:31.130
years, decreasing the quality of life and
wealthy nations and pushing still more of

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:36.380
the world's poor as well as other species
to the edge of survival. The President of

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:41.040
the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, has recently
noted that climate change is a fundamental

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.400
threat to development, one that threatens
to reverse 50 years of progress. So what

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:51.220
will a future of unmitigated climate
change look like? Not just physically, but

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.990
socially, economically, and politically?
This was the question that Erik Conway and

00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:00.770
I set out to answer in our book that also
has a very optimistic title, "The Collapse

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:07.040
of Western Civilization." The book takes
place in the year 2393, when a historian

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:12.540
looks back on our present and asks the
question, "How was it that they knew so

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:18.270
much about what was happening to them, had
so much good scientific information, and

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:23.830
yet did so little to prevent it?" The year
is 2393, the occasion is the commemoration

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:28.780
of the Great Collapse of 2093. I wanted to
read to you from the book, but time

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:32.280
doesn't permit that, so I'll just
summarize the argument and hope you'll go

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.640
and buy the book, which only costs 6.95,
and it's Kindle edition.

00:23:37.347 --> 00:23:40.127
So first our historian recounts what

00:23:40.127 --> 00:23:44.260
happened in the Great Collapse. It begins
with the collapse of the west end Arctic

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:50.530
ice sheet, and this physical collapse then
ramifies into social dislocation and the

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:56.010
collapse of economic and political
systems. Then she tries to answer why

00:23:56.010 --> 00:24:00.970
question, "Why did people let this
happen?" And she argues that the grip of

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:05.380
free market ideologies, combined with
scientists' failure to communicate what

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:11.310
was truly at stake, created a disabling
paralysis. So my question today is, how do

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:16.480
we avoid that future? The question of what
kind of future we will have is really the

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.890
question of whether we are capable of
addressing the problems that are before

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:27.140
our eyes. And this, of course, is not a
new question. Indeed, I would argue it's

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:32.980
the Malthusian question. In 1798 as most
of you know, Thomas Malthus asked the

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:39.560
question, "Can the Enlightenment project
work?" By that he meant, can we reasonably

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:46.900
expect to improve the condition of
mankind? And his short answer was no. And

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:51.120
for this reason, Malthus is often
considered an anti-Enlightenment

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:57.120
philosopher. He rejected it's impossible
and even misguided the Enlightenment

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:03.720
aspiration to achieve the perfectability
of man and of society. He even doubted the

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:09.420
possibility of long-term and sustained
improvement. Now most of us also know why

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:13.500
Malthus came to this pessimistic
conclusion. It was what he called the

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:19.350
positive checks. Positive in the sense of
absolutely positively certain. And those

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:25.060
with the checks of famine and disease and
the misery and mortality that ensued from

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:32.640
them. Now most of us also know that,
happily, Malthus was wrong, and it's

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.840
generally taken to be received wisdom that
the main reason he was wrong was because

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:43.080
he failed to appreciate the empowering
effects of technological innovation. The

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.750
19th and 20th century saw technology
enabling a number of key developments that

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:52.120
helped to stave off the Malthusian
disaster that he imagined. The most

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.940
important, of course, was increased food
production, but also arguably, equally

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:02.000
important, better public health through
sanitation and vaccination, which led in

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.110
turn to the greater survival of children.
And the survival of children, along with

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:12.180
the education of women and the development
of technologies, available technologies of

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.880
population control, allowed many of the
nations of the world to bring their

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:22.670
fertility rates down without the misery or
vice that Malthus feared.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:27.380
Because of this success, because of how
much technology played a role in the

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:33.040
development of the western world in the
last 250 to 300 years, technological

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.990
success has become a foundational tenant
in many of our beliefs, particularly those

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:42.050
of us living in wealthy industrialized
technologically endowed nations, where we

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:48.040
have benefited the most from these
technological successes. Indeed, our

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:52.680
belief in technology is so foundational
that we can name several philosophies that

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:58.120
express this belief. So, for example,
technophilia, the love of technology.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.840
Cornucopianism, the belief in the
continued productivity of technological

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:07.860
innovation. Technofidiesm or faith in
technology. And more recently something

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:13.600
I've been calling disruptivism, a belief
in the power of disruptive technologies.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.550
In fact these philosophies are so powerful
that some of them even have their own

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:22.360
bibles. So some of you are familiar with
the Bible of Cornucopianism, the book, The

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:27.800
Resourceful Earth. Now one of the things I
find most interesting in ...about faith in

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:32.160
technology is that it cuts across party
and ideological lines. In fact I would

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.060
argue it's one of the few things in
western culture that does. So the

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:41.050
cornucopians are mostly conservatives and
neoliberals. They have confidence in human

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:46.000
ingenuity and the capacity of the
marketplace to do its magic. The

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.412
technofidiest tend to be traditional
Republicans, Democrats,

00:27:49.412 --> 00:27:53.357
and what I call paleoliberals.
As opposed to neoliberals.

00:27:54.332 --> 00:27:56.873
I guess we have to have mesoliberals,
too, but I haven't figured

00:27:56.873 --> 00:28:01.110
out who they are yet. Technofidiest
tend to believe in government investment

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:05.940
in technological R&amp;D. And then there's the
disruptivists, who I haven't quite figured

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.070
out what they believe in, but they talked
about the need for disruptive technologies

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:15.110
but without specifying how those
technologies come to exist. But all agree

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:19.880
on the crucial role of technology. What
they disagree about is how we get it. So

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.870
liberals tend to focus on education and
research particularly in great research

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:28.080
universities and institutions like this
one and UCSD across the street.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:32.190
Conservatives stress free market economics
and entrepreneurship, and these

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.947
disruptivists don't say.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.540
But here's the rub, and actually there are
several rubs. I'm a historian. There's

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:45.340
never only one answer. The first rub is
what I'm calling the cargo cult mentality,

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.050
and we have anthropologists in the
audience, so I hope they'll appreciate

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:53.210
what I mean by this. When you listen to
the advocates of technological solutions

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:57.650
to climate change, no matter of the left
or right or in between, one is struck by

00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:03.050
the similarity to anthropological
descriptions of the cargo cult. By that I

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:07.290
mean we are waiting for the goods to
arrive, but we have no coherent plan how

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:11.710
to get them. The cornucopians, for the
cornucopians I would ask, but what if the

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:17.160
market doesn't do its magic? To the
technofidiests I would ask, but what if

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:22.340
basic research doesn't translate into
usable technologies? And to the

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.820
disruptivitists, what if the climate
disruption arrives before the

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:30.990
technological one? The second rub, much of
this discussion ignores what we have

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:36.100
learned or should have learned from
experience. It ignores what we know from

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.990
the history of technology about how
transformative technologies became normal

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:44.820
parts of our lives. Now I live with
historians, and historians don't like big

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.750
generalizations. There are no laws of
history, and we tend to focus on the

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:52.670
specifics of individual developments and
cases and cultures because we know they're

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:57.260
all different, but there is a
generalization I think is broadly true

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:02.370
about technology in the 20th century. And
that is that none of the transformative

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:07.570
technologies of the 20th century were
produced either by market-based mechanisms

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:14.130
alone or entirely by government R&amp;D
either. Rather, nearly all the transform

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:17.520
of technologies of the 20th century
involved government private sector

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:22.000
partnerships, and here's just a short
list. I couldn't fit them all on a slide,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.470
but just some examples. Rural
electrification, the development of

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:31.020
telephone and telegraph, aviation and air
traffic control, nuclear power, the

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.400
Internet, digital computing, space
technologies, pollution control

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:39.390
technologies, all formed by
government-private sector partnerships. In

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:43.130
fact, the only two exceptions I could come
up with, and being at this institute I

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:47.449
have to mention the polio vaccine
and the contraceptive pill,

00:30:47.449 --> 00:30:50.990
also developed largely here in
southern California. These

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:54.450
were private-private partnerships, but
we're one half of the partnership was

00:30:54.450 --> 00:31:00.850
philanthropic rather than private sector
entrepreneurial. Electricity is a very

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.760
well-studied case in point. We know a lot
about the history of the development of

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:09.310
electricity. We know that entrepreneurship
brought electricity to most Americans in

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:14.050
major cities, but it took governmental
initiative to bring it to rural citizens,

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:18.280
and that's true in other countries as
well. In fact, most other countries have

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:22.690
rural electricity before the United States
did because their governments were less

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:26.610
reluctant to get involved, and because
they viewed electricity as a common good

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:31.440
rather than as a commodity. The third
problem is what I'm calling the problem of

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:36.980
persistence forecasting, and by that I
mean assuming that the future will be like

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:43.170
the past. Technology has led the way in
many radical changes in the way we live,

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:47.590
but will it be up to the challenge of
anthropogenic climate change? The Zen

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:51.193
masters have said that technology makes
major contributions

00:31:51.193 --> 00:31:52.784
to the minor needs of men.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.920
Now I think that might be a bit strong,
having a warm, safely lit house and clean

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:06.020
water and good food would seem to be more
than minor needs. But still, in a world of

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:12.470
laptops and iPhones, one may well wonder
are we getting the technologies we want,

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:18.040
or the technologies we need? It's now a
truism that Malthus was wrong, but the

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.310
fact is that billions of people on Earth
today do still lack adequate food and

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:27.650
water, and they do suffer misery for that
lack. And in many parts of the world,

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:34.410
childhood mortality remains very high.
Life has improved dramatically for those

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:38.920
of us in the upper four billion is I think
Roman [sp] often calls it, but it remains

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:44.690
highly unimproved for at least 2 billion
of our fellow citizens. And in public

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:48.190
health, it's well-documented that medical
breakthroughs of the past decades have

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:53.020
mainly addressed the diseases and even the
discomforts of the wealthy to the neglect

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:59.240
of many of the most devastating diseases
of the poor. So why have we made so much

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:04.050
progress on telephones and contact lenses
technology and cosmetic surgery, and such

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:09.760
relatively modest progress on solar cell
efficiency and energy storage? Well, I

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.280
think one part of the answer is clear,
market response to market signals. And

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:18.770
without a price on carbon, there's
insufficient demand for energy efficiency

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:24.320
and storage. Governments will respond to
political signals and those have so far

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.290
been largely lacking as well. And of
course this also explains why we haven't

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:33.760
solved the diseases of the poor. And the
fourth issue is the issue of inequality

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:38.310
and inequity. Today, technological
development has not resolved problems of

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:44.140
inequality, and in some cases has, in
fact, exacerbated them.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:50.030
So perhaps Malthus was right after all,
and technology just bought us extra time.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:55.530
So will we survive the future? Again, I
still think the answer is yes. But how we

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:59.940
survive hangs in the balance, and it will
depend in no small part on how quickly we

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:06.610
can develop the technologies to transform
our energy systems. And to do that, we

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:10.870
can't just sit around chattering about
disruptive technologies or letting the

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:15.890
market do its magic, while meanwhile the
fossil fuel industry continues to explore

00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:20.260
for and develop still more reserves of
fossil fuels, including the Arctic, one of

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.830
the few places on Liz's maps that is
not filled with people. And of course, we

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:29.830
continue to use those fuels. We have to
get past wishful thinking and

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:35.300
technofidiesm to apply what we know from
experience it is likely to take to solve

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:42.030
these problems. And that brings me to the
thorny issue of politics. People don't

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:47.620
like to talk about politics. It's awkward
and divisive. In fact, we've had a whole

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:52.160
set of wonderful speakers here today, but
no one has spoken about the evolution of

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:58.190
political systems or the evolution of
governance. But without talking about

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:02.100
political systems and governments, I don't
see how we can solve the problems that we

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:08.460
face. Now many people have seen an analogy
between our problem of relinquishing

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:12.840
dependency on fossil fuels and the 19th
century problem of relinquishing

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:18.400
dependency on slave labor. Interestingly,
some of the people who invoked the need

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:22.590
for disruptive technology to solve climate
change are the same people who invoked

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:30.020
this analogy with the disruption of ending
slavery. But slavery was not ended because

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:35.400
of disruptive technologies that eliminated
the need for slaves. It was ended by a

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:40.580
disruptive politics that included acts of
terrorism, of illegal sheltering of

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:47.940
escaped slaves, and finally culminated in
a tragic bloody military conflict. Now few

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.880
of us are prepared to break the law to
stop disruptive climate change, and I'm

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:55.950
not advocating that we necessarily should,
and I've certainly heard many of our

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.930
colleagues criticize climate scientist
James Hansen for "crossing a line,"

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:05.200
becoming an advocate because
he has been arrested protesting the

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:11.270
Keystone XL Pipeline. I do not know
whether what Hansen is doing is right or

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:15.680
wrong, or whether it will make a
difference or not, and of course, no one

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:23.920
does. But as a historian, I will say this,
most of us in the climate science arena

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:28.030
have been focused on science and
technology, and to a lesser extent, on the

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:34.880
business side of business as usual. But
what may matter most, what may be most

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:40.240
urgent, and what may actually determine
the question of how we survive, is whether

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:45.780
we can create and sustain a disruptive
politics. Politics makes nearly all

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:51.540
scientists very uncomfortable. We don't
want what we do to be politicized and we

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:57.860
are afraid of being seen as political. But
it seems to me very unlikely that we can

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:02.940
solve climate change with politics as
usual. And it seems to me also very

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:07.240
unlikely that we can solve climate change
without ...with our scientific thinking as

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:11.778
usual either. And so maybe the time has
come to think about that.

00:37:11.778 --> 00:37:13.321
Thank you very much.

00:37:25.202 --> 00:37:29.453
- [Ramanathan] We heard from Jeff
Severinghaus about the greenhouse

00:37:29.453 --> 00:37:31.484
effect of carbon dioxide in Venus,

00:37:31.484 --> 00:37:38.120
and that brought me fine memories
when 45 years ago, I got started in this

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:43.930
field, like taking the quantum mechanics
of the carbon dioxide molecule and trying

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:49.560
to figure out how it maintains the climate
of Venus and Mars. So how did I go from

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:55.810
quantum mechanics to talk about the topic
which is totally foreign to me, in pursuit

00:37:55.810 --> 00:38:03.250
of the common good. So I have to walk you
through how my science led me into the

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:09.040
villages of India and Kenya, and finally
found myself face-to-face with Pope

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:15.710
Francis last year, and that's what gave me
this idea of the pursuit of common good.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:23.800
So let me start with the 30-second lesson
on climate and climate change. The

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.710
fundamental energy source for the planet
is sunlight considered solar

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:34.370
energy. Not all of that is absorbed by the
planet. The intervening clouds and ice

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:42.930
sheets surface bounces some of these back.
Somewhat 70% is absorbed by the planet

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:47.060
that heats the planet and it gives off
this energy, the infrared wavelengths. We

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:52.770
call it heat radiation, infrared
radiation. But not all of that can escape

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:58.650
the space. The intervening atmosphere,
particularly water vapor in carbon dioxide

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:05.970
acts like a blanket and traps this heat.
In fact the blanket is a good analogue, if

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:11.910
not a metaphor that the blanket keeps you
warm on a cold winter night, not because

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:18.800
it gives off any heat, it traps your body
heat. That's exactly how these gases trap

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:24.450
the planet's infrared heat, which is what
we call by greenhouse effect. Nature gave

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:29.640
us a thick blanket, and later I'll tell
you how thick that blanket is, so without

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:35.470
that, the planet would be so frozen beyond
anything you see in the ice ages that Jeff

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:42.230
showed us. So now what we've been doing is
adding to the blanket, making the blanket

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:48.230
thicker. So the first of this, we heard
about the carbon dioxide, and that was

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:54.750
worked out more than years ago by Svante
Arrhenius, the famous chemist. He did some

00:39:54.750 --> 00:40:00.200
of the most definitive calculations in
1896. I know this paper very well because

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:05.090
the Swedish Academy at the 100th
anniversary invited me to write a detailed

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:14.520
critique of this. So for maybe 80 years,
after the publication of this paper, we

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:19.200
thought carbon dioxide was the only
molecule causing the greenhouse effect. In

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.280
fact many talks where they focus on the
CO2. After I finished graduate school, I

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:30.660
stumbled on this totally shocking and
surprising discovery even from myself that

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:35.210
we were losing other components,
particular the chlorofloroucarbons, CFCs,

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:38.760
and my work showed bringing ...taking
again starting from the quantum mechanics

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:45.000
of the CFC molecule. Addition of one
molecule of CFC has the same green house

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.240
effect as adding to 10 to 15,000 molecules
of carbon dioxide. This isn't, mind you,

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:56.560
purely synthetic gas used as refrigerants
and propellants, but the CFCs were also

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:04.090
involved in damaging the ozone layer. So
the Montreal Protocol in 1980s phased out,

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:09.270
banned the use of chemicals after the
discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole.

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:16.150
Just in the last five years, my work was
recognized, and The Economist called the

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:22.400
Montreal Protocol as the best climate
mitigation strategy because my work had

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:28.270
shown if we had not to buy any CFCs, the
CFC alone would have cost half a degree

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:33.720
warming so far. Okay? So now let me go to
the real gorilla on the table, which is

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:39.300
carbon dioxide. The theory is being
attacked, so the key thing is to remember

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:44.540
any theories judged by its predictions. So
in 1980, I teamed up with the famous

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:50.460
metereologist Roland Madden. We took the
observed climate fluctuations, so-called

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:57.610
noise. Until when will we detect the
signal of carbon dioxide warming. So we

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:02.620
predicted, if the theories, Arrhenius'
theory was right, we should see the

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:08.830
warming by year 2000. As you have seen,
it's after the 1990 to 2000 [inaudible

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:14.500
00:42:08] shown the shade were the warming
grows above the background noise. In fact,

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:20.420
thousand scientists said finally we are
seeing the human-induced warming. So there

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:28.270
a forecast came out to be okay. So for the
last 30, 35 years, I used varieties of

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:33.050
instruments. The one I'm showing on the
left hand side is the satellite which I

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:37.580
helped design that with three other
scientists at NASA. We were looking at the

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:43.250
regulation of the heat flow in and out of
the planet by the atmosphere. More

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:49.670
recently, we developed this unmanned
aircraft to look at how that heating from

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:54.380
man-made pollutants is really warming the
planet. So let me walk you through. What

00:42:54.380 --> 00:43:02.280
we did was using this to track down each
of the prediction by models and theories

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:08.140
and see, are they coming too true? So the
first thing we went after is what's called

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:14.080
the water vapor feedback. Remember I think
Jeff showed several talk about the warmer

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:20.650
atmosphere has more moisture, but water
vapor is the most powerful greenhouse gas.

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:26.180
So we determined the greenhouse directly
simply by ...we have estimated the

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:31.220
infra-radiation coming from the ocean,
basically given by the plancks black

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:36.200
body law. Then we were measuring the heat
escaping to the top of the atmosphere and

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:41.230
difference the two. Look at the thickness
of this blanket. What you see here in the

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:46.870
tropics is where the blanket is at its
thickest. Our unit for measuring the

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:51.510
thickness what's the energy trapped.
So why is so much greenhouse

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:57.250
effect happening in the tropics? It's warm
and humid water vapor greenhouse effect,

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:00.430
but we are not satisfied with that. We
wanted to see as the planet warms,

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:05.080
how the water vapor increased.
So on the right hand side you

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:11.200
see, I'm not gonna go through step by
step, every year, the planet does a

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:16.880
spectacular experiment. It's the entire
planet for the average, it's hottest

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:22.480
during August and coldest during February.
Remember, August is winter in the southern

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.820
hemisphere. So when the temperature
increases, we found with the satellite,

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:32.580
the greenhouse effect increased exactly as
predicted by models. And then you ask why

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:37.180
did that increase? That's the last bottom
panel, it's because the water vapor

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:41.480
increased as the planet temperature
increased. So why is the water vapor

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:47.430
increasing? It's basic thermodynamics. The
weight per pressure of moisture above a

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:52.900
body of water increases exponentially with
temperature. So here it is. Arrhenius was

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:57.700
the first to suggest it. The next was,
another theory which was done by Russian

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:01.310
climatologist so-called CI Salvedo.
Charlie Kennel already

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:06.940
showed that. This took me 30 years, to
start from the launch of the satellite to

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:11.050
come to this. It was still one of my
graduate student's thesis work.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:18.900
So as the arctic sea ice are treated, what
the climatologist said is, "You know, ice

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.000
absorbs absorb only 50% of the sunlight.
It bounces everything back. That's why it

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.600
white." When you melt the ice away, you
get the sudden tipping point. You see the

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:34.250
dark ocean. And the document of that
exactly how much energy, as that energy

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:39.900
increased, although it's a tiny part of
the planet, Arctic, was so large that it

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:44.560
was equal to one-fourth of the greenhouse
effect of CO2 increased. Okay? Again, this

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:49.540
was suggested by the magnitude of the
feedback is much larger than what the

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:55.240
models were using. The last one I wanna
mention to you, one of the key things we

00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:00.510
are after this is the warmer planet going
to be more cloudy? Why is that an

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:07.370
important question? Clouds are one of the
most powerful regulators of sunlight. The

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:13.790
clouds are white because it's reflecting
50 to 70%. In our planet, both in the

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:19.890
northern polar regions, southern polar
region, is massive extra tropical cloud

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:24.740
system. Remember, that's what you see when
you fly across in the Pacific-Atlantic,

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:29.830
thick, white. They are the refrigerants
for the planet. What we are finding is

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:34.910
...now think of them as two white
umbrellas. They are shrinking, letting in

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:41.350
more sunlight in the tropical ocean.
Again, an amplification. So when we put

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:47.630
all of these together, remember, I
forecast in 1980 boldened by the success

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:54.260
of that, we made two forecasts seven years
ago that we have already dumped enough

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:59.450
gases to keep the planet by two and half
degrees. We have only seen about one-third

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:07.280
of it. The other thing which is what made
me go out to the pursuit of the common

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:11.890
good, I said we are gonna hit these two
degrees, not when ...people are saying

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:18.970
hundred years from now. Around the corner,
30 to 40 years from now. Okay? So the

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:29.080
so-called two degrees is facing us
already. So how do we slow down warming?

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:35.110
Of course, most of the studies talk about
cutting down CO2, which I agree with.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:41.190
We came with the number to reduce the
long-term warming. You got to stabilize

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:51.350
the CO2 below 440 bpm. CO2 is already at
400. So to limit to 440, we can't emit

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:57.990
more than thousand billion tons. That
looks large, but every year they are

00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:01.877
emitting 40 billion tons.
So we have only 25 years left.

00:48:02.406 --> 00:48:07.500
Okay? But that's not gonna help the
near-term warming because CO2 is like a

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:12.100
super tanker. Its lifetime is centuries of
thousand years. It's not gonna respond

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:18.690
quick. So remember, my work on the CFCs,
that's put us hc halocarbon. That's a

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:24.190
family of chemicals. And after that work
in '75, we came with numerous other

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:29.120
pollutants. Ozone, it's called smog.
Methane, we heard about it. The other is

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:33.710
black carbon. It is such the dark stuff
that comes from diesel. It's not a

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:38.440
greenhouse gas. It's a particulate of
sunlight. Much of my work with the UAVs

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:43.440
must attract that. But we have
technologies to cut them down, and their

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:49.030
lifetime is few weeks to a decade. If you
eliminate black carbon from diesel, their

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:53.570
warming effect is gone two weeks from now.
So we said if you cut these pollutants

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:58.670
with existing technologies, we can cut
down the rate of warming in the next 30

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:06.750
years by nearly 50%. So you need a
two-prong strategy. So now let's look at

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:14.220
who is gonna do which. By the way, this
idea of the CCAC, the short-lived climate

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:19.560
pollutants, I wrote a paper of this for
our policy makers, that the political

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:25.040
scientist at UCSD, that was read by
Hillary Clinton, and she formed the

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:30.240
coalition three years ago. Now there are
40 nations are working to cut down the

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:37.560
short-lived pollutants. So now let's look
at the human side of the problem. For

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:44.100
reasons I'm not gonna get into, I spent
...took my sabbatical and spent with my

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:49.870
wife living in villages in India for three
months. We also do work in Kenya. Every

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:55.050
week or so, the life in the village was so
oppressive. I would escape to the nearest

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:58.022
city for the cold glass of beer.

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:04.250
I have a movie I can show if there is
time. That's when I discovered, my God,

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:11.000
there are two worlds in this planet. The
first is inhabited by the top one billion,

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.290
with obviously seemingly unlimited access
to fossil fuels. The other one is

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:21.790
inhabited by the bottom three billion,
lack of access to the fossil fuels, even

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:27.000
for cooking. They still burn firewood and
coal lump. I was having my meals in this

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:34.140
woman's house, in the foot of Himalayas.
So the top one billion, consumed 50% of

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:40.760
the energy, are responsible for something
that 50 to 70% of the greenhouse gas

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:46.930
emissions. So where population is a
problem, as Dr. Hadley said, the other big

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:54.770
gorilla is unsustainable consumption by a
small part of the world's population.

00:50:54.770 --> 00:51:01.380
Okay? Particularly climate change. So in
terms of cutting CO2, the buzz word is

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:06.750
decarbonization. So that takes about, it's
been estimated, about a trillion dollars

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:13.640
per year. That's about thousand dollars
per person for the top 1 billion. And our

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:19.910
fossil fuel subsidies about 450 billion.
So you take it out. It's basically a $500

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:25.660
problem we are looking at. And then
the second thing is, the worst

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:29.660
consequences of climate change is going to
be experienced by the bottom three

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:36.590
billion. This woman represents about 600
million women around the world, who are on

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:43.310
subsistence farming one or two to five
acres. A drought like what hit California

00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:48.150
extending for three, four years would wipe
them out. They would become homeless,

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:53.270
called the slums in cities, et cetera, et
cetera. So the question is we have to give

00:51:53.270 --> 00:52:00.990
them energy access. And that has also been
cost a lot. It's about 250 billion. So if

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:07.600
we divide it amongst the top one billion,
it's $250 problem. So the question we have

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:11.470
to ask is, why should I? I'm living here.
I'm of course part of the top 1 billion.

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:16.600
I'm one of those on the top of the top one
billion if you bring on my travels. So why

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:22.320
should I give $250 to this woman sitting
in Himalayas? If I don't do that, she

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:30.870
climbs on the fossil fuel ladder, her
consumption of fossil fuel go by 30%,

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:35.380
another 12, 13 billion. So purely selfish
reasons, we wanna [inaudible 00:52:35]

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:41.140
energy access, but we know if we throw
250 billion, it's not gonna reach them.

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:48.730
All right? So we started a project called
Surya, where we developed improved cook

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:53.860
stoves to cut down the emission,
my daughter developed

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.490
cellphone technologies to measure these
emissions. My instruments were all way too

00:52:57.490 --> 00:53:03.670
expensive, but this cook stove is about
$70 a person. That's about five weeks of a

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:10.830
paycheck. Okay? So we said, she's cutting
down climate by cutting down the black

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:16.840
carbon emissions, some CO2 emissions.
She's saving about five tons a year. So if

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:23.920
I give them minimum carbon credit to her,
which is about $15, she get to pay stove

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:28.940
paid off, and she'll be making next two,
three years. But how do you know she's

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:33.150
gonna use it, right? That's the biggest
problem is compliance. So I went to my

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:35.417
daughter again, asked her to
do something useful.

00:53:38.116 --> 00:53:42.435
She's a wireless technology genius.
So she came up with a simple

00:53:42.435 --> 00:53:45.480
temperature sensor,
which hits us. As soon as she starts the

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:50.580
stove, the data comes to her lab, but
she's at Los Angeles. She sends it

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:55.880
to my lab. We convert the carbon
credits. UCSD created the first climate

00:53:55.880 --> 00:54:01.850
mitigation fund, and we demonstrated it in
5000 homes. In fact this work was started

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:08.710
first by donation from Qualcomm, Charlie
Kennel, and a billionaire in San Francisco

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:13.940
got it started. So next week, this
methodology has been accepted by United

00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:17.710
Nations. I'll be there next ...in the
summit. They're going to release it as one

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:25.860
way, the point energy access. So let me
go. So I'm now taking my quantum mechanics

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:31.910
to villages. So why did I need the pope?
Clearly, after we ...particularly we heard

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:36.960
from the last speaker and the previous
speaker, I deserve by the way, I'm never

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.581
going to follow Naomi Oreskes.

00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:45.090
I was so mesmerized what she was saying I
forgot what I was gonna say.

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:51.620
So we teamed up. I belong to the Pope's

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:56.740
Academy of Science with the economist,
Nobel Laureate and biology, physics,

00:54:56.740 --> 00:55:02.270
chemistry. In fact, Charlie and Naomi
attended that summit, and we discussed to

00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:08.970
see this whole issue of sustainability.
And at the end of it, we were asked to

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:13.490
brief to the pope, and I've been in this
academy for last ...every time we meet

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:18.140
pope, like Pope John Paul and Pope
Benedict, it's always in the most ornate

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:22.840
room in the Vatican. This pope met us in
the parking lot right here.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:28.490
That's why he's called people's
pope. So we briefed. What was remarkable

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:35.030
about this group, at the end of it, three
[inaudible 00:53:51] talks, we didn't talk

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:39.660
about technology. We didn't talk about
this. What we said was the main way to

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:45.850
solve this problem is to change our
attitude towards nature and towards each

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:53.550
other. And remember, by leaving three
billion behind, they're gonna suffer the

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:58.910
consequences of our fossil consumption,
and then from the previous speaker we

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:05.200
heard we're going to generations of yet
unborn suffering our [inaudible 00:56:05]

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:10.000
consumption. So it's a moral issue. So
what we are saying is that religious

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.610
leaders should take hold of this. And two
weeks ago, Pope Francis, because of this

00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:24.310
previous meeting, assembled religious
leaders from Islam, Hindu, Jewish, all the

00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:29.560
religious leaders represented, and they
all signed a declaration. And anyway, so

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:35.680
let me just come to the last point. I
joined this infamous group Planetary

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:42.050
Boundaries Group. So we published this
year this planetary boundary that has,

00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:47.550
that is a safe ecosystem, that's an inner
circle. And then you exceed the outer

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:52.920
circle. You go to the danger zone. And so
there were eight components we identify. I

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:57.450
was the only climate scientist there. And
climate change, and then the atmospheric

00:56:57.450 --> 00:57:01.220
aerosol loading is there. Two of the
components we already exceeded the

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:06.740
boundaries. Dr. Hadly's talk beautifully
showed that species extinction. It turns

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:12.820
out our extinction rate is 10 to 100 times
larger than when we compared the

00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:18.030
extinction rates before humans really
started colonizing the planet. The other

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:25.040
major is nitrogen. Fertilizers. We have an
oxic zones in the ocean

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.840
because pollutants, effluence
from the ocean. So climate change, there

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:38.960
are denialists because of political and
economic reasons, but our chairman also

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:46.290
said we are also a denialist. It is coded
into our genes. So no matter how, if we

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:51.430
don't do much about it, I wanna conclude
mine with my prediction that you see that

00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:59.100
the red zone, the climate was still in the
yellow zone, we would exceed that by 2050

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:06.470
two degrees. So the anthropocene, which is
coined by my good friend Paul Crutzen,

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:11.340
will reach adolescence by 2050. I'm
thinking there the teenage is the most

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:14.435
dangerous age in the human being's
evolution.

00:58:14.435 --> 00:58:18.100
Right? So we'll reach two degree world.

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:24.080
When I predict when we reach two degrees,
the changes would be so huge, just

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:28.180
physically and thermodynamically, the
water vapor alone would be 15% more,

00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:34.180
fueling the storms, fueling droughts,
fueling floods. So we would change our

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:40.280
attitude towards nature. We will
decarbonize the economy. But I am saying

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:45.600
it's a $450 problem amongst the top one
billion. Safe to assume all of us here

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:51.570
belong to that prestigious club. And then
we need to provide clean energy for the

00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:55.835
bottom three billion. Okay?
Thank you very much.
