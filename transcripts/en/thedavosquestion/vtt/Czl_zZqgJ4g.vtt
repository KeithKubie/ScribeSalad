&gt;&gt;Hi YouTube. I'm Salman bin Hamad from Bahrain.
I'd just like to answer the Davos question.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.540
What is the one thing that companies, business,
governments, and individuals can do to make

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.820
the world a better place in 2008? I thought
about this a lot. And really I think that

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.840
in this time of uncertainly that we live being
open to one another is the biggest thing that

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.359
we can do to make this world a better place.
Like sharing ideas, as we are doing here.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:38.070
By listening to one another, and by investing
in new people, techonologies, and companies.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.420
I believe we can do a lot. I have heard some
fantastic ideas regarding climate change.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.969
Heard some fantastic ideas regarding energy
dependence. And I have heard many fantastic

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:59.289
ideas regarding water that have been shared,
communicated, and transmitted across the globe.

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:07.520
So while many in this world today are calling
for the closure of borders, the increase of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.009
protection for either products or people.
The world has always been at it's best when

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.229
it has been open to itself. Thank You very
much.
