00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990
&gt;&gt; Can India become a superpower?
I'm not sure that India would really want

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.120
to be a superpower.
If India thought about its prosperity in the

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.730
right way.
India is looking to a period of 8, 9 percent

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.750
growth [INAUDIBLE]
And India's main priority surely should be

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.050
to increase the life
circumstances of its own people, increasing

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.460
health services, increasing
education, making sure that the hundreds of

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.120
millions of people who live
on less than $3 a day in rural areas have

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.840
their life chances improved.
Improving educational, economic opportunities

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.000
for women, managing what
is second largest degree of organization that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.110
the world has ever seen.
So all of those are major, major challenge

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.390
for this Indian government
and future Indian leaders.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.620
And if I was India, I'd concentrate on meeting
those challenges before

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.441
worrying about whether it is a superpower.
