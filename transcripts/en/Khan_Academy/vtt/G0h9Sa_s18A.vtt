00:00:00.383 --> 00:00:01.491
- [Voiceover] In this
video we're gonna introduce

00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:03.489
a couple of words to help talk about the

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:06.385
relationship between sines and cosines,

00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:09.615
or different sinusoids that
have the same frequency,

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:12.072
but a different timing relationship.

00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:13.231
So, what I've shown here,

00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:15.015
is a plot of a cosine,

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.768
and a sine wave.

00:00:16.768 --> 00:00:18.954
And the axis here is in theta,

00:00:18.954 --> 00:00:21.011
in the angle, the radian angle

00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:22.844
of the cosine or sine.

00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:25.380
Now I can label these, the pi over two

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.963
represents a 90 degrees change.

00:00:29.754 --> 00:00:30.587
Pi is 180,

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:33.765
degrees.

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:35.432
This is 270 degrees.

00:00:36.648 --> 00:00:39.014
And this is 360 degrees.

00:00:39.014 --> 00:00:41.097
Those are two equivalent,

00:00:41.097 --> 00:00:44.452
scales for the angle, the angle axis,

00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:46.535
in degrees or in radians.

00:00:48.557 --> 00:00:50.704
Now, one thing we notice
here is that sine and cosine,

00:00:50.704 --> 00:00:53.095
they look the same,
but they don't overlap.

00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:55.618
If I change this to a time,

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:58.368
If I change this to a time, axis,

00:00:59.574 --> 00:01:00.757
what I can say is

00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:04.924
the cosine wave reaches its
peak at time equals zero,

00:01:07.274 --> 00:01:09.835
and the sine peak, the sine wave,

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:12.676
reaches its peak at a later time,

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:15.438
this is increasing time going this way.

00:01:15.438 --> 00:01:18.727
So, the sine is delayed
compared to the cosine.

00:01:18.727 --> 00:01:20.624
The peak here is delayed here.

00:01:20.624 --> 00:01:23.015
If I go down and look at these two peaks,

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:25.230
we see the same relationship.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.043
This sine peak in orange,
is behind, is delayed, from

00:01:30.043 --> 00:01:30.960
the cosine.

00:01:31.796 --> 00:01:33.381
So when we have this timing relationship

00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:35.577
between two periodic waves,

00:01:35.577 --> 00:01:37.934
what we say is, in this case,

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:39.851
we say that the cosine,

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:44.069
leads,

00:01:46.294 --> 00:01:47.923
the sine wave.

00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:51.243
And the amount of lead
is the difference between

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:52.305
these two points,

00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:54.536
and we can say the lead is

00:01:54.536 --> 00:01:58.536
270 minus 180, in this
case, it'd be 90 degrees.

00:02:00.028 --> 00:02:02.361
So we say that cosine, leads

00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:04.566
sine

00:02:05.856 --> 00:02:07.023
by 90 degrees.

00:02:09.507 --> 00:02:11.627
Now I can take exactly the
opposite point of view.

00:02:11.627 --> 00:02:16.394
If I actually measure where
the sine is relative to cosine,

00:02:16.394 --> 00:02:20.144
I say it's behind, then
we would say it lags.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.571
So the phrase we hear would be

00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:25.904
sine lags cosine

00:02:29.363 --> 00:02:30.530
by 90 degrees.

00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:35.407
So that's the term lead and
lag, that's what those mean.

00:02:35.407 --> 00:02:37.819
Now these terms apply,
this idea of a delay,

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.644
this only applies when these
frequencies are the same.

00:02:40.644 --> 00:02:42.487
If the frequencies are different,

00:02:42.487 --> 00:02:44.359
the relationship between
the two wave functions

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:45.624
changes all the time.

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:47.482
So, we use the word lead and lag when we

00:02:47.482 --> 00:02:49.902
know that the two signals
we are talking about

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:52.316
are exactly the same frequency.

00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:53.790
One thing I want to be able to do

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.830
is express sines and cosines
in terms of each other.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.829
So, if I have a sine wave,

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.487
could I actually express this orange curve

00:03:01.487 --> 00:03:03.178
as a cosine wave?

00:03:03.178 --> 00:03:04.649
How would a do that?

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:05.482
So what I've noticed,

00:03:05.482 --> 00:03:07.989
if I look at the value of sine right here,

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.065
and this is sine at 90 degrees,
or sine at pi over two,

00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:14.525
if I look at this value here,

00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:17.510
what I notice is that,
this has the same value,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.883
which is the peak of one.

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:23.051
Cosine has the same
value, the peak of one,

00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:25.999
but 90 degrees earlier, 90 degrees before,

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:29.052
because it's a leading function.

00:03:29.052 --> 00:03:30.723
So this suggests a conversion factor.

00:03:30.723 --> 00:03:33.503
Any time I pick out a value of the sine,

00:03:33.503 --> 00:03:35.730
if I look back 90 degrees,

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.485
I'll see the same value for cosine.

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:39.701
So I can write something like this,

00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:42.034
I can say that sine of theta

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.530
equals the cosine of theta,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.977
minus 90 degrees.

00:03:55.604 --> 00:03:56.930
If I go out to some value,

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.663
let's say there on the sine curve,

00:03:59.663 --> 00:04:01.604
and if I back up 90 degrees,

00:04:01.604 --> 00:04:04.975
like that, I'll read the same
value on the cosine curve,

00:04:04.975 --> 00:04:09.142
so these two functions will
give me the same number.

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:14.598
So I can write this
identity in reverse also.

00:04:14.598 --> 00:04:16.370
If I have a cosine, if I'm riding along

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.066
on this cosine wave,

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:21.162
what I notice is, if
let's say I'm right here,

00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:24.018
I'll notice I have my peak value here,

00:04:24.018 --> 00:04:26.668
and if I added, if I went later in time,

00:04:26.668 --> 00:04:29.021
or if I added 90 degrees,

00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:32.351
I would have the same value
on that orange sine curve.

00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:34.578
So if I look here, on cosine,

00:04:34.578 --> 00:04:37.544
if I want to know what that is,
in terms of a sine function,

00:04:37.544 --> 00:04:40.427
if I add 90 degrees to the argument,

00:04:40.427 --> 00:04:43.214
the sine function will
give me the same value.

00:04:43.214 --> 00:04:46.131
So what that says, is cosine theta,

00:04:49.476 --> 00:04:51.976
equals sine of theta, plus 90.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:59.122
So these are two
identities, we can use this

00:04:59.122 --> 00:05:02.349
to convert a something
expressed as a sine,

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.766
into a cosine, or vice versa.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.910
Now I want to show you
two more identities,

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.577
that are actually pretty useful.

00:05:12.597 --> 00:05:16.025
And here what I have is, I
sketched on in dash lines

00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:17.571
the negative of the orange curve,

00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:20.355
so this is a negative sine wave.

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:21.621
You can see it the opposite

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:24.760
of the original sine wave we had.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.408
So now I have the case
here where the cosine

00:05:28.408 --> 00:05:32.480
is trailing, or lagging,
the negative sine.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.061
Right, it comes later
in time, right there.

00:05:36.061 --> 00:05:38.478
So cosine lags negative sine.

00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:40.517
And what I'll do is, I'll write

00:05:40.517 --> 00:05:42.363
the same sort of identities here,

00:05:42.363 --> 00:05:45.403
but in terms of this negative sine,

00:05:45.403 --> 00:05:47.820
and those come out like this.

00:05:48.877 --> 00:05:50.210
Cosine of theta,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.800
equals minus sine,

00:05:54.533 --> 00:05:56.616
so that's the dashed one,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.730
of theta, minus 90 degrees.

00:06:03.472 --> 00:06:07.639
So what that means, if I want
to know the value of cosine,

00:06:09.976 --> 00:06:11.785
and I can flip that around the same way,

00:06:11.785 --> 00:06:13.285
and I can say that

00:06:15.811 --> 00:06:16.894
negative sine

00:06:18.832 --> 00:06:19.665
of theta

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:23.172
equals cosine

00:06:25.282 --> 00:06:26.699
of theta plus 90.

00:06:30.547 --> 00:06:32.903
That's the same identity but in reverse.

00:06:32.903 --> 00:06:36.269
If I want to know the
value of negative sine,

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:37.969
I just take that argument,

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:41.052
I add it, I advance it by 90 degrees,

00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:44.755
and take the cosine,
it'll have the same value.

00:06:44.755 --> 00:06:46.172
So, this identity

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:48.991
and,

00:06:51.442 --> 00:06:53.176
this identity,

00:06:53.176 --> 00:06:54.537
are pretty useful to have around.

00:06:54.537 --> 00:06:57.932
This one allows us to convert
sines and cosines together.

00:06:57.932 --> 00:07:02.537
This pair here is useful for
moving minus sines around.

00:07:02.537 --> 00:07:04.893
So that's what I wanted
to say about lead and lag.

00:07:04.893 --> 00:07:06.980
These are sort of slang or jargon,

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.513
the nicknames of the relationship between

00:07:09.513 --> 00:07:12.017
two different wave forms
of the same frequency

00:07:12.017 --> 00:07:15.292
but different phase timing,
different phase delay.

00:07:15.292 --> 00:07:17.678
And then we worked out
some, some identities

00:07:17.678 --> 00:07:20.008
that are kind of useful to have around,

00:07:20.008 --> 00:07:23.166
to be able to convert these two wave forms

00:07:23.166 --> 00:07:24.937
from one to the other and back.
