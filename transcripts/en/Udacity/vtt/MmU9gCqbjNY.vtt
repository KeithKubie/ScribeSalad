00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's trace what happens as we see a little more of the input.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's say we actually walk over and we see the 2.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, then our parcing state looks like this--E goes to 2.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We've seen the 2, and there's nothing left.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Everything important is in the past.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
There's nothing in the future.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So conceptually, we can use this rule--this rewrite rule, E goes to 2

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
like we hinted at here with our purple text, we will also be here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
E goes to E + E, but we've already seen the E, the +, and the E--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
E + E.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So we can go even further and go back to the first rule in our grammar

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
where we were trying to parse a sentence, which could be an expression.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We've already seen an entire expression--1 + 2--and now we're done.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In fact, if you can get to the state corresponding to your starting nonterminal

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
being completely finished, everything is in the past. Nothing to see in the future.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Then you've parsed it! That string was in the language of the grammar.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So formally a parsing state, a possible configuration of a parser, a world we could be in

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
is a rewrite rule from the grammar augmented with exactly 1 red dot--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that's where I'm putting my finger. That's where we are now. The past comes before it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The future comes after it--on the right-hand side of the rule.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
You can never put the dot on the left. The dot is always to the right.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now for any given input as we've seen here, you could actually be in maybe 3 of these

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
parsing states at once.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
One way of looking at the world is that I just finished seeing the 2.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Another way of looking at the world is--actually I'm done with everything.

00:01:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Those can all be true at the same time.
