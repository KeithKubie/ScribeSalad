question is do you think hydraulics

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660
question is do you think hydraulics
 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.030
question is do you think hydraulics
could help people with knee problems

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040
could help people with knee problems
 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.190
could help people with knee problems
when their need breaks down and it could

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200
when their need breaks down and it could
 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.580
when their need breaks down and it could
help it go down much softer well meet

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590
help it go down much softer well meet
 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.200
help it go down much softer well meet

great question could hydraulics help

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
great question could hydraulics help
 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.460
great question could hydraulics help
somebody's knees there's a great word

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470

absolutely I don't know how familiar you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
absolutely I don't know how familiar you
 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.190
absolutely I don't know how familiar you
are with hydraulics but you asked about

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
are with hydraulics but you asked about
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.250

and it's very reasonable that this would

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
and it's very reasonable that this would
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.520
and it's very reasonable that this would
work because what hydraulics do that is

work because what hydraulics do that is
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.210

so fabulous is they provide a tremendous

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
so fabulous is they provide a tremendous
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.350
so fabulous is they provide a tremendous
amount of force from a small object to

small actuator and the other thing they

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909
small actuator and the other thing they
 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.820
small actuator and the other thing they
really help with is what's called

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830
really help with is what's called
 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.260
really help with is what's called
damping which used to be called

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
damping which used to be called
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.010
damping which used to be called
dampening but the the faster you move

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
dampening but the the faster you move
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.230
dampening but the the faster you move
something the more damping slows it down

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
something the more damping slows it down
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.140
something the more damping slows it down
it's it sounds tricky but it's not

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
it's it sounds tricky but it's not
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.630
it's it sounds tricky but it's not
you've you've done it so what happens in

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
you've you've done it so what happens in
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.969
you've you've done it so what happens in
a hydraulic actuator they'll have an

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
a hydraulic actuator they'll have an
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.550
a hydraulic actuator they'll have an
opening which is another I think it's a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
opening which is another I think it's a
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.910
opening which is another I think it's a
Greek word an orifice and so when you

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
Greek word an orifice and so when you
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.920
Greek word an orifice and so when you
try to squeeze the oil or the water

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
try to squeeze the oil or the water
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.770
try to squeeze the oil or the water
through that opening it slows it down

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780
through that opening it slows it down
 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.380
through that opening it slows it down
and the faster you try to go the more it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
and the faster you try to go the more it
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.389
and the faster you try to go the more it
slows it down and this has to do with

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
slows it down and this has to do with
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.880
slows it down and this has to do with
the nature of fluids and there's a whole

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890
the nature of fluids and there's a whole
 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.859
the nature of fluids and there's a whole
study in physics called fluid mechanics

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
study in physics called fluid mechanics
 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.499
study in physics called fluid mechanics
but yes you should that is a great idea

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
but yes you should that is a great idea
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.179
but yes you should that is a great idea

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270
work at Boeing on the 747 airplane which
 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.570
work at Boeing on the 747 airplane which
is getting to be an old airplane now but

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580
is getting to be an old airplane now but

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.080
737 787 anyway the thing there's two
things I worked on a lot one of them was

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090
things I worked on a lot one of them was
 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.540
things I worked on a lot one of them was
a rudder and that's the thing that

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550
a rudder and that's the thing that
 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.530
a rudder and that's the thing that
steers the plane this way and that thing

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540
steers the plane this way and that thing
 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.770
steers the plane this way and that thing
is so powerful so there's a pump by

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
is so powerful so there's a pump by
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.910
is so powerful so there's a pump by
there's four pumps by the engines and

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920
there's four pumps by the engines and
 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.400
there's four pumps by the engines and
each pump is unbelievably reliable and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410
each pump is unbelievably reliable and
 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.990
each pump is unbelievably reliable and
just they work for years and years

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000
just they work for years and years
 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.540
just they work for years and years
because the thing they pump is oil so

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550
because the thing they pump is oil so
 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.340
because the thing they pump is oil so
they're always getting lubricated

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350
they're always getting lubricated
 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.750
they're always getting lubricated
they're always slippery inside which

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760
they're always slippery inside which
 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.390
they're always slippery inside which
keeps things from wearing out anyway

a 747 rudder actuator will do it for you

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810
a 747 rudder actuator will do it for you
 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.920
a 747 rudder actuator will do it for you
and so that is a great idea man you can

could be the perfect place where and I
just notice when you go to do it you're

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610
just notice when you go to do it you're
 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.150
just notice when you go to do it you're
gonna need a place for the actuator to

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160
gonna need a place for the actuator to
 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.259
gonna need a place for the actuator to
push and you're gonna need something to

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269
push and you're gonna need something to
 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.110
push and you're gonna need something to
pull with like in this in my day I'm

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120
pull with like in this in my day I'm
 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.940
pull with like in this in my day I'm
sure it still is this is called a

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950
sure it still is this is called a
 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.699
sure it still is this is called a
wishbone crank because it's kind of like

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709
wishbone crank because it's kind of like
 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.870

a wishbone you're gonna need a force and
 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.140
a wishbone you're gonna need a force and
you're gonna need a lever something

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150
you're gonna need a lever something
 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.750
