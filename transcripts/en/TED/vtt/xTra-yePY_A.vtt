00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:16.210
What I'm about to share with you
are findings from a study

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:19.385
of the brains of more than 1,000
children and adolescents.

00:00:20.038 --> 00:00:22.038
Now, these were children
who were recruited

00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:24.352
from diverse homes
around the United States,

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:27.422
and this picture is an average
of all of their brains.

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.403
The front of this average brain
is on your left

00:00:30.427 --> 00:00:32.875
and the back of this average brain
is on your right.

00:00:33.287 --> 00:00:35.686
Now, one of the things
we were very interested in

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.825
was the surface area
of the cerebral cortex,

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:41.863
or the thin, wrinkly layer
on the outer surface of the brain

00:00:41.887 --> 00:00:44.807
that does most
of the cognitive heavy lifting.

00:00:46.673 --> 00:00:49.814
And that's because past work
by other scientists has suggested

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:51.382
that in many cases,

00:00:51.406 --> 00:00:53.660
a larger cortical surface area

00:00:53.684 --> 00:00:56.287
is often associated
with higher intelligence.

00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:00.258
Now, in this study, we found one factor

00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:02.855
that was associated
with the cortical surface area

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.061
across nearly the entire
surface of the brain.

00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:10.765
That factor was family income.

00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:16.919
Now, here, every point you see in color
is a point where higher family income

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:20.652
was associated with a larger
cortical surface area in that spot.

00:01:21.592 --> 00:01:24.203
And there were some regions,
shown here in yellow,

00:01:24.227 --> 00:01:26.856
where that association
was particularly pronounced.

00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:31.895
And those are regions that we know support
a certain set of cognitive skills:

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:35.329
language skills
like vocabulary and reading

00:01:35.353 --> 00:01:37.645
as well as the ability
to avoid distraction

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:39.091
and exert self-control.

00:01:39.525 --> 00:01:41.022
And that's important,

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:43.025
because those are the very skills

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.512
that children living in poverty
are most likely to struggle with.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.029
In fact, a child living with poverty

00:01:50.053 --> 00:01:54.519
is likely to perform worse on tests
of language and impulse control

00:01:54.543 --> 00:01:56.664
before they even turn two.

00:01:58.013 --> 00:02:01.486
Now, there are a few points
I'd like to highlight about this study.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.677
Number one:

00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:06.359
this link between family income
and children's brain structure

00:02:06.383 --> 00:02:08.898
was strongest at the lowest income levels.

00:02:09.447 --> 00:02:11.564
So that means that dollar for dollar,

00:02:11.588 --> 00:02:13.952
relatively small differences
in family income

00:02:13.976 --> 00:02:17.646
were associated with proportionately
greater differences in brain structure

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.113
among the most disadvantaged families.

00:02:20.137 --> 00:02:22.297
And intuitively, that makes sense, right?

00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:26.583
An extra 20,000 dollars for a family
earning, say, 150,000 dollars a year

00:02:26.607 --> 00:02:30.917
would certainly be nice,
but probably not game-changing,

00:02:30.941 --> 00:02:32.765
whereas an extra 20,000 dollars

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.190
for a family only earning
20,000 dollars a year

00:02:35.214 --> 00:02:38.420
would likely make a remarkable difference
in their day-to-day lives.

00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:41.254
Now, the second point
I'd like to highlight

00:02:41.278 --> 00:02:45.611
is that this link between family income
and children's brain structure

00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:47.800
didn't depend on the children's age,

00:02:47.824 --> 00:02:50.045
it didn't depend on their sex

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.485
and it didn't depend
on their race or ethnicity.

00:02:53.982 --> 00:02:55.132
And the final point --

00:02:55.156 --> 00:02:56.510
and this one's key --

00:02:56.534 --> 00:03:01.006
there was tremendous variability
from one child to the next,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.334
by which I mean there were plenty
of children from higher-income homes

00:03:04.358 --> 00:03:06.193
with smaller brain surfaces

00:03:06.217 --> 00:03:08.997
and plenty of children
from lower-income homes

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:10.644
with larger brain surfaces.

00:03:11.553 --> 00:03:12.851
Here's an analogy.

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:14.512
We all know that in childhood,

00:03:14.536 --> 00:03:17.016
boys tend to be taller than girls,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.550
but go into any elementary
school classroom,

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:22.747
and you'll find some girls
who are taller than some boys.

00:03:23.778 --> 00:03:26.485
So while growing up in poverty
is certainly a risk factor

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:28.237
for a smaller brain surface,

00:03:28.261 --> 00:03:32.144
in no way can I know an individual
child's family income

00:03:32.168 --> 00:03:33.439
and know with any accuracy

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:36.293
what that particular child's brain
would look like.

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:40.009
I want you to imagine,
for a moment, two children.

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:42.943
One is a young child
born into poverty in America;

00:03:42.967 --> 00:03:45.484
the other is also an American child,

00:03:45.508 --> 00:03:48.171
but one who was born
into more fortunate circumstances.

00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:53.228
Now, at birth, we find
absolutely no differences

00:03:53.252 --> 00:03:54.778
in how their brains work.

00:03:56.322 --> 00:03:59.333
But by the time those two kids
are ready to start kindergarten,

00:03:59.357 --> 00:04:01.710
we know that the child living in poverty

00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:06.607
is likely to have cognitive scores
that are, on average, 60 percent lower

00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:08.173
than those of the other child.

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:11.216
Later on, that child living in poverty

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.542
will be five times more likely
to drop out of high school,

00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:16.359
and if she does graduate high school,

00:04:16.383 --> 00:04:18.918
she'll be less likely to earn
a college degree.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.410
By the time those two kids
are 35 years old,

00:04:23.434 --> 00:04:27.380
if the first child spent
her entire childhood living in poverty,

00:04:27.404 --> 00:04:32.382
she is up to 75 times
more likely to be poor herself.

00:04:34.103 --> 00:04:35.793
But it doesn't have to be that way.

00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:41.493
As a neuroscientist, one of things
I find most exciting about the human brain

00:04:41.517 --> 00:04:44.915
is that our experiences change our brains.

00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:49.435
Now, this concept,
known as neuroplasticity,

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:52.214
means that these differences
in children's brain structure

00:04:52.238 --> 00:04:54.955
don't doom a child
to a life of low achievement.

00:04:55.716 --> 00:04:58.135
The brain is not destiny.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.690
And if a child's brain can be changed,

00:05:01.714 --> 00:05:03.401
then anything is possible.

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:09.910
As a society, we spend billions of dollars
each year, educating our children.

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:12.462
So what can we tell schools,
teachers and parents

00:05:12.486 --> 00:05:15.296
who want to help support kids
from disadvantaged backgrounds

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.265
to do their best in school and in life?

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.748
Well, emerging science suggests

00:05:19.772 --> 00:05:24.040
that growing up in poverty is associated
with a host of different experiences

00:05:24.064 --> 00:05:26.713
and that these experiences
in turn may work together

00:05:26.737 --> 00:05:29.920
to help shape brain development
and ultimately help kids learn.

00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:31.580
And so if this is right,

00:05:31.604 --> 00:05:32.928
it begs the question:

00:05:32.952 --> 00:05:35.977
Where along this pathway
can we step in and provide help?

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.872
So let's consider first intervening
at the level of learning itself --

00:05:39.896 --> 00:05:42.161
most commonly through
school-based initiatives.

00:05:42.486 --> 00:05:45.772
Now, should we be encouraging teachers
to focus on the kinds of skills

00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:48.770
that disadvantaged kids
are most likely to struggle with?

00:05:48.794 --> 00:05:49.945
Of course.

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:53.237
The importance of high-quality education
based in scientific evidence

00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:54.695
really can't be overstated.

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.577
And there are a number of examples
of excellent interventions

00:05:57.601 --> 00:06:00.029
targeting things like literacy
or self-regulation

00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:03.609
that do in fact improve kids' cognitive
development and their test scores.

00:06:04.647 --> 00:06:08.184
But as any intervention scientist
doing this work would tell you,

00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:09.574
this work is challenging.

00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:12.823
It's hard to implement high-quality,
evidence-based education.

00:06:12.847 --> 00:06:14.297
And it can be labor-intensive,

00:06:14.321 --> 00:06:16.754
it's sometimes costly.

00:06:16.778 --> 00:06:20.611
And in many cases, these disparities
in child development emerge early --

00:06:20.635 --> 00:06:22.737
well before the start
of formal schooling --

00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.996
sometimes when kids are just toddlers.

00:06:25.582 --> 00:06:27.004
And so I would argue:

00:06:27.028 --> 00:06:28.980
school is very important,

00:06:29.004 --> 00:06:32.110
but if we're focusing
all of our policy efforts

00:06:32.134 --> 00:06:33.709
on formal schooling,

00:06:33.733 --> 00:06:35.920
we're probably starting too late.

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:39.095
So what about taking a step back

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:41.898
and focusing on trying to change
children's experiences?

00:06:42.685 --> 00:06:46.036
What particular experiences
are associated with growing up in poverty

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.925
and might be able to be targeted
to promote brain development

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:50.576
and learning outcomes for kids?

00:06:50.957 --> 00:06:52.928
Of course, there are many, right?

00:06:52.952 --> 00:06:56.155
Nutrition, access to health care,

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:59.588
exposure to second-hand smoke or lead,

00:06:59.612 --> 00:07:01.737
experience of stress or discrimination,

00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:03.084
to name a few.

00:07:03.653 --> 00:07:04.803
In my laboratory,

00:07:04.827 --> 00:07:07.689
we're particularly focused
on a few types of experiences

00:07:07.713 --> 00:07:10.382
that we believe may be able to be targeted

00:07:10.406 --> 00:07:12.430
to promote children's brain development

00:07:12.454 --> 00:07:14.701
and ultimately improve
their learning outcomes.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.310
As one example,

00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:19.583
take something I'll call
the home language environment,

00:07:19.607 --> 00:07:23.242
by which I mean, we know
that the number of words kids hear

00:07:23.266 --> 00:07:26.076
and the number of conversations
they're engaged in every day

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.527
can vary tremendously.

00:07:28.067 --> 00:07:29.351
By some estimates,

00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:31.632
kids from more advantaged backgrounds

00:07:31.656 --> 00:07:34.792
hear an average of 30 million
more spoken words

00:07:34.816 --> 00:07:36.493
in the first few years of life

00:07:36.517 --> 00:07:39.045
compared to kids from less
advantaged backgrounds.

00:07:39.745 --> 00:07:41.285
Now, in our work, we're finding

00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:44.230
that kids who experience
more back-and-forth,

00:07:44.254 --> 00:07:46.481
responsive conversational turns

00:07:46.505 --> 00:07:49.868
tend to have a larger brain surface
in parts of the brain

00:07:49.892 --> 00:07:52.811
that we know are responsible
for language and reading skills.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.854
And in fact, the number
of conversations they hear

00:07:55.878 --> 00:07:59.457
seems to matter a little bit more
than the sheer number of words they hear.

00:08:00.432 --> 00:08:02.384
So one tantalizing possibility

00:08:02.408 --> 00:08:05.384
is that we should be teaching parents
not just to talk a lot,

00:08:05.408 --> 00:08:08.319
but to actually have more conversations
with their children.

00:08:08.752 --> 00:08:11.705
In this way, it's possible
that we'll promote brain development

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:14.455
and perhaps their kids' language
and reading skills.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.231
And in fact, a number
of scientists are testing

00:08:17.255 --> 00:08:19.403
that exciting possibility right now.

00:08:20.055 --> 00:08:21.305
But of course, we all know

00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:24.864
that growing up in poverty is associated
with lots of different experiences

00:08:24.888 --> 00:08:27.323
beyond just how many
conversations kids are having.

00:08:27.347 --> 00:08:29.971
So how do we choose what else to focus on?

00:08:30.679 --> 00:08:32.766
The list can be overwhelming.

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.152
There are a number
of high-quality interventions

00:08:35.176 --> 00:08:37.418
that do try to change
children's experience,

00:08:37.442 --> 00:08:39.078
many of which are quite effective.

00:08:39.733 --> 00:08:41.876
But again, just like
school-based initiatives,

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.080
this is hard work.

00:08:43.104 --> 00:08:44.366
It can be challenging,

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.878
it can be labor-intensive,

00:08:45.902 --> 00:08:48.524
sometimes costly ...

00:08:48.548 --> 00:08:49.833
and on occasion,

00:08:49.857 --> 00:08:52.820
it can be somewhat patronizing
for scientists to swoop in

00:08:52.844 --> 00:08:56.762
and tell a family what they need to change
in order for their child to succeed.

00:08:57.619 --> 00:09:00.019
So I want to share an idea with you.

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:05.064
What if we tried to help
young children in poverty

00:09:05.088 --> 00:09:07.735
by simply giving
their families more money?

00:09:10.027 --> 00:09:12.599
I'm privileged to be working
with a team of economists,

00:09:12.623 --> 00:09:14.708
social policy experts and neuroscientists

00:09:14.732 --> 00:09:16.925
in leading Baby's First Years,

00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:19.145
the first-ever randomized study

00:09:19.169 --> 00:09:24.514
to test whether poverty reduction causes
changes in children's brain development.

00:09:25.846 --> 00:09:27.928
Now, the ambition of the study is large,

00:09:27.952 --> 00:09:30.044
but the premise is actually quite simple.

00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:31.776
In May of 2018,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.841
we began recruiting 1,000 mothers
living below the federal poverty line

00:09:35.865 --> 00:09:38.900
shortly after they gave birth
in a number of American hospitals.

00:09:40.076 --> 00:09:41.673
Upon enrolling in our study,

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:45.859
all mothers receive
an unconditional monthly cash gift

00:09:45.883 --> 00:09:48.903
for the first 40 months
of their children's lives,

00:09:48.927 --> 00:09:51.411
and they're free to use this money
however they like.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.585
But importantly,
mothers are being randomized,

00:09:55.609 --> 00:10:00.249
so some mothers are randomized
to receive a nominal monthly cash gift

00:10:00.273 --> 00:10:04.713
and others are randomized to receive
several hundred dollars each month,

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:06.710
an amount that we believe is large enough

00:10:06.734 --> 00:10:08.925
to make a difference
in their day-to-day lives,

00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:12.408
in most cases increasing
their monthly income by 20 to 25 percent.

00:10:13.357 --> 00:10:14.775
So in this way,

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:17.335
we're hoping to finally move
past questions

00:10:17.359 --> 00:10:21.043
of how poverty is correlated
with child development

00:10:21.067 --> 00:10:25.751
and actually be able to test
whether reducing poverty causes changes

00:10:25.775 --> 00:10:28.901
in children's cognitive, emotional
and brain development

00:10:28.925 --> 00:10:31.073
in the first three years of life --

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:32.478
the very time when we believe

00:10:32.502 --> 00:10:36.029
the developing brain may be
most malleable to experience.

00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:41.007
Now, we won't have definitive results
from this study for several years,

00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:42.581
and if nothing else,

00:10:42.605 --> 00:10:45.701
1,000 newborns and their moms
will have a bit more cash each month

00:10:45.725 --> 00:10:47.568
that they tell us they very much need.

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:51.904
But what if it turns out
that a cost-effective way

00:10:51.928 --> 00:10:54.314
to help young children in poverty

00:10:54.338 --> 00:10:57.158
is to simply give their moms more money?

00:10:58.982 --> 00:11:00.933
If our hypotheses are borne out,

00:11:00.957 --> 00:11:05.134
it's our hope that results from this work
will inform debates about social services

00:11:05.158 --> 00:11:08.784
that have the potential to effect millions
of families with young children.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.630
Because while income may not be the only
or even the most important factor

00:11:13.654 --> 00:11:16.193
in determining children's
brain development,

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:17.460
it may be one that,

00:11:17.484 --> 00:11:19.403
from a policy perspective,

00:11:19.427 --> 00:11:21.082
can be easily addressed.

00:11:22.327 --> 00:11:23.716
Put simply,

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.843
if we can show that reducing poverty
changes how children's brains develop

00:11:28.867 --> 00:11:32.174
and that leads to meaningful
policy changes,

00:11:32.198 --> 00:11:35.262
then a young child born into poverty today

00:11:35.286 --> 00:11:38.997
may have a much better shot
at a brighter future.

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:40.710
Thank you.

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:46.238
