00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820
Your heart, that throbbing, beating muscle,
is probably the most iconic organ in your body.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.500
No other organ gets its own holiday, or as
much radio play. And you’re not likely to

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.640
get a love note decorated with a kidney or a spleen,
or even a brain, which is really what rules the emotions.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.640
Don’t get me wrong, the heart does some
great things -- namely, it powers the entire

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.619
circulatory system, transporting nutrients,
oxygen, waste, heat, hormones, and immune

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.779
cells throughout the body, over and over.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.440
But in the end, the heart does not make you
love. It doesn’t break apart if you get

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.470
dumped by your boo. And it’s not a lonely
hunter.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.050
The truth is, the heart is really just a pump
-- a big, wet, muscley brute of a pump.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.440
And it doesn’t care about poetry or chocolate,
or why you’re crying.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.040
The heart only has one concern: maintaining
pressure.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.700
If you’ve ever squeezed the trigger on a
squirt gun or opened up a shaken can of soda,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.030
you’ve seen how fluids flow from areas of
high pressure -- like inside the gun or the

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.070
can -- to areas of low pressure, like outside.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.680
The heart’s entire purpose is to maintain that same
kind of pressure gradient, by generating high

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.200
hydrostatic pressure to pump blood out of the heart,
while also creating low pressure to bring it back in.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.130
That gradient of force is what we mean when
we talk about blood pressure.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.840
It’s basically a measure of the amount of
strain your arteries feel as your heart moves

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.500
your blood around -- more than five liters
of it -- at about 60 beats per minute.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.670
That’s about 100,000 beats a day, 35 million
a year, 2 to 3 billion heart beats in a lifetime,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.610
the basic physiology of which you can
easily feel, just by taking your own pulse.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.689
I don’t have a watch

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.789
Now, that might not inspire a lot of poetry,
but it turns out, it’s still a a pretty good story.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.100
Let us begin with a little anatomy.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.280
Unless you happen to be of the Grinch persuasion,
the average adult human heart is about the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.970
size of two fists clasped together -- one
of the few bits of trivia you often hear about

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.470
human anatomy that is actually true.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.540
The heart is hollow, vaguely cone-shaped,
and only weighs about 250 to 350 grams -- a

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.420
pretty modest size for your body’s greatest
workhorse.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.939
And although Americans tend to put their right
hand over their left breast while pledging

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.340
allegiance, the heart is actually situated
pretty much in the center of your chest, snuggled

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.139
in the mediastinum cavity between your lungs.

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.829
It sits at an angle, though, with one end
pointing inferiorly toward the left hip, and

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:21.129
the other toward the right shoulder. So most of its
mass rests just a little bit left of the midsternal line.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.769
The heart is nestled in a double-walled sac
called the pericardium.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.919
The tough outer layer, or fibrous pericardium,
is made of dense connective tissue and helps

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.580
protect the heart while anchoring it to some
of the surrounding structures, so it doesn’t

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.420
like bounce all over the place while beating.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.759
Meanwhile, the inner serous pericardium consists
of an inner visceral layer, or epicardium

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.029
-- which is actually part of the heart wall
-- and an outer parietal layer.

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:46.510
These two layers are separated by a thick
film of fluid that acts like a natural lubricant,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.860
providing a slippery environment for the heart to move
around in so it doesn’t create friction as it beats.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.519
The wall of the heart itself is made of yet
more layers, three of them: that epicardium

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.739
on the outside; the myocardium in the middle,
which is mainly composed of cardiac muscle

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.680
tissue that does all the work of contracting;
and the innermost endocardium, a thin white

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.820
layer of squamous epithelial tissue.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.540
Deeper inside, the heart has a whole lot of
moving pieces that I’m not going to pick

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.329
apart here, because the really big thing to
understand is how the general system of chambers,

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.049
and valves, veins, and arteries all work together
to circulate blood around your body.

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.650
Of course fluid likes to move from areas of
high pressure to areas of low pressure, and

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.919
the heart creates those pressures.

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.419
Form once again following function.

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:30.589
Your heart is divided laterally into two sides
by a thin inner partition called the septum.

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:34.879
This division creates four chambers -- two
superior atria, which are the low pressure

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.139
areas, and two inferior ventricles that produce
the high pressures.

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.629
Each chamber has a corresponding valve, which
acts like -- like a bouncer at a club at closing

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.889
time -- like he’ll let you out, but not
back in.

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.220
When a valve opens, blood flows in one direction
into the next chamber. And when it closes,

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.640
that’s it -- no blood can just flow back
into the chamber it just left.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.560
So if you put your ear against someone’s
chest -- and yeah, ask for permission first

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.800
-- you’ll hear a “lub-DUB, lub-DUB”.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.279
What you’re really hearing there are the
person’s heart valves opening and closing.

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.179
It’s a relatively simple, but quite elegant
set up, really.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.280
Functionally, those atria are the receiving
chambers for the blood coming back to the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.159
heart after circulating through the body.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.999
The ventricles, meanwhile, are the discharging
chambers that push the blood back out of the heart.

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:20.039
As a result, the atria are pretty thin-walled,
because the blood flows back into the heart under

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.530
low pressure, and all those atria have to do is push it
down into the relaxed ventricles,

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.950
which doesn’t take a whole lot of effort.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.660
The ventricles are beastly by comparison.
They’re the true pumps of the heart, and

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.389
they need big strong walls to shoot blood
back out of the heart with every contraction.

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.169
And the whole thing is connected to the rest
of your circulatory system by way of arteries

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.110
and veins. We’ll go into a whole lot more
detail about these later, but the thing to

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.710
remember first, if you don’t already remember
it, is that arteries carry blood away from

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.430
the heart, and veins carry it back toward
the heart.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.569
To differentiate the two, anatomy diagrams
typically depict arteries in red, while veins

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.210
are drawn in blue, which, incidentally, is
part of what has led to the common misconception

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.479
that your blood is actually blue at some point.

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.139
But, it isn’t. It is always red. It’s just a
brighter red when there’s oxygen in it.

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.999
So let’s look at how this all comes together, starting
with a big burst of blood flowing out of your heart.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.320
The right ventricle pumps blood through the
pulmonary semilunar valve into the pulmonary

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.639
trunk, which is just a big vessel that splits
to form the left and right pulmonary arteries.

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.360
From there -- and this is the only time in
your body where deoxygenated blood goes through

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.580
an artery -- the blood goes straight through
the pulmonary artery into the lungs, where

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.699
it can pick up oxygen.

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.560
It finds its way into very small, thin-walled
capillaries, which allow materials to move

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.000
in and out of the blood stream. In the case of the lungs,
oxygen moves in, and carbon dioxide moves out.

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.740
The blood then circles back to the heart by
way of four pulmonary veins, where it keeps

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.000
moving to the area of lowest pressure -- because
that is what fluids do -- and in this case

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.699
that’s inside the relaxed left atrium.

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.719
Then the atrium contracts, which increases
the pressure, so the blood passes down through

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:52.879
the mitral valve into the left ventricle.

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.449
So the thing that just happened here, where
a wave of blood was pumped from the right

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.150
ventricle to the lungs and then followed the
lowest pressure back to the left atrium?

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.360
There is a name for that, it is the pulmonary
circulation loop.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.060
It’s how your blood unloads its burden of
carbon dioxide into the lungs, and trades

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.229
it in for a batch of fresh oxygen. It’s
short, it’s simple -- at least in the way

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.980
I have time to describe it -- and it’s just
delightfully effective.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.340
Of all of the substances you need to continue
existing, oxygen is the most urgent -- the

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:22.249
one without which you will die in minutes
instead of hours, or days, or weeks.

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:27.289
But it’s pretty useless unless the oxygen can actually
reach your cells. And that hasn’t happened yet.

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.649
For that, your newly oxygenated blood
needs to travel through the rest of your

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:32.439
organ systems and share the wealth.

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:37.270
And that fantastic journey -- known as the
systemic loop -- begins in the left ventricle,

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.849
when it flexes to increase pressure. Now the
blood would like to flow into the nice low

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:45.650
pressure left atrium where it just came from,
but the mitral valve slams shut, forcing it

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.509
through the aortic semilunar valve into your
body’s largest artery -- nearly as big around

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:54.360
as a garden hose -- the aorta, which sends
it to the rest of your body.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.969
And after all your various greedy muscles, and neurons,
and organs, and the heart itself have had

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:04.219
their oxygen feast at the capillary-bed buffet,
that now-oxygen-poor blood loops back to the

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:09.699
heart, entering through the big superior and inferior
vena cava veins, straight into the right atrium.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.460
And when the right atrium contracts, the blood
passes through the tricuspid valve, into the

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.629
relaxed right ventricle, and right back to
where we started.

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:20.629
This whole double-loop cycle plays out like
a giant figure eight -- heart to lung to heart

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:25.009
to body to heart again -- and runs off that
constant high-pressure, low-pressure gradient

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:27.259
exchange regulated by the heart valves.

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:31.509
So the first “lub” that you hear in that
lub-DUB is made by the mitral and tricuspid

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:35.370
valves closing. And they do that because your
ventricles contract to build up pressure and

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.550
pump blood out of the heart. This high pressure
caused by ventricular contraction is called systole.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.099
Now, the “DUB” sound -- and, just to be
clear, I am not talking about dubstep sounds

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:50.039
-- that’s the aortic and pulmonary semilunar
valves closing at the start of diastole. That’s

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:53.729
when the ventricles relax, to receive the
next volume of blood from the atria.

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:56.719
When those valves close, the high-pressure
blood that’s leaving the heart tries to

00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:58.800
rush back in, but runs into the valves.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.860
So you know when you get your blood pressure
measured, and the nurse gives you two numbers,

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.330
like, 120 over 80?

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.990
The first number is your systolic blood pressure
-- essentially the peak pressure, produced

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.979
by the contracting ventricles that push blood
out to all of your tissues.

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:14.590
The second reading is your diastolic blood
pressure, which is the pressure in your arteries

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.229
when the ventricles are relaxed.

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:19.689
These two numbers give your nurse a sense of
how your arteries and ventricles are doing,

00:08:19.689 --> 00:08:24.000
when they’re experiencing both high pressure
-- the systolic -- and low pressure -- the diastolic.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.320
So if your systolic blood pressure is too
low, that could mean that, say, the volume

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.099
of your blood is too low -- like, maybe because
you’ve lost a lot of blood, or you’re dehydrated.

00:08:31.099 --> 00:08:34.499
And if your diastolic is too high, that
could mean that your blood pressure is high,

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.240
even when it’s supposed to be lower.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.900
Considering how much we’ve talked about
the importance of homeostasis, it should come

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:42.870
as no surprise that blood pressure that’s
too high or too low, or anything that affects

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.730
your blood’s ability to move oxygen around
can be dangerous.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:50.279
Prolonged high blood pressure can damage arterial
walls, mess with your circulation and ultimately

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:54.370
endanger your heart, your lungs, brain, kidneys,
and nearly every part of you.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.800
So I guess you could say the best way to break
a heart is to mess with its pressure.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.690
But good luck trying to write a song about
that.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.699
Today you learned how the heart’s ventricles,
atria, and valves create a pump that maintains

00:09:03.699 --> 00:09:08.600
both high and low pressure to circulate blood
from the heart to the body through your arteries,

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.410
and bring it back to the heart through your
veins. We also talked about what systolic

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.060
and diastolic blood pressure are, and how
they’re measured.
