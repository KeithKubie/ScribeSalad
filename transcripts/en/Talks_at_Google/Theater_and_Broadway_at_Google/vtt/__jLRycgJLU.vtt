SPEAKER 1: On behalf of
the Talks at Google team,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.670
I would like to welcome you all
to see today's Talks at Google

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.540
with the cast of the Broadway
revival of "Miss Saigon."

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.270
For those of you unfamiliar
with "Miss Saigon,"

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.730
this comes from the creators
of "Les Miserables."

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.160
The musical "Miss
Saigon" is the epic story

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.100
of a young Vietnamese
woman named Kim.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.820
In a bar run by a notorious
character called The Engineer,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.730
Kim meets a young American GI.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.610
That encounter will change
their lives forever.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.690
Featuring stunning spectacle,
a sensational cast of 45,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.550
and a soaring score,
including Broadway

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.550
hits like "Last Night of the
World," "I Still Believe,"

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.410
and "I'd Give my
Life for You," this

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.390
is a theatrical event
you will never forget.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.997
So to whet your
appetite a little bit,

00:00:51.997 --> 00:00:53.830
we've got a little
sizzle reel from the show

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.300
to give you a little preview.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.400
And then we're going to
have the cast come up

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.100
and perform a couple of
numbers, after which we'll

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.410
do a little Q&amp;A.
At the end, we'll

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.610
open it up to the audience.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.940
So if you've got
questions, be sure to hold

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.430
onto those until the end and
we'll make sure we get to you.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.596
All right, thanks so much
and enjoy the performance.

is sweeping audiences
off their feet.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.210
"Miss Saigon" soars
to the rafters.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.200
It's sensational in every way.

00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:32.948

Brilliantly cast.

00:01:34.852 --> 00:01:38.590

NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER: How's
everybody doing today?

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.870
Pretty good?

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.822
Aren't they pretty?

00:06:02.822 --> 00:06:04.530
So basically, at this
point in the story,

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.920
my character, John, and a
bunch of the Vietnam Vets

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.500
start a foundation called
the Bui-Doi Foundation.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.980
And what that is, is
that is a foundation

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.820
to raise money to go
back to Vietnam to help

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.950
the children that were
basically produced by the war--

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.130
American citizens that have
a right to live in America.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.787
So this is a song about me
asking you for your money.

00:06:31.787 --> 00:06:33.620
So play along, you've
got to be an audience.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.380
That's your
character, all right?

EVA NOBLEZADA: Hello, again.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.850
This next song is actually
the finale of Act 1.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.490
And without giving too much
away, the scene prior to this

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.770
was very emotional,
very passionate.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.376
And I realize in this
moment that nothing

00:10:44.376 --> 00:10:45.750
is more important
than protecting

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.720
my child, my son,
Tam, who at this time

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.170
was around three years old.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.390
And the song is called
"I'd Give my Life for You."

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.337
The singing was stunning.

00:14:57.337 --> 00:14:59.420
So first of all, thank you
so much for being here.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.390
Maybe we can get it started
by just going down the row

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.400
and introducing
yourself and saying

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.526

NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER: Nicholas
Christopher, I play John.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.070
SPEAKER 1: So I'd love
to kick things off

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.190
by talking a little bit
about the historical context

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:52.740
of the show.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.440
So this is obviously a show that
is deeply rooted in history.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.300
Clearly, the show
is fiction, but it's

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.230
set very distinctly
in a specific time

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.510
period-- basically, the
end of the Vietnam War

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.656
and the fall of Saigon.

00:16:08.656 --> 00:16:10.100
I can pretty safely
say most of us

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.220
here probably were
not born at this time

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.650
and did not have a chance to
experience this firsthand.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.850
So how did you guys
go about getting

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:19.850
the context of the show?

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.490
Did you have members
of the creative team

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.530
brief you on facts and history?

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.854
And how did you get up to speed?

00:16:26.854 --> 00:16:29.020
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER: On
the first day of rehearsal,

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.690
or the first three days
of rehearsal, all of us

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:35.170
together watched documentaries.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.150
And we also talked about books.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.000
And we talked about
different things

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.247
that we've learned
about the Vietnam War

00:16:43.247 --> 00:16:45.080
in terms of the context
and the time period.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.780
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.710
Excuse me.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.260
But then also,
this show is based

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.620
on "Madame Butterfly" told
through the lens of the Vietnam

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.490
War.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.670
So with those heightened
circumstances,

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:02.160
it allows us to take
certain artistic liberties

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.579
with the show.

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:06.099
But for the most
part, we all got

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:09.670
on the same page about
how long the war was,

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:15.703
what it was like to get out, the
repercussions of the war after.

00:17:15.703 --> 00:17:21.230
Yeah, we took, like, three,
four days to do dramaturgy.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.089
SPEAKER 1: Got it.

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:24.099
And I know that many
members of the cast

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:27.339
are not actually from
the US or from Vietnam.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:31.540
And I think we've got Bermuda,
Canada, UK, Philippines

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.580
represented, maybe
even other countries.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.542
Do you guys feel--

00:17:34.542 --> 00:17:36.250
for those of you born
outside of the US--

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.810
do you feel like
you come to this

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.810
with a different
perspective than, say,

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:44.470
the average American who's maybe
been steeped in Vietnam history

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:48.250
and what the Vietnam
War represented?

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.312
ALISTAIR BRAMMER: I feel
more pressure that--

00:17:50.312 --> 00:17:51.680
I think I don't know about that.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.300
I've never been an American.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:52.800
[CHUCKLES]

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.794
But I feel a lot--

00:17:53.794 --> 00:17:54.698
[CHUCKLING]

00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:58.870
I feel a lot of pressure
to do the story justice,

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.560
as someone that wasn't
around during that time

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.630
and who isn't from
here, because you don't

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.880
want to do a
disservice to anybody

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.360
that was involved in the story.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.310
So that's how I feel.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.300
I feel it's a duty to do it
as truthfully and honestly

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.900
as possible.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.590
JON JON BRIONES: I was born
and raised in the Philippines.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:22.090
And during the
fall of Vietnam, we

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:26.080
had a lot of refugees
come to the Philippines--

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.250
two boat loads of
refugees, maybe three.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.220
So I've lived that.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:39.360
I actually am born and raised
in one of the slums of Manila.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:47.890
So I understand the squalor, the
difficulties, maybe not as much

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.130
as how they--

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.220
what they experience in Vietnam.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:59.954
But I understand it more coming
from a third-world country.

00:18:59.954 --> 00:19:00.930
SPEAKER 1: Got it.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.180
And obviously, I
think what happens

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.960
in the context of the play has
a lot of resonances with what's

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.835
going on in the world today.

00:19:08.835 --> 00:19:12.210
Especially Kim, The Engineer,
Tam become refugees,

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.170
have to flee their home.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:15.962
This has a lot of
parallels about what's

00:19:15.962 --> 00:19:18.420
been going on in the Middle
East in the last several years.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:23.250
How much does the current
political context, if at all,

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.170
shape your performances?

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.030
EVA NOBLEZADA: I
think, especially now,

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.122
when things are so easily
triggered and heated,

00:19:30.122 --> 00:19:32.580
it's important to have these
conversations put on the table

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.163
so that we can talk about them
and that there is open dialogue

00:19:35.163 --> 00:19:37.620
about, well, the story.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.020
And what's great is
that there's not--

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.990
I believe that when you
come and see the show,

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.490
if you listen with open ears,
there's no way that you cannot

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:45.910
be emotionally affected.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:46.890
There's no way that you
can leave the theater

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:49.320
without thinking, oh my god,
you know what that reminds me--

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.000
you know, the same
thing's going on today.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.380
The refugees-- you
know that happened.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.213
Oh, look at the natural
disasters happening,

00:19:54.213 --> 00:19:56.820
all the refugees that--

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.500
this story is
legendary and timeless

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.870
because no matter when
you put it in history,

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:01.710
it will be relevant.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:02.543
There is always war.

00:20:02.543 --> 00:20:05.952
There is always going to be some
kind of devastation happening

00:20:05.952 --> 00:20:07.410
throughout the
country, politically

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:08.325
and with the people.

00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:11.190
And it's great to
have, like I said,

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.470
an open dialogue about it.

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.540
JON JON BRIONES:
And I think as well,

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.000
as Americans, what
we do-- what we

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:28.290
do in other countries in the
past had a lot of effects

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.750
on the world, our policies.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:39.560
It's not being preachy, but the
story is that, in our story,

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:44.100
we talk about what we've
done in that country, what

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:51.010
happened to people, the
effects, what we produced there.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.950
And all of this is all--

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.930
but we have a love story.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:58.216
That is the main point there.

00:20:58.216 --> 00:20:59.590
SPEAKER 1: Got it.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:00.690
So one of the things--

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.120
I guess that's more
general in terms

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.750
of people who have been
impacted by the war and effects.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.460
I was reading a
story in "The Times"

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.500
where I think one
of your cast mates

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.130
talked about how a certain
Vietnam Vet would come back.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.090
And it was cathartic.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.650
They would come once a week.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:20.310
Have you seen any impacts,
or heard from any members

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.250
of the audience-- either
Vietnam vets or on the flip side

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.250
of the coin, people who were
in Vietnam and were impacted--

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.010
who come to this and have
certain reactions because they

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.180
were directly impacted?

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.440
JON JON BRIONES: I--

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.280
ALISTAIR BRAMMER: I have, yeah.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.510
JON JON BRIONES: Well,
actually, when I was on tour--

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:36.260
I've been doing this
show for a long time.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:41.400
So when I was on tour in
the Midwest, the very first

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.650
show we did, and one
of our crew guys--

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:49.810
because if you've seen the show,
the very first thing you hear

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.360
is the sound of a helicopter.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.230
And it's rumbling.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.790
And it's really strong.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:58.570
And this guy, one of our crew
members, just froze like this.

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.120
And we found out that he
was a Vietnam Veteran.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.690
And he couldn't move.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:06.910
And that was-- it
still affected him.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.720
They still felt it.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.745
EVA NOBLEZADA: We met
somebody in London

00:22:14.745 --> 00:22:17.070
at backstage who-- it
was a grandmother who

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.420
didn't speak a word of English.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.920
And her granddaughter was
translating everything.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.170
And she was one of the boat
people that came across.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.300
And that was really
extraordinary to hear

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:29.380
from the tales, and another
story about someone my age,

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.830
or a bit older actually,
who was put in a box

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.660
to kind of hideaway
on one of the boats.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.451
It's just incredible,
the stories you hear.

00:22:36.451 --> 00:22:39.130
And I think we've gotten a
few bui-dois at the stage door

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:39.790
as well.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:43.029
It really does impact everybody,
which I think is quite special.

00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:44.570
ALISTAIR BRAMMER:
There was a guy who

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.290
was an American who was there.

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:51.790
And with the lighting
and set design,

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.520
you try and recreate the
world as best as you can.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.120
But when you've got three walls,
and a theater of 1,000-plus

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.360
seats, I always feel
like we must be failing

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.330
because, of course, it
doesn't look like Vietnam.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.490
But this guy said, it does.

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:10.240
He said, you guys have really
captured the heat of the place,

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.510
is what he said to me.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.420
He said, it just looks so hot.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.230
And my biggest memory of
that place is how hot it was

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.730
and how busy it was.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.556
He said, and it
really does capture--

00:23:20.556 --> 00:23:21.430
this is what he said.

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:22.870
I'm not-- [CHUCKLES]
he said, it really

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.420
captures the essence of what
that place was for him, which

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.412
was a great thing to hear.

00:23:28.412 --> 00:23:30.370
SPEAKER 1: So let's
actually pivot a little bit

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.578
from the historical context
to talk a little bit more

00:23:32.578 --> 00:23:34.365
about this production itself.

00:23:34.365 --> 00:23:35.740
So obviously, I
think most people

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.260
will know this is a
revival of a show that was

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.420
on Broadway in the early '90s.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.350
Tremendous success, both
critically, financially.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.922
So I'd love to know a little bit
about how the show has changed.

00:23:47.922 --> 00:23:50.130
My understanding is this is
not a direct carbon copy.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:53.434
There are even a new song,
changes to much of the lyrics.

00:23:53.434 --> 00:23:55.600
So I don't know if any of
you would feel comfortable

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.266
talking to that.

00:23:56.266 --> 00:23:58.720
Jon Jon, I know that you've
been with the show actually

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.852
the longest and actually
from the original cast.

00:24:00.852 --> 00:24:02.560
But I would love to
hear your perspective

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.624
on how things have
changed over time

00:24:04.624 --> 00:24:06.790
and how this is different
from the previous original

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.389
production.

00:24:09.389 --> 00:24:10.930
JON JON BRIONES:
Well, first of all--

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:11.730
[CHUCKLING]

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.109
--the set is different.

00:24:13.109 --> 00:24:14.400
It's totally different, right--

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:14.910
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:16.034
JON JON BRIONES: --our set.

00:24:16.034 --> 00:24:19.710
The original set is
beautiful because I

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:24.240
think it was the most
high-tech set ever,

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.460
because things were
just gliding in and out.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.030
And the first time you
see it, you go, oh my god.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.770
And when you first see the
helicopter going vrr-- like.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:39.750
But this time around,
I think it's grittier.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.280
The producers have been
doing this for a long time.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.410
So now they know what they want.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:49.090
They want this grittier
because of the new--

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:50.410
for the new audience.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.870
And times have changed.

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:58.580
It's not as pretty and as--

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.940
ANTOINE L. SMITH:
Broadway [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.830
JON JON BRIONES: It
needs to represent

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:05.920
what really happened back then.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.220
So it is uglier.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.570
It's hotter.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:13.030
It's not pretty.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:18.080
Like, for example,
the very first scene,

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.110
they don't want people to go,
oh my god, that is so fun.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.150
I want to be in it.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:24.340
They want you to see
it and go, oh my god.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.040
That's disgusting.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.787
That's awful.

00:25:28.787 --> 00:25:30.620
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER:
From my understanding,

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:31.960
I believe the first--

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.800
just to piggyback off
of what Jon Jon said,

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.490
the first production
was much closer,

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:40.450
it was much more heightened,
and much closer to an opera.

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:45.550
And now, our show really
flows very nicely, almost

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.100
in a cinematic way.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.440
ALISTAIR BRAMMER: Yeah, it
seems to be more high def,

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.930
doesn't it now, I think?

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:52.930
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, got it.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:53.945
ALISTAIR BRAMMER: Sharper.

00:25:53.945 --> 00:25:54.430
EVA NOBLEZADA: Yeah.

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.905
SPEAKER 1: And speaking of
changes with the production

00:25:56.905 --> 00:26:00.340
side, this current production
started out in the West End

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.770
in 2014, if I'm correct.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.410
I believe, Jon
Jon, Alistair, you

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.930
guys were part of the original
production, and Eva as well,

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:09.250
of course.

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:11.500
So did you see changes
from the production

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.889
when you brought it
from the UK to the US?

00:26:13.889 --> 00:26:14.680
EVA NOBLEZADA: Yes.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.340
SPEAKER 1: And is that, like--

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:15.930
EVA NOBLEZADA:
[INAUDIBLE] changes.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:16.510
ALISTAIR BRAMMER: Identical.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:17.301
SPEAKER 1: --is it?

00:26:17.301 --> 00:26:18.515
[CHUCKLING]

00:26:18.515 --> 00:26:19.390
ALISTAIR BRAMMER: No.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.370
SPEAKER 1: Is it a
response to the audience?

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.087
Or was it, hey, we figured
out these things didn't

00:26:24.087 --> 00:26:26.170
work in London, so when
we're making the transfer,

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.710
we want an overhaul?

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.335
ALISTAIR BRAMMER:
Yeah, it has changed.

00:26:29.335 --> 00:26:31.250
There's been certain
lyrical changes.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:31.750
It's funny.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.569
Each time you come
and revisit it--

00:26:33.569 --> 00:26:35.360
because I did the show
for a year in London

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.640
and then went away.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.620
And then I came back
to it very briefly to--

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.940
we did a filmed version.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.140
And then we've come here.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.160
And each time, it's just--
they just try and delete

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.170
any of the things that are
considered to be unrealistic.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:51.430
There's just a few little
single syllables and ohs

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.934
that are quite musical
theater, like (SINGING) oh,

00:26:53.934 --> 00:26:56.320
that they've gone, we
don't need that anymore.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.236
So it seems to be coming
more and more real and more

00:26:59.236 --> 00:27:00.610
and more
conversational, I think,

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:01.630
each time you revisit it.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.130
EVA NOBLEZADA: I feel like it
trims the fat off of it a bit.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.550
Like when Nick was saying,
it started off kind of

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.530
like an opera, I feel
like now, almost, you

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:13.120
could consider it a play with
song, because it's so smooth,

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.280
the way the production goes.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.890
From my understanding, you
bring in different actors who

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.560
are all frickin' outstanding.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.510
And the whole dynamic changes.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:25.240
You have different chemistry
between different people.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.940
And you have different stories
and different perspectives of,

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:28.920
like, say, Ellen.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.630
She is a critical
role in the show

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.250
and one of the
hardest in the show.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.550
She comes on stage and
she has very little time.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:39.400
But every single second,
millisecond counts.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.474
And it's worth weight, just as
much as Kim and The Engineer.

00:27:42.474 --> 00:27:44.890
And with that, like, you have
different people playing it,

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.514
you're going to have
different staging.

00:27:46.514 --> 00:27:49.750
You're going to have
different ways of storytelling

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:54.980
through the songs and reacting
with the other performers.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.180
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.540
Speaking about the
impact of individuals,

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.530
I would love to talk a
little bit about some

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:02.180
of your individual
journeys because I

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.977
think we've got some really
fascinating stories in terms

00:28:05.977 --> 00:28:06.810
of your backgrounds.

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:10.160
So, Eva, you have a
really interesting journey

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.630
in terms of how your path to
the professional theater world.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:17.150
My understanding is that
when you were in the West End

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:20.180
production, that was your
first professional performance.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:20.900
EVA NOBLEZADA: Yeah,
that was the first time

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:21.830
ever getting paid.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:22.590
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:23.660
Would you mind--

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.110
JON JON BRIONES: She was 17.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.140
SPEAKER 1: Which is
crazy and amazing.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.480
Would you talk a little
bit about your journey,

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.130
and how you were
discovered, and what

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.630
it was like to be 17 and be the
lead in a major epic musical?

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.460
EVA NOBLEZADA: It wasn't mental.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.234
It wasn't, like, all fun.

00:28:39.234 --> 00:28:41.400
It was like the most difficult
thing I've ever done.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:41.900
[CHUCKLES]

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:46.700
So a long story short, I was
plucked from a musical theater

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.617
competition here in New
York, at the Minskoff,

00:28:48.617 --> 00:28:50.658
called the Jimmy Awards,
the National High School

00:28:50.658 --> 00:28:51.920
Musical Theatre Awards.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.560
And from Tara Rubin, who's
a casting director here,

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.407
knew that "Saigon" was casting.

00:28:56.407 --> 00:28:56.990
I had no idea.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:00.250
[WHISTLES] I literally had
no experience before that.

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:04.310
And we drove up to New
York from North Carolina.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:05.870
And I auditioned a few times.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.780
And yeah, it really
went quickly.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.780
It was so difficult because,
I mean, I left high school.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:12.639
I left everything.

00:29:12.639 --> 00:29:14.180
But it was all worth
it and then some

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.055
because this show
has, like, changed me.

00:29:17.055 --> 00:29:17.930
It's been incredible.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.540
But there's so many incredible
stories, like, in the cast,

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.170
definitely.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:25.100
JON JON BRIONES: I heard
that Tara Rubin, the casting

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.070
director, was there
when she was singing.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.430
And she went-- pulled out her
phone and started recording

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.297
and sent it to Cameron.

00:29:33.297 --> 00:29:33.922
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:29:33.922 --> 00:29:34.416
EVA NOBLEZADA: Really?

00:29:34.416 --> 00:29:35.270
Oh.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:36.230
SPEAKER 1: Cameron
is the producer.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.800
[CHUCKLING]

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.425
Cameron is the producer
of the musical,

00:29:38.425 --> 00:29:40.710
for those who aren't familiar.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.140
That's pretty amazing.

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.880
And for those of
you who don't know,

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.060
Eva was actually nominated
for a Tony for Best Actress

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:47.650
in a Musical--

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:48.608
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:29:48.608 --> 00:29:50.004
--which is pretty amazing--

00:29:50.004 --> 00:29:51.670
ANTOINE L. SMITH:
Against Bette Midler--

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:52.830
SPEAKER 1:
--considering your age.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:53.150
So I wanted to ask--

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.400
ANTOINE L. SMITH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.412
[CHUCKLING]

00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.240
SPEAKER 1: You were nominated
against some pretty heavy

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:00.740
hitters.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.590
I have it down here.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:06.080
Let's see-- Bette Midler, Patti
LuPone, Christine Ebersole.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.170
What is it like to
be, like, your age

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:10.300
and against these people?

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.644
Like, were these your idols?

00:30:11.644 --> 00:30:13.310
I'm sure you knew who
these people were.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:14.990
What was it like to
be sitting there?

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:16.239
EVA NOBLEZADA: It was surreal.

00:30:16.239 --> 00:30:17.305
[CHUCKLING]

00:30:17.305 --> 00:30:17.930
It was surreal.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.971
But the same time, like,
it was just a good time,

00:30:19.971 --> 00:30:24.380
because I don't really base
my career off getting awards.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.120
But obviously,
duh, what an honor.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:26.860
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.610
EVA NOBLEZADA: So it
was just a fun night.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.500
Like, the biggest
highlight for me

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.320
was getting to perform with the
cast and knowing we kicked ass.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.330
Like, we killed it.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.695
Like, it was amazing.

00:30:36.695 --> 00:30:38.070
So that was the
big thing for me.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:40.970
And just the recognition
for the show--

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.540
that's all that matters.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.460
SPEAKER 1: Got it.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.552
So pivoting to you,
Jon Jon, you mentioned

00:30:46.552 --> 00:30:48.510
how you have a very--
we've talked a little bit

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:49.510
about your long history.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:52.590
Like I said, you were
part of the original cast.

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.460
Can you talk about
what it's like?

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.310
And I understand
that you've performed

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.760
this all over the world,
and in a variety of roles

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.560
and a variety of countries.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.690
What has it been like
being so involved

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:06.030
in one show for such
a long period of time?

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.310
And do you have a
favorite country and role

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.449
that you've done
in your journey?

00:31:10.449 --> 00:31:11.490
JON JON BRIONES: America.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.208
[CHUCKLING]

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:15.820
Yes, I'm old.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:23.640
I've been with the show
on and off since 1989.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.290
This show means so much to me.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:31.760
Because of this show, I was
able to leave the Philippines.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:37.310
I was able to have a better
life for myself and my family.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.160
I learned to speak English.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.040
I'm still learning.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:46.400
And it brought me to so many
places, so many countries.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:51.320
I met my wife doing the
show in Germany, in German.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.330
Both my kids were born in
England because of the show.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:59.960
And they were born for
free because it was London.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.960
[CHUCKLING]

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.574
ALISTAIR BRAMMER:
Woo, woo, woo, woo.

00:32:02.574 --> 00:32:03.490
JON JON BRIONES: And--

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:06.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:11.150
--and actually, a lot of
us former "Saigon" actors,

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:15.466
we call the show the show that
keeps on giving because, not

00:32:15.466 --> 00:32:15.965
to be--

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.790
it's one of the few shows
that employs Asian actors.

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:29.520
And it's so important to us that
we get a platform to be seen

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:39.440
and to see us, and people go,
oh, yeah, they can do that.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.600
I totally believe that
because of this show,

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.270
Asian actors are seen
in a different light

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:46.670
now, since it opened.

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:53.180
Suddenly, more Asian
actors are being employed.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:58.100
More Asian people
want to go into arts,

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.500
because they've seen themselves
on stage, and they can do it.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.720
And it means so much--

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.640
much, much, so much, much, much.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.600
Thank you.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.000
[CHUCKLING]

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:13.205 --> 00:33:14.580
SPEAKER 1: So I
want to make sure

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.550
that I get a little bit of
representation from everybody.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:21.120
So I know many of you
in the ensemble also

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.259
understudy roles in the show.

00:33:24.259 --> 00:33:26.550
I think for a lot of people
here, we're not in theater.

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:28.500
I know, Billy, I
think you're a swing.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.012
Is that right?

00:33:30.012 --> 00:33:31.547
BILLY BUSTAMANTE: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:33:31.547 --> 00:33:32.630
SPEAKER 1: You're-- sorry.

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.080
Billy, you're a
swing, as well, right?

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.300
BILLY BUSTAMANTE: I'm in
the ensemble of the show,

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.160
so I have a role in
the show every night.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:37.744
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:33:37.744 --> 00:33:39.993
BILLY BUSTAMANTE: But then
every now and then, I go on

00:33:39.993 --> 00:33:41.120
for this lovely gentleman.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:41.990
SPEAKER 1: Oh, OK.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.630
Wow.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:45.200
So would all of you guys
who are understudies,

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.910
could you speak a
little bit to what

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:49.220
it's like to be an understudy
on Broadway, what it's

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.750
like to be on the ensemble?

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:54.350
How often do you get to go on?

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:57.590
Are you rehearsing your roles
that you're understudying for--

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.264
is that something you do
frequently to stay up to speed?

00:34:00.264 --> 00:34:01.680
BILLY BUSTAMANTE:
You know what, I

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.690
think we have quite a
few understudies here.

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:06.300
Do we all want to say
who we cover real quick?

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:10.080
ANTOINE L. SMITH: I understudy
the incomparable Nick Chris

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.480
as John.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.159
BILLY BUSTAMANTE: Paul.

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:19.020
PAUL MILLER: I recently started
understudying the role of Thuy.

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.850
JULIAN DEGUZMAN: I
also understudy Thuy.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:24.239
GRAHAM SCOTT FLEMING: I
understudy Alistair, so Chris.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:25.870
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER:
I understudy Kim.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:26.530
[LAUGHING]

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.106
SPEAKER 1: I would
pay to see that one.

00:34:29.106 --> 00:34:31.521
ROBERT PENDILLA: When Billy
has to go on for The Engineer,

00:34:31.521 --> 00:34:32.940
then I have to understudy Billy.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.100
So I just cover ensemble people.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.230
BILLY BUSTAMANTE: It's a
circle of life, really.

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:38.370
I don't know if you
guys feel the same way.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.780
I feel like understudying in
this show is very special.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.469
I feel like the creative
team from the get-go

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:47.340
was not interested
in, like, plugging us

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:50.600
into very constrained
parts, where,

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.110
like, I feel like
as understudies,

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:55.530
we're allowed to play and bring
ourselves to the role as much

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:57.100
as possible.

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:01.380
So for me, I think it's a
really special experience.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.995
ANTOINE L. SMITH: And we
get to rehearse quite often.

00:35:04.995 --> 00:35:09.210
I, myself, I enjoy the
understudy rehearsal process

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:12.180
because it gives you time
to play in the room and--

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.520
I mean, not necessarily
play in that matter,

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.890
but to kind of figure
out the character.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.084
And you get to work
with different people

00:35:19.084 --> 00:35:20.250
during different rehearsals.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:25.380
Like, we just added two
new people to the ensemble.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:28.360
So getting to work with
the new people that come in

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.389
is very exciting.

00:35:29.389 --> 00:35:31.680
SPEAKER 1: And how often
would you have the opportunity

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.042
to get to step in?

00:35:33.042 --> 00:35:34.500
ANTOINE L. SMITH:
I think I've been

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.774
on maybe seven or eight times.

00:35:35.774 --> 00:35:37.440
JULIAN DEGUZMAN: Yeah,
it really varies.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.040
ANTOINE L. SMITH:
It just varies.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.310
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:39.726
JULIAN DEGUZMAN:
Like, ultimately,

00:35:39.726 --> 00:35:41.580
our jobs as
understudies or swings,

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.320
we're insurance policies.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:47.790
So we're in place so
the audience still

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.510
gets to know the
narrative of the show.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:55.590
So the story is
still told to them.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.540
But it's special
every time you go on

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:02.730
because we have a very, very
supportive cast in every way.

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:07.590
It's kind of rare, like how
well we get along, actually.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:10.840
It's really cool because
every time you go on,

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.030
you see the excitement
in everyone's faces,

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.960
like, oh, you're on.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.380
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.921
JULIAN DEGUZMAN:
And it just makes it

00:36:15.921 --> 00:36:18.490
that much more worth it when
you have people behind you

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:22.780
and supporting you and
nurturing you in the role.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.290
I mean, it varies how
many times you go on.

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:30.940
Like, some of us have
been on 10, 15, 20 times.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.820
Others have only been like
once or twice or whatever.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.730
But it's always a special
experience anytime

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:38.740
we have an understudy
go on because it's

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.600
like you're on alert.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.360
As an ensemble member or whoever
in the show, you're always--

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:48.550
you're like in tune with the
difference, the subtleties,

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:51.370
the nuances that change
the show because you

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:52.579
have someone new into a role.

00:36:52.579 --> 00:36:55.203
GRAHAM SCOTT FLEMING: It's also
kind of cool as an understudy--

00:36:55.203 --> 00:36:57.315
this is my first time
being understudy--

00:36:57.315 --> 00:36:59.440
but you get to see the show
from a different light.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.360
There's obviously the stories
and the main characters,

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.160
who have a story
that you can follow.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.800
But ensemble members all
have their own stories, too.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.730
So to go from that to also
getting to do this story

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:11.560
and see his light
through the show

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.270
is quite a cool experience.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.478
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER: And
it's also rare for the show

00:37:15.478 --> 00:37:16.150
not to suffer.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:18.330
Like if you ever
come to see the show,

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:20.080
and you see that there's
an understudy on,

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.330
the show is just as strong.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.970
And sometimes, it's a little bit
stronger because you're right.

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:26.017
It puts us all on alert.

00:37:26.017 --> 00:37:27.100
And we're all on our toes.

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.391
And we're all really listening.

00:37:28.391 --> 00:37:31.780
And we're all really reacting.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.690
So the show is just
as good, if not better

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.920
sometimes, when there
are understudies on.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.640
JON JON BRIONES: And to
add to that, sometimes

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.760
they find out they're on
that night late morning

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.190
or early afternoon.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:45.380
Or, you know.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.671
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER: And
one time I had a stomach bug,

00:37:47.671 --> 00:37:49.799
and Antoine had to go on
in the middle of the show.

00:37:49.799 --> 00:37:50.590
SPEAKER 1: Oh, wow.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:51.865
[CHUCKLING]

00:37:51.865 --> 00:37:52.990
EVA NOBLEZADA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.500
ANTOINE L. SMITH: But--

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:53.770
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER: Yeah.

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:57.020
ANTOINE L. SMITH: --the cast
is so supportive in everybody.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.282
So great.

00:37:58.282 --> 00:37:58.990
They really were.

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:00.810
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.310
for the remainder of the
performance, the role of John

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:04.247
will be played by--

00:38:04.247 --> 00:38:05.080
EVA NOBLEZADA: Yeah.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.290
ANTOINE L. SMITH: It
was very exciting.

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:08.320
I will say that the
first time you ever go on

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.870
as an understudy, like,
sometimes it's just,

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:11.554
it's a blur.

00:38:11.554 --> 00:38:12.970
Like, you don't
even remember what

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:15.040
you've done because
you're concentrating

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.920
on being at the right place
and saying the right words

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.507
at the right time.

00:38:19.507 --> 00:38:22.090
And I often think that those are
the best shows because you're

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:23.560
so concentrated on doing it.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.600
But you just don't
remember it until--

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.530
[CHUCKLING]

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:27.436
--the next day.

00:38:27.436 --> 00:38:28.810
SPEAKER 1: So I
want to make sure

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:31.240
that we have time to open up
to some audience questions.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.200
I've got some more
questions for you.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.270
But if anybody has a
question, I believe

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:37.090
we have a mic-- yep,
over at that table that

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:37.965
has a little red box.

00:38:37.965 --> 00:38:38.881
ANTOINE L. SMITH: Ooh.

00:38:38.881 --> 00:38:40.520
SPEAKER 1: If you
approach the box--

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:40.925
BILLY BUSTAMANTE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:40.925 --> 00:38:42.035
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER:
Ain't that fancy.

00:38:42.035 --> 00:38:44.548
ANTOINE L. SMITH: And the
light came up on it as it--

00:38:44.548 --> 00:38:46.180
[CHUCKLING]

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.990
SPEAKER 1: But while we're
waiting for audience questions,

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:52.840
if there are any, so I
overheard a little bit

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.590
while you were in the green
room talking about Tam.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.770
So Tam is the son.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.205
And if I understand, there's
four little boys who play--

00:39:02.205 --> 00:39:03.580
EVA NOBLEZADA:
There's actually--

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.240
ANTOINE L. SMITH:
Three boys, one girl.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.200
SPEAKER 1: Three boys, one girl?

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:05.950
EVA NOBLEZADA: Yeah, one girl.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.990
SPEAKER 1: OK-- who
play the role of Tam.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:12.850
So I would imagine having
a young child on the stage

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.304
always makes things interesting.

00:39:14.304 --> 00:39:15.470
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER: Mm-hm.

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.810
EVA NOBLEZADA: What
are you talking about?

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:17.934
SPEAKER 1: Can you tell us
some interesting stories

00:39:17.934 --> 00:39:19.905
about what it's like
[? during ?] many of them?

00:39:19.905 --> 00:39:21.280
EVA NOBLEZADA: I
love this story.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:21.940
[CHUCKLING]

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:24.110
I will never-- so in London--

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:24.610
stop it.

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:29.220
So in London, we had just the
cutest, cutest little boy.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.720
And in the finale, obviously,
without giving anything away--

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.330
come see the show--

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:35.654
it's very still.

00:39:35.654 --> 00:39:37.570
It's like moving through
honey, it seems like.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:39.520
So if anything happens
that's out of place,

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.840
it's easily spotted.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.970
And obviously,
with a small child,

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.884
that needs to be kept
under [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:44.884 --> 00:39:46.300
So he needed to
go to the restroom

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.370
as soon as the curtains opened.

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:49.780
And I can see it in his--

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.490
he was kind of going
back and forth.

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:53.616
And he looked
really, really angry

00:39:53.616 --> 00:39:55.240
that he needed to go
at the wrong time.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.119
And I hold him.

00:39:56.119 --> 00:39:58.160
And I'm-- something else
is happening on the side

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:58.701
of the stage.

00:39:58.701 --> 00:40:00.268
And I just say, go ahead.

00:40:00.268 --> 00:40:01.900
[CHUCKLING]

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:02.590
Go ahead.

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:03.970
Because it would
have been easier

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.320
for him to do in then than--

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:05.770
JON JON BRIONES:
He was on your lap.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.311
EVA NOBLEZADA: Yes,
he was on my lap.

00:40:07.311 --> 00:40:08.380
He was cradling my lap--

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.510
sorry.

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:12.040
And yeah, so I did
the curtain call

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.720
with the beautiful
stain of just piss.

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.184
[GROANS AND CHUCKLING]

00:40:16.184 --> 00:40:18.700
Yeah, but you know
what, he said sorry.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.640
And he looked
really, really upset.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:20.890
JON JON BRIONES: Yeah.

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:21.030
SPEAKER 1: Aw.

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:22.310
EVA NOBLEZADA: But it happens.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:23.969
It's one for the kids.

00:40:23.969 --> 00:40:26.260
ALISTAIR BRAMMER: You just
said, sorry, but it happens.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.755
Sorry.

00:40:28.755 --> 00:40:30.546
One of the [INAUDIBLE]
in here-- and mine's

00:40:30.546 --> 00:40:31.421
not as funny as that.

00:40:31.421 --> 00:40:34.150
But Jace-- one of the
kids, Jace, who plays Tam,

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:35.380
he walked over to me.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.280
His job is to hand
me a photograph.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.820
And that's what he's told
to do in that moment.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.970
And he decided to say, he went,
you're a (LISPING) thlithering

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:43.990
thnake--

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.910
[LAUGHING]

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.362
--just for no reason.

00:40:46.362 --> 00:40:47.570
SPEAKER 1: Was this on stage?

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:48.790
ALISTAIR BRAMMER:
Yeah, on stage, yeah.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:50.530
EVA NOBLEZADA: He told our
Thuy at the Tony Awards--

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:50.710
ALISTAIR BRAMMER:
Yeah, just for--

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:52.270
EVA NOBLEZADA: --at rehearsals,
he just looked at him and goes,

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:53.200
I hate you.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.464
[LAUGHING]

00:40:54.787 --> 00:40:56.287
ALISTAIR BRAMMER:
So I was like, OK.

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:59.320
I was like, [? ah, ?] in it.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.130
JULIAN DEGUZMAN: But he's
a wonderful little boy.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:02.350
ALISTAIR BRAMMER:
Yeah, he's great.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:03.582
EVA NOBLEZADA: Oh, yeah.

00:41:03.582 --> 00:41:05.207
GRAHAM SCOTT FLEMING:
Actually, they'll

00:41:05.207 --> 00:41:07.240
let you know if you
made a mistake, too.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.380
Because I remember going
on for my first time,

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.230
I guess I forgot the whole
grab the photo thing-- what

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:13.620
he's talking about.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.900
And he was waiting to do it.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.780
And I was just trying to
focus on plugging his ears.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:20.134
And anyway, we got offstage.

00:41:20.134 --> 00:41:21.050
And he comes up to me.

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:23.060
And he's like, you
didn't take the photo.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:23.864
[LAUGHING]

00:41:23.864 --> 00:41:25.280
I was like,
(CHUCKLING) I'm sorry.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.113
Thanks for the note.

00:41:26.113 --> 00:41:27.882
SPEAKER 1: Thanks
for the note, sir.

00:41:27.882 --> 00:41:30.340
All right, looks like we have
a question from the audience.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:31.300
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Melina.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:31.590
EVA NOBLEZADA: Hi.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:32.923
AUDIENCE: Thank you all so much.

00:41:32.923 --> 00:41:33.660
It was amazing.

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:37.100
I'm curious about your
experience as actors of color

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.624
on Broadway.

00:41:38.624 --> 00:41:40.040
Outside of "Miss
Saigon," have you

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.921
found that there have been
more opportunities in the past?

00:41:42.921 --> 00:41:44.420
Do you find that
actors of color are

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.430
being cast more in
lead roles instead of,

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:48.440
like, you know, the
Asian friend, sort

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.006
of supporting
role, sort of deal?

00:41:51.006 --> 00:41:52.880
And so I'm just curious
about your experience

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.342
as performers in New
York and internationally.

00:41:56.342 --> 00:41:57.800
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER:
Well, for me,

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:03.910
I've noticed a huge difference
since "Hamilton," really,

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:11.470
since "Hamilton," being
such a big hit, that now it

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:14.380
seems like the fad is
to have actors of color

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:15.790
be in lead roles.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:17.369
That's the new kind
of phase that's

00:42:17.369 --> 00:42:19.660
happening right now, which
is great because it opens up

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:25.950
doors for alternative casting
and having casting directors

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:30.970
and creative teams think
outside the box, or their box.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:35.830
And so I've noticed the
rooms that I get in,

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:39.060
and the attention that I get
once I get into those audition

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:45.010
rooms, and how seriously
they take me, which is nice.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:47.260
EVA NOBLEZADA: There's still
a lot of work to be done.

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:47.840
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER: Yeah.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.339
EVA NOBLEZADA: I
think it definitely

00:42:49.339 --> 00:42:50.480
opened a massive door.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.556
But at the same
time, it's also, it's

00:42:52.556 --> 00:42:54.180
not just having them
in the production.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.080
It's the way that the
light is shone on them.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.140
It's not just having
them as a token anything.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.210
They're just as
heavily influenced.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:05.260
I mean, this cast, you can see,
is a sucker punch to the gut

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:09.490
with people of color and who
we represent as a people.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:12.370
And to see people at the stage
door going, you look like me.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:13.060
Thank you.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.990
And that is literally
the best, isn't it?

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:17.740
ANTOINE L. SMITH: Yeah,
and I have to say,

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:21.310
it's definitely not the lack of
talent in the people of color.

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:27.370
I think it's the fear of
people putting people of color

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:32.290
in roles because of the fear
of their monies or people

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:33.490
coming to see the show.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:38.860
But I think that times are now
proving that you can definitely

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:40.930
put people of color in roles--

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:43.354
of leading roles--
and people will still

00:43:43.354 --> 00:43:44.270
come and see the show.

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:47.350
People will come and
see what you give them.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:49.660
If you're not afraid
to give them that,

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.054
they're going to come, no
matter what color you are.

00:43:52.054 --> 00:43:53.470
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER:
And also one

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:55.930
of my least favorite
excuses is, is like, well,

00:43:55.930 --> 00:44:00.190
then why aren't people
of color creating roles

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:01.950
for other people of color?

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:06.880
And I was a part of a
great show about prison.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.670
And it was like six
black guys on a stage

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:12.760
playing a myriad
of different parts

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.800
and different cultures
and everything like that.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.430
And there are so
many more hurdles

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:22.450
that are put in place that I had
no idea realizing because it's

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:24.020
about getting the money.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.810
It's about getting
the right producers.

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:27.601
But then once you have
the right producers,

00:44:27.601 --> 00:44:29.940
you also have to find a theater.

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:31.480
And these theater
owners have to be

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:36.640
willing to gamble if they're
going to have people come,

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.400
and gamble their
money and their space

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:44.320
on either they're going to
do this prison show with six

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:48.680
black actors, or they're
going to do "Annie."

00:44:51.634 --> 00:44:53.050
And that's like,
there are so many

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:56.440
more hurdles than I
even knew before I

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.809
got into this business.

00:44:57.809 --> 00:44:59.350
SPEAKER 1: So I
think we could-- oh--

00:44:59.350 --> 00:44:59.770
ALISTAIR BRAMMER: Sorry.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:00.280
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, go ahead.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.100
ALISTAIR BRAMMER: I know
this isn't my question.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.468
[CHUCKLES] But--

00:45:02.468 --> 00:45:04.110
[LAUGHING]

00:45:04.627 --> 00:45:05.960
--you were talking to me, right?

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.440
Yeah.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.770
No, but I think, well,
I remember a friend--

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:12.830
not a friend, a person I don't
like very much back home--

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:15.910
once, he had a
problem with the fact

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:19.870
that Javert in "Les
Miserables" was black.

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:21.560
And I said, what's the problem?

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:24.460
And he said, well, a
police officer back then

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:25.930
wouldn't have been black.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.150
And I just thought,
the fact that you

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:30.490
think that modern casting
should be defined by what

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:33.460
the past has said is absurd.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:36.790
Just because someone back
then wouldn't have been,

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:38.730
that's irrelevant now.

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:40.870
So that was the most
closed-minded thing

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:43.396
I've ever heard, to say that.

00:45:43.396 --> 00:45:45.270
SPEAKER 1: So this will
be the last question.

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:46.210
But I definitely
want to get to you.

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.294
And then we'll wrap it up.

00:45:47.294 --> 00:45:49.168
AUDIENCE: All right,
well, thanks for coming.

00:45:49.168 --> 00:45:51.400
So as someone new to New
York, never been to Broadway

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.850
or seen a show, any tips
to make my first experience

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:57.100
at the theater a
really good one?

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:57.840
[CHUCKLING]

00:45:58.484 --> 00:45:59.650
ALISTAIR BRAMMER: Get drunk.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:00.276
AUDIENCE: Yeah?

00:46:00.276 --> 00:46:01.733
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER:
"Miss Saigon"

00:46:01.733 --> 00:46:02.980
is a great first show to see.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.190
[LAUGHING]

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:05.200
Bring your friends.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.129
Go out for dinner.

00:46:06.129 --> 00:46:06.920
Get a little tipsy.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.753
EVA NOBLEZADA: Wear
your waterproof mascara.

00:46:08.753 --> 00:46:11.514
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER: Yeah,
wear your waterproof mascara.

00:46:11.514 --> 00:46:13.430
EVA NOBLEZADA: It's a
good first-date musical.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:14.426
I recommend it.

00:46:14.426 --> 00:46:15.662
[CHUCKLING]

00:46:15.662 --> 00:46:17.245
JON JON BRIONES:
Yeah, it is because--

00:46:17.245 --> 00:46:18.780
ALISTAIR BRAMMER: It really is.

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.401
JON JON BRIONES: --you
get that really good grip.

00:46:21.401 --> 00:46:23.656
[LAUGHING]

00:46:24.561 --> 00:46:25.810
ANTOINE L. SMITH: No, but it--

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:27.460
EVA NOBLEZADA: But don't stare
too long at what's on stage.

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:28.090
You might get in trouble.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:29.020
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER:
And people always talk

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:30.640
about the price of tickets.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.760
But there are discounted
tickets everywhere.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.560
If you just walk up
to the box office,

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.570
you can ask them if
they have any discounts.

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:41.470
Or you can go to, on 47th
Street, right in Times Square,

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:44.710
there's TKTS, where that
has discounted tickets.

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:46.330
Or there's even
Tickets Today, which

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:49.530
is an app, where it's that
day, you can go on that app.

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:53.020
And you can find
discounted tickets.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:54.520
SPEAKER 1: Available
on Google Play.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:54.820
EVA NOBLEZADA: I'm also
going to be cheesy, sorry.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:55.075
Can I--

00:46:55.075 --> 00:46:55.960
NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER:
Available on Google Play.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:56.390
SPEAKER 1: Exactly.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:58.390
ANTOINE L. SMITH: Right,
and I was going to say,

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:00.906
you can Google just about
any musical you can--

00:47:00.906 --> 00:47:01.406
[CHUCKLING]

00:47:01.406 --> 00:47:05.020
JULIAN DEGUZMAN: But
after you Google, please,

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.937
please put your phone away
because sometimes we can see--

00:47:07.937 --> 00:47:08.770
EVA NOBLEZADA: Amen.

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:09.200
JULIAN DEGUZMAN: --phones.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.660
So the light is shining.

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.330
Like, it's dark in the theater,
but we see the light shining.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:14.260
ANTOINE L. SMITH: Those
damn Apple Watches.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.240
JULIAN DEGUZMAN: It's like,
yo, B, just, like, turn it off.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.160
Like, focus.

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.390
Just focus on what's
happening in front of you.

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:19.890
Be present.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:21.806
ANTOINE L. SMITH: But,
no, I was going to say,

00:47:21.806 --> 00:47:24.460
you can Google any musical
and read any review

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:27.880
or any synopsis of a show that
will pique your interest, that

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.200
will make you want to sit
there and watch an entire two

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.100

ANTOINE L. SMITH: 2:40.

00:47:35.288 --> 00:47:37.636

note of discounts,
