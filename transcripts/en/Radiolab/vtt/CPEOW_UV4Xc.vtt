00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.880
Hey [inaudible] I remember Krulwich.

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.170
This is Radiolab and today we're talking about the escape scanning.

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.320
This last story,

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.850
I have a feeling that this guy actually does kind of make it through.

5
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:14.970
This is a true, I think he does honest escape,

6
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.960
but he does it in the most original and most unusual.

7
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.020
Hey here where the story is our producer Sean Cole.

8
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.100
So the story starts in the late fifties there was this little boy in Richmond,

9
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:28.930
Virginia named Joe and Grassy, a junior.

10
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.540
He's seven or eight years old and he's just sitting at home dialing various

11
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:36.360
numbers on his parent's telephone just to see what happens.

12
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.840
He was on a long distance call to information, you know, five, five,

13
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:42.930
five one two, one two and to just an area code. This is Phil Lapsley.

14
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:45.400
I first heard Joe's story from him and he heard it

15
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.220
<v 1>very faintly in the background, the tone,</v>

16
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:52.221
and you just started whistling along with it and all of a sudden he heard a

17
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.430
critique

18
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.600
<v 0>and the call went away and it turns out that the tone in the background of the</v>

19
00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:01.650
phone and his corresponding whistle was 2,600 hertz.

20
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.630
Musically it's about seventh [inaudible]. So he has perfect pitch. Yeah.

21
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.430
And he was weirdly smart as you'll soon

22
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.780
<v 1>discover anyway, he thinks to himself. That's very odd. Well,</v>

23
00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:14.460
that happened once. I wonder if it could happen again. Does it again?

24
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.440
<v 0>He didn't even really know exactly what it was at the time, but he does it.</v>

25
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.500
Yeah.

26
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.420
<v 1>Again, and again,</v>

27
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.650
<v 0>he didn't think it was particularly useful for anything.</v>

28
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.260
He does talk about walking past, uh,

29
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.040
somebody at a pay phone when he was seven or eight years old and whistling this

30
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:33.360
tone and uh, having the phone and the phone call, disconnect on the person. Wow.

31
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:36.000
That's amazing. Super power. That really is. Yeah.

32
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.160
Which means he could be a little walking bomb.

33
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.310
He could go to grand central station where there many people sitting in phone

34
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:44.310
booths and as he could make them all lose their phone calls. Yeah.

35
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.210
And no one would know. Right. But it was more than just a cool trick for him.

36
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.720
This discovery was the beginning.

37
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.740
<v 1>I have a kind of escape.</v>

38
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.030
<v 2>Oh, what were you scared of when you were a little, I bet something</v>

39
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.650
scared me. I don't know remember how old I was, but

40
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.640
<v 0>it's all we have left of him. In fact,</v>

41
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.880
he died in 2007 but he left behind hours and hours of recordings of his voice

42
00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.850
phone recordings. And as he listened to them

43
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.820
<v 2>that was afraid, you know, something might have grown out of the bed.</v>

44
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.230
What found the button on the floor. And

45
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.530
<v 0>you pretty quickly realized that the little boy in that room who was playing</v>

46
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:31.690
with the phone, he was kind of desperate. Really. Um,

47
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.060
he went to this Catholic school for the blind was his mind. He was born blind.

48
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.590
And when he was there

49
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.800
<v 2>in the fall of 1955, this got pretty bad.</v>

50
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.700
A lot of the nuns where me and my sister really hard, you know, and shut.

51
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.560
The only one that the will abuse.

52
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.750
She used to have me get on the table.

53
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.600
Then she wouldn't get up on the table and lie down.

54
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.830
She did the bad touching.

55
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.520
<v 3>Things were pretty bad at home too.</v>

56
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.610
<v 2>Daddy wouldn't slam mother and her and break things and lots of scary sounds and</v>

57
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:12.001
stuff at night that has my phone up close to the dial tone

58
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.390
<v 4>[inaudible] too.</v>

59
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.820
<v 2>I'm on a dial tone there.</v>

60
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.070
<v 5>It's a nice warm tone. It never yelled at, never fought.</v>

61
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.150
<v 2>One on wonderful thing of telephone is</v>

62
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.280
<v 5>well, just a nice way for him to comfort himself</v>

63
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.760
<v 2>during those long nights.</v>

64
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.670
<v 3>And so how does exactly did the, the whistling thing he was doing,</v>

65
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.530
<v 6>how did that help him? Yeah. Well</v>

66
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.120
<v 3>it takes a few steps to explain,</v>

67
00:03:47.121 --> 00:03:52.121
but it turns out that that tone was the key word in a hidden mechanical language

68
00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:54.560
that controlled the phone system.

69
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.740
He wasn't supposed to be able to hear it at all. In fact,

70
00:03:57.741 --> 00:04:01.410
it was an internal signal probably bleeding over from another line.

71
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.400
And when a long distance line was idle, when there was no call on it,

72
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.440
this tone would be being played continuously.

73
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.860
Basically the tone means that the line is free and silence on the line means

74
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:15.760
there's someone trying to make a call.

75
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.350
So say you're in New York and you want to call La, you pick up your phone,

76
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.320
the circuit's got this tone on it and marking the circuit is idle,

77
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.640
dial the La number.

78
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:28.060
And at that point your line takes away the tone for just a moment.

79
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.950
It goes silent and La goes, AH,

80
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.240
New York wants to make a phone call and then la drops its tone and the New York

81
00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:36.620
and La machines talk to each other.

82
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.520
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

83
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.420
<v 3>so that's one discovery.</v>

84
00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:46.110
Another discovery is that you can dial a phone by just having the hook switch,

85
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:50.130
that little button where you hang up, tap that three times delta number three,

86
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.690
seven times, dial the number seven. And so then Joe thought wheat pulses,

87
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.650
tones. Maybe if you were to make a little bursts of a tone.

88
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.240
So something like

89
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.740
Joe's demonstrate it on a web show called hacks or radio.

90
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.250
<v 6>You were nine. If you were to do something like that,</v>

91
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.800
maybe you could actually dial a call with my math

92
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.190
and you could actually make a comment.

93
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.800
<v 3>That's exactly how the phone system used to send calls back and forth.</v>

94
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.460
That was its language, if that's right. Joe Learned how to speak telephone,

95
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.730
which was amazing. I mean, I think that's amazing. Um,

96
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.790
but isn't he just dialing the phone with his lips as opposed to using his

97
00:05:31.791 --> 00:05:33.380
fingers? Yes, true.

98
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.440
But Joe made one more little discovery that would change his life forever.

99
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.960
See if you first dialed a a number, like long distance information, five, five,

100
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:47.640
five, one, two, one, two. The telephone company doesn't charge for call for him.

101
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.520
So what he figured out was that once you get the operator on the line,

102
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.610
if you then whistled to disconnect, but only for a little bit,

103
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.250
only for a second or two, the line nearly disconnects.

104
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.660
But it doesn't all the way,

105
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.120
it just sits in this kind of limbo waiting for instructions waiting to be used.

106
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:06.470
Huh. And you

107
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.300
<v 7>can we route your call by whistling the digits and wanting to dial and make a</v>

108
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:15.170
free call because the phone company again thinks that you're still connected to

109
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.270
information and it's not charging you for that.

110
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.920
<v 9>He was like having an unlimited plane ticket to anywhere Joe could call anywhere</v>

111
00:06:25.381 --> 00:06:27.000
he wanted for free.

112
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.280
Coming up and explore in the number you have. Code is not connected. Listen

113
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.853
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

114
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.230
<v 9>and so he started calling all over the world,</v>

115
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.250
even broken number numbers just to hear the different voices,

116
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.530
the number [inaudible] gang.

117
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.030
<v 3>I used to do this by the way, did you really?</v>

118
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.210
My sister and I would get on the phone. We could call information.

119
00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:52.390
That was a free service. Yeah, and we said, hello information.

120
00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:55.930
Can you please contact with Toronto and then we get the Toronto operator.

121
00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.340
Let me see. Trying to, could you please get us in comp project with Churchill,

122
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.620
Ontario, which is way up north. Then the Trisha lady would come on and say,

123
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.050
can you please put us in touch with [inaudible] New York in a workplace and they

124
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.850
did transfer you to the northern space.

125
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.960
We would be talking to a person in the Arctic for nothing. Wow.

126
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.600
It was the sense of, of going long distance for free.

127
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.900
Now imagine you're a blind kid doing that in an abusive home.

128
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.900
You can't even run away. I think the phone represented freedom.

129
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.380
<v 7>Um, it represented a place that was under his control.</v>

130
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.720
He could be an expert in it, you know, it was,

131
00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:33.780
it was a place that he could do all sorts of things that maybe he wasn't so

132
00:07:33.781 --> 00:07:35.340
easily able to do in real life.

133
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.080
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

134
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.130
<v 3>so what happens next?</v>

135
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.980
So things get a little bit better for Joe as he gets older.

136
00:07:40.981 --> 00:07:43.200
His mom takes him out of the Catholic school.

137
00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:45.450
Once she finds out that the nuns are beating him,

138
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.990
he never told his parents about the sexual abuse.

139
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.540
He gets more and more savvy with the phone.

140
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.160
And then finally he goes off to the University of South Florida where he starts

141
00:07:56.161 --> 00:07:56.740
showing off.

142
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:57.370
<v 7>It started out,</v>

143
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.610
Joe told a student that he can whistle a free phone call and the students said,

144
00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:02.890
no, you can't. And he said, want bet. So they bet a dollar.

145
00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:04.720
And Joe whistled a long distance call for him.

146
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.560
And before long there were crowds of 40 kids who were following them around

147
00:08:08.561 --> 00:08:10.600
wanting to see him do this parlor trick. And,

148
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.010
<v 3>and then he whistled up this one particular fateful call,</v>

149
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.830
<v 7>he's trying to whistle somebody in New York, which is area code five one six</v>

150
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.060
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

151
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.090
<v 7>but instead had wound up in Canada, which is five one four.</v>

152
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.070
<v 10>Yeah,</v>

153
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.630
<v 7>you can see if you're whistling calls,</v>

154
00:08:27.631 --> 00:08:29.550
you could easily get off by one or two beeps.

155
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.560
So he wound up talking to an operator in Canada and the operator in Canada put

156
00:08:34.561 --> 00:08:36.710
his call through to New York, uh,

157
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.210
but then actually managed to listen to the call.

158
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.770
And then the student was talking about the,

159
00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:44.780
the wizkid who put the call through to him for him and telephone companies.

160
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:47.640
Security ended up tracing it back to a University of South Florida.

161
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.100
<v 3>It was just a gossipy operator who told on him and gossipy or security</v>

162
00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:55.470
conscious, depending on how you view it, fun ruining. That's how I view.

163
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.840
So Joe's busted,

164
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.230
he nearly gets kicked out of school and the whole thing causes just enough of a

165
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:02.720
stir that people find out.

166
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.900
<v 7>The local school newspaper wrote an article about it and it got picked up by a</v>

167
00:09:08.901 --> 00:09:11.360
wire service. Next thing you know,

168
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.400
there are newspaper articles and publicity and [inaudible].

169
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.390
<v 3>Here's the weird thing. As news travels,</v>

170
00:09:16.391 --> 00:09:19.180
did you see this article about the blind kid in Florida? You can do this.

171
00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.890
It turns out Joe wasn't alone, right,

172
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.030
<v 4>Brian?</v>

173
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.090
<v 3>There were all of these other Joan Grossi as out. Yeah.</v>

174
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.990
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

175
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.830
<v 3>the phone system. Two, one, two, three, nine, six you mean I'm not the only one.</v>

176
00:09:29.831 --> 00:09:31.900
You mean there are other people who are interested in this as well.

177
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.190
They weren't whistling.

178
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.420
Some of them would use these little machines called the blue boxes that would

179
00:09:37.421 --> 00:09:38.254
make the tones.

180
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.280
Couple of kids actually modified a toy whistle from a box of captain crunch,

181
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.930
and because Joe got hot, they all started to find out about each other.

182
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.170
<v 6>That really ended up being, I think,</v>

183
00:09:50.171 --> 00:09:54.860
a point for a whole generation of fun fleets. This is NBC nightly news phone.

184
00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:56.990
What phone freaks. Phone freaks will tell you.

185
00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:01.210
Phone freaking began with a blind young man named Joe and Bresha.

186
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.270
One thing he discovered was that he could whistle his own call

187
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.420
and before long people are actually calling John Grassi inm network starts to

188
00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:15.770
form n the phone freaks started finding

189
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.940
broken vacant member recordings. So for example,

190
00:10:19.941 --> 00:10:22.950
you dial in non-working number and you get the usual telephone company record.

191
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:24.870
<v 4>Well, did you have recently non working number?</v>

192
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.390
<v 6>But it turns out some of those were broken in such a way that the volume level</v>

193
00:10:28.391 --> 00:10:32.070
was very low and if multiple people called the same number, they could talk.

194
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:32.290
Right?

195
00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.370
<v 4>Oh God, yeah. Wow.</v>

196
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.120
<v 6>Teenage kids would call. Anyway, it turned into a party line,</v>

197
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.060
kind of an annoying one because you had this announcement that was repeating

198
00:10:40.061 --> 00:10:41.260
every 30 seconds by my number,

199
00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.790
but it's still allowed teenage kids to talk to one another at the department of

200
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.710
no. Wow.

201
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.760
<v 3>Oh, so this is it. I mean he found his tribe basically. Yeah.</v>

202
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.840
And he would call the conference lines and talk with them about phones and

203
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.831
freaking and everything.

204
00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:58.160
But that really wasn't what he was after and I think it's an interest

205
00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.353
<v 7>something because,</v>

206
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.790
so say you're a lonely kid and you start playing around with the phone or you

207
00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:05.840
start playing around with scrabble or whatever it is,

208
00:11:05.841 --> 00:11:10.660
you get really obsessed about something right through the magic of that thing.

209
00:11:10.661 --> 00:11:11.950
You end up meeting other people.

210
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.620
You sort of have a choice to make at that point.

211
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:19.420
Choice one is embrace the community. Choice two is,

212
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.320
Oh that's nice.

213
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.510
It's great that there are other people and I get some stuff from that.

214
00:11:22.511 --> 00:11:26.020
But you know, I found this thing, life telephone, my scrabble set,

215
00:11:26.021 --> 00:11:30.730
whatever it is I'm obsessed by and I'm still obsessed by it and it seems to me

216
00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:32.910
like he sort of made the choice to go for the thing.

217
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.760
<v 3>It's not that he didn't like the community,</v>

218
00:11:36.761 --> 00:11:40.350
but he was still searching for something. Hmm.

219
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.950
<v 12>Esquire magazine, 1971</v>

220
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.010
<v 7>march of 1971 is when you moved to Memphis, right. Reporter</v>

221
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.730
<v 12>and that month he had done very little long distance phone freaking from his own</v>

222
00:11:49.731 --> 00:11:52.880
phone. He had begun to apply for a job with the phone company.

223
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:55.890
<v 0>Yeah. He went there intending to get a job and be a man as he [inaudible]</v>

224
00:11:56.210 --> 00:12:00.050
<v 12>and he wanted to stay away from anything illegal in Garcia. Quote,</v>

225
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:04.400
any kind of job, we'll do anything as menial as the most lowly operator.

226
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.950
That's probably all they'd give me because I'm blind.

227
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:10.400
<v 0>He wanted to be a telephone man. He wanted to take his lunchbox to work.</v>

228
00:12:10.401 --> 00:12:14.300
He wanted to get a paycheck. He wanted to be a real person like everybody else.

229
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.600
This is Stephen Gip, one of Joe's best friends. He lived in a couple of places.

230
00:12:17.601 --> 00:12:20.840
The first one was, you know, just imagine the skid row. I mean, it was, it was,

231
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:21.410
you know,

232
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.990
you woke up one morning when the heat went out and he stepped on a dead frozen

233
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.990
rack cause he had ended up sleeping in his coat. I mean, you know,

234
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.870
that's all we could afford and uh, he can't get arrested in Memphis. Uh,

235
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.750
you know, he can't get a job to save his life.

236
00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:37.751
So he decides to get arrested literally by um,

237
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.730
doing this very,

238
00:12:40.731 --> 00:12:45.500
very elaborate public freak where he gets a bunch of his freaking friends on a

239
00:12:45.501 --> 00:12:48.920
conference call and he starts dialing up for an embassy's like the armed

240
00:12:48.921 --> 00:12:52.910
services and Moscow like and pretended that he was calling as a radio host and

241
00:12:52.911 --> 00:12:57.070
that all of his friends were his studio audience. Hi, this is, you know, sold.

242
00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.310
So from this radio show,

243
00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:00.590
do you have time to talk and be on the air with us today? Oh Great.

244
00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.640
Cause he wanted to stay on the phone line so that the phone company could trace

245
00:13:04.641 --> 00:13:08.020
him cause his, he, he says they're not really speeding. You know,

246
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.550
you wanted to give them a lot of time to catch up.

247
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.390
Two weeks later is when he walked out the door and you know the FBI came up and

248
00:13:14.391 --> 00:13:16.670
said Joseph and [inaudible] and why did he do this?

249
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.950
Cause he was trying to try and get the phone company pay attention.

250
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.240
That's right. That's right.

251
00:13:20.241 --> 00:13:23.210
In the hopes that he would get a free meal in jail or no,

252
00:13:23.211 --> 00:13:25.640
in the hopes that he would get a job with the phone company. That's right.

253
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.900
What a weird way to go about it. And amazingly it worked.

254
00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.600
Yeah, he got four job offers, all phone jobs.

255
00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.450
So he got a job at a little independent Millington telephone company and he

256
00:13:38.451 --> 00:13:39.680
started cleaning telephones.

257
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.900
Anything from cleaning phones to servicing equipment,

258
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.140
<v 12>any kind of job will do,</v>

259
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.330
<v 0>but any kind of job wouldn't do. You really didn't like it.</v>

260
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.720
It's that kind of thing where you realize your lifelong dream and then you

261
00:13:49.721 --> 00:13:53.470
think, wait, I can dream anything I want.

262
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:55.090
I can dream bigger than this.

263
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:59.350
And so in 1975 76 whatever,

264
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:03.490
he moved to Denver, Denver, where every dream is in reach,

265
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.970
paid for by the committee to promote Denverton.

266
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.530
He started hobnobbing with all the telephone guys and going into the public

267
00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:10.990
utilities commission and that's when he stopped working for mountain bell

268
00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:15.670
mountain bell telephone. And that's when he started freaking for the man.

269
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.930
And so he worked as a network troubleshooter and at this point he had such an

270
00:14:19.931 --> 00:14:23.620
intimate knowledge of all the little clicks and pops of the phone system that he

271
00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:27.580
could tell from those noises what was going on in the network,

272
00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:29.050
how your car was being routed.

273
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.890
There was a problem somewhere along the line that the problem was maybe even

274
00:14:32.891 --> 00:14:36.520
where it was. Wow. Strictly from listening strictly from excellent.

275
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.750
This was listening to the dial tone times near

276
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.130
<v 4>[inaudible] should</v>

277
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:52.963
<v 2>have to go through</v>

278
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.060
<v 0>and he demonstrated his powers on the New York radio station. WBAI there was,</v>

279
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.660
there was a show called off the hook.

280
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.220
<v 2>Okay. Good old bang.</v>

281
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:04.663
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

282
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.350
<v 2>would just stick. Click now it'll answer briefly.</v>

283
00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.340
That was a little funny. CML,

284
00:15:12.341 --> 00:15:16.780
it'll stay like that as long as you want to stay on it. [inaudible] nice sound.

285
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.850
I didn't know. Oh,

286
00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.620
it drops off on number five efs. I forgot.

287
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.120
<v 0>Wow. He's like a Jedi master. Yeah, he's made it. Yeah,</v>

288
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.540
and so he quit what gave up the job for his friend.

289
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.880
But it sounds like you finally got what he wanted.

290
00:15:32.881 --> 00:15:37.440
I think like he became the master of the world that he had escaped into,

291
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:42.830
but he never really dealt with the world that he had escaped from.

292
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.540
Meaning like that little boy,

293
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:50.570
that broken little boy that he was still needed a kind of fixing in a way that

294
00:15:51.391 --> 00:15:55.500
wasn't going to be, you know, no job is really gonna solve that. So,

295
00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.810
so my time,

296
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.370
he moves to Minneapolis on June 12th cause six,

297
00:16:02.371 --> 00:16:07.371
12 was Minneapolis area code and he basically becomes a kid again,

298
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.610
you know, just everything you did from that point on,

299
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.710
other than his phone had to do with children.

300
00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.170
He'd visit with children who were terminally ill.

301
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.480
You just visit with children in general.

302
00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.480
I've got a recording at home affect those, listening to it.

303
00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.010
Last night before he came to the interview,

304
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.730
I was laughing and giggling because all these little girls were coming up and

305
00:16:26.731 --> 00:16:28.080
they were saying, hi. Hi.

306
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:37.490
<v 14>[inaudible]</v>

307
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:41.290
<v 0>I'm going. I could hear the parents in the back saying, don't sit on his toys.</v>

308
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.080
And uh, you know, he acts, you start talking about little, little more to me,

309
00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:51.670
you know, about his being abused. And you know, missing out on his childhood.

310
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:56.700
And he was at a seminar at uplifting seminar and the instructor said something

311
00:16:56.981 --> 00:17:00.670
on the order of, I'm paraphrasing, like, tell me how you feel right now.

312
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.330
And he screamed and yelled and threw up his arms and said, joy bubbles.

313
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.860
And in that moment he decided that he would actually go by that name,

314
00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:13.480
joy bubbles. You may changed his name legally changed his name to joy bubbles,

315
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:14.403
all one word.

316
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:19.470
And it was around this time that he decided and announced that he wasn't going

317
00:17:19.601 --> 00:17:20.590
to be an adult anymore.

318
00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:24.400
His old name in his past was gone and he wanted to be five years old,

319
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.560
five years old, forever.

320
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:30.390
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

321
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.710
<v 0>and then he started doing this.</v>

322
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.800
<v 6>Gosh, it's may already. Well,</v>

323
00:17:34.801 --> 00:17:39.680
I'm glad you called stories and stuff. You're storyteller,

324
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.450
joy bubble here in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

325
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.500
<v 0>You know those recordings I mentioned at the beginning,</v>

326
00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:48.880
they're all from the show that Joe recorded every week.

327
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.220
He called it stories

328
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.460
<v 15>and stuff. And instead of broadcasting it,</v>

329
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.510
he'd record the episodes to an answering service and then you'd call a number

330
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.790
and listen to it on the phone.

331
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:05.060
<v 16>Hello kids shy adults. I think the title is part tiled and part adult.</v>

332
00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:10.150
<v 14>Well, hello, I am. Hello. If this story isn't stuff</v>

333
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.670
<v 16>you've read stories and stuff. This is Joey bubbles here in Minneapolis.</v>

334
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.240
That's all one word. No, don't you dare split it. Joey bubbles.

335
00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.410
<v 15>And this may be too armchair psychoanalytical,</v>

336
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:26.860
but it really feels as though it's the kind of show that he needed to hear when

337
00:18:27.051 --> 00:18:27.884
he was a kid.

338
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:34.090
Like the new five-year-old was trying to go back and say something to the

339
00:18:35.751 --> 00:18:37.400
five-year-old from the early fifties.

340
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.700
Something akin to it's okay in the end it's going to be okay.

341
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.850
<v 17>Yeah, there is help if you'd like an American, every friend,</v>

342
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.910
a bunch of 'em come that are just looking for somebody to love and play with and

343
00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:57.150
talk to. And so all you have to do is any quiet day,

344
00:18:57.151 --> 00:19:02.151
just get quiet and ask for one that the kind get like they'll come and uh,

345
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.520
they'll be with you for as long as you want them. [inaudible]

346

<v 18>[inaudible]</v>

347
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.290
<v 15>thanks to producer Shawn Cole and to Steven Gibbs and Phil Lapsley,</v>

348
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:25.980

349
