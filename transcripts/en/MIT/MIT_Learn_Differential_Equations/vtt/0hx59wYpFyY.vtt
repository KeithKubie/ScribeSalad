00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:01.800
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.540
I'm concentrating now on the
key question of stability.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.320
Do the solutions approach 0 in
the case of linear equations?

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.570
Do they approach some constant,
some steady state in the case

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.120
of non-linear equations?

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.550
So today is the
beginning of non-linear.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.360
I'll start with one equation.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.810
dy dt is some function of y,
not a linear function probably.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.300
And first question, what is a
steady state or critical point?

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.430
Easy question.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.020
I'm looking at
special points capital

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.380
Y, where the right-hand side
is 0, special points where

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.340
the function is 0.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.000
And I'll call those critical
points or steady states.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.930
What's the point?

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.020
At a critical point,
here is the solution.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.950
It's a constant.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.515
It's steady.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.430
I'm just checking here that
the equation is satisfied.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.950
The derivative is 0
because it's constant,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.930
and f is 0 because
it's a critical point.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.640
So I have 0 equals 0.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.170
The differential equation
is perfectly good.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.970
So if I start at a critical
point, I stay there.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.770
That's not our central question.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.950
Our key question is, if
I start at other points,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.685
do I approach a critical
point, or do I go away from it?

00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:56.320
Is the critical point
stable and attractive,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.840
or is it unstable and repulsive?

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.280
So the way to
answer that question

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.530
is to look at the
equation when you're

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.199
very near the critical point.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.350
Very near the critical point, we
could make the equation linear.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.680
We can linearize the equation,
and that's the whole trick.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.870
And I've spoken before,
and I'll do it again now

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.530
for one equation.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.240
But the real message,
the real content

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.010
comes with two or
three equations.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.780
That's what we see
in nature very often,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.990
and we want to know,
is the problem stable?

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.490
OK.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.250
So what does linearize mean?

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.740
Every function is
linear if you look at it

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.516
through a microscope.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.980
Maybe I should say if you
blow it up near y equal Y,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.885
every function is linear.

00:03:00.885 --> 00:03:02.015
Here is f of y.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.320
Here it's coming
through-- it's a graph

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.622
of f of y, whatever it is.

00:03:10.622 --> 00:03:14.640
If this we recognize
as the point capital Y,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.410
right, that's where
the function is 0.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:24.900
And near that point, my function
is almost a straight line.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.500
And the slope of that
tangent is the coefficient,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.630
and everything depends on that.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.440
Everything depends on whether
the slope is going up like

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.650
that-- probably that's going to
be unstable-- or coming down.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.330
If it were coming
down, then the slope

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.240
would be negative at
the critical point,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.360
and probably that
will be stable.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.040
OK.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.410
So I just have to do
a little calculus.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.260
The whole idea of linearizing
is the central idea of calculus.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.750
That we have curves,
but near a point,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.690
we can pretend-- they are
essentially straight if we

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.710
focus in, if we zoom in.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.390
So this is a zooming-in
problem, linearization.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.980
OK.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:25.850
So if I zoom in the
function at some y.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.850
I'm zooming in around
the point capital Y.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.710
But you remember
the tangent line

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.910
stuff is the function
at Y. So little y is

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.180
some point close by.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.610
Capital Y is the crossing point.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:56.870
And this is the y minus Y times
the slope-- that's the slope--

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:06.720
the slope at the critical point
there is all that's-- you see

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.860
that the right-hand
side is linear.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.110
And actually, f of Y is 0.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.100
That's the point.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.810
So that I have just a
linear approximation

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.180
with that slope and
a simple function.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.490
OK.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.590
So I'll use this approximation.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.370
I'll put that into the
equation, and then I'll

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.620
have a linear equation,
which I can easily solve.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.760
Can I do that?

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.090
So my plan is, take my
differential equation,

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.690
look, focus near
the steady state,

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.060
near the critical point
capital Y. Near that point,

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:55.570
this is my good approximation
to f, and I'll just use it.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.130
So I plan to use
that right away.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.580
So now here's the linearized.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:13.790
So d by dt of y equals f of y.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:20.630
But I'm going to do
approximately equals this y

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.530
minus capital Y times the slope.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.220
So the slope is my
coefficient little a

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.045
in my first-order
linear equation.

00:06:34.045 --> 00:06:40.610
So I'm going back to chapter
1 for this linearization

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.530
for one equation.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:48.770
But then the next
video is the real thing

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.640
by allowing two equations
or even three equations.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.570
So we'll make a
small start on that,

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.530
but it's really the next video.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:57.260
OK.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.860
So that's the equation.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.620
Now, notice that
I could put dy dt

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.710
as-- the derivative
of that constant

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.150
is 0, so I could
safely put it there.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.085
So what does this tell me?

00:07:10.085 --> 00:07:12.070
Let me call that number a.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.300
So I can solve that
equation, and the solution

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.740
will be y minus capital
Y. It's just linear.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.070
The derivative is the
thing itself times a.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:34.850
It's the pure model of steady
growth or steady decay.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:43.810
y minus Y is, let's
say, some e to the at.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.200
Right?

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.610
When I have a coefficient
in the linear equation ay,

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.870
I see it in the exponential.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.840
So a less than 0 is stable.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.840
Because a less than
0, that's negative,

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.210
and the exponential drops to 0.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.430
And that tells me that
y approaches capital

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:20.200
Y. It goes to the critical
point, to the steady state,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.110
and not away.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.520
Example, example.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.880
Let me just take an
example that you've

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:33.640
seen before, the logistic
equation, where the right side

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.020
is, say, 3y minus y squared.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:38.520
OK.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.659
Not linear.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:44.470
So I plan to linearize after
I find the critical points.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.450
Critical points, this is 0.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.960
That equals 0 at--
I guess there will

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:56.930
be two critical points because
I have a second-degree equation.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:05.900
When that is 0, it could be 0
at y equals 0 or at y equals 3.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.340
So two critical points,
and each critical point

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:15.040
has its own linearization, its
slope at that critical point.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.670
So you see, if I
graph f of y here,

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:29.700
this 3y minus y squared has--
there is 3y minus y squared.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.090
There is one critical point, 0.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.550
There is the other
critical point at 3.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.240
Here the slope is
positive-- unstable.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.030
Here the slope is
negative-- stable.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.060
So this is stable, unstable.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.730
And let me just push
through the numbers here.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:57.790
So the df dy, that's the slope.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.440
So I have to take the
derivative of that.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.830
Notice this is not my
differential equation.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.880
There is my
differential equation.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.530
Here is my linearization
step, my computation

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.390
of the derivative, the slope.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:17.570
So the derivative of
that is 3 minus 2y,

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.690
and I've got two
critical points.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.180
At capital Y equal 0, that's 3.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:29.580
And at capital Y equals 3,
it's 3 minus 6, it's minus 3.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.340
Those are the slopes
we saw on the picture.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.500
Slope up, the
parabola is going up.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.700
Slope down.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.093
So this will
correspond to unstable.

00:10:43.165 --> 00:10:46.450
So what does it mean
for this to be unstable?

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:52.000
It means that the solution
Y equals 0, constant 0,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.020
solves the equation, no problem.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:59.590
If Y stays at 0, it's a
perfectly OK solution.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:00.710
The derivative is 0.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.670
Everything's 0.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.990
But if I move a
little away from 0,

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:10.080
if I move a little way
from 0, then the 3y minus y

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.700
squared, what does it look like?

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.320
If I'm moving just
a little away from Y

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.900
equals 0, away from
this unstable point,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.420
y squared will be
extremely small.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.690
So it's really 3y.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.920
The y squared will be
small near Y equals 0.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.040
Forget that.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.635
We have exponential
growth, e to the 3t.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:43.640
We leave the 0 steady
state, and we move on.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.530
Now, eventually
we'll move somewhere

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.485
near the other steady state.

00:11:50.485 --> 00:11:57.510
At capital Y equals 3, the
slope of this thing is minus 3,

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:02.090
and the negative one
will be the stable point.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:14.000
So where y minus 3, the
distance to the steady state,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.620
the critical point will grow
like e to the mi-- well,

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.380
will decay, sorry, I said grow,
I meant decay-- will decay

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:29.040
like e to the minus 3t because
the minus 3 in the slope

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.180
is the minus 3 in the exponent.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:34.710
OK.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:38.270
That's not rocket
science, although it's

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.440
pretty important for rockets.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.570
Let me just say
what's coming next

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:47.590
and then do it in
the follow-up video.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:59.960
So what's coming next will be
two equations, dy dt and dz dt.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.910
I have two things.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.990
y and z, they depend
on each other.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:16.440
So the growth or decay of y
is given by some function f,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:24.330
and this is given by some
different function g, so

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.050
f and g.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:29.180
Now, when do I
have steady state?

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.480
When this is 0.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.520
When they're both 0.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.180
They both have to be 0.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.860
And then dy dt is
0, so y is steady.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.540
dz dt is 0, so z is steady.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:44.290
So I'm looking for-- I've
got two numbers to look for.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.150
And I've got two
equations, f of y-- oh,

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:52.370
let me call that capital
Y, capital Z-- so those

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.740
are numbers now-- equals 0.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:14:03.200
So I want to solve-- equals 0,
and g of capital Y, capital Z

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.630
equals 0.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.170
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:14.000
So both right-hand
sides should be 0,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.080
and then I'm in a steady state.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.360
But this is going to be like
more interesting to linearize.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.210
That's really the next video,
is how do you linearize?

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.560
What does the
linearized thing look

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.090
like when you have two functions
depending on two variables

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.490
Y and Z?

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:39.080
You're going to have, we'll
see, [? for ?] slopes-- well,

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.300
you'll see it.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.340
So this is what's coming.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.970
And we end up with
a two-by-two matrix

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:52.990
because we have two equations,
two unknowns, and a little more

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:58.960
excitement than the
classical single equation,

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.920
like a logistic equation.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.420
OK.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.650
Onward to two.
