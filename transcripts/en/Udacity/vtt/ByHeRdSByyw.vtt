00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.860
Let's now take a look at the anatomy of an HTTP response. A response

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.900
includes a status line, which includes the

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.630
HTTP version and a response code, whether response

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.450
code may indicate a number of possible

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.700
outcomes. 100 response codes are typically informational and

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.110
200s indicate success. So an example, 200

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.250
response code is a common server response that

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.930
indicates okay. 300 response codes indicate redirection.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.310
For example, a 301 response code indicates

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.310
that the page has moved permanently. 400s are errors, a well known one being 404

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.820
which is not found, and 500s indicate

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.970
server errors. Other headers, include the location, which

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.120
may be used for redirection. A server

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.650
which indicates server software. Allow which indicates the

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.960
HTTP methods that are allowed such as

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.650
get, head and so forth. Content-encoding, which

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.630
describes how the content is encoded. For

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.855
example, if it's compressed. Content length, which indicates,

00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:07.989
how long the content is in terms of bytes. Expires which indicates, how long the

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:10.865
content can be cached. And last-modified, which

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:13.160
indicates the last time the page was modified.
