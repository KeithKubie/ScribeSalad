00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.660
After being done with glycolysis
and the Krebs

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:10.315
Cycle, we're left with 10
NADHs and 2 FADH2s.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.240
And I told you that these are
going to be used in the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.650
electron transport chain.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.140
And they're all sitting in the
matrix of our mitochondria.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.996
And I said they're going to be
used in the electron transport

00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:26.190
chain in order to actually
generate ATP.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.750
So that's what I'm going to
focus on in this video.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.000
The electron transport chain.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.290
And just so you know, a lot
of this stuff is known.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.990
But some of the details
are actually

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.360
current areas of research.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.790
People have models and
they're trying to

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.960
substantiate the models.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.090
But things are happening at such
a small scale here that

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.620
people can just look at the
evidence, some of which is

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.940
indirect, and say, this is
probably what's happening.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.650
Most of this is very well
established, but some of the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.110
exact mechanisms-- for example,
how exactly some of

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.630
the proteins work-- aren't
completely understood.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.080
So I think it's very important
for you to understand that

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.280
this is at the cutting edge,
that you're already there.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.060
So the basic idea here is that
the NADHs-- and that's where

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.670
I'll focus.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.780
FADH2 is kind of
the same idea.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.960
Although its electrons
are just at slightly

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.210
lower energy state.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.780
So they won't produce
quite as many ATPs.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:32.570
Each NADH is going to be-- as
you'll see-- indirectly

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.500
responsible for the production
of three ATPs.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.100
And each FADH2, in a very
efficient cell, in both of

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.980
these cases, will be indirectly
responsible for the

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.520
production of two ATPs.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.020
And the reason why this guy
produces fewer ATPs is because

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.420
the electrons that he has
going into the electron

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.400
transport chain are at a
slightly lower energy level

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.580
than the ones from NADH.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.110
So in general, I just
said indirectly.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.620
How does this whole
business work?

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.680
Well in general, NADH, when it
gets oxidized-- remember,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.750
oxidation is the losing of
electrons or the losing of

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.010
hydrogens that happen
to have electrons.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.620
We can write its half
reaction like this.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.810
Its oxidation reaction
like this.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.790
You'll have some NAD plus, which
you can then go and use

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.130
back in the Krebs Cycle
and in glycolysis.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.630
You have some NAD plus, you'll
have a proton, a positive

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.940
hydrogen ion is just a proton.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.450
And then you'll have
two electrons.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.700
This is the oxidation of NADH.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.310
It's losing these
two electrons.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.520
Oxidation is losing electrons.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.620
OIL RIG.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.310
Oxidation is losing electrons.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.110
Or you can imagine it's losing
hydrogens, from which it can

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.600
hog electrons.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.250
Either one of those
is the case.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.650
Now this is really the
first step of the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.990
electron transport chain.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.030
These electrons are transported
out of the NADH.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.120
Now, the last step of the
electron transport chain is

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.130
you have two electrons-- and you
could view it as the same

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.320
two electrons if you like--
two electrons plus two

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.610
hydrogen protons.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.110
And obviously if you just add
these two together, you're

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.610
just going to have two hydrogen
atoms, which is just

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.280
a proton and an electron.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.210
Plus one oxygen atom, so
I could say one half of

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.450
molecular oxygen.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.190
That's the same thing as
saying one oxygen atom.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.030
And you're going to produce--
if I have one oxygen and two

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.105
complete hydrogens, I'm
left with water.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.850
And you could view this, we're
adding electron or we're

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.480
gaining electrons to oxygen.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.890
OIL RIG.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.740
Reduction is gaining
electrons.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.140
So this is the reduction
of oxygen to water.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.060
This is the oxidation
of NADH to NAD plus.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.480
Now, these electrons that are
popping out of-- these

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.720
electrons right here-- that are
popping out of this NADH.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.270
And when they're in
NADH they're at a

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.150
very high energy state.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.310
And what happens over the
course of the electron

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.260
transport chain is that these
electrons get transported to a

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.920
series of, I guess
you could call

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.589
them transition molecules.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.790
But these transition molecules,
as the electrons go

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.770
from one to the other,
they go into slightly

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.010
lower energy states.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.900
And I won't even go into the
details of these molecules.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.170
One is coenzyme Q,
and cytochrome C.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.820
And then they eventually end
up right here and they are

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.980
used to reduce your
oxygen into water.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.830
Now every time an electron
goes from a higher energy

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.960
state to a lower energy state--
and that's what it's

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.220
doing over the course of this
electron transport chain--

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.515
it's releasing energy.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.990
So energy is released when you
go from a higher state to a

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.380
lower state.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.060
When these electrons were in
NADH, they were at a higher

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.650
state than they are when they
bond to coenzyme Q.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.140
So they release energy.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.270
Then they go to cytochrome
C and release energy.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.300
Now that energy is used to
pump protons across the

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.410
cristae across the inner
membrane of the mitochondria.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.580
And I know this is all very
complicated sounding.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.800
And this is the cutting edge.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.760
So it maybe should sound
a little complicated.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.770
Let me draw a mitochondria.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.630
So let me draw a small
mitochondria just so you know

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.490
where we're operating.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.000
That's its outer membrane.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.980
And then its inner membrane,
or its cristae,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.340
would look like that.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.680
And let me zoom in
on the membrane.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.210
So let's say if I were to
zoom in right there.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.690
So if I were to zoom that out,
that box would look like this.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.490
You have your crista here.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.010
And I'm going to
draw it thick.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.020
So I'm zooming in.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.330
This green line right
here, I'm going to

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.300
draw it really thick.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.510
I'm going to color it in with
the green, just like that.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.050
And then you have your
outer membrane.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.090
This outer membrane, I
can do it up here.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.070
And I'll just color it in.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.400
You don't even have to see the
outside of the outer membrane.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.950
Right here, this space right
here, this is the outer

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.970
compartment.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.720
And then we learned in the last
video, this space right

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.970
here is the matrix.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.690
This is where our Krebs
cycle occurred.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.850
And where a lot of our NADH,
or really all of

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.420
our NADH, is sitting.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.900
So what happens is, every time
NADH gets oxidized to NAD

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.120
plus, and the electrons keep
transferring from one molecule

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.600
to another, it's occurring in
these big protein complexes.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.600
And I'm not going to go into
the details on this.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.860
So each of these protein
complexes span-- so let's say

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.810
that's a protein complex where
this first oxidation reaction

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.350
is occurring and releasing
energy.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.970
And then let's say there's
another protein complex here,

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.610
where the second oxidation
reaction is occurring and

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.860
releasing energy.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.320
And these proteins are able to
use that energy to essentially

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.910
pump-- this might all seem
very complicated-- to

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.810
essentially pump hydrogens
into the outer membrane.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.220
It actually pumps hydrogen
protons.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:19.940
And let me be very clear.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.610
Hydrogen protons into
the outer membrane.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.150
And every one of these reactions
pump out a certain

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.250
number of hydrogen protons.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.980
So by the end of the electron
transport chain, or if we just

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.750
followed one set of electrons,
by the time that they've gone

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.560
from their high energy state in
NADH to their lower energy

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.450
state in water, by the time
they've done that, they've

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.540
supplied the energy to these
protein complexes that span

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.330
our cristae to pump hydrogen
from the matrix

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.720
into the outer membrane.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.650
So really the only byproduct of
the oxidation of NADH into,

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.670
eventually, water, or the
oxidation of NADH and the

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.630
reduction of oxygen into
water, isn't ATPs yet.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.950
It's just this gradient where we
have a lot higher hydrogen

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.660
proton concentration in the
outer compartment than we do

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.630
in the matrix.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.480
Or you could say that the outer
compartment becomes a

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.290
lot more acidic.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.650
Remember acidity is just
hydrogen proton concentration,

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.020
the concentration of
hydrogen protons.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.640
So the byproduct of all of this
energy is used to really

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.780
just pump these protons into
the outer membrane.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.570
So you have two things.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.039
The outer membrane becomes
more acidic

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.539
than the matrix inside.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:40.110
Maybe we could call
that basic.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.640
And obviously these are all
positively charged particles.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:48.790
So there's actually an electric
gradient, an electric

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.440
potential between the
outer membrane

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.250
and the inner membrane.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.190
This becomes slightly negative,
that becomes

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.300
slightly positive.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.990
These guys wouldn't naturally
do this on their own.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:00.170
If this is already acidic and
it's already positive, left to

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.715
its own devices, these more
protons wouldn't be entering.

00:09:02.715 --> 00:09:06.950
And the energy to do that is
supplied by electrons going

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:11.270
from high energy state in NADH
to going to a lower energy

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.730
state, eventually, on the
oxygen in the water.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:15.650
That's what's happening.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.660
But essentially all that's
happening is protons being

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.160
pumped from the matrix into
the outer compartment.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.420
Now once that gradient
forms, these guys

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.250
want to get back in.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.760
These guys want to get
back into the matrix.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.940
And that is where the
ATPs are formed.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.300
So there's a protein that
also spans this.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.730
Let me draw.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.020
Remember this is all this inner
membrane right here.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.980
Let me just draw it a little
bit bigger right here.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.090
So that's our inner membrane,
our cristae right there.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.950
There's a special protein
called-- and I'll show you

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.960
actually a better diagram of
what looks like in a second--

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.295
called ATP synthase.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.000
And what happens is, remember
because of the electron

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.462
transport chain, we have all
of these hydrogen ions up

00:10:09.462 --> 00:10:12.540
here, all of these
protons really.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.370
All they are is a proton.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:18.210
That really want to get back
into the matrix down here.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:21.990
But they can't.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.520
This crista is impermeable to
them so they have to find a

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.960
special way to get through.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.420
They were able to go the reverse
direction through the

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.600
special protein complexes.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.390
Now they're going to
go back into the

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.250
matrix through ATP synthase.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.830
So they're going
to go back, but

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.080
something interesting happens.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.970
And this is really an area of
current research where people

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.510
think they know how it works
but they're not sure.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.290
Because you can't just take
these proteins apart and watch

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.946
them operate like you can a
regular mechanical engine.

00:10:48.946 --> 00:10:51.360
These are ultra-small and they
have to be in a living system.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.550
And they have to have the
right conditions.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.590
And you can't even-- it's hard
to see hydrogen protons.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.465
These are ultra-small things
that are, pretty much, you

00:10:58.465 --> 00:10:59.580
can't see them.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:04.490
But what happens, the current
model is, as these enter, as

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.040
these go through
my ATP synthase

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.800
there's actually an axle.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.370
So you can kind of view
this as a housing.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.530
And then there's an axle.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.910
And this is all just
a big protein.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.280
And there's an axle and then
there's another part of the

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.050
synthase down here.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.190
So you can imagine, this is
kind of mind-blowing.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:26.460
That something this fancy is
occurring on the membranes of

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.210
pretty much all living
systems' cells.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.230
It's not just eukaryotes.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.420
Even prokaryotes do this.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.900
They don't do it in their
mitochondria; they do it in

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.300
their cellular membrane.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.530
But it's a pretty neat thing.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.030
And what happens is, as these
go through, you can kind of

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.860
imagine as water flowing
through a turbine.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:46.540
It mechanically causes
this structure in

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.080
the middle to spin.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.280
To actually spin.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.700
This is the current thinking.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.970
And this thing is all uneven.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.000
It's not, like, this
nice tube.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.870
It'll look all crazy
like that.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.830
And what happens is that an ADP
molecule-- let's say that

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.730
this is the A part of the ADP.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.270
And then you have two
phosphate groups.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.770
It'll attach to one part
of this protein.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.910
And maybe a phosphate will
just randomly attach to

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.570
another part of this protein.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.280
Just like that.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.580
So right now it's just
ADP and a phosphate.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:24.290
But as this inner axle turns--
because it's not a symmetrical

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.440
tube, it has different things
sticking out that have

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.680
different amounts of atomic
charge and it's going to play

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.340
with this outer housing
right here.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.880
And so as this turns, the outer
housing, because of just

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.450
the proteins bumping against
each other and electrical

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.590
charge and whatever else, it's
going to squeeze the ADP and

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:48.460
the phosphate together to form,
actually form, ATP.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.120
And actually the current
thinking is that it does it on

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.240
three different sites
simultaneously.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.900
So as this spins around, ADP and
phosphate groups kind of

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.300
show up on the inside
of this housing.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.080
You could imagine
it like that.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.430
And I don't even know if
it's on the inside.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.830
But they show up
on the housing.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.750
And as this thing spins around,
it stretches and pulls

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.810
on this outer part and pushes
these two things together.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.070
So it's using the energy from
this proton gradient

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.580
to drive this axle.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.230
And because it's all strange, it
does all these distortions

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.280
on this outer part and
actually pushes

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.180
the two ATPs together.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:28.540
So when you start off with your
10 NADHs, it'll provided

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.250
just enough energy and just
enough protons to put into the

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.190
outer membrane that when they
go back through our ATP

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.350
synthase-- you could almost
view it as an ATP synthase

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.800
motor-- just based on people's
observations they see that

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.730
this will produce, on
a per-NADH level,

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.390
roughly three ATPs.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.690
On a per-FADH2 level,
roughly two ATPs.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.355
And I've said multiple times
in the videos, this

00:13:51.355 --> 00:13:52.480
is kind of an ideal.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.590
That a lot of times, maybe
you'll have some protons leak,

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.740
so their energy can't be
captured properly.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.600
Or maybe some of these electrons
might somehow jump

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.360
the gun or jump some steps, so
some of the energy gets lost.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.030
So you don't always have a
completely efficient system.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.580
And just so you believe that
this is actually occurring on

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.740
our membrane, there's
actual visual

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.050
depictions of these proteins.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:16.680
This is the actual protein
structure of ATP synthase

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.360
right here.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.610
That is actually ATP synthase.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.450
And as you can see, there's
this piece right here that

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:30.490
holds this part and that part.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.590
You can kind of imagine it
relatively stationary.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.490
The hydrogen comes
through here.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.200
The axle gets spun.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.940
And as the axle gets spun, ADP
and phosphate groups that are

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.450
lodged inside this
F1 part of the

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.600
protein, get pushed together.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.950
You have to put energy into the
reaction in order to make

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:48.780
them stick together.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.060
But they get pushed together by
the protein itself as this

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.280
axle turns around.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.100
And this axle turns around
from the energy of the

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.000
hydrogen going.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.270
I don't even know what the
mechanics would look like.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.940
But you could imagine-- in my
head I imagine, the simplest

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.880
thing is a windmill.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:10.300
Or not a windmill, as maybe some
type of water turbine or

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.320
maybe the simplest thing
is, if you have

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.010
something like that.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.090
I don't know if that's
what the protein

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.850
actually looks like.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.440
If you have any kind of
thing passing by, it's

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.770
going to spin it.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:19.990
It's going to spin
it like that.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.070
And you could be more creative
if you want to change the

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.270
angle of the spin and whatnot.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.620
And that's all, people are
really still trying to

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.340
understand this at a deeper
and deeper level.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.640
But for your purposes,
especially in an introductory

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.570
biology level, you just have to
realize that two things are

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.870
happening in the electron
transport chain.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.890
Electrons are moving from the
NADHs and the FADH2s to

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:45.520
eventually show up and
reduce the oxygen.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.700
And as they do that, they're
releasing energy as they go

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.400
from one molecule to another.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.570
They're going to lower
energy states.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:57.210
That energy is used to pump
hydrogen protons into the

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.420
outer compartment of
the mitochondria.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.450
And then that gradient, those
hydrogen protons want to get

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.520
back into the matrix of
the mitochondria.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.770
So as they go back in, that
drives this ATP synthase

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.970
engine, which actually
produces the ATP.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.680
So just like we said in the
past, when you have 10 of

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.520
these, on average-- let me say
this way-- on average each

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.720
NADH is going to
produce 3 ATPs.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.450
Not directly.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.380
It produces enough of a gradient
of hydrogen protons

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.680
to produce 2 ATPs in
the ATP synthase.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.440
And each FADH2, on average,
produces enough of a hydrogen

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.870
gradient to produce 2 ATPs.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.150
So if we come in with 10 NADH,
they're going to produce-- in

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:42.250
this ideal world-- 30 ATP.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:47.660
And then our 2 FADH2s are
going to produce 4 ATP.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:52.170
And then if you remember from
glycolysis, we had 2 net ATPs

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.300
directly produced.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.530
And from the Krebs cycle we had
2 ATPs directly produced.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:04.170
So then you have 4 from
glycolysis and Krebs, and that

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:08.230
gets us, once again, to our
magic 38 ATPs from one

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:09.900
molecule of glucose.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.880
And now, I think you have a
pretty good grasp of cellular

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.130
respiration.
