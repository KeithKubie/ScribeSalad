in some sense all of finance is about

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890
in some sense all of finance is about
 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.220
in some sense all of finance is about
imagination because finance is about

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230
imagination because finance is about
 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.320
imagination because finance is about
saying what should something be worth

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330
saying what should something be worth
 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.720
saying what should something be worth
today based on what I think is going to

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730
today based on what I think is going to
 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.339
today based on what I think is going to
happen in the future nobody knows what's

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349
happen in the future nobody knows what's
 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.499
happen in the future nobody knows what's
going to happen in the future and so all

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
going to happen in the future and so all
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.799
going to happen in the future and so all
financial models are specifying in some

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809
financial models are specifying in some
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.349
financial models are specifying in some
way an imagined future and then saying

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359
way an imagined future and then saying
 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.630
way an imagined future and then saying
if that future is true what should I pay

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640
if that future is true what should I pay
 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.529
if that future is true what should I pay
for something today

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539
for something today
 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.340
for something today
and so for example um if you're if

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350
and so for example um if you're if
 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.570
and so for example um if you're if
you're building an optional model you're

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580
you're building an optional model you're
 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.370
you're building an optional model you're
saying what will volatility be in the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380
saying what will volatility be in the
 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.290
saying what will volatility be in the
future and given my estimate of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
future and given my estimate of
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.389
future and given my estimate of
volatility in the future I can value an

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399
volatility in the future I can value an
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.030
volatility in the future I can value an
option today if you're looking at CDOs

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040

which sort of came a cropper in the
Bigham financial crisis essentially

human beings are saying what will
housing prices do in the future what

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450
housing prices do in the future what
 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.360
housing prices do in the future what
will defaults and loans be in defaults

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
will defaults and loans be in defaults
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.610
will defaults and loans be in defaults
and mortgages B and given my imagined

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
and mortgages B and given my imagined
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.650
and mortgages B and given my imagined
scenario for the future what should I

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
scenario for the future what should I
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.389
scenario for the future what should I
pay for something today that's sensitive

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399
pay for something today that's sensitive
 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.610
pay for something today that's sensitive
to that future behavior the big failures

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
to that future behavior the big failures
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.950
to that future behavior the big failures
I think or failures of imagination not

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960
I think or failures of imagination not
 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.590
I think or failures of imagination not
of mathematics the big mistakes are when

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
of mathematics the big mistakes are when
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.299
of mathematics the big mistakes are when
you don't think of something that does

in graduate school I went to see a movie

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090
in graduate school I went to see a movie
 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.490
in graduate school I went to see a movie
the night before my qualifying exams

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
the night before my qualifying exams
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710

Dudley Moore it's about 40 years old but
 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.340
Dudley Moore it's about 40 years old but
I think it was remade a few years ago

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350
I think it was remade a few years ago
 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.990
I think it was remade a few years ago
Dudley Moore I think they're both dead

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
Dudley Moore I think they're both dead
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.580
Dudley Moore I think they're both dead
now Darla Moore and Peter Cook he was a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
now Darla Moore and Peter Cook he was a
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.560
now Darla Moore and Peter Cook he was a
short-order cook and a Wimpy's in London

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570
short-order cook and a Wimpy's in London

short-order cook and a Wimpy's in London
and he's in love with the waitress that

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759
and he's in love with the waitress that
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.730

serves him Peter Cook plays the devil
and offers him seven chances to seduce

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740

the waitress in exchange for his soul
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.890
the waitress in exchange for his soul
and so he agrees and then he tries to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
and so he agrees and then he tries to
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.380
and so he agrees and then he tries to
specify the circumstances under which he

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390
specify the circumstances under which he
 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.340
specify the circumstances under which he
will be with the waitress and so the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
will be with the waitress and so the
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.039
will be with the waitress and so the
first time he says something like he'd

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049
first time he says something like he'd
 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.719

they are in this case on their around a

they are in this case on their around a
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.319
they are in this case on their around a
billiard table and they're in love with

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
billiard table and they're in love with
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.609
billiard table and they're in love with
each other but she's married to the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
each other but she's married to the
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.170
each other but she's married to the
owner of the castle and he's just a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
owner of the castle and he's just a
 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.539
owner of the castle and he's just a
guest and she has scruples so she's not

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
guest and she has scruples so she's not
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.270
guest and she has scruples so she's not
willing to get involved with him and

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280
willing to get involved with him and
 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.679
willing to get involved with him and
every scenario he tries of these seven

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689
every scenario he tries of these seven
 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.569
every scenario he tries of these seven
scenarios and he gets wrong in the last

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
scenarios and he gets wrong in the last
 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.639
scenarios and he gets wrong in the last
one he asks if they can both just be

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649
one he asks if they can both just be
 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.350
one he asks if they can both just be
somewhere quiet with nobody to interfere

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
somewhere quiet with nobody to interfere
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.730
somewhere quiet with nobody to interfere
with them and nobody talking and they

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
with them and nobody talking and they
 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.530
with them and nobody talking and they
make them both of them nuns in a sort of

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540
make them both of them nuns in a sort of
 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.350
make them both of them nuns in a sort of
Trappist monastery and so his

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
Trappist monastery and so his
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.199
Trappist monastery and so his
imagination can never specify precisely

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209
imagination can never specify precisely
 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.400
imagination can never specify precisely
enough

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
enough

enough

the future that that he'd like to have
 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.550
the future that that he'd like to have

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560
and I think that's sort of what goes
 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.110
and I think that's sort of what goes
wrong with a lot of financial models you

wrong with a lot of financial models you
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.060
wrong with a lot of financial models you
can't really write down one short

can't really write down one short
