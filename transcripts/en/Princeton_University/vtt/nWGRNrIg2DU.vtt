00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:07.741
Princeton is absolutely a leader
around diversity and inclusion.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.943
Diversity is so important
because we need so many more

00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:13.613
diverse students, faculty, and
staff here

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:17.217
that will not only enhance
Princeton, 

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:20.186
but help Princeton to
continue to grow.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.021
We have a president
who "gets it",

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.956
we have senior leaders
who "get it"

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:26.792 size:88% position:44%
they understand that
this is a priority

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:31.030
and there's been an incredible
investment all across campus

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.398 align:start position:0%
towards this effort

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:36.268
because we know the importance
of all members of our community

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:38.871
from students, to faculty,
to staff, 

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.372
to our alumni and visitors even

00:00:40.372 --> 00:00:44.744
to feel that they are a part of
a community that is caring,

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:49.215
that is inclusive, where they
can be valued contributors

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.651
to the overall mission
of excellence.

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:56.488
Princeton is so amazing at this
moment because we are at a time 

00:00:56.488 --> 00:01:00.059
of a complete culture shift, and
faculty, staff, and students

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.795
have an opportunity  to be
a part of that change, a part

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:07.099
of that growth, in a direction
that is very much inclusive

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:11.070
of all communities of
all people.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.508
Given the 2013 trustee report on
supporting diversity and

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:18.077
other initiatives that went
along with that, that was

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:20.579
very attractive to me
when I was looking at

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.316
employment potentially
at Princeton.

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:26.953
The investments are visible
on campus in terms of 

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:31.323
staffing resources, deans for
diversity in many offices,

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:34.661
centers that have been
developed and grown.

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:38.197 size:84% position:58%
It's a continuous effort.

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:41.033
There are about 7,000 students
on campus if you include

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:43.803
undergrad and graduate students,
and we have about

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:46.706
65 professionals whose full time
job is to support

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:50.109
diversity and inclusion
on campus.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.378
It's not just a workplace,
it's a community.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.647
The people who work at
the institution really

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.515 size:78% position:39%
care about one another.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:59.285
Staff, faculty, the students,
they really want to make

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:03.389
this place something that
is remarkable and unique

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.859
in its community. The way that
it helps individuals

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.028
form relationships
with one another.

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:11.064
I just think it's a
vibrant place to work.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:14.400
It's a place that's committed
to excellence. It's committed to

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.535
honoring people, and
bringing them forward

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:18.571
helping them to grow.

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.040
Princeton currently has ten
employee resource groups

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.410
that support a wide array of
different communities on campus.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.813
We do a lot of consultation
around a whole host of

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.716
diversity and inclusion matters,
and support staff in thinking

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:33.252
about how to make Princeton
a more equitable place to be,

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:35.721
and a more diverse place,
really an inclusive place

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:37.590 align:start size:88% position:13%
for all staff.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.893
Princeton has a lot of
services and centers.

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:44.229
So we also have the
Women's Center, the LGBT Center,

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.233
Davis International Center, the
Center for Jewish Life, the

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.601
Office of Disability services,
As well as

00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:53.706
the Office of Religious Life,
and the Carl Fields center.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:56.708
We're working in populations
of students that are more

00:02:56.708 --> 00:02:59.078
diverse than we've ever
seen in our history.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.848
And we need to make sure that
those students that come

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.850
from diverse backgrounds
are well represented. 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.788 line:91%
Institutions are in such a rush
to check off what we're

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:11.757 line:91%
trying to accomplish, and in
that process really forget

00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:15.395
the real fundamental reason why
the communities exist, and

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.363
they're built and they
exist on trust.

00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:21.067
Tolerance is not enough to
create community.

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:24.470
Respect, as wonderful as
that is, is not enough.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.208
Honoring and celebrating,
including all, not maintaining

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:32.478
the majority and making a little
bit of space to accommodate

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:35.281
those that are different, but
actually having a space where

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:39.218
everyone has an equal stake in
what it means to be

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:40.787
a Princetonian.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:44.557
It's important to have dialog
and discussion here on campus,

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:47.326
especially done in
an environment that is

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:49.128
facilitated by peers.

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:52.064
It's important to provide that
opportunity for students to

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:55.334
be able to explore, to be
able to challenge themselves,

00:03:55.334 --> 00:04:00.105
and further grow into who they
are and really think about

00:04:00.105 --> 00:04:03.576
their identity and not only of
themselves but also how

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:06.779 size:88% position:56%
they influence community. 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.482
Every single person is
different, and disability

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:11.918
is just another
type of difference.

00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:14.820
The main purpose for the
Office of Disability Services

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.457
is to be a place for students
who have disabilities and

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.992
to talk with us about
accommodations that may be

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:24.296
helpful to them in a classroom
or in navigating campus.

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:28.367
It really warms my heart when
I can see a student who has

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:32.171
overcome barriers and has then
been able to take advantage

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:35.341
of the academic experiences
here that will enable them

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:38.177
to make a difference
in this world.

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:42.014
Princeton University is probably
one of the most pluralistic

00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:44.783
campuses in America when
it comes to religious life.

00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:47.820
It offers opportunities for
worship, offers opportunities

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.557
for learning about one's faith
or another person's faith.

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:54.994
There is not only a full time
Muslim Chaplin and there is

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:57.896
also a full time Hindu Chaplin,
and we have many different

00:04:57.896 --> 00:05:00.800
Christian denominations, we have
different sects within

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.837
Judaism represented. You can ask
the tough questions and

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:08.040
no one will shun you for it.
It aspires to be a place

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.877
where everyone can find
a spiritual home.

00:05:11.877 --> 00:05:15.414
I believe that diversity and
inclusion and concepts around

00:05:15.414 --> 00:05:19.719
social justice are not addition,
it's not an add on

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.087
and it's not something extra,
it's just who we are

00:05:22.087 --> 00:05:24.056
and who we want our
students to be, and what

00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:27.527
we want them to know as we
prepare to create leaders

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:29.862
for a global society.

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:35.935
I really admire that Princeton
can acknowledge its shortcomings

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:39.671
as well as celebrate
its accomplishments.

00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:43.843
And when we acknowledge that we
have work to do, we act.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:48.414
And we lead in many of
these areas in improving

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:51.683
the experiences that our
students have, that our staff

00:05:51.683 --> 00:05:53.953 align:start size:94% position:6%
and faculty have.

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:56.088
You know it's not only about
making sure that our

00:05:56.088 --> 00:06:00.560
institution is always keeping in
mind what an ethical utopian

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.895
vision of itself would look
like, but also that we're

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:05.531
creating the kinds of people and
future leaders that can go out

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:08.067
in the world and make that
change more broadly.

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:10.602
People have
good intentions here.

00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:12.371 size:84% position:58%
They care about each other.

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:15.141
You feel that when
you're on campus.

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.644
We all are responsible for the
well-being of each other, and

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:22.614
if we live that we all
raise each other up.

00:06:22.614 --> 00:06:24.617
We have a responsible to grow,

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:26.319 size:78% position:61%
to learn from the lessons
of the past

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.222 line:91%
and to be committed to that
vibrant present and

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.157
translate it into
a better future,

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:34.794
into a better Princeton,
a brighter Princeton.
