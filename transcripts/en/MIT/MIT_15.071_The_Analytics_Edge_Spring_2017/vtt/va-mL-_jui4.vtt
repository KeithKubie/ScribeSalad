00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.110
What is the impact
of clustering?

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.100
Clustering members
within each cost bucket

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.080
yielded better predictions for
heart attacks within clusters.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.670
Grouping patients
in clusters exhibits

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.610
temporal diagnostic
patterns within nine months

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.840
of a heart attack.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.450
These patterns can
be incorporated

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.920
in the diagnostic rules
for heart attacks.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.690
The approach shows that using
analytics for early heart

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.500
failure detection through
pattern recognition

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.240
can lead to interesting
new insights.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.230
The findings here are reinforced
by results from our research.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.650
IBM, Sutter Health, and
Geisinger Health Systems

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.490
partnered in 2009 to
research analytics tools

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.790
in view of early detection.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.110
Steve Steinhubl, a
cardiologist from Geisinger,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.670
wrote, "our early
research showed

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.240
the signs and symptoms of
heart failure in patients

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.670
are often documented
years before diagnosis.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.289
The pattern of documentation can
offer clinically useful signals

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.550
for early detection of
this deadly disease."
