00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
Hey, whats up guys?

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.360
We are back outside and today is the day we're testing these homemade, pull tab, pyrotechnics.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.420
the idea here really is convenience, rather than having to light a fuse with a barbecue igniter

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.920
we want to be able to pull these tabs and have our pyrotechnics light themselves.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.420
So lets dive right in and see if they actually work!

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.660
Now to kick things off, I'm going to get started with one of these small paper tubes that we made.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.260
This is the smallest and one of the cleanest ones that I've made

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.400
So it should give us the safest results.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.940
Moment of truth guys! Lets go light it off!

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.400
Theoretically i should just be able to pull this and the thing will light itself, lets see if that's really the case!

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.120
Haha! The handle broke, i need more friction!

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.500
Oh dude! The fuse came out!

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.740
What the heck!

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.900
*Laughter*

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.380
Oh its still going to work though!

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.740
There it goes!

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.240
Nice! Nice!

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.580
I love the smell of smoke bomb in the morning!

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.700
So that was a success and it wasn't nearly as dangerous of a burn as i thought it was going to be.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.960
So for this one, I think i'm going to try pulling the tab and throwing it more smoke grenade style!

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.740
That was cool! Did you hear the way that it popped when it went off?

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.600
It was like "BANG!"

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.900
It went off in the wrong direction though, it kind of shot of to the side and i wanted it more pointed inwards.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.820
So i'm going to grab another one and we're going to try that again.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.920
There it goes.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.280
I really want that thing to go upright though

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.580
woah!

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.680
Look at the smoke! Look over by the slide! Look up into the trees! That's a lot of smoke!

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.060
Yep! Not going to complain about that, that's awesome!

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.080
Lets check out the damage!

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.920
Our pyrotechnic compositions melted off the hot glue, they just fall off the cardboard bases.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.980
But surprisingly, the cardboard bases didn't ignite on fire, they're just charred.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.400
These pieces of paper have crumbled into ash.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.360
That's 100% success, lets go bigger!

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.740
I'm not exactly sure how we are going to do it, but for this next one, id like to see two go off at once!

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.220
Cool! Here we go!

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.140
Sweet!

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.000
Oh! The other one hasn't taken off!

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.860
C'mon! You can do it!

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.800
Oh there it goes

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.760
Oh that's a fair amount of smoke!

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.500
Wow! Look over here! Look over by the trees and the pond!

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.780
That house is just completely covered in a smoke screen, that's awesome!

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.280
Wow!

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.600
Cool! That was awesome!

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.860
For this next experiment, let's try taking one of these big ones, burying it in the sandpit and see how these things do underground.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.280
Will it even light off? We're about to find out

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.980
Moment of truth!

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.140
Woah!

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.680
Woah!

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.140
That's kind of cool!

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.180
It's still burning underground, look at that!

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.620
It's like spewing ash! Kind of looks like a volcano!

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.560
Look at that! All that smoke rising up out of the sand! With a little geyser coming out from the top

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.540
Oh thats really hot! As you'd expect it would be, right?

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.740
Look at that! Oh my gosh that is freakin' cool!

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.480
Wow! This is way to much fun!

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.560
Okay, that exceeded my expectations.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.120
So apparently smoke bombs will go off underground, who knew?

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.420
We're down to our last two pyrotechnics, and i saved the best for last.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.200
We've got this refurbished smoke grenade and a cup full of the left overs, lets go with the grenade first!

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.860
I think for this one i'm going to get a little bit gutsy and see if i can hold on to the container while it actually smokes and goes off

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.560
This burns a lot hotter and a lot more vigorously than the normal smoke composition that would be in here.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.320
Because we're using a potassium nitrate, but that's why i am wearing gloves, safety first!

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.920
I'm looking forward to this one!

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.960
Here we go!

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.240
Oh wow! That works better than i thought!

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.580
Phew! It's raining hot ash on me but it's working, look it's working really well!

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.520
That is a lot of smoke!

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.400
And its not even hot on the outside, I can hold it bare handed and it feels just fine.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.620
This blows me away, i was expecting flames to be shooting out of there, but the flames seem to be tempered, and it was just a lot of really good smoke

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.280
I do feel the heat starting to be transfer down to the plastic now, but for the most part

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.020
That was an epic success! I'm really proud of that guys! That worked really, really well!

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.500
For the Grand finale, lets bring out Big Bertha!

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.860
This one here guys, I'm really looking forward to, that is a lot of material and i think its going to get really hot, really fast!

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.680
So we're going to do it close to water.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.760
Now if you look in the centre here, you can see that as the composition cooled, it actually sucked down quite a bit into the centre

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.320
So I'm not sure how well that fuse is going to stay on

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.880
I'm hoping that there is still enough friction in there to hold the fuse and the igniter in place as we pull it, so lets go find out!

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.820
Not going to lie, I am a little bit nervous about this one, but we just got to suck it up!

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.000
Here we go!

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.700
Oh yea, there's plenty of delay time there.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.900
Oh, there it goes!

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.660
The flames are shooting at least two feet tall! And look at all that smoke!

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.440
Oh my heck! That was a lot of smoke!

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.500
I wouldn't be surprised if the neighbours complain on that one!

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.020
Lets take a look at the glass

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.820
Oh my goodness! Look at the top here!

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.900
This is where the rim used to be.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.400
I'm actually really surprised that that's stayed intact as much as it did

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.860
But you can see the top has just fell off

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.140
I thought for sure this glass would have been completely disintegrated.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:48.500
That was a pretty good size fireball guys! And honestly i cant think off any better way to deal with leftovers, then to light them of in style!

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.720
So guys, lets recap what just happened.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.520
We started off with our smallest and cleanest smoke bomb because we weren't sure they'd even work at all, but they did work.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.660
So we tossed them hand grenade style and watched them go off and that was fun.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.300
Then we moved it up to lighting off two off them at the same time.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:08.260
That was so much fun that we moved over to the sandpit to see if our smoke bombs could still burn underneath the sand, and they did.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.360
And actually that right there was probably the most surprising thing of this whole experiment here today.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.040
We lit one of our smoke bombs off inside off a plastic grenade and that was a tremendous success

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.760
And we took all the left over scraps, put them in a cup and lit them off by my fishpond.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.240
A day like this cant get any better unless you have a little bit of pyrotechnics and a whole lot of smoke.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.120
Thanks for joining me for this experiment guys, I'l be looking for you in the next one

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.260
Talk to you then!

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.920
Oh! It just came right out, haha, need a better way to hold that!
