00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.300
Determine the number of
solutions to the quadratic

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.200
equation, x squared plus 14x
plus 49 is equal to 0.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.760
There's a bunch of ways
we could do it.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.325
We could factor it and just
figure out the values of x

00:00:12.325 --> 00:00:13.560
that satisfy it and
just count them.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.310
That will be the number
of solutions.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.400
We could just apply the
quadratic formula.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.690
But what I want to do here is
actually explore the quadratic

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.290
formula, and think about how we
can determine the number of

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.290
solutions without even maybe
necessarily finding them

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.280
explicitly.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.950
So the quadratic formula tells
us that if we have an equation

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.830
of the form ax squared plus bx
plus c is equal to 0, that the

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.840
solutions are going to be-- or
the solution if it exists is

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.860
going to be-- negative b plus or
minus the square root of b

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.570
squared minus 4ac.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.770
All of that over 2a.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.220
Now the reason why this can be
2 solutions is that we have a

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.070
plus or minus here.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.620
If this b squared minus 4ac is
a positive number-- so let's

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.250
think about this a little bit.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.220
If b squared minus 4ac
is greater than 0,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.470
what's going to happen?

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.410
Well, then it's a
positive number.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.950
It's going to have
a square root.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.920
And then when you add it to
negative b you're going to get

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.910
one value for the numerator, and
when you subtract it from

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.400
negative b you are going
to get another

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.450
value in the numerator.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.935
So this is going to lead
to two solutions.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.550
Now what happens if b squared
minus 4ac is equal to 0?

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.390
If this expression under the
radical is equal to 0, you're

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.860
just going to have the
square root of 0.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.790
So it's going to be negative
b plus or minus 0.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.673
And it doesn't matter whether
you add or subtract 0, you're

00:01:40.673 --> 00:01:42.270
going to get the same value.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.870
So in that situation, the
actual solution of the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.260
equation is going to be
negative b over 2a.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.060
There's not going to be this
plus or minus, it's not going

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.540
to be relevant.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.770
You're only going to
have one solution.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.170
So if b squared minus 4ac
is equal to 0, you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.920
only have one solution.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.240
And then what happens if
b squared minus 4ac

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.150
is less than 0?

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.800
Well if b squared minus 4ac is
less than 0, this is going to

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.863
be a negative number right here
and you're going to have

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.880
to take the square root
of a negative number.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.430
And we know, from dealing with
real numbers, you can't take

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.020
the square root.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.010
There is no real number
squared that becomes a

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.560
negative number.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.560
So in this situation there is
no solutions, or no real--

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.370
when I say real I literally
mean a real

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.195
number-- no real solution.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.530
So let's think about it
in the context of this

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.670
equation right here.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.840
And just in case you're curious
if whether this

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.170
expression right here,
b squared minus 4ac,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.740
has a name, it does.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.990
It's called the discriminant.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.045
This is the discriminant.

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:53.032
That's that part of the
quadratic equation.

00:02:53.032 --> 00:02:55.450
It determines the number
of solutions we have.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.185
So if we want to figure out the
number of solutions for

00:02:57.185 --> 00:02:59.180
this equation, we don't have
to go through the whole

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.360
quadratic equation, although
it's not that much work.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.400
We just have to evaluate
b squared minus 4ac.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.530
So what is b squared
minus 4ac?

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.830
So b is right here, it's 14.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.590
So it's 14 squared minus 4 times
a, which is 1, times c,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.120
which is 49.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.480
That c, right there, times 49.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.972
What's 14 times 14?

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:27.275
Let me do it over here.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.870
14 times 14.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.230
4 times 4 is 16.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.120
4 times 1 is 4.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.540
Plus 1 is 56.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.180
Put a 0.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.100
1 times 14 is 14.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.850
It is 6, 9, 1.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.800
It's 196.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.750
So this right here is 196.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.070
And we can ignore the 1.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.845
What's 4 times 49?

00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:56.080
So 49 times 4.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.840
4 times 9 is 36.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.090
4 times 4 is 16 plus
3 is 190-- or is

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.210
19, so you get 196.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.200
So this right here is 196.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.540
So b squared minus 4ac
is 196 minus 196.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.250
So 196 minus 196
is equal to 0.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.850
So we're dealing with a
situation where the

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.720
discriminant is equal to 0.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.120
We only have one solution.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.800
And if you want, you could try
to find that one solution.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.020
This whole part is going to
be the square root of 0.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.020
It's just going to be 0.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.790
So the solution is going to
be negative b over 2a.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.920
And negative b is-- we
could just solve it.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.170
Negative b is negative 14 over 2
times a. a is just 1 over 2.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.420
So it's equal to negative 7.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.560
That's the only solution
to this equation.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.480
But if you just wanted to know
how many solutions, you just

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.460
have to find out that b squared
minus 4ac is 0.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.250
So it's only going to
have one solution.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.990
And there's other ways.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.530
You could have actually factored
this pretty easily

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.270
into x plus 7 times x plus 7
and gotten the same result.
