00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.035
Donald Trump took time out of

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.370
his busy schedule a-tweetin' on

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.605
the crapper to take over the one

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:05.906
place even more bat-shit crazy

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:07.374
than him...

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:10.277
Japanese wrestling!

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:11.578
(laughter)

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:13.514
That's, uh, definitely him.

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:15.148
I don't...

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:16.950
DDT pro wrestling just unveiled

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.585
their new leader, Donald Trump,

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:19.753
who they say evolved out of a

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.021
regular Japanese wrestler,

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.556
quote, "like a PokÃ©mon." And...

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:24.391
(laughter)

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.592
...judging by this picture,

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.661
I'm assuming it was Bulbasaur.

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:28.862
(laughter)

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:29.863
Good, you guys are still

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:30.364
playing.

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:32.165
This Trump... this Trump wasted

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.166
no time establishing his

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.434
policies on gay rights by

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:35.702
announcing a, quote, "anal

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.337
explosion death match" between

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:38.772
the world's strongest gay

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:41.408
wrestler... and the world's

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:43.644
strongest penis fighter.

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:45.779
And unlike some Donald Trumps I

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.247
could name, this one followed

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:50.517
through on his promises.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.586
(audience groans, laughter,

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:54.521
shouting)

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.160
Under Trumpcare, that's a

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.361
prostate exam.

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.496
(laughter)

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:03.931
(applause, whooping)

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.700
It kind of... I also...

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.069
Doesn't it... doesn't it also

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.370
look like this truck is going,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.805
"I've driven into them.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.408
Pardon me. I'll just... be...

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:15.609
backing out."

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.544
(imitating backup beeping)

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.583
Uh, what are some other Japanese

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:23.684
wrestling matches Trump will

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:24.585
order?

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:25.586
Brian.

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:27.020
&gt;&gt; Uh, tiny thumb wrestling.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.589
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Yes, points!

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:30.457
Uh, Stephanie.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:31.992
&gt;&gt; Slam them by the pussy.

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:33.160
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.161
Very good. Very good.

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:35.162
(applause)

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:36.163
Uh, Sasheer.

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:37.164
&gt;&gt; Father-daughter mud

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:37.664
wrestling.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:38.665
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Yes, points!

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:39.666
Perfect!

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.168
(laughter, whooping, applause)

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:45.072
Very good, Sasheer. Thank you.

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:46.473
(like Trump): I mean, the mud's

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:47.474
optional, you know, the mud's

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:48.141
optional.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.142
We could have it, we could not

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:49.510
have it.
