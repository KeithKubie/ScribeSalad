00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:04.570
- I'm doing a gig for the head
of Sony Music.

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:05.838
He just retired.

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:07.406
- Really?
- (Dan) Holy shit.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.841
Tommy Mottola?

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:10.276
- Mmm...
- (Dan) Wasn't that?

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.478
- That kind of sounds like it.
- (Dan) I think he was the--

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.014
He was the si-- he was the head.
- What?

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.282
(Dan)
He married Mariah Carey

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:18.351
when he was the president of--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:20.886
If this is the guy,
you just gave me material.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.021
(Dan)
Tommy Mo-- I don't think

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:24.157
it's Tommy Mottola.
- No, no, it's-- he's--

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.791
Wait, wait, hold on.
Who is this guy?

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:26.826
(Dan)
What if this exposes me

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.127
as actually being a rich kid?

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.295
I go, "That's my dad."
(gasps)

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.097
- If you still do jokes
about him being married

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.298
to Mariah Carey, go, "Sorry,

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.800
I thought you were
Tommy Mottola."

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.135
(Dan)
He goes, "That's the best roast

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:36.769
I've ever seen in my life."
- When I took this gig,

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.304
I thought you were
Tommy Mottola.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.173
- I was really only doing this
'cause I thought--

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.007
I have a bunch
of Mariah Carey jokes

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:44.043
that I thought
were gonna murder.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.112
- No. Martin...

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.080
Martin Bandier.
- Okay.

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:52.118
- Chairman and CEO
of Sony ATV Music forever,

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:53.519
and he's retiring.
- Damn.

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:55.888
- Let's take a look at him.
We'll roast his ass right now.

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:57.123
We'll set you up.
- Bring him up.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:58.257
- This is him right here.
- Oh, look at this guy.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.525
- There you go!
That's him!

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:00.994
That's the picture they sent me.
That one.

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:02.161
Right-- the second one.
- Dude, that guy--

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:03.295
You guys can-- you could smell

00:01:03.328 --> 00:01:05.965
the money through the picture.

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:07.800
That is so much fucking money.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:10.336
- He looks like the guy
who hides the vaccine for AIDS.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.939
- Yeah.
He looks like he's--

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:14.507
He looks like-- yeah.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.709
♪♪

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.277
(flames crackling)

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.748 line:0%
- What I remember very much,
before I started doing comedy,

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:25.217 line:0%
I think several years before
I even thought of doing it,

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.587 line:0%
on my mom's TV in her bedroom
I would watch

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.923 line:0%
on Philly 57,
"Uptown Comedy Club."

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.892 line:0%
- Wow!
- Which is where I saw--

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:34.360
And you and Rob Magnotti...

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:35.761
- Wow!
- ...were the, uh,

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:39.031
were the white guys with Macio
and Monteria Ivey

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:41.401
and all these guys, uh,
on this show,

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:42.835
and it was--
- (Jim) Wow.

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:44.971
- You guys started so many bits.
I remember the drunk cops.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.872
- Yeah, "Top Cops."
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.775
With Macio you would do.
- Yeah.

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.309
- And then it was very cool
when I started working

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:51.777
the comic strip,
when I first got to New York,

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:52.679
Macio was like a regular.

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:54.380
I think he's like
a cruise ship guy now...

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:55.982
- I think so too, yeah.
- ...I think, ultimately.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:57.549
But Macio, uh,
was a comic who was around.

00:01:57.583 --> 00:02:00.153
And when I'd see Magnotti and
these guys, I'd be like, "Wow!"

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:04.223
To me, that registered from
"Uptown Comedy Club,"

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:06.593
but I also,
starting in Philadelphia,

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:09.194
just by where it was
and the timing

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:12.064
and it would-- it was
after the fall, I guess,

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:13.633
of several comedy clubs
in Philadelphia,

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.968
and all that remained was
The Laff House,

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.504
which was a black comedy club,
and that's where I started.

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:23.243
I only did the black
comedy circuit for years,

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.178
like, before I ever crossed over
into the mainstream stuff.

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.413
And also, knowing that world,
when I got to perform

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:29.849
at the Brown's place,
the Uptown Comedy Store there,

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:31.250
that was such a cool thing
for me.

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:32.585
- Wow.
- (Dan) Yeah, so?

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.321
- And to do well-- I mean,
pandering wildly, I'm sure,

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:36.655
but doing well still.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.424
But I knew how to pander nice
in the beginning.

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:39.959
- Wow.
- (Jay) Yeah, yeah.

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:41.894
- That's quite a throwback.

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:43.029
- Yeah, I mean, that--

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.331
- That's 1992, '93, '94.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.800
- Did that feel-- I mean,
that had to feel at the mo--

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.102
How long were you in comedy
when that popped up?

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:54.039
- I started--
I started in '85.

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:55.408
- Mm-hmm.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:59.112
- But when I say "started,"
it means I started dabbling.

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.679
(Dan)
Just open mics occasionally?

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:03.649
- I played a--
I would start at a rock club.

00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:04.917
- Were you in college
or something?

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.619
- No, no, high school.
- (Jay) High school still?

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:08.354
Oh, shit.
- So, in high school,

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:11.357
I would go to this rock club
called February's

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.560
on Hempstead Turnpike
in Elmont.

00:03:14.593 --> 00:03:16.629
- (Jay) Okay.
- And it was a rock--

00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:18.164
it was a rock club.
- (Dan) Yeah.

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:20.533
- So, me, my friends.

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:23.703
And my friend would say,
"You need to emcee."

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:27.406
And I would emcee.
And my first joke was--

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.675
'Cause "Live Aid" just came out.
- (Jay) Mm-hmm.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.212
- That's how I remember this.
And "Live Aid"--

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:34.780
I was looking for an Ozzy joke
'cause Ozzy was on.

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:38.250
- (Jay) Mm-hmm.
- So, my very first joke was:

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:41.854
Did you guys see "Live Aid"?
How great was Ozzy?

00:03:41.887 --> 00:03:44.757
You know, you had, uh...

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.460
Freddie Mercury and U2,
but when they threw

00:03:48.493 --> 00:03:51.096
the Ethiopian on stage and...

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.098
(as Ozzy)
Ozzy bit his head off!

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:54.634
(fake laughing)

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.201
And you know, and there's
eight people going,

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.604
"Yeah, Breuer!
You're the best!"

00:03:58.637 --> 00:04:01.974
And then I was doing-- so,
this place called February's,

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:04.276
which was a rock club
and they would play metal

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:06.345
and Priest and all these guys.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.680
And then I went to Governor's
in Long Island.

00:04:08.714 --> 00:04:10.483
- (Dan) Yeah.
- And I played there three times

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:12.885
and I really thought I was gonna
be discovered immediately.

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:16.189
That's how-- That's how cocky
and confident I was.

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:18.490
- I reached out to managers
in a Yellow Pages

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.393
about a month into comedy.
I was like, well,

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:23.095
time to get some fucking muscle
behind this hustle.

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:24.297
Some hustle behind this muscle.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.333
- Dude, I-I, uh--
You know, 'cause I started,

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:29.268
uh, in the Internet age.

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:30.569
I remember submitting
to, like,

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.704
a Sierra Mist competition
in '03,

00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:35.375
and I was like, well, they'll
probably pluck me out of Tucson

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:38.144
and it'll be cool to buy a car
in the first month.

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:40.112
But, uh, you're talking about--
- Cash.

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:41.480
- Yeah.
Working at February's,

00:04:41.513 --> 00:04:43.149
you're like 16, 17?
- No.

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:46.685
I was 17 about to turn 18.
- That's still fucking crazy.

00:04:46.718 --> 00:04:49.555
You're like 17, you're like,
"Let's go rip it at Governor's!"

00:04:49.588 --> 00:04:52.691
I was like-- I was 26
driving out to Governor's like,

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:54.093
"Fuck! Fuck!"

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.463
- I was 19,
um, when I started.

00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:59.132
- I was 21-- yeah,
I was 21 when I started.

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:03.135
- And but it took me five whiffs
of not even going on stage

00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:05.037
before attempting to go on.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.173
But you felt comfort there
'cause people knew you, though,

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:08.240
too, a little bit.

00:05:08.273 --> 00:05:10.043
- No, nobody-- no.
- Oh, yeah.

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:12.245
It was the show-- the show--
the show before that.

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:14.180
- Yeah, the shows.
- (Jay) The rock show.

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:18.684
- And then-- And then,
I went into acting,

00:05:18.717 --> 00:05:22.187
and I got some jobs, but then
my family moved to Florida,

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.623
and it fucked me up.
- Okay.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.124
- 'Cause it threw me
way off course.

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:28.627
- Yeah.
- And so, 1989,

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.331
I was watching Arsenio Hall
and I-I said,

00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:33.966
"God, I want to go back
to stand-up.

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.267
"God, I wanna go back.

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:37.003
Why don't I follow
my stand-up career?"

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:40.473
In 1989, I'm watching, uh--

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.908
or it was '88,
something like that--

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:45.410
Arsenio Hall
and Eddie Murphy's on there.

00:05:45.444 --> 00:05:47.179
And Arsenio goes...

00:05:47.212 --> 00:05:49.314 line:0%
(as Arsenio)
"So, uh, Eddie.

00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:51.484 line:0%
"There's young comedians
out there.

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:53.652 line:0%
What-- You got any advice
for 'em, hmm?"

00:05:53.685 --> 00:05:55.287
And Eddie Murphy looked
at the screen,

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:56.722
he goes-- he goes...

00:05:56.755 --> 00:05:58.090
(as Eddie)
"Don't listen to your mother.

00:05:58.124 --> 00:05:59.725
"Your mother will tell you
to fall back on stuff.

00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:01.393
"You can never fall back.
If you want to be a comedian,

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:03.463
"you do it 100%.
If you're gonna do something,

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:05.764
you gotta do it 100%.
You can't be 20% here, 40%."

00:06:05.797 --> 00:06:07.599
And I went, holy shit,
he's talking to me.

00:06:07.632 --> 00:06:10.435
- Yeah.
- And-- And so the--

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:12.972
I saved all my money...
- Yeah.

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:15.341
- ...in Florida as a waiter
for a year,

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.910
and I said I'm gonna take off
and go full-blown

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:18.978
and never look back.

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:22.581
And that was 1989, July.

00:06:22.614 --> 00:06:24.950
And I went to a place called
Ron Bennington's Comedy Scene...

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:27.352
- Hell yeah.
- ...at the Radisson Inn,

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:28.921
Clearwater, Florida.
- (Jay) Yup.

00:06:28.954 --> 00:06:30.556
- Yeah!
- And then--

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:32.491
- Fucking 30 years ago!

00:06:32.524 --> 00:06:34.693
- Yeah, yes.
- Fucking-- that's awesome!

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:37.796
- And then 2 1/2,
3 years later,

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.000
I was-- I was--
I was featuring,

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:43.503
which means you do 30 minutes...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:45.904
- ...headlining, but I should
not have been headlining.

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:48.508
And then I said, I gotta move
to New York/L.A.

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:49.909
- By the way,
did you get a just--

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:52.445
not to sidebar here too much--
but did you get like a nice,

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:53.946
coked-up, wacked-out
Ron Bennington?

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:55.648
- (Dan) Yeah!
- We're all dying to know

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:57.516
what a night with him
would be like that was like.

00:06:57.549 --> 00:06:58.951
- Yeah, we only know--
- Well, when--

00:06:58.984 --> 00:07:00.786
- We know reformed,
successful Ron Bennington.

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:04.924
- I know smooth jazz,
old junkie story Ron Bennington.

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:06.659
- (Dan) I know, I know.
- I wanna hear the fucking,

00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:08.895
Ron been doing like fucking, uh,
you know, Fred Astaire flips

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.429
off a wall.
- That's what I want.

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:13.432
I want-- I've gotten
double glasses on the head,

00:07:13.465 --> 00:07:15.901
chomping at a cigar,
wise tales Ron Bennington.

00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:17.770
- (Jay) Yes!
- I want a guy that's fucking--

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:19.639
waitresses are nervous
to be alone with.

00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:22.241
- Dressed like a fucking
A.C. Slater.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.408
- Yeah, yeah.

00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:26.111
I want the fucking--
give us the dirt!

00:07:26.144 --> 00:07:27.780
- Ron Bennington.

00:07:27.813 --> 00:07:30.115
It was called
"The Ron and Ron Show,"

00:07:30.148 --> 00:07:31.850
and it was on, like, 98 Rock,

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:35.754
and he was
the biggest radio DJ...

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:37.256
- Mm-hmm.
- ...in the Tampa,

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:38.523
St. Pete, Florida.

00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:40.659
I mean, he was huge!

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:43.795
- And that's literally coming
from he just went on the radio

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:45.931
to promote the comics
from The Comedy Club,

00:07:45.964 --> 00:07:46.966
and they were like,
"You're pretty great.

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.467
You want to just be
on the show?"

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.868
And he was like, "Yeah."
- He goes, "Cool!

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:52.205
Let me, uh, step into this
and be a legend."

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:53.539
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:07:53.572 --> 00:07:57.442
And then-- So, he only showed up
once in a blue moon.

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:58.910
And when he showed up...
- Yeah.

00:07:58.944 --> 00:08:01.881
- ...it was like
Rodney Dangerfield showing up

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:03.015
at Dangerfield's.

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.717
You were-- You were like,
"Holy shit!

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.652
Ron Bennington's here!
Oh, my God!"

00:08:06.685 --> 00:08:07.953
- Now--
- "I don't wanna--

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:09.855
"I'm goin' up there--
dude, I'm not going up tonight.

00:08:09.888 --> 00:08:11.624
"I'm not.
My set's not tight enough.

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:13.259
I can't fucking go
in front of Ron."

00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:15.694
And he would go up and he would
talk about Philadelphia

00:08:15.727 --> 00:08:16.996
and he would do his set
and we're like,

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:20.966
"Oh, my God!
It's Ron Bennington!"

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.901
- Did he wear robes
like Rodney?

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:24.370
He's just-- he's in
a terry cloth, he's like...

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.805
(as Rodney)
"Hey, we're all gonna get laid!"

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.041
Like, fucking Ron
was a swinger.

00:08:29.074 --> 00:08:31.677
- He was a swinger.
- Yeah, God, for Ron!

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.546
I fucking love Ron!
- He was in with the Phillies

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:35.047
and the Hooter Girls.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.815
It was-- It was huge.

00:08:36.848 --> 00:08:39.551
- '80s Hooters Girls?
- He was full-blown rock star.

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:40.987
- That's Vanilla Dan tens.
- Yeah.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.488
I see he was a rock star.
- He was full-blown rock star.

00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:45.323
- I fucking love Ronny B.!
- Yeah.

00:08:45.357 --> 00:08:46.925
Extremely intimidating.
- Yeah.

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:49.128
- He was huge.
- I'm still intimidated by him.

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:52.331
- And that's in 1991.

00:08:52.364 --> 00:08:54.500
I said, I'm moving back
to Long Island

00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:56.235
in my friend's basement.

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:58.937
And in six months,
I got The Uptown Comedy Club.

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.138
- (Jay and Dan) Wow!
- And then--

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:04.676
So I kind of got shot out
of a cannon quick.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.546
And two years on there,
and then development,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.515
then me and Chappelle
are gonna have a sitcom,

00:09:09.548 --> 00:09:11.417
and then-- and then
"Saturday Night Live."

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.685
It all happened really quick.
- Yeah.

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:16.888
But you-- Moving from Florida
to New York--

00:09:16.922 --> 00:09:18.123
and, you know,
you're featuring,

00:09:18.156 --> 00:09:19.792
you're doing some
headlining work down there--

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:21.127
when you moved to New York,
do you notice

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.795
that your jokes work?

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:24.629
Like, 'cause when I--
- My jokes worked,

00:09:24.663 --> 00:09:26.532
but everyone hated me.
- Okay.

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:29.201
- And I--
- You're saying the black club?

00:09:29.234 --> 00:09:31.636
- No, but I'm saying, like--
I'm just saying, like,

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.839
when I moved from Tucson
to New York, and I was--

00:09:33.872 --> 00:09:35.707
I was doing the same thing.
I was featuring,

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:38.143
which was a stretch in Tucson,
and emceeing,

00:09:38.176 --> 00:09:42.048
and I moved here and I was like,
oh, I was totally wrong.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:43.382
- Yeah.
- I, like, had to do a thing

00:09:43.415 --> 00:09:44.750
where I was like,
tear it all down,

00:09:44.783 --> 00:09:48.153
we gotta restart everything.
- I did too.

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:51.590
And I hated certain comics
'cause they were such dicks.

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:53.559
- Yeah.
- I hated Marc Maron.

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:54.893
I hated Louis C.K.

00:09:54.926 --> 00:09:57.663
I hated all these motherfuckers
'cause they were dicks.

00:09:57.696 --> 00:09:59.765
- Were they just, like, snobby?
- They were snobby,

00:09:59.798 --> 00:10:01.734
"fuck you," look down on me.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:02.934
So my attitude was like,
"Well, fuck you.

00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:04.670
I'm gonna crush you."
- Yeah.

00:10:04.703 --> 00:10:09.508
- And through time, uh--
And even Attell at one point,

00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:10.709
I was like, "Well, fuck you."

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:13.779
You go on stage and you--
and you insult me

00:10:13.813 --> 00:10:15.680
when you go up on?
So, fuck you."

00:10:15.714 --> 00:10:16.982
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna crush you.

00:10:17.015 --> 00:10:18.851
- I love that.
- And so...

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:20.953
- 0-60 Dan loves that.
- So I had a--

00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:23.655
I had-- I came with my--
I came like...

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:25.023
- Yeah.
- "Hey, fuck you, guys.

00:10:25.056 --> 00:10:26.859
I'm just trying to be funny."
- Yeah.

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:29.629
- Marc-- And they all--
You know, Dave--

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:33.399
We all eventually...
it was all cool after a while.

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:36.669
- Yeah.
- Marc eventually apologized.

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:39.371
And I even fucked with Marc
at one time 'cause Marc

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:43.842
was all about, "You know,
I'm not doing TV, man.

00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:47.346
I'm too-- I'm too-- I'm too cool
for TV," and all that.

00:10:47.379 --> 00:10:50.816
And so he's like-- You know,
and before I would go on stage,

00:10:50.849 --> 00:10:53.552
he'd go, "Bro, are you gonna
go up and woo 'em

00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:55.754
with your animation?"

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:57.856
- Oh, dude,
let me tell you something.

00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:59.224
- I swear to God.
- Let me tell you something.

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:00.992
- And I'd be with my wife.
- What a shitty thing to say

00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:04.129
to somebody before they go on.
And you're not really friends?

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:06.665
- And I'm like,
"Dude, why are you being a dick?

00:11:06.698 --> 00:11:08.667
I'm just trying to do my time."
- Dude.

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:10.368
You're getting me riled up.
- And then I would--

00:11:10.402 --> 00:11:12.237
And then I would do a set
and then Attell would go up

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.306
after me, he's like,
"Let's hear it for Breuer

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:18.977
and his hand puppets."
You're like, "Fuck you, Dave.

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:21.179
You cunt."

00:11:21.213 --> 00:11:24.884 line:0%
Sorry I don't talk about
fucking dead hookers.

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:26.117 line:0%
- Yeah.

00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:28.621 line:0%
- Sorry I'm not as intelligent
as all you guys.

00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:29.955 line:0%
- Yeah.
- And so...

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:31.990
- That's so fucking funny.

00:11:32.023 --> 00:11:34.526
- So, yeah, I was--
I was--

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:36.361
I had a problem
when I first got here.

00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:39.098
And then, um,
Louis never gave me a problem,

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:41.066
but I just felt like
he just didn't--

00:11:41.099 --> 00:11:43.702
he just looked at me
and was like, "Ugh!"

00:11:43.735 --> 00:11:44.903
- You can feel that,
I guess, sometimes.

00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:47.339
I'm very-- I try.
I hope it reads.

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:49.975
But I make a concerted effort
because I was helped so much,

00:11:50.008 --> 00:11:53.412
ironically, by-- Dave Attell
helped me a bunch in my career.

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:54.847
Patrice, the list goes
on and on.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.348
- Yeah.
- Uh, Bobby Kelly,

00:11:56.381 --> 00:12:00.018
who have helped me in my career.
- I just saw him in Aruba.

00:12:00.051 --> 00:12:01.853
- Yeah! Bobby was just
down there with his family...

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:03.122
- Yeah!
- ...and doing shows.

00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:05.124
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- But people that have helped me

00:12:05.157 --> 00:12:06.992
like that, so when I'm
on the road,

00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:08.761
and, like, the features
and hosts,

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:10.462
I'm always, like, trying
to be very cool to

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:12.998
and, like, you know, hang out,
take 'em to lunch or something

00:12:13.031 --> 00:12:14.933
just because I know
how much that meant to me.

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:17.302
- I learned, Jay,
from those days,

00:12:17.335 --> 00:12:19.571
I would never treat
other comics like that.

00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:20.673
- Yeah.
- Whether I liked them

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:22.574
or not liked them,
I would never do that

00:12:22.608 --> 00:12:24.676
to another comedian ever.
- Sure.

00:12:24.709 --> 00:12:26.979
- And so, now,
I want to make it clear

00:12:27.012 --> 00:12:28.347
that those--
that was the beginning.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.848
- Sure.
- Yeah, that's you--

00:12:29.881 --> 00:12:31.750
that's you being a new comic
up from Florida.

00:12:31.783 --> 00:12:32.751
- New guy.
- You got a chip

00:12:32.784 --> 00:12:33.885
on your shoulder too.

00:12:33.918 --> 00:12:34.953
- And you're, like, from here,

00:12:34.986 --> 00:12:36.255
and you're back to New York,

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:37.956
so you're kind of like--
- I'll show you!

00:12:37.989 --> 00:12:40.626
I'm the good-looking,
gonna be on TV guy.

00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:43.028
- Yeah, and they're like artsy
and like--

00:12:43.061 --> 00:12:46.231
- Yeah! Fuck you
and your artsy bullshit.

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:48.199
- Fucking beatniks.
Beatnik assholes.

00:12:48.233 --> 00:12:50.802
- Yeah, they're like...
(scatting jazz rhythm)

00:12:50.835 --> 00:12:53.739
"Dating is weird.
Dating is weird."

00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:55.641
- Yeah, yeah.
- Well, because you had, uh,

00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:57.442
comedy I assume
that wouldn't work well

00:12:57.475 --> 00:13:00.045
in like the coffee shop,
and I've never had that either,

00:13:00.078 --> 00:13:01.446
where I could go
to the coffee shop.

00:13:01.479 --> 00:13:03.248
They're always like-- they're
so very pooh-poohing of it.

00:13:03.281 --> 00:13:07.953
- But I also realized, um,
I don't need to go there.

00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:09.054
- Right.
- I don't need that crowd.

00:13:09.087 --> 00:13:10.789
It's not my crowd.
- Sure.

00:13:10.822 --> 00:13:11.956
- Yeah, that's a pretty
important thing

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.425
for a comic to learn.
- Find your audience.

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:16.361
- If I play baseball, I--

00:13:16.394 --> 00:13:19.564
As a comedian, I compare myself
to a baseball player.

00:13:19.598 --> 00:13:21.199
I don't want a single
or a walk.

00:13:21.233 --> 00:13:22.901
I want the...
(mimics baseball bat cracking)

00:13:22.934 --> 00:13:25.370
"Oh, my!
The outfielder didn't even walk!

00:13:25.404 --> 00:13:28.140
It's in the upper deck!"
(mimics crowd cheering)

00:13:28.173 --> 00:13:30.409
And I-- And I'm going--
I flip the bat.

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:32.144
- Yeah, Barry Bonds
those motherfuckers!

00:13:32.177 --> 00:13:33.979
- I walk real slow...
- Take a trot.

00:13:34.012 --> 00:13:36.915
- ...around the bases
and I eye the pitcher, going,

00:13:36.948 --> 00:13:39.618
"Try to throw me
inside again, stupid."

00:13:39.651 --> 00:13:41.820
- Yeah.
- That's-- It--

00:13:41.853 --> 00:13:44.756
You learn, okay,
I only swing at fastballs,

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.858
and the fastballs
I knock in the upper deck.

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:49.327
I'm not gonna woo you
with my intelligence.

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:50.863
- But, you know, I mean--
- I'm not gonna--

00:13:50.896 --> 00:13:52.965
I'm not gonna try
to talk over your head.

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.299
That's not me.
I'm not that smart.

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:56.234
I'm not good.
- And everybody should hope--

00:13:56.267 --> 00:13:58.537
Everybody should hope
that everyone's not

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.106
the same kind of thing,
'cause the odds that you're

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:03.241
the best at that thing are slim.

00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:04.943
- Yeah.
- But also being honest

00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:06.745
with yourself and, like,
what you wanna do.

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:07.912
'Cause there's a lot of people
that'll be like,

00:14:07.946 --> 00:14:10.382
I see something else is popular.
Let me do that.

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:12.317
But if you just--
If you do yourself,

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.386
you know, you can be like--
'Cause that Barry Bonds thing

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.988
is-- I think we all have that.
You wanna fucking flip the bat

00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:18.323
at the pitcher and be like...
- Hell yeah!

00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:19.491
- ...fucking nice job.
- But don't you even get--

00:14:19.524 --> 00:14:20.992
as you get older, like,
you get the novelty

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:23.462
of, like-- I get still
the silliness as a comic,

00:14:23.495 --> 00:14:27.032
especially who tries to write
something that hits people,

00:14:27.065 --> 00:14:28.634
that you see
Jeff Dunham's success,

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:29.968
and people will
always be kind of--

00:14:30.002 --> 00:14:31.136
As a young comic,
you definitely wanna go like,

00:14:31.169 --> 00:14:32.737
"Ugh," 'cause he's doing it
with that thing.

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:34.039
But at the end of the day,

00:14:34.072 --> 00:14:35.540
well, someone's gotta
do that thing.

00:14:35.573 --> 00:14:37.810
Like, I don't do that thing
and he does it probably great.

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:39.978
Like, why do I care?
It's like it's out--

00:14:40.012 --> 00:14:41.747
You should almost be happy
it's out of your lane.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.048
It's not even what
you're going for.

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:45.217
- Jay, you hit it.
You reach a maturity in life.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.820
Like, there was a time where
I hit in life where I went,

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:50.522
"Oh, my God.
Marc found--

00:14:50.555 --> 00:14:52.290
Marc found himself."
- Yeah.

00:14:52.323 --> 00:14:55.527
- He's the "I was a dick
and I'm sorry" guy.

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:57.863
- Yeah!
(laughter)

00:14:57.896 --> 00:15:00.399
- I love you.
Now I-- Now I love you.

00:15:00.432 --> 00:15:02.434
- What a cool character!
He's like...

00:15:02.467 --> 00:15:06.071
- And I'll never forget,
Attell one time--

00:15:06.104 --> 00:15:08.374
which Dave would never
remember this.

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:09.808
I think it was--
it was right before

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:12.077
I got to "Saturday Night Live,"
and he kind of pulled me aside--

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.946
- Nah, he wouldn't
remember it then.

00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:17.249
- No, but he goes,
"You should be on TV."

00:15:17.282 --> 00:15:18.751
And I went,
"What? Why do you say?"

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:20.419
- He's like,
"You're a TV guy, man.

00:15:20.452 --> 00:15:22.154
I'm surprised TV hasn't..."
and I went, "Oh, my God.

00:15:22.187 --> 00:15:24.122
"He gave me compliment.
Like, oh, my God.

00:15:24.156 --> 00:15:25.724
The king of--"
and so I was like,

00:15:25.757 --> 00:15:27.759
"Oh, my God.
Dave accepted me."

00:15:27.792 --> 00:15:30.729
And then Louis--
Louis, no,

00:15:30.762 --> 00:15:34.833
but it was-- you start seeing
everyone else mature,

00:15:34.866 --> 00:15:36.768
and then you're like,
you know what,

00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:38.771
there comes a time, too,
where you're not

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:40.105
competing against everyone.
- Yeah.

00:15:40.138 --> 00:15:41.640
- You just compete
against yourself.

00:15:41.673 --> 00:15:43.908
- (Dan and Jay) Yes.
- You set yourself goals.

00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:46.211
And I'm happy for everyone
who does whatever.

00:15:46.244 --> 00:15:47.579
- Takes you a long time
to get there.

00:15:47.612 --> 00:15:49.414
Longer than you think.
- It takes a while to get there.

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:52.484
- Unless you find
very young success--

00:15:52.517 --> 00:15:54.453
doesn't happen for everybody,
at least like the success

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:57.055
where you're like, "I'm good."
- No.

00:15:57.088 --> 00:15:59.190
- Um, if you find
that young, maybe.

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:00.792
But really I said it
when I realized--

00:16:00.825 --> 00:16:01.927
That's one of
the interesting things

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.529
when I got my hour special,
Comedy Central,

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:06.431
the next day one of the first
things to hit me

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:10.368
was to call Kevin Hart because
I've always had this story like,

00:16:10.401 --> 00:16:13.072
yeah, you know, okay,
we lost touch

00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:15.006
'cause he went to Hollywood,
he became a huge star,

00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:16.474
and what are you gonna do?
But I go,

00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:18.309
I never really worked hard to
stay in touch with him either.

00:16:18.343 --> 00:16:19.811
And I thought of that
and I was like, yeah,

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:21.914
I probably didn't wanna hear
about how fucking awesome

00:16:21.947 --> 00:16:23.581
shit was going
for him constantly.

00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:25.250
So, you know what I mean?
You realize that,

00:16:25.283 --> 00:16:26.918
but it takes maturity
to get there.

00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:29.087
- Yeah, and even in maturity,
you can learn how to go, like--

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.622
You can actually learn
to be the opposite,

00:16:30.655 --> 00:16:32.057
and have someone in your life,
you're like,

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.158
"Oh, I'm pulling this along.
I'm--"

00:16:34.192 --> 00:16:35.794
- Sure, sure.
- I should just let go of this,

00:16:35.827 --> 00:16:38.263
'cause clearly I'm the only one
that wants this thing.

00:16:38.296 --> 00:16:40.332
But, like, you can do that
with like harboring resentment--

00:16:40.365 --> 00:16:42.067
- Dan, I know what
you're getting at,

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.835
and the lead singer of Korn--
the lead singer of Korn

00:16:43.869 --> 00:16:45.337
has been texting me
back lately, so--

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.306
- Jonathan Davis
doesn't care about you.

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:48.607
- He writes back though.
- No, he doesn't.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.874
- Yeah, everybody says it
about Gary Clark

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:51.176
and then he wrote back too,
but okay.

00:16:51.209 --> 00:16:53.044
I'm just letting you know,
don't give me your number

00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:54.913
if you don't want me
to text you ever.

00:16:54.946 --> 00:16:56.815
- Jonathan Davis, yeah.

00:16:56.848 --> 00:16:58.216
You just bring it up? Yeah.

00:16:58.249 --> 00:17:00.084
- I'm not gonna make it weird,
but I mean, once in a while,

00:17:00.118 --> 00:17:01.753
I'm gonna fucking say hey.
- It would be nice

00:17:01.786 --> 00:17:04.189
to get a text back.
(laughter)

00:17:04.222 --> 00:17:06.525
It would be nice
to get a text back.

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:10.095
- It's a lot of blue in them
Jonathan Davis texts.

00:17:10.128 --> 00:17:11.429
- "Hey."
- There's a lot.

00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:14.399
There's a lot of swipe-ups
of blue and then like a,

00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:16.434
"Cool, man."
Hey! He wrote back!

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:19.504
- But I mean, even when--
It's kind of cool

00:17:19.537 --> 00:17:21.239
to hear you say that,
'cause, you know,

00:17:21.272 --> 00:17:22.808
as a guy that looks up to you
and a guy that like--

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:25.677
I mean, dude, "The Pesci Show"
with you and Colin is--

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.378 line:0%
Can I tell you?
That's like one of the things

00:17:27.412 --> 00:17:29.748 line:0%
that I remember clearly where
I was when I was watching it,

00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:32.818 line:0%
like, as a fucking weird
13-year-old, just being like,

00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:35.487
"This is the funniest thing
I've ever seen in my life."

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:37.756
And it's great to hear you
say stuff about, like,

00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:39.491
you know, Louis being a dick
to you and you're like--

00:17:39.524 --> 00:17:41.527
'Cause I have this
incessant need to be liked.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.795
It's pretty obvious, I talk
about it a lot on the show.

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:45.463
- Yeah.
- And Louis C.K. is a god,

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:46.898
and then I got in at the Cellar
and he would--

00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:48.199
- (whispers)
Everybody hates you.

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:50.535
- Yeah, exactly.
But that's how you walk around.

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:53.137
And it was like Louis--
Louis didn't dislike me,

00:17:53.171 --> 00:17:54.840
but Louis didn't like me,
and for me,

00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:56.141
that was like a thing
where I'm like,

00:17:56.174 --> 00:17:58.376
"Do I suck? Am I--"
and the spiral out of control.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.378
And you hear someone else talk
about it, and it's kind of like,

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:01.780
"Oh, okay.
I'm just--"

00:18:01.813 --> 00:18:04.516
- And I gotta say, he never was
blatantly a dick to me.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.317
- Yeah.
- Just dismissive almost.

00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:07.986
- In my head...
- (Jay) Sure.

00:18:08.019 --> 00:18:09.420
- Yeah.
- In my head,

00:18:09.454 --> 00:18:12.124
he just didn't like me 'cause he
didn't give me the time of day

00:18:12.157 --> 00:18:13.558
and that really bothered me.

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:15.794
- That's the exact same thing.
And that, for me--

00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:17.228
- Chris Rock's
never spoken to me

00:18:17.261 --> 00:18:19.064
in the thousand times
he's walked past me.

00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:20.765
And you know what?
He's threatened by me.

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:22.533
(laughter)

00:18:22.567 --> 00:18:24.069
You know how I--
you know how I processed that?

00:18:24.102 --> 00:18:26.505
- Jay goes,
"He can feel my power

00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:27.972
"radiating off me.

00:18:28.006 --> 00:18:29.741
He understands
that I'm a titan."

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.977
- He can feel my
"Bigger and Blacker" is coming.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.879
- Yeah. Yeah, but it's--
I think it's like--

00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:36.548
It's so fucking relieving
to hear someone else say that

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:39.050
because you go through it
and then you're, like, home,

00:18:39.083 --> 00:18:41.253
having shower arguments
with Louis C.K.

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:42.654
where you're like,
"Yeah, dude?

00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:44.623
"Well, you fucking jerked-off
in front of a lady

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:46.325
and I'm a good dude!"
- (Jay) You know what it is?

00:18:46.358 --> 00:18:47.593
- And then you're just
getting out and you're like,

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:49.994
"Dude, he did nothing to me,
and I'm just fucking--"

00:18:50.028 --> 00:18:52.764
- But when you trivialize your
own comedy, it's the same thing.

00:18:52.797 --> 00:18:56.034
There's a thing you do
that makes your comedy unique.

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:57.635
You're able to do impressions,
you do voices,

00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:59.070
you incorporate that
into your comedy.

00:18:59.103 --> 00:19:00.672
- But just what he said.
When he was saying--

00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:02.441
- But you think comics
like Dave Attell are like,

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:03.975
"Cornball," and you can't
live in that.

00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:05.210
- (Dan) Exactly!
- You're not doing

00:19:05.243 --> 00:19:07.512
your comedy for Attell.
That's the big deal.

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:09.181
It's not for Attell,
your comedy.

00:19:09.214 --> 00:19:11.950
- I had that Maron moment
with Kevin Brennan,

00:19:11.983 --> 00:19:13.284
where I'm waiting
to go up and he--

00:19:13.318 --> 00:19:15.253
- Kevin?!
- Yeah. And he goes--

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:17.356
Yeah, and he goes--
- I got stories about Kevin.

00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:19.757
- Yeah, but I'm about to go
on stage and he goes,

00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:22.627
"You gonna make 'em laugh
with your wrestling noises?"

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:25.296
And it's just like, I don't
even know what that means!

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.098
I don't even know
what that means!

00:19:27.131 --> 00:19:28.366
And I like-- But then
when I learned that

00:19:28.399 --> 00:19:29.734
that's just Kevin
playing with you--

00:19:29.767 --> 00:19:32.905
- That's Kevin.
- And I'm just like-- right?

00:19:32.938 --> 00:19:34.072
When I learned that,
then I just go,

00:19:34.105 --> 00:19:36.107
"I'll bite your fucking nose
off, old man."

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.409
And then he's just like--
- Laughs.

00:19:37.442 --> 00:19:38.710
- Yeah, he laughs.
He texted me

00:19:38.743 --> 00:19:40.645
while I was on stage
and he was following me.

00:19:40.678 --> 00:19:42.280
Last week at the Cellar,
I'm on stage.

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:43.748
I get off stage.
It's a text from Kevin Brennan.

00:19:43.782 --> 00:19:46.584
It just says "hack."
And then I write--

00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:49.187
And then I text him back,
"bitter asshole."

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:50.354
And then he texts me back,
he goes,

00:19:50.388 --> 00:19:52.090
"Oh, I was just sending you that
to throw you off

00:19:52.123 --> 00:19:54.092
when you're on stage,"
and it's like--

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:57.328
- Yeah, he's-- That's--
Kevin's fucking nuts.

00:19:57.362 --> 00:19:59.197
- But when you realize that it--
- I love him.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.531
- Yeah, I love Kevin Brennan.
- But yeah.

00:20:00.565 --> 00:20:01.934
- When you realize
it's not you--

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:03.201
- Right.
- You--

00:20:03.234 --> 00:20:04.569
- --a gallon of bleach

00:20:04.602 --> 00:20:06.437
on the Anthony Cumia Show.
- He what?

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:08.140
- He gave Artie
a gallon of bleach

00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:10.342
on the Anthony Cumia Show.
He'll go for it.

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:11.542
He'll go for that punchline.

00:20:11.576 --> 00:20:13.278
- I've had those moments,
though.

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:15.546
- Yeah, you just,
but it's like, but I'm saying,

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.549
like, if Jim Breuer's
on our show being, like,

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:19.617
"Yeah, fuckin' Marc Maron
whispered that to me,"

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.419
I'm like, oh, dude,
I'm just, like, 0 to 60,

00:20:21.453 --> 00:20:23.088
Dan's just, like, barking
at the door. Like, arf!

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:24.689
- Oh, dude, people know,
Judah Friedlander,

00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:26.691
early when I first
got to New York,

00:20:26.724 --> 00:20:29.227
would go, uh,
at the Boston Comedy Club.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.262
I-- I'm always, like,
a wall-leaner--

00:20:31.295 --> 00:20:32.998
- Yeah.
- And I guess my elbow was up

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:34.633
or something,
and he goes, "God, man,"

00:20:34.666 --> 00:20:36.201
he goes, "when you do comedy,
everyone's just watch--

00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:37.502
"we're all in the back,
just laughing,

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:38.770
"'cause your hand,
when you talk,

00:20:38.803 --> 00:20:40.205
just keeps bouncing--"
it's the thing

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:42.107
to tell, like,
a three-year comic?

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.142
You're like, oh, God,

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:45.477
just-- just when I thought
I was pretty cool,

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.945
I was working
the Boston Comedy Club--

00:20:46.978 --> 00:20:49.381
- Oh, fuck, this sucks,
oh, God, this sucks so bad.

00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:51.983
- You know what's funny, I got
into the Boston Comedy Club,

00:20:52.016 --> 00:20:54.386
doing the Sunday night dare,

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:56.554
which was their black show
with talent and Will Sylvince.

00:20:56.587 --> 00:20:59.725
- Talent, wow.
- And, uh, and that's--

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:02.093
- Will! Wow.
- Will Sylvince, yeah.

00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:04.162
Not to go back,
but, like, when--

00:21:04.196 --> 00:21:06.164
'cause you said
you came back to Long Island,

00:21:06.197 --> 00:21:07.265
in your friend's basement,
and then--

00:21:07.298 --> 00:21:08.332
- Yeah.
- --six months later

00:21:08.366 --> 00:21:09.667
was on Uptown Comedy Club.

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:11.436
How did--
What was the lead-in to,

00:21:11.469 --> 00:21:13.471
like, you getting into
the black circuit of comedy?

00:21:13.505 --> 00:21:15.740
'Cause that show was, like,
- It was because of that.

00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:17.842
I-- I got into that,

00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:20.711
and that honestly changed
my life on many levels.

00:21:20.745 --> 00:21:22.747
- I mean, that was
just an audition you did?

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:24.416
- Yeah.
- You weren't doing, like,

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:26.150
black, you weren't pulled out of
black comedy rooms--

00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:27.586
- No, no.
- Oh, interesting.

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:31.022
- No, as a matter of fact,
that changed my life

00:21:31.055 --> 00:21:34.425
as far as...
on so many levels.

00:21:34.458 --> 00:21:38.930
I grew up in Valley Stream,
New York, where,

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.565
in Long Island,

00:21:40.598 --> 00:21:43.568
at the end of my street
was the borderline.

00:21:43.602 --> 00:21:45.670
Across the street
was all black.

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:48.239
We were all white.
- Yeah. Like Green Acres Mall.

00:21:48.272 --> 00:21:50.542
- So-- So if
a black guy walk--

00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:53.278
if we went into
the black neighborhood,

00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:55.914
we'd instantly hear,
"Go home, white boy."

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:57.549
- Right.
- And if they walked

00:21:57.582 --> 00:21:59.084
down the street by us,

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:01.919
the entire neighborhood
would stop,

00:22:01.953 --> 00:22:05.190
like a black bear was
walking down the street.

00:22:05.223 --> 00:22:08.226
It was like, "Holy shit,
this fuckin'--"

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.261
you know,
"Hide the fat white chicks!"

00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:13.598
And fuckin' "Hide your purses
and your bikes."

00:22:13.631 --> 00:22:15.933
- And the fat white chicks were
like, "No, don't hide me!"

00:22:15.967 --> 00:22:17.401
- (laughing)
- It was--

00:22:17.435 --> 00:22:20.238
- Who is this black bear?
- (laughing)

00:22:20.272 --> 00:22:22.440
- It was intense.
- I got some honey.

00:22:22.473 --> 00:22:24.409
- So, it was really intense.

00:22:24.443 --> 00:22:27.011
So, I grew up...

00:22:27.045 --> 00:22:29.080
uh, I'll say racist.

00:22:29.114 --> 00:22:30.481
All I knew was,
black people,

00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:33.084
I thought
rape, killing, murder.

00:22:33.118 --> 00:22:34.920
I'm gonna get robbed.
So now--

00:22:34.953 --> 00:22:37.489
- Did your family
perpetuate that? They--

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:39.390
- It was the news, it was the--
it was the culture.

00:22:39.423 --> 00:22:41.626
- Sure, okay.
- It was the culture.

00:22:41.659 --> 00:22:43.728
And, um,

00:22:43.762 --> 00:22:46.431
when I got Uptown Comedy Club,
now I'm in Harlem

00:22:46.464 --> 00:22:48.533
every single day.
- (laughter)

00:22:48.566 --> 00:22:53.938
- And all I remember was
how much it changed my life.

00:22:53.972 --> 00:22:56.341
And one of the greatest...

00:22:56.374 --> 00:22:59.243
I learned
so much about life.

00:22:59.277 --> 00:23:02.080
I saw a guy get shot.
- Really?

00:23:02.113 --> 00:23:04.516
- I-- oh,
I'll never forget--

00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:06.785
uh, a changing moment
for me was--

00:23:06.818 --> 00:23:09.387
there was a couple
big changing moments.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.290 line:0%
One was Tracy Morgan was
on that show.

00:23:12.324 --> 00:23:14.692 line:0%
And me and Tracy
became very close.

00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:16.427 line:0%
And I know
this sounds crazy,

00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:17.728
but there was a guy
named Yi-Yi,

00:23:17.762 --> 00:23:19.364
and I don't remember
Yi-Yi's real name.

00:23:19.397 --> 00:23:21.165
- Yeah.
- And Yi-Yi wrote--

00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:23.101
Yi-Yi wrote the top cops.

00:23:23.134 --> 00:23:25.870
And Yi-Yi looked at me like
one animal looking at another.

00:23:25.903 --> 00:23:28.806
He's like, "Yo, you put
stuff in your hair?"

00:23:28.839 --> 00:23:30.575
"I-- what do you mean?"
He's like, "You got,

00:23:30.608 --> 00:23:33.010
can I touch your hair?"
- (laughing)

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:34.646
- Touch my hair?

00:23:34.679 --> 00:23:36.181
And he's like,
"What-- What is that

00:23:36.214 --> 00:23:37.482
that makes your hair
stand up?"

00:23:37.515 --> 00:23:39.651
He was fascinated
by my hair.

00:23:39.684 --> 00:23:41.453
And then I was like,
"Can I touch your hair?"

00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:43.388
I'd never touched
a black person's hair.

00:23:43.421 --> 00:23:46.390
I'm being serious.
And-- And--

00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:49.027
I remember being on the street,
and I heard--

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.695
uh, and I heard, like,

00:23:50.728 --> 00:23:53.331
a... pop-pop-pop
pop-pop-pop.

00:23:53.364 --> 00:23:55.366
And it was on 125th and 5th.

00:23:55.399 --> 00:23:57.402
And Tracy came,
and he went,

00:23:57.435 --> 00:23:59.003
(as Tracy)
"Who got shot?"

00:23:59.036 --> 00:24:01.739
- (laughter)

00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:03.141
- And I went,
"You hear that?

00:24:03.175 --> 00:24:04.408
It was some--
it was fireworks."

00:24:04.442 --> 00:24:06.411
He went,
"No, somebody got shot."

00:24:06.444 --> 00:24:08.646
And I went,
"What do you--"

00:24:08.679 --> 00:24:11.716
And he went, "They hear it
across the street."

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.618
And I-- to this day,
I'll never forget.

00:24:13.652 --> 00:24:15.786
It was like a movie scene.
I looked across the street.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.157
And I saw a guy
on all fours,

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.558
struggling for his life,

00:24:20.591 --> 00:24:22.827
and I--
I went numb.

00:24:22.861 --> 00:24:24.963
And I didn't even pay attention
to the traffic,

00:24:24.996 --> 00:24:27.064
I just walked to him,

00:24:27.098 --> 00:24:30.869
and I'll never forget
the image of this guy's

00:24:30.902 --> 00:24:33.304
blood just streaming
out of his...

00:24:33.337 --> 00:24:35.707
- Ugh.
- ...nuts, his head,

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.477
dripping down on the sidewalk,
going into the curb,

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.313
and down into the sewer.

00:24:41.346 --> 00:24:43.882
And people-- there was
a big woman going,

00:24:43.915 --> 00:24:45.717
(as woman)
"Look at you now, muh-fucker!

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.220
You stupid muh-fucker!
See? I told you!"

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:51.189
And I'm like...
nobody gives a shit.

00:24:51.223 --> 00:24:52.724
Like, what is--
what is going on?

00:24:52.757 --> 00:24:54.993
This is so far from...

00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:56.661
- Yeah.
- ...anything I've ever seen.

00:24:56.694 --> 00:24:58.028
- You didn't feel there were
cops coming or anything?

00:24:58.062 --> 00:24:59.897
- No, and then--
and then the paramedics came,

00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:01.600
and they were, like--
I'm not exaggerating,

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:03.034
they were, like,
telling jokes, and--

00:25:03.067 --> 00:25:04.736
and while they're
telling jokes to each other

00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:06.704
and laughing, they're like,
"You gotta stay still!

00:25:06.737 --> 00:25:08.506
"Hey! If you don't stay still,
you're gonna be dead!

00:25:08.539 --> 00:25:09.808
I don't have to tell ya!"
- What year is this?

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:11.842
Like, 1990...
- This is '92, '93.

00:25:11.876 --> 00:25:13.677
- So this is fucking right
before Giuliani--

00:25:13.711 --> 00:25:15.413
this is New York, like--
- Well, this is also--

00:25:15.446 --> 00:25:18.350 line:0%
right before that,
there was a cop killed

00:25:18.383 --> 00:25:20.718 line:0%
by the Nation of Islam.

00:25:20.751 --> 00:25:22.320 line:0%
And I'll never forget that.

00:25:22.353 --> 00:25:24.556
I was in a bodega.

00:25:24.589 --> 00:25:26.758
And there was a big
Nation of Islam guy behind me.

00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:28.926
- Yeah.
- And he started--

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.095
he started in with me,
and I was scared to death.

00:25:31.128 --> 00:25:33.698
He was like,
"You white devil motherfucker!

00:25:33.731 --> 00:25:35.633
What you doin' here,
motherfucker?!"

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:38.036
And I went, oh, my God,
oh, my God, I'm dead.

00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:39.370
- Yeah.
- I'm dead.

00:25:39.403 --> 00:25:42.707
And he had leather j--
and then, um,

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.476
what's his name, Flex?

00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:46.610
- Yeah.
- Flex--

00:25:46.644 --> 00:25:47.746
- I love that, like--
- Flex!

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:48.779
- Flex was a juice, too.

00:25:48.813 --> 00:25:51.049
- Flex said,
"Yo, man,

00:25:51.082 --> 00:25:53.784
"why don't you get educated?
You don't know this kid.

00:25:53.818 --> 00:25:55.420
"You don't know
this white boy.

00:25:55.453 --> 00:25:56.788
"He's more-- He's more--

00:25:56.821 --> 00:25:58.522
He's got more soul
than you'll ever have."

00:25:58.556 --> 00:26:00.124
And those two start
going at it,

00:26:00.158 --> 00:26:02.293
and the--
and the Nation of Islam guy

00:26:02.326 --> 00:26:03.662
called him an Uncle Tom.

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:05.396
And I was like,
what's an Uncle Tom?

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.564
- Yeah.
- What-- like, what--

00:26:06.597 --> 00:26:08.065
what lingo's going on here?

00:26:08.098 --> 00:26:12.837
And I learned
so much about life, culture,

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:16.007
how demographics are held
in a position.

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.742
- He goes,
wait, this is the story

00:26:17.775 --> 00:26:19.844
of how you became
"un-racist"?

00:26:19.877 --> 00:26:21.546
- Seriously, well--
- He's telling the story

00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:23.514
of how you found out
Flex was an Uncle Tom.

00:26:23.547 --> 00:26:25.283
- (laughter)
- Well, yeah.

00:26:25.316 --> 00:26:26.784
And I--
I remember one day,

00:26:26.818 --> 00:26:29.453
I even remember one day,
that-- that neighborhood

00:26:29.486 --> 00:26:31.956
loved me so much...
- Yeah.

00:26:31.989 --> 00:26:34.425
- ...to the point
where now I was parking

00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:35.994
in the back streets,
and they were all,

00:26:36.027 --> 00:26:37.962
"Hey, what's up, white boy?
What's up?"

00:26:37.995 --> 00:26:39.664
- 'Cause they knew you
from the show.

00:26:39.698 --> 00:26:41.165
- They knew me from the show.
- That's awesome.

00:26:41.198 --> 00:26:43.635
- And they knew I--
I was non-judgmental--

00:26:43.668 --> 00:26:47.305
and I was like,
"I feel... so safe here."

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:49.807
And I remember

00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:52.911
going-- walking
the back streets,

00:26:52.944 --> 00:26:54.912
and-- and when I was really
comfortable there,

00:26:54.945 --> 00:26:57.581
and they loved me,
I'll never forget,

00:26:57.615 --> 00:27:00.652
there was cops
chasing a guy down the street,

00:27:00.685 --> 00:27:02.186
and this guy was running
towards me,

00:27:02.219 --> 00:27:05.623
and I went, oh, my God,
I could take this guy out hard.

00:27:05.657 --> 00:27:07.158
- (laughing)
- I could be a hero

00:27:07.191 --> 00:27:08.593
to these cops.
- Yeah.

00:27:08.626 --> 00:27:09.927
- And I also saw
the whole neighborhood

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.729
just watching,
and I went,

00:27:11.762 --> 00:27:13.898
if I take this guy out,

00:27:13.931 --> 00:27:15.467
they're all gonna
turn on me.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.801
- Yeah, you're
snitch of the city.

00:27:16.834 --> 00:27:18.636
- And I just went-- pfft!
I let him run.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:21.272
And he got caught,
like, 20 feet up the road.

00:27:21.305 --> 00:27:23.708
But me and--
me and Tracy had

00:27:23.741 --> 00:27:25.677
about a three-hour
conversation

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:31.282
about black, white,
welfare, drugs.

00:27:31.315 --> 00:27:33.852
Why ghettos exist.

00:27:33.885 --> 00:27:37.555
Why our mentalities--
and-- and I swear on my life

00:27:37.588 --> 00:27:39.390
and my children's lives,
to this day,

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:43.061
I wish the entire world heard
that conversation,

00:27:43.094 --> 00:27:45.096
'cause it would've
changed so many lives.

00:27:45.129 --> 00:27:47.698
And-- And one of the things
that really--

00:27:47.732 --> 00:27:49.901
I'll never forget going back
to my neighborhood,

00:27:49.934 --> 00:27:53.471
and-- you know, 'cause
you wanna fluff your feathers,

00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:54.839
and I'm on TV,

00:27:54.872 --> 00:27:56.574
and I went to this bar

00:27:56.607 --> 00:27:58.276
that I used to go to
all the time.

00:27:58.309 --> 00:28:01.912
And one of the kids
from high school that was a star

00:28:01.946 --> 00:28:03.981
came up to me--
this part's heavy,

00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:05.883
I don't know if I should say it.
- No, let it rip.

00:28:05.916 --> 00:28:07.785
- And he--
and this is--

00:28:07.818 --> 00:28:09.620
this is when I realized
how much I changed,

00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:13.524
but how much...
we're brainwashed

00:28:13.558 --> 00:28:16.761
and how much...
it's-- it's--

00:28:16.794 --> 00:28:18.796
you're just brainwashed.

00:28:18.829 --> 00:28:20.631
Racism is
brainwashing.

00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:22.266
And he goes--
on both sides--

00:28:22.299 --> 00:28:24.669
it's not just white people,
that's another fucking farce.

00:28:24.702 --> 00:28:26.404
- We do excel at it, though.

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:29.040
- No, we do good, but trust me,
it's not just us.

00:28:29.073 --> 00:28:30.808
- We're on-- We're on--
- I mean, I'm--

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:32.243
if you're born
varsity, though.

00:28:32.277 --> 00:28:34.845
- Yeah, no, yeah, yeah.
- We're basically creating

00:28:34.879 --> 00:28:36.414
the west coast offense
of racism.

00:28:36.447 --> 00:28:38.349
- We just--
We just handle it

00:28:38.382 --> 00:28:40.017
more in a subliminal manner.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.919
- Right? You know what I mean.
We're not so vocal about it.

00:28:41.952 --> 00:28:45.023
- Racist-- Racist defense
gains championships.

00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:46.490
- We're just smarter
about it, you know,

00:28:46.524 --> 00:28:49.294
'cause we're white.
- (laughter)

00:28:49.327 --> 00:28:52.230
- The Europeans
have mastered this since--

00:28:52.263 --> 00:28:53.598
- Very white.
- --AD.

00:28:53.631 --> 00:28:55.166
- Very white.
Very very white over there.

00:28:55.199 --> 00:28:58.369
- Right, AD, they've been
fucking masterminding this shit.

00:28:58.402 --> 00:29:00.671
And I swear on my life,

00:29:00.704 --> 00:29:03.908
this is a moment
that changed my entire life.

00:29:03.941 --> 00:29:05.243
Guy comes up to me,
he's like,

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:08.045
"Yeah, fuck yeah,
I see you on TV."

00:29:08.078 --> 00:29:11.483
He goes, "What's it like
working with them?"

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:13.517
But he said the word,
and I went--

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.987
I just looked at him, went...

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.123
"Yo, it's-- it's--
it's not what you think.

00:29:19.156 --> 00:29:21.626
It-- no, I'm actually
friends with--"

00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:23.461
He went, he went,

00:29:23.494 --> 00:29:26.664
"You're friends...
with that?"

00:29:26.697 --> 00:29:28.833
And I went, "Yo...

00:29:28.866 --> 00:29:31.001
- Yeah.
- And then, I swear to God,

00:29:31.035 --> 00:29:33.538
I'll never forget,
he went, he looked at me,

00:29:33.571 --> 00:29:36.040
he got mad at me,
and he went,

00:29:36.073 --> 00:29:39.611
"Oh, I get it, 'cause
you get a salary from them."

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:43.648
And he just couldn't
comprehend...

00:29:43.681 --> 00:29:46.183
his hatred was so powerful.

00:29:46.217 --> 00:29:47.819
- I hope you didn't try
to explain it to him,

00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:49.254
because honest to God--
- I did, but it--

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:51.489
it, I knew right there--
- Deaf ears.

00:29:51.522 --> 00:29:52.823
- It's deaf ears.
- Yeah.

00:29:52.856 --> 00:29:55.459
- And that made me go,
holy shit, like,

00:29:55.493 --> 00:29:57.295
this is...

00:29:57.328 --> 00:29:59.330
how do you even begin
to change something like this?

00:29:59.363 --> 00:30:01.231
- I think there is a time
where it's too late for people.

00:30:01.265 --> 00:30:03.033
I've had to just,
in a smaller scale,

00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:05.103
with just comedy people,
I said,

00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:09.073
trying to explain to somebody
who waits in line of fans

00:30:09.107 --> 00:30:10.641
to tell me
they thought I sucked,

00:30:10.674 --> 00:30:12.010
and I should change
what I do,

00:30:12.043 --> 00:30:13.644
versus going, like,
don't you feel like

00:30:13.677 --> 00:30:14.979
maybe you just didn't like it?

00:30:15.012 --> 00:30:16.347
And maybe
I'm not your thing?

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.082
Like, people don't see
that kind of thing--

00:30:18.116 --> 00:30:19.083
you know, so--
- But it's also--

00:30:19.116 --> 00:30:20.418
- For that guy to walk up with--

00:30:20.451 --> 00:30:22.086
I'm sorry, Dan,
but for that guy to walk up

00:30:22.119 --> 00:30:23.621
with the confidence,
he goes,

00:30:23.654 --> 00:30:24.922
"I'm gonna drop
a couple of n-bombs,"

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:26.457
he goes, this guy's
gonna be into it.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.426
Like, like, the thing
he knows where you're from.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.529
And just going-- he goes,
this guy's definitely

00:30:31.563 --> 00:30:33.130
gonna jump
on my n-bomb path here.

00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:34.933
- This is--
This is gonna work.

00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:36.467
Also, I-- it's like one of
those things, sorry, but it's

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.135
like one of those things
we were just talking about,

00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:40.138
where it's someone else's shit
spilling on you.

00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:42.073
Like, this guy is popular
in high school.

00:30:42.106 --> 00:30:43.641
He's watching
his life slip away,

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:45.242
realizing that high school
might've been the pinnacle--

00:30:45.275 --> 00:30:47.311
- Right, right.
- And you're on fuckin' TV.

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:49.013
Showing up, the one thing
he's got on you--

00:30:49.046 --> 00:30:50.848
he's like, fuck it,
let me just be racist as shit

00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:53.217
to try to make him
feel bad that he's--

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.787
- But that's--
But I can honestly say...

00:30:56.821 --> 00:30:58.589
five years
before that,

00:30:58.623 --> 00:31:00.625
that would've been me.
- Yeah.

00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:03.727
- So, and I'm not gonna--
and I hate when people like--

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.797
"He said the n-word in 1977!"

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.465
Oh, please.
- Yeah.

00:31:07.498 --> 00:31:09.166
- So...
- (laughing)

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.170
- People grow, people learn
about life, people grow--

00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:14.104
- For the record,
I said it 2:07pm today.

00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:16.207
- --they mature, if I was
judged for things I did

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.944
in 1983, 1984, '85,
I might be in jail.

00:31:19.977 --> 00:31:21.278
- Yeah.
- So...

00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:25.249
- ...he's loose.
- But that-- that-- that...

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:26.717
I don't know
why I brought all that up,

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.019
but, like,
comedy's one thing.

00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:29.419
- Well, I'll say
it's an interesting life--

00:31:29.453 --> 00:31:31.389
- It changed my life--
the Uptown Comedy Club

00:31:31.422 --> 00:31:33.123
was the greatest thing that
ever happened to me in my life.

00:31:33.157 --> 00:31:34.459
- That's awesome.
- I grew up in a neighborhood

00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:36.661
that was relatively mixed
and became...

00:31:36.694 --> 00:31:38.262
blacker as I got older.

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:39.897
And then I moved
to South Jersey,

00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:43.467
which was really white--
very few black people.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.036
and then, when I started going
back to Philly to do comedy,

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.705
it was the black comedy club,
and that's sort of

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:50.207
where... uh...

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.409
I landed and started for
the first two or three years,

00:31:52.443 --> 00:31:55.679
it was mostly what I did was
the black comedy circuit.

00:31:55.713 --> 00:31:58.081
And I mean,
less than a year in,

00:31:58.115 --> 00:31:59.983
I don't remember going,
like, in the beginning,

00:32:00.017 --> 00:32:01.352
there was places
that were scary,

00:32:01.385 --> 00:32:02.954
and there was places
where things happened

00:32:02.987 --> 00:32:04.422
that were bad and scary.

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:07.224
But I didn't go to gigs
with that thing always like,

00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:09.193
oh, man,
we're going into, like,

00:32:09.226 --> 00:32:11.629
...rougher,
Manhattan proper, like,

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:13.497
in-- in Brooklyn,
they'd be like,

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.900
"That's the room, like, boy,
if it goes bad for a second--"

00:32:15.933 --> 00:32:17.168
but I kinda
always knew, also,

00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:18.703
I had to pander enough
to be like,

00:32:18.736 --> 00:32:20.871
I know how to be the white guy
at these black shows.

00:32:20.904 --> 00:32:22.073
You know what I mean?
I know how to--

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:24.074
- Let me do my white guy...

00:32:24.108 --> 00:32:25.609
only in a room
of black people--

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:26.910
- You wanna hear
something funny?

00:32:26.944 --> 00:32:28.179
This is the...

00:32:28.212 --> 00:32:31.082
so, years later, okay,

00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:33.250
years later,
my wife's...

00:32:33.284 --> 00:32:36.421
gets born again,
it's another whole story, okay?

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:37.822
You get into that story.

00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:39.691
And she has--
she's getting involved

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:41.925
at the local church
and whatever.

00:32:41.959 --> 00:32:47.164
So I said, hey,
I get sweets at Shea Stadium.

00:32:47.197 --> 00:32:49.467
and she goes, "Do you ever think
you would take them?"

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.836
They're all Cubs fans,
'cause they're from Wisconsin.

00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:53.304
The pastor and-- I said,

00:32:53.337 --> 00:32:54.938
why don't I take him
to a Mets game?

00:32:54.972 --> 00:32:58.076
So, we're going
to the Mets game from Jersey,

00:32:58.109 --> 00:33:02.146
and we're in
the worst traffic ever.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.348
So I get off the Harlem River
drive, and I went,

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:06.350
"All right,
go through Harlem."

00:33:06.383 --> 00:33:08.685
'Cause I know Harlem.
So, as I'm going through Harlem,

00:33:08.719 --> 00:33:11.388
I-- I-- on my kids' lives,

00:33:11.421 --> 00:33:14.792
I'm going through, and I see
these people, like, petrified,

00:33:14.825 --> 00:33:16.794
- Yeah.
- They are like, "Oh, my God,

00:33:16.827 --> 00:33:18.195
"oh, my God,
if we break down,

00:33:18.228 --> 00:33:19.897
this is the worst place
we could be."

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.133
- From Wisconsin, so they're
completely out of their element.

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:24.268
- Way out of their element,
and I swear on my life,

00:33:24.301 --> 00:33:26.437
you can't even-- if you wrote
this in a movie scene,

00:33:26.471 --> 00:33:29.674
they'd go,
"It's too over-the-top."

00:33:29.707 --> 00:33:31.341
We're at a red light,

00:33:31.375 --> 00:33:33.244
and I looked
at this guy, Shaun,

00:33:33.277 --> 00:33:35.579
who was sitting next to me,
I went, Shaun,

00:33:35.612 --> 00:33:37.815
I know you look worried,
but I gotta be honest with you.

00:33:37.848 --> 00:33:40.317
If it--
If it all went down,

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.086
this is the place
I would go,

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.822
because this is the place
I would feel the safest.

00:33:44.856 --> 00:33:48.492
I said, this community would
welcome me with open arms.

00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:50.427
And he looked at me,
and went "Really?"

00:33:50.461 --> 00:33:53.231
And just as that happened,
I hear POW!

00:33:53.264 --> 00:33:56.500
And I looked, and there's
a guy with his wife and kids.

00:33:56.534 --> 00:34:00.371
He's like, "Yo, let me get
a picture, Jim Breuer!"

00:34:00.404 --> 00:34:02.006
- (laughter)

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:05.409
- "I love you, man,
you real! You real!"

00:34:05.442 --> 00:34:08.379
And I went, oh, shit!
- That's so great.

00:34:08.412 --> 00:34:09.914
- Oh, shit!

00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:12.316
And it happened
at every red light,

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:14.085
and-- and it wasn't like,

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:15.419
"You're the guy
from 'Half-Baked.'"

00:34:15.452 --> 00:34:16.954
They were like,
you're the guy from Uptown--

00:34:16.987 --> 00:34:18.422
- Uptown Comedy Club.
- That's fuckin'--

00:34:18.455 --> 00:34:19.891
- You're the real guy.
- --awesome, dude,

00:34:19.924 --> 00:34:22.225
that's fuckin' great.

00:34:22.259 --> 00:34:24.361
- That's your audience, dude.
85-year-old men.

00:34:24.395 --> 00:34:26.296
- White--
White, confused old men.

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:28.132
- Camel-skin jacket--
- Hey, do I know you?

00:34:28.165 --> 00:34:29.567
- --this is
my audience right here.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.968
Guy talking to himself.

00:34:31.001 --> 00:34:32.970

00:34:33.003 --> 00:34:34.805

big fan of mine.

00:34:36.306 --> 00:34:38.509

00:34:44.482 --> 00:34:47.384
- I tell you the frogs are--
eating the damn lizards.

00:34:47.417 --> 00:34:49.487
And by the way, man, "Z-Rock"
was, like, my favorite show.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.455

Dunkin' Donuts.

can I definitely not?

Maybe not in these shoes.
- Look how high up it is!

00:38:22.532 --> 00:38:24.201

- Also the way it's weighted.

00:38:24.234 --> 00:38:25.536

- Huh?

00:38:25.569 --> 00:38:27.071

on the stepstool.

00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:29.440

my friends all of my secrets?

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:32.376

Jay, you know you have
that third nipple

00:38:37.014 --> 00:38:38.715
you're afraid they're gonna see
if you go to the hospital.

00:38:38.749 --> 00:38:40.984
Shut up!
- Jay, you get queasy

00:38:41.018 --> 00:38:43.220
when you get off-balance.

00:38:43.253 --> 00:38:44.388
- (laughter)

00:38:44.421 --> 00:38:45.856
- Jay, you get nervous
when you see

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:48.692
three people at the same time
walking together.

00:38:48.725 --> 00:38:51.227
- (laughing)
- Shut up, Christine!

00:38:51.261 --> 00:38:53.130
- Jay, you cry
at cold showers!

00:38:53.163 --> 00:38:54.632
So nobody wants me to do it?

00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:57.534
Tell you what, film crew could
be more encouraging.

00:38:57.567 --> 00:38:59.070
She can't wait to get on
WorldStarHipHop.

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:03.340
- Yeah, they're looking,
they're looking for content.

00:39:03.373 --> 00:39:04.808
- "Big Jay Goes Down."
- They just want you

00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:06.176
busting your ass.

00:39:06.209 --> 00:39:07.578
They don't wanna see--
- Either way--

00:39:07.611 --> 00:39:08.946
- They don't wanna say
Jay Oakerson thrive.

00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:10.981
- Can I not do it?
- This is a not-thrive

00:39:11.015 --> 00:39:13.283
situation.
- I can't do this?

00:39:13.316 --> 00:39:15.185
- Um--
- I would not suggest trying it

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:16.553
on concrete
for the first time.

00:39:16.587 --> 00:39:18.455
- Can I do it?
I gotta do it.

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:19.823
Can I-- Can I say this?
- Yeah.

00:39:19.856 --> 00:39:22.325
- I'll do it on Sweatpants Day.
- Okay.

00:39:22.359 --> 00:39:24.261
All right.

00:39:24.295 --> 00:39:26.563
All right, sure.

00:39:26.596 --> 00:39:28.765
- I agree, this might
not be the look.

00:39:28.799 --> 00:39:30.801
- No, it's not
the floor for it.

00:39:30.834 --> 00:39:32.335
- Huh?
- It's not the floor for it.

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:33.437
You need, like,
a wrestling mat

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:34.638
before you try it--
- What?

00:39:34.671 --> 00:39:36.506
- Janet Jackson used
a wrestling mat?

00:39:36.539 --> 00:39:37.874
- What?
What is that?

00:39:37.907 --> 00:39:39.609
That's something you say
coming out of a nap.

00:39:39.643 --> 00:39:41.412
- Janet Jackson...
(laughing)

00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:42.846
...she used
her own wrestling mat.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.381
Janet Jackson used
a wrestling mat.

00:39:44.414 --> 00:39:45.682
- "Jay, we gotta go."

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:47.117
Janet Jackson had
a-- a wrestling mat.

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:48.452
- Hang on, yes, sir,
it's me.

00:39:48.485 --> 00:39:50.287
Jay Oakerson in the flesh,
your favorite.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.923
"I knew it was you."
(grunting)

00:39:52.956 --> 00:39:54.958
Let's go up.

00:39:54.991 --> 00:39:57.795
Get this on camera.
Big Jay Oakerson cares.

00:39:57.828 --> 00:40:01.031
- (laughing)

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:02.867
(kindling crackling)

00:40:04.901 --> 00:40:06.937
- Hey, this is Dan Soder
and Big Jay Oakerson

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:09.206

00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:13.010
Come back next Thursday
for a new episode

00:40:13.043 --> 00:40:14.411
of "The Bonfire."

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:15.779
I say "The Bonfire" a lot.

00:40:15.812 --> 00:40:17.181

- I did, dude.

00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:18.616
'Cause I love you.
