MALE SPEAKER: I'm really,
really happy and excited to let

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.700
everybody know that we have
Dennis Wingo here speaking

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.200
today.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.200
Dennis is the CEO of
Skycorp Incorporated,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.400
and he spent the last
year, over a year,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.290
on this ISEE-3
Reboot Project, which

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.990
I'm sure you guys
are on the website

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.900
and seeing the news up until--
I think they had a post about it

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.520
this morning.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.830
So with that, I will hand
things over to Dennis.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.830
DENNIS WINGO: Thank you.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.360
And thanks for having me today.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.165
And since I'm here at Google,
I must put on my uniform.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.430
I am a Google Glass explorer.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.450
So, OK, Glass, take picture.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.330
So I really appreciate
being here today,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.780
and everybody that's
watching over the internet,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.280
and including some of our
direct collaborators at Google.

00:00:48.207 --> 00:00:49.790
As a matter of fact,
it's interesting.

00:00:50.777 --> 00:00:52.360
When you said a year,
I'm going, yeah.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.960
But I'm going, no.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.970
We started this
project literally--

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.370
I read a blog post in February
that this spacecraft was

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.390
going to come by the Earth.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.030
They weren't going
to be able to save it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.190
because it was impossible to
save because NASA had gotten

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.170
rid of all of the
equipment in the 1990s.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.710
And they didn't have a way
to do anything anymore.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.690
And so we're just want to
go by silently in the night.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.350
And I'm going, wait a minute?

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.640
You know, I've got
this character flaw

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.940
that, when somebody says
something's impossible,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.290
I've got to at least look
at it and see what's up.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.780
And just to give you a little
bit of background about me,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.830
it's not the first
time that we've

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.420
adopted an impossible project.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.670
In about 1990, they said it
was impossible for a hard drive

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.680
to be able to work
on the Space Shuttle.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.720
And I'm going, why?

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.270
Because I used to work for
a hard drive manufacturer.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.420
And we ended up flying
the first MacIntosh that

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.900
ever flew on the
Space Shuttle in space

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.060
with a big old 5.25,
1-gigabyte hard drives,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.870
and we made that work.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.460
And a couple of years later,
my university said, you know,

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.789
it's impossible--
students have never, ever,

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.110
ever raised the money
to build a satellite.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.850
We're lucky to raise $20,000
for lights on the soccer field

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.650
here.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.985
And we ended up
raising $6.6 million

00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:22.100
in cash and in
kind contributions

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.140
and built the first
student satellite

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.200
that NASA ever supported.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.550
So I've got kind of a history
of doing stuff like that,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.040
and I have a very long
history in engineering.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.585
And I started to work
in computers back when

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:39.080
we called them
microcomputers, even

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.430
before that infamous
day in August of 1981

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.550
when IBM foisted
the IBM PC on us.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.420
And so this February,
I read that blog,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.890
and I'm going, well, why?

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.990
Because I kind of knew
about the spacecraft.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.470
And it was February of
this year, not last year.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.820
I'm going, why?

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.770
The ISEE-3, I've always
kind of known about it

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.680
because in the 1990s, when I
was at the University of Alabama

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.480
Huntsville, I worked at a
research institution called

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.390
the Center for Space Plasma
and Aeronomic Research,

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.800
called CSPAR.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.690
And at CSPAR, we
studied what's called

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.360
the solar terrestrial interface.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.660
It's where the
energy from the Sun

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.370
begins its interface
with the Earth,

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.860
and this call solar
terrestrial physics.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.100
And so I knew about--
and I've actually

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.980
known about for a
very, very long time--

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.230
this spacecraft called ISEE-3.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.810
I'm also a ham radio operator.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.020
I got my first ham license
when I was 14 years old.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.950
And if you're a
ham radio operator,

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.769
you studied Sun,
because you want

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.310
to know when the
conditions are right

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.260
for long-distance communication.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.240
This is the internet
of the 1970s.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.620
And so we studied
that, and I used

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.420
listen to solar
terrestrial reports.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.560
So I was familiar with ISEE-3,
and I've been familiar with it

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.590
for a very long time.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.600
So I'm going, you know,
it'd be a real shame--

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.930
so what can we do?

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.940
And you start
thinking about this.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.710
And this is kind of
one of the reasons

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.630
I like talking to
Google, because it's

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.670
about technology advancement.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.250
10 years ago, what
we've just pulled off

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.089
couldn't happen-- because
the software wasn't there,

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:25.140
the hardware wasn't there, and
kind of the systems engineering

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.510
wasn't there to do something
like this on a rapid basis.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.730
So I started thinking about
in and I did some research

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.183
on software-defined radios,
and I did some research

00:04:34.183 --> 00:04:35.070
here and there.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.620
And I'm going, you know, I
think it's possible to do this.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.240
And we're very fortunate in
that I have an existing project

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.050
that NASA also said
was impossible,

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.960
which was taking tapes from the
1960s that hadn't been touched

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.655
in 45 years and old
tape drives that

00:04:51.655 --> 00:04:54.070
were sitting in a
barn in Los Angeles.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.630
And we put all
that back together,

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.960
and we've been digitized
the original 1960s

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.150
images of the Moon.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.210
It's a project called McMoons.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.420
And we're at a place
called McMoons.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.100
It's just a stone
throw from here,

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.510
over at NASA Ames
in the research

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.440
park in the McDonald's,
just literally right

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.714
behind the place you
guys just took over.

00:05:12.714 --> 00:05:14.005
And so we're kind of neighbors.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.120
And so we've been into McMoons.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.850
We're doing this.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.480
And I'm just going,
you know, it'd

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.950
be a real shame
for the spacecraft

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.970
not to get used again, because
it's a great spacecraft.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:26.970
And I'll tell you why.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.070
This is ISEE-3.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.830
The spacecraft has these booms.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.790
And it doesn't have an
imaging system on it.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.430
This is not a satellite
like you're thinking.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.730
But it has very, very
wide band sensors.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.250
And it starts out at RF, like
very low band, short-wave era,

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.420
short-wave frequency RF.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.250
There's these booms right here.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.140
These booms right
here-- each one of those

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.990
are 41 meters long.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.150
So this spacecraft
has a tip-to-tip width

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.870
of 92 meters in space.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.160
We called it-- if it kind
of got off-course and went

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.800
through the geo belt--
our space blender.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:13.100
So we're looking at that,
and it's got magnetometers

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.210
for measuring the
Sun's magnetic field,

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.650
in it has cosmic ray detectors.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.840
It actually had the very first
gamma ray burst instrument,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.140
and it was the first
instrument to detect

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.900
that we had these weird
gamma ray bursts that

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.320
were coming from all
over the universe.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.200
And later there was
a spacecraft built

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.780
because of this one called
the Gamma Ray Observatory,

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.920
and they measured these
bursts all over the universe.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.860
This spacecraft here
literally wrote the book

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.580
and invented the
term "heliophysics,"

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.670
which is the physics of
the Sun in the modern sense

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.660
of the word.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.600
And it's a spinning spacecraft.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.050
It spins at 19.75 RPM.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.170
So that means the
tips of these booms

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.840
are whipping around
once every 3.04 seconds.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.530
And it's been doing
that since 1978.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.390
And so it's a really
cool spacecraft.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.340
It's a dumb spacecraft.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.870
There's no computer
on this spacecraft.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.470
There's no software
on the spacecraft.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.030
This is a state machine,
is basically what it is.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.320
It's got a ROM, so they have
a few little stored things.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.850
But it doesn't-- there's no ALU.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.590
There's no processing.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.600
There's no code.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.550
It's all done in what anybody
who's been around that long--

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.160
it's 1970s-era CMOS chips.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.720
And so it's a very
dumb spacecraft.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.580
And the way that this used
to work back in the day,

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.810
you had dumb spacecraft
and very smart

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.800
people on the ground,
a whole bunch of them,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.380
that controlled the
really dumb spacecraft.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.230
Well, we didn't have
the money for that,

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.770
and we didn't have all this.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.840
So we're going, what can we do?

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.220
So we started talking the NASA,
and fortunately, we know people

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.900
like Dr. John Grunsfeld, who's
the Associate Administrator

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.742
for Science.

00:08:03.742 --> 00:08:05.200
And if you read
the thing-- they're

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.770
looking at shutting down the
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.310
They're looking at shutting
down Cassini and rovers on Mars.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.260
NASA didn't have any
money put into this,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.450
even if they did
have the equipment.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.200
So we talked to NASA.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.390
And on April the
10th of this year,

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.699
we had a teleconference
with NASA.

00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:27.490
And they told everybody
who was interested.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.110
And there's a lot
of people interested

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.280
in this spacecraft
at NASA, because most

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.460
of the senior
management at NASA today

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.422
cut their teeth on this
spacecraft or its companions.

00:08:37.422 --> 00:08:38.880
There was actually
three spacecraft

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.780
launched at the same time--
two were in Earth orbit.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.390
And this was out at about
a million kilometers away.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.010
And so this is what the
spacecraft looked like back

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.440
in 1978, before
they launched it.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.734
And then this is a
pretty graphic from one

00:08:52.734 --> 00:08:53.400
of its missions.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.320
And here's another
real cool picture.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.575
We just got this yesterday.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.660
And people start
to send us stuff.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.980
And we just got this yesterday.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.840
This is some of the
team members that

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.380
put this spacecraft
together before launch.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.990
And so we're starting to
gather these pictures.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.090
So it's not a big spacecraft.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.420
And it was actually
in the era that NASA

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.210
didn't have much money.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.640
NASA was spending all of its
money in the mid to late 1970s

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.060
building the Space Shuttle,
and so they didn't really

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.480
have much money for science.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.550
And so this was a very,
very inexpensive mission.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.765
And that's kind of caused a
few other problems we've had

00:09:31.765 --> 00:09:32.265
lately.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.270
So here's the original mission.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.400
What this spacecraft did-- it
was one of three spacecraft.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.160
Two were in Earth's
orbit, circling here

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.180
between low Earth orbit and
the Earth's magnetosphere

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.590
to measure all of these
parameters, from cosmic rays,

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.640
gamma rays, magnetic fields--
everything about the Earth.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.740
And then they had one spacecraft
that was all the way out here,

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.820
about 1.5 million
kilometers closer to the Sun

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.900
than the Earth, in the
Earth-Sun libration point called

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.740
L1, which is a gravitationally
stable area about 1.5

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.230
million kilometers away.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.890
But see, the Sun's in the way.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.300
So what they had to
do-- the spacecraft

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.270
had to orbit the
libration point in order

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.310
to get out of the
interference of the Sun,

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.260
because the Sun
puts out more radio

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.980
energy at radio
frequencies than anything

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.500
else in the solar system.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.480
And so they had to orbit
this point and about 600,000

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.830
miles away from it.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.860
And so it sat there.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.450
It measured the
Sun during the peak

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.930
of what's called Solar
Cycle 21, in 1980,

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.490
and in companionship with
these other spacecraft, studied

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.940
all of these parameters.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.650
Well, back then,
these spacecraft

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.270
really didn't last
all that long.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.130
It was only a
three-year mission.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.990
And so around 1981, 1982,
they started thinking, hey.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.100
What else can we do
with this spacecraft?

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.370
Because there was-- and I
remember this, because I've

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.130
always been a science
geek, and I always

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.840
remember the NASA stuff.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.410
And at the time, NASA
wanted to send a spacecraft

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:06.870
to Halley's Comet.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.600
They didn't have the money, and
they didn't build a spacecraft.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.420
And a lot of the
NASA guys-- kind

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.960
of like me-- were kind of,
you know, this is crap.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.710
We're going to figure
out something to do.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.350
So what they did--
they figured out

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.135
a mission for this spacecraft.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.300
Think about what it
took to figure out

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.860
the math for this
course back in an era

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.570
when you had a mainframe
of maybe one meg of memory

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:39.020
and maybe 100,000
FLOPS of power.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.290
But there's a guy by the name of
Dr. Bob Farquhar-- who I really

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.430
think should get the Nobel
Prize for this alone--

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:49.780
who figured out that by doing
several flybys of the Earth

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.920
and flybys of Moon, that
you could gain enough

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.500
orbital energy to
fly by the Moon--

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.020
and they did their final
flyby in September of 1983--

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.860
to go and catch a comet.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:07.240
And they caught this comet
on September the 11th, 1985.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.360
It was the very
first comet encounter

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.240
that any spacecraft had ever
had a year before the Halley,

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.800
so the "Go USA" kind of stuff.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.080
The USA was the first country
ever to get close to a comet.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.150
And they navigated
this spacecraft

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.060
that was not designed
for interplanetary flight

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:31.231
within 8,000 kilometers of the
nucleus of this comet-- way

00:12:31.231 --> 00:12:31.730
cool.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.020
And it was just amazing.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.616
And I remember it at the time.

00:12:36.616 --> 00:12:38.490
But they didn't have an
imaging system on it.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.120
But they got a lot
of really good data.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.070
And if you go look at the NASA
technical report server, what

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.420
you will find is that
there's literally

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.270
thousands of papers
written by people

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.240
who worked on this satellite,
because literally it

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.270
wrote many books
on these subjects.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:03.940
And then in March of 1986, it
encountered the-- let's see.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.120
Oh, I've got a clock here.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.460
It encountered the comet
Halley, but at about 21 million

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.450
kilometers.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.920
But still, even at that
distance-- and this was

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.050
a discovery as
well-- Halley's Comet

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.310
influenced the solar
magnetic field.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:24.310
And they still don't quite get
how that works, but it did.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.440
And so after this
encounter, this spacecraft

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.440
is in a heliocentric
orbit, about 354 days,

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.610
with the Earth at 365 days.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.030
And so these are two ellipses.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.190
And what they started
calculating is,

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.920
can we bring this
back to the Earth?

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.990
Well, they calculated,
and they set it up,

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:47.870
and they did the
thruster firings.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:52.090
In 1986-- and the
last thruster firing

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:56.100
was in February of 1987--
for this spacecraft

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:04.892
to fly by the Moon at about 1830
UTC on August the 14th, 2014.

00:14:04.892 --> 00:14:08.080
Do you know how far off course
this spacecraft is right now?

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:16.080
20,000 kilometers,
after 27 years.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.220
Come on, guys.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.280
Could we do any
better than that?

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.130
Nuh uh.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:28.472
These guys got it-- 20,000
kilometers off-course

00:14:28.472 --> 00:14:32.440
in 24 billion miles of travel.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.050
Just mind-blowing--
mind-blowing.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:41.070
So we started thinking
about this, and on the 12th,

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.190
we started a
crowd-funding effort.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:48.326
The 12th of April, when we
started, we had no money,

00:14:48.326 --> 00:14:52.130
had no technology, but we had
a bunch of people-- you know,

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.780
I'm not dumb, and I've
done a lot of stuff,

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.410
and I've been around this
business a long time.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.140
And I'm going, you know,
I think we can do this.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.067
So what we did--
and right here, I

00:15:04.067 --> 00:15:05.400
want to show you one more thing.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.370
We have the tyranny
of Isaac Newton.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.800
This is the other thing
that we were fighting.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.760
Because this
spacecraft, we knew,

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.610
was a little bit off course.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:18.760
Well, 20,000 kilometers
is still a very long way

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.615
when you want to pass by
the Moon at 50 kilometers.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.440
So we knew it was off course.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.330
And to change the
course, you have

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.300
to fire the propulsion system.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.180
In order to fire the
propulsion system,

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.780
you've got to talk
to the spacecraft.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.300
In order to talk
to the spacecraft,

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.640
you've got to understand
the spacecraft.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.641
You've got to stroke it.

00:15:36.641 --> 00:15:38.599
You've got to be nice to
it, just like a kitty.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.920
But we had a problem.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.400
We had a Delta-V curve.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.280
This is how much Delta-V,
in meters a second,

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.260
it was going to take to make
the course correction we had

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.975
to make in order to fly over
the Moon at 50 kilometers.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.590
And this number starts
really going up.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:59.524
It's asymptotic.

00:15:59.524 --> 00:16:00.940
As you might think,
the closer you

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.720
get, the more energy it
takes to correct your course.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.050
Well, that number starts--
and this is seven.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.040
This is July,
where we're at now.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.730
And we're going,
the spacecraft only

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:15.720
had about 140 meters a
second of propulsion left.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.270
Well, here we are 1st
of July-- we're already

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.580
at 100 meters a second.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.960
We're going, oh crap.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.610
And so we started right here.

00:16:25.075 --> 00:16:27.630
And so we're going, what
the hell are we going to do?

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.170
What have I got
myself into this time?

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:31.195
So we started thinking.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.940
And as good engineers,
whether you're

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:39.170
a software engineer, a hardware
engineer, you think, OK.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.380
I've got-- there's
an old saying, if you

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.580
have enough problems, you can
make them solve each other.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.550
So I started
thinking about this.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.330
I'm going, OK.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.230
We don't have a transmitter.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:54.120
We can't use any NASA dishes,
because our deal with NASA-- we

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.510
actually signed a Space
Act agreement with NASA,

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.910
but NASA can't
give us any money.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.605
So NASA can't give
us any facilities.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:06.760
And all the big telescopes,
all the big antennas are mostly

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.119
NASA or other
government agencies'.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:11.079
I know people in a
commercial business,

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:14.460
but the biggest dishes
are like 13 and 15 meters.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:15.930
We needed a big dish.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.140
We needed a really big dish.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.185
So I'm going, hey.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.015
There's a really big
dish in Puerto Rico.

00:17:23.015 --> 00:17:25.440
It's called Arecibo--
the biggest frickin'

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.520
dish on the Earth.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.530
I wonder if we can use that.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.710
So we went to Arecibo.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.580
And we talked to
the guys down there.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.500
And fortunately for us,
they had had an earthquake

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.250
in Puerto Rico a few
months before that

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.420
caused some problems
with that big structure

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.980
in the middle that holds up
all of the communications gear.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.900
And so they had, literally
only a couple of weeks before,

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.470
started operations again.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.770
So they weren't really
back up to full speed

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.280
with all their science
and all that other stuff.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.370
And so they had
some time for us.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.480
And it just so worked
out that the time

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.240
of day we wanted to do this was
at the end of their maintenance

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.098
period.

00:18:07.098 --> 00:18:08.973
And so these guys always
put a little padding

00:18:08.973 --> 00:18:12.900
in their maintenance period,
and so we could come in there

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.080
and use the antenna then.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:16.830
I went, all right.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.410
I got the biggest antenna
in the frickin' world now,

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.470
so I've just solved one problem.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.970
OK.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.060
But it also solved
another problem,

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.655
because I needed a transmitter.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.910
Well, NASA usually, with their
big 34 and 70-meter dishes,

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.130
they have a 10-kilowatt
transmitter.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.040
Anybody got a clue
what the lead time

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.720
and cost of one of
those suckers is?

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.080
It wasn't going to happen.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.624
Well, Arecibo to
the rescue again.

00:18:42.624 --> 00:18:44.165
I only needed a
400-watt transmitter.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.600
I talked to some
people on the internet.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.110
I found a guy in Germany
who built power amplifiers

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.030
for ham radio.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.910
I said, I need one in two weeks.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.280
He said, OK.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.780
And I think I about
drove him crazy,

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.190
because I think he signed up for
something impossible as well.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:04.510
And he was about a week
late, but we still got it.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:09.750
And at the end
of-- it was May 29.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:14.190
Now, we started the
project on April 12.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.780
I swear to God we hadn't
written a line of code,

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.120
hadn't built a
piece of hardware.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:19.660
May 29.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.460
Success.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.680
We commanded the spacecraft to
go into engineering telemetry

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.310
mode.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.240
One of the cool things about
the spacecraft that the guys had

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.560
done who built it before, or who
had operated it before-- they

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.220
left the transmitter zone.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.010
So that was a beacon
that we could lock on to.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:42.640
Well, we found out that
the ephemeris that NASA had

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.790
was wrong.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.570
The spacecraft wasn't exactly
where it was supposed to be.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:51.320
But, another side
benefit of Arecibo--

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.255
any of you guys here
communications engineers?

00:19:53.255 --> 00:19:54.880
You know anything
about communications?

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.700
Well, OK.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:58.620
Think of a dish.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.560
Think of a telescope.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.770
Think of anything like that.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.510
You have what's
called a beam width.

00:20:03.626 --> 00:20:05.125
So if I've got a
small antenna, I've

00:20:05.125 --> 00:20:06.934
got a really wide beam width.

00:20:06.934 --> 00:20:09.100
If I have a big antenna, I
have a narrow beam width.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.310
And this is how we
communicate with satellites.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.677
But if I've got the biggest
telescope in the world--

00:20:13.677 --> 00:20:15.260
and I should have
thought about this--

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.600
I've got the narrowest
beam width in the world.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.565
The beam width of this
telescope is 120 arcseconds.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.460
So I've got to point that
sucker really accurately.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.110
And you ask, how the
hell do you point

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.360
a dish that's
anchored on the Earth?

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:35.060
Well, they have an azimuth in
elevation on the center part,

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:39.570
and they get about 15 to
20 degrees of elevation.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.970
And they can do a
full 360 in azimuth.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.870
So they can point the dish.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.610
We've got a 120 arcsecond.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.250
But that's accurate
enough that we

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.620
could do what's called
passive Doppler.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.710
And so they could
point the telescope,

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.480
and they point it the next
day, and point it the next day.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.090
And so just like the guys who
find asteroids and comets--

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.060
and they don't have
transmitters on them.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.880
And this is how they
determine their orbits.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.610
And so we were able to get
a better fix on the orbit.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:12.480
And guess what?

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.100
This asymptote number turned out
to not be anywhere near as bad.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.700
This was based on
250,000 miles off course.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.040
NASA didn't have
confidence in themselves.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:31.330
But when we were only 20,000
kilometers off course-- and I

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.360
won't jump ahead.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.318
We're going to try to do
a [? burn ?] tomorrow.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.860
We're down here.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.270
Whew.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:42.600
So this right here--
we put the spacecraft

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.700
into 512 bits per second and
we were able to get the data

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.010
and start to assess the
health of the spacecraft.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:52.455
Ah-- not that data.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.690
But I wanted to show you right
here-- this is how we did it.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.325
This is a company that's
right here locally called

00:22:00.325 --> 00:22:00.950
Ettus Research.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.440
They're right over
here in Sunnyvale.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.970
They're owned by
National Instruments.

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.030
You guys didn't buy them.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:06.704
Somebody else did.

00:22:06.704 --> 00:22:08.000
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.910
And they build a
software-defined radio

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:11.930
called the N210 USRP.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.530
It has about 400
megahertz of bandwidth

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.040
and can go up to
about 6 gigahertz.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.200
So this right here
was our radio.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.810
Instead of trying to build
hardware-- modulators,

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:30.090
demodulators, all that
stuff-- we were able to use,

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:34.660
via Linux in an application
called GNU Radio,

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:39.590
we were able to build in
software in three weeks

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.200
something that
normally takes a year

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.570
to do, in terms of
building hardware,

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.430
building systems to be
able to control and operate

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:48.170
a spacecraft.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.200
We did this, literally,
in three weeks.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.110
And this is kind of a slightly
more advanced version of what

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.310
we were doing, but this
is how we operate it now.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.340
We call this HA by
Static Mode, and I'll

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.860
let you figure
out what HA means.

00:23:03.874 --> 00:23:05.540
It was our-- let's
call it "half-baked."

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.550
And there's another
word in there.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.430
We transmit from Arecibo.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.010
Because we know where
the spacecraft is now.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:19.030
And we have a group working with
us in the amateur radio world.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:22.365
We have a dish in
Germany, a 20-meter dish,

00:23:22.365 --> 00:23:27.600
and a radio telescope called
Bochum Observatory in Germany,

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.730
to where we receive.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.590
And so we're able to receive
telemetry at the same time

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.220
that we're
transmitting, so we're

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:39.050
in what radio guys know
as full duplex mode.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:42.140
So we can determine what
happens to the spacecraft.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.700
And it's really, really improved
the way that we do things.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.560
And so we use Skype--
we actually have Skype.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.440
We have guys calling out values.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.010
Because we have this
little problem called ITAR.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:55.410
It's a four-letter word.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.470
I can't tell these guys what
all the telemetry values mean,

00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:59.950
because it's in a
document that we

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:03.050
got from NASA that's called
an ITAR document, which

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.800
means that if I export the data,
tell them what the data is,

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.700
I can go to jail.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:13.010
So my brain is a controlled
item by the US government.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.980
It's been that way for years.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.200
And so what we do-- they
read off the numbers,

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.800
and I'm on Skype.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.460
And we have another guy over
here translating the numbers.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.430
And so I tell our
other guy, who's

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:28.500
on the other laptop commanding
the spacecraft, what to do.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.850
So literally we have
recreated, in eight weeks,

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:37.230
an entire ground station
network that's global in extent.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:38.855
We have other ground
stations-- one's

00:24:38.855 --> 00:24:40.310
at Morehead State in Kentucky.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.010
We work with the
[? city ?] guys.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.959
We've got some other dishes
that we were just offered.

00:24:46.959 --> 00:24:49.000
So this is kind of how we
operate the spacecraft.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.460
This right here tells
you a little bit

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.040
about what we actually did.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.880
This is called a waterfall plot.

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:02.560
And what a waterfall
plot is-- it's

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.930
looking at the carrier
from the spacecraft

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.750
along with its Doppler.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:09.270
Because a spacecraft
moving through space

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.780
will have a Doppler
effect on its carrier,

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.010
and we can measure that.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.690
And then you do a waterfall
plot so you can follow it.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.040
Well, what this
is here-- we were

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.390
able to test out the
spacecraft, and this

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.290
is what's called ranging mode.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.650
And this is coherent
ranging mode,

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:29.600
where we actually send a
waveform to the spacecraft--

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.070
and these are the sidebands--
and the spacecraft jumping

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:33.630
frequency.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.990
So we determined
that we would be

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:39.790
able to range to the
spacecraft and use the Doppler

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:43.040
effect to get an even better
position on the spacecraft.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.640
Because we have to
reduce our uncertainty

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.350
in the position of the
spacecraft to less than 5

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:52.370
kilometers in either
direction-- actually closer to 1

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:56.150
kilometer uncertainty
in its position in order

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:57.625
to fly by the Moon
at 50 kilometers

00:25:57.625 --> 00:25:58.500
and not hit the Moon.

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.250
So, again, uncertainty here.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:06.580
And so we built the
command structure.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.080
We're reading the telemetry.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.750
We're doing all of this.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.017
We're moving along.

00:26:12.017 --> 00:26:14.100
And then this right here
is just some of the data.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.470
And I think this is probably
the coolest data to me,

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:20.300
because I do a lot of
spacecraft power systems work.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.350
These temperatures
are right in line

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.050
where the spacecraft
was 30 years ago.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.910
The solar arrays on this
satellite-- everybody

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.120
loves solar power.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.210
Google loves solar
power, and all this.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:36.720
But solar arrays degrade.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.830
What we found out about
these solar arrays--

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:44.050
that they were still
at 93% of the power

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:47.885
they were putting out in 1980,
when Jimmy Carter was still

00:26:47.885 --> 00:26:48.385
in office.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:53.870
So that was a major
revelation for NASA.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.830
And that right there
justified the money

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:57.380
that NASA put in the project.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.740
So what we're able to
do-- and this is the value

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.050
that this brought
to NASA-- is they

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:06.640
wanted to understand what the
health of this spacecraft was.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.360
Because by doing that, they
can confirm their codes.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.450
Everybody likes to have
their code validated.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:15.530
So the thermal analysis from
back then they can validate,

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.200
so they can go back.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.060
And believe it or not,
the thermal analysis code

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:24.570
that NASA uses today
originated in the 1960s.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.970
It's just been
translated from Fortran

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:31.290
into more modern applications,
but it's still the same base

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:32.300
code.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:37.540
And so they came very close
to good thermal analysis

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.815
within a couple of
degrees of everything,

00:27:39.815 --> 00:27:43.390
within a few percentage points--
just absolutely fabulous.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:44.105
They did great.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.030
And so we verified all of that.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.010
And then so we kept operating.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:52.830
And we still operate
the spacecraft.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:56.320
This is our operations
facility today, the McMoons,

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.540
with our pirate flag.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.045
And that's an inside NASA joke.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:04.430
But this is our operations, back
in what used to be the kitchen.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.430
We have our guys and gals
in there doing their work.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.650
We do a pass.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:12.254
We have a decent
internet connection.

00:28:12.254 --> 00:28:12.920
I'm telling you.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.711
When you guys take over
the airfield there,

00:28:14.711 --> 00:28:16.690
please get us some
good internet in there.

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:18.250
Because it really sucks.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:22.170
I was using DSL until
a few weeks ago,

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:25.130
where we finally got a
decent internet connection.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:31.320
But we use the internet and
the GNU radio here at NASA Ames

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.800
to connect to the radios that
are at Arecibo, through SSH.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.260
And so we can send our
commands to the radio,

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:44.130
through a private network,
a relatively secure system,

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:46.410
to be able to command
the spacecraft.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.320
So that's what we do, and so
we do our passes here now.

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.920
Well, everything
was going great.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.880
We were doing good.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.480
We tested the propulsion system.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.220
We spun the spacecraft
up from 19.16 RPM,

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:07.380
and it slowed down a little
bit over 27 years, to 19.75.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.540
It worked great.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.680
And last week, we
were all going.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.120
We hit the button for the
final propulsion maneuver

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.790
to put it on course
to fly by the Moon

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:20.050
at 50 kilometers on August
10, and this is what happened.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.920
This is kind of like pressing
the gas on your electric car

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.670
when your battery's
about 95% dead.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.565
It has a similar effect.

00:29:27.565 --> 00:29:28.930
[ENGINE DYING SOUND EFFECT]

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.590
Well, it turned out
we had a problem.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:35.060
And we have been
debugging that problem.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:39.150
And I just put out an article
on this on my WordPress site

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.795
and on our
spacecollege.org site.

00:29:42.221 --> 00:29:43.345
I've come to a realization.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.480
And this is partly because of
the people here in this room

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.970
and on this campus
and everywhere else.

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:53.060
We now are the board.

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:58.523
We have a global
collective consciousness.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:02.690
And how that worked
in this instance

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.735
is that-- I'm not a
hydrazine propulsion--

00:30:05.735 --> 00:30:07.110
I've got to see
which one I have.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.930
OK.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.050
I'm not a hydrazine
propulsion guy.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.370
My expertise is, mostly,
I'm a systems engineer.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:14.930
I'm a systems architect.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:19.590
My detailed experience is in
communications, computers,

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:23.210
and power systems on spacecraft
and in the computer industry.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:24.960
I worked 20 years in
the computer industry

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.130
before I ever started
playing with space.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:32.030
And so I wanted some help.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:35.480
So what we did-- we
put out a blog post

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.700
on Space College and NASA
Watch in two or three places.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.350
We need help.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:48.130
Within two hours, I had
90% of the biggest experts

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:51.340
in the world, both
from US industry,

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.900
aerospace industry,
from NASA, from DoD,

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:58.750
as well as international,
to help us with our problem.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:02.160
Instantly-- almost instantly.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.390
So we were able to
take our telemetry

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:05.880
and talk to these guys.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.270
And they kind of talked
us through the issues.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:12.086
And we sort of
figured out that, OK.

00:31:12.086 --> 00:31:13.460
I mean, when this
first happened,

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:14.380
we were all depressed.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:14.730
We're going, oh.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:15.680
We're out of fuel.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.269
But now we've
figured out that we

00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:20.560
may have a problem with what's
called the latch valves.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.730
And these are valves inside
of the spacecraft that

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:25.750
block the propellant tanks
from the rest of the system.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.460
And there's details of why.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.746
But these guys that are top
people in the world-- we

00:31:30.746 --> 00:31:32.370
talked through all
of the possibilities

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.860
and came to the conclusion
there are these little valves.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:38.310
So not only did we diagnose
the problem of the satellite

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:41.006
from that far away, we use
the collective consciousness.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:48.450
And I say probably 98% of the
professionals in the world

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.030
are on the internet--
probably 99%.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:56.410
That 99% in professional
roles, that is a brain trust.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:58.810
That is a collective
consciousness

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:01.980
that can help solve
problems, can help do things.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.740
And I think this is a
very profound observation,

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:09.050
and a very profound thing that
we've been able to do here.

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:12.892
But the bottom line is that
we're going to go tomorrow,

00:32:12.892 --> 00:32:14.600
and we're going to go
through at Arecibo,

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.910
and we're going to try to
propulsion system again.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.590
We've got some things to try.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:21.360
And I think we have a pretty
good chance of doing it right.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.692
So what are we doing?

00:32:23.692 --> 00:32:24.650
What are we doing here?

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:27.850
And I want to show
one slide here,

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:29.710
and I'm just going to
show it for a minute,

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:32.090
because my friends--
we're actually

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:34.950
working with Google
Creative Labs right now.

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:38.220
Google Creative Labs has been
with us since the beginning.

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:41.730
And I know sometimes people
describe Google as an ant

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:43.902
colony, and sometimes
the ants don't

00:32:43.902 --> 00:32:45.360
know what the other
ants are doing.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.850
But you have a
great organization

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:50.420
called Google Creative Labs,
and we're working with them

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:54.970
to build some interesting things
that will be revealed soon.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.890
And you know how
things are around here.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.560
We can't say everything,
but real soon.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:04.370
And some of our collaborators,
Suzanne Chambers and the guys,

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:05.520
are working with us.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.550
So we're going to have a Google
Creative Labs crew at McMoons

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:10.160
tomorrow, working with us.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.410
So we're having some
fun there, and we're

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:16.440
going to show some really cool
stuff very soon-- next month.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.620
And so I'm just going
to show this again,

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.450
but then I'm going to
show where I'm going.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.070
Because we're getting
up to that time.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.903
And I want to open it
up for some questions.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.120
This is what I want to do.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.230
Why am I doing this?

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.480
We want to do it,
one-- everybody

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.640
said it was impossible, and
we want to do stuff like this.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.870
The other is that I want
to showcase my company.

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.330
You guys know this.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:40.790
I don't know how many of you
guys have your stock options,

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:45.350
but everybody knows that Google
and other companies around here

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:46.760
are vying for space right now.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.450
I know about Google WorldView.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:49.665
I know about O3b.

00:33:49.665 --> 00:33:51.580
I know about many
of your projects.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.130
And I know about many of the
other projects around here.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.690
Well, one of things I
want to do is say, hey.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:58.970
We know what we're doing.

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.360
Our little company
knows what we're doing.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.710
We do the impossible.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:06.990
My gig is doing stuff like
this-- building spacecraft

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:07.790
on orbit.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.659
And that's just
my little teaser.

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:12.400
Because we know how to do
it better than anybody else.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.550
People might say
this is impossible.

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.290
I'm telling you--
this is how we're

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:21.750
going to have ubiquitous
global internet, not CubeSats.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.365
That's my part there.

00:34:23.365 --> 00:34:27.840
And with that, I'm going to open
this for questions how ISEE-3

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.580
and what we're doing.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.624
Because we've got about
10, 15 minutes left,

00:34:32.624 --> 00:34:34.540
and so we've got plenty
of time for questions.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:36.750
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.940
I'm pretty sure we have
seen this [INAUDIBLE],

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:44.542
so is there any risk of someone
hijacking your spacecraft?

00:34:44.542 --> 00:34:46.000
DENNIS WINGO: Well,
they would have

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.223
to know a lot more about
the spacecraft than what

00:34:49.223 --> 00:34:50.489
you can find out.

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:52.320
There actually is a
lot of information

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.370
about this spacecraft
on the internet.

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.954
But one thing that's not out
there is the command codes.

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.750
And those are actually
ITAR-controlled as well.

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:02.610
So they're not out there.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:07.360
When we do our pipeline,
there's a white list of IP.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.790
And, yeah, somebody
could probably break in.

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:14.145
But, you know, why?

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:18.950
It would take a lot of effort
to replicate what we did.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:22.000
And at the end of
the day, you couldn't

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.589
have that much fun with it.

00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:25.630
AUDIENCE: Would you say
satellite control systems

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.010
have changed significantly?

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:30.565
Like, 20 years in the future,
can current space-- would

00:35:30.565 --> 00:35:33.591
it ever be possible to do this
again, or is stuff more complex

00:35:33.591 --> 00:35:34.090
now?

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.420
DENNIS WINGO: The answer
is yes, and here's why.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:44.210
One of the problems that we face
is incomplete documentation.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.730
It's difficult.

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:52.050
Modern spacecraft-- and
I want to use an example

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:55.140
like Lunar
Reconnaissance Orbiter.

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.530
You would really
have to have-- so I'm

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:00.330
going to kind of agree with you.

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:03.310
But one of the problems
is these spacecraft

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:06.110
have safe modes that you can
kind of start with and kind

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:08.910
of build with, and get into it.

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:12.190
And now we keep
documentation better.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:17.720
So we have a better-- more
ability to go in there

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.300
and do that.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:23.630
But I think there is
some merit in that.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:26.590
I certainly don't think we could
have done it in three weeks.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:32.180
But at the same time, there's
a lot of commercial satellites

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.600
out there in the geo world.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.630
And one of the business areas
that we're going to move into

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:39.390
is controlling geosynchronous
communication satellites.

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:42.770
I think we can do that a lot
cheaper than other folks.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:47.210
And so the answer's
only a qualified yes.

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:49.030
AUDIENCE: If the
spacecraft continues

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.570
on the same trajectory,
what other things

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:54.960
can you do with it other than
controlling the propulsion?

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.899
Can you get more science and--

00:36:56.899 --> 00:36:57.940
DENNIS WINGO: Absolutely.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.270
AUDIENCE: Is it going to pass
interesting areas or something?

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:01.061
DENNIS WINGO: Yeah.

00:37:01.061 --> 00:37:03.622
We already have gotten our first
science from the spacecraft,

00:37:03.622 --> 00:37:04.580
from the magnetometers.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:09.670
What this spacecraft
has-- if you're

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:12.601
studying magnetic fields,
you want more than a few data

00:37:12.601 --> 00:37:13.100
points.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.340
Well, right now, we
have a whole bunch

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.800
of spacecraft in Earth orbit.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.065
We have a couple around Mars.

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.700
Well, this one here gives
us another baseline.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.525
And we've already gotten some
good magnetometers readings.

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:28.560
When we put the spacecraft--
even if we don't get it back

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.810
in Earth orbit, we're going
to leave the telemetry on,

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:32.920
the science experiments on.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.540
And we'll be able to
get that data, gamma ray

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:36.950
bursts, and things like this.

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.400
And so if you're looking
at something that's

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.170
six billion light
years away, you

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:44.400
want to have a bigger baseline
than a couple thousand

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.250
kilometers or a couple
of million kilometers

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:48.320
to be able to
determine the distance.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.130
So the answer is,
no matter what,

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:52.500
we're going to get good
science out of this.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.570
But what we hope to do is to
put it back into a stable Earth

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:59.030
orbit to where we can
provide, as citizen

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:01.760
scientists, this
data to everyone.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.280
And that's kind of what
we're working with.

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.939
And I can't really say
too much more about that.

00:38:06.939 --> 00:38:09.230
AUDIENCE: You mentioned the
status of the solar panels.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:11.190
Do you have status on other
things in the aircraft?

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:12.720
For example, the
memory-- have there

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.110
been bits flipped by cosmic
rays and things like that?

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:16.610
DENNIS WINGO: There
ain't no memory.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:18.358
AUDIENCE: Ah, no memory.

00:38:18.358 --> 00:38:20.490
DENNIS WINGO: [LAUGH]
I'm telling you.

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:24.420
And I don't know
how far back you go.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:29.565
But it's like a super,
super, super old printer.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.920
Those super old printers
didn't have memory.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.170
You stuffed data
into a register.

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.300
And you read data
out of a register.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.330
Those registers are
hard-wired chips

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:44.330
that had flip-flops in it
that are not classical memory

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:44.830
elements.

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:46.130
They're not like a static RAM.

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:47.860
They're not like a dynamic RAM.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.990
They literally are
hard-wired registers

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:53.410
that you can read
to and write to.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:55.350
That's all this spacecraft has.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.190
I missed [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:59.920
It has one microprocessor on it.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.900
It's an 1802 that's on
one of the experiments.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:07.160
But all the memory for
that died 30 years ago.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.730
And this spacecraft has
taken more than five

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:13.950
times its normal radiation dose.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:15.390
And so, yeah.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.990
There's a couple of bits
flipped here and there,

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.520
but you just reset the
register and you're fine.

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:26.980
It is literally the dumbest
spacecraft on the block,

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:27.715
but we love it.

00:39:27.715 --> 00:39:29.590
AUDIENCE: I enjoy your
comment about the lack

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:31.930
of documentation, because
I'm a technical writer

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:34.320
and a former military historian.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.120
And what was really good
is to organize the document

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.780
for lessons learned.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:42.320
Is there a plan for
a book or a movie

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.020
starring George Clooney
and Sandra Bullock

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.712
to document your efforts?

00:39:47.712 --> 00:39:48.420
DENNIS WINGO: No.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.975
But what we are doing--
we're actually working,

00:39:50.975 --> 00:39:53.350
and we've been working with
them for a while, the Library

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:55.055
of Congress and the
National Archives.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.430
And since you're a
military historian--

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:00.380
I actually worked
on the very first

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:04.400
terabyte-class engineering
document management

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.950
system for the Defense
Department in the 1980s.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:11.620
We had a four-terabyte
engineering document server

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.730
in 1985.

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:17.250
In the Defense Department,
because their equipment

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:20.610
has a much longer life
cycle-- like the B-52

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.130
is older than
anybody in this room.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.640
And these old weapon
systems-- they

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.065
have to maintain those drawings.

00:40:27.065 --> 00:40:28.440
So back in the
old days, they had

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.450
what's called an aperture
card, which is an IBM punch

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:33.890
card with a piece
of microfilm in it.

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:37.390
My company, along
with AT&amp;T, digitized

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:40.870
millions of those aperture
cards and put them

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:42.140
into a digital database.

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.110
This is literally the first
large-scale engineering

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:47.010
document database in the world.

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:48.940
And NASA doesn't
do that, though.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:53.200
NASA does a really good job
at archiving their science.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.450
They suck at archiving
engineering data.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:01.060
Every single program, including
the Space Shuttle, the Space

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.390
Station, the Saturn
V-- the only reason

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.660
that we have the design
plans for the Saturn V is

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:08.540
that a friend of mine
in Huntsville, Alabama

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:12.860
took it upon himself to collect
an entire collection of all

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.154
the Saturn V stuff and
stuff it in the library

00:41:15.154 --> 00:41:16.820
at the University of
Alabama Huntsville.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:20.450
Or we wouldn't have the
drawings for the Saturn V.

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:21.750
There is no requirement.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:23.210
This is government contracting.

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:26.490
There's no requirement in
any of these guys' contract

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:31.500
to archive their product,
their spacecraft.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.170
And so what we're doing is--
and we're working directly

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.090
with the Associate
Administrator for Science

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:37.840
and the associate
administrator for what's

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.650
called HEOMD, the
exploration guys,

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:43.730
to write in to
Federal Acquisition

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:47.440
Regulations and NASA
contracts that they also

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.030
have to have an archival
plan for all the engineering

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:55.160
documentation for the spacecraft
products that they build.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.580
Because I know more about
this spacecraft than anybody

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:58.080
at NASA.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.505
I know more about Lunar
Orbiter than anybody at NASA.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.640
And that's a tragedy in a way.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.440
I saw a presentation
one time when

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.640
I started building my
students' satellite.

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.670
This is in the early 1990s.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:14.740
And I get brought to this
company in Huntsville.

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:17.471
Does anybody know the name
of the first commercial space

00:42:17.471 --> 00:42:17.970
company?

00:42:19.037 --> 00:42:19.870
Of course you don't.

00:42:21.082 --> 00:42:25.260
The company's name was
Space Craft Incorporated,

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:26.430
a company called SCI.

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.010
That company still exists.

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:33.120
It's called Sanmina, SCI--
the world's largest contract

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.780
electronics manufacturer.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.300
You guys probably use them,
in some form or another,

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.260
for some of your
Google products.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:43.510
But at the time in the
1950s when they were found,

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.470
they basically invented--
all this stuff about CubeSats

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:49.360
that everybody's waxing poetic
about and all they can do,

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:52.480
they invented that
in 1958 and 1959.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:52.980
Guess why?

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.000
The rockets the US had
couldn't put anything other

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.140
than a CubeSat, basically.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.980
I mean, the Explorer
1, the first satellite

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.610
we ever launched,
weighed 30 kilograms.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.150
We just didn't have it.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:07.842
And so this guy's showing
me this presentation.

00:43:07.842 --> 00:43:09.300
When I was building
this satellite,

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:13.040
it was 34 kilograms,
that we flew in 1998.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.792
And this guy's showing
me all this stuff.

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:16.250
And I'm telling
him, I said, do you

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:18.155
realize how many patents
I could invalidate?

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:22.410
And this is part of
it in that there's

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:24.020
this intellectual
property that's

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:28.100
developed that falls off the
map, is reinvented later.

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.210
And we're like on our
third or fourth generation

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:31.330
of reinventing this stuff.

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:35.080
So to answer your question,
we are working very hard

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.940
with the National Archives,
and the Library of Congress,

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:41.340
and NASA to get NASA to do what
the Defense Department does

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.720
in kind of a good way.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.810
And I laugh about
this all the time,

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:50.160
because I'm very much of a
technical historian myself.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.420
I have a really good library
of technical documentation.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.410
It predates 1990.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:59.380
Still, the vast majority
of really cool stuff

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:03.400
that happened before 1990
doesn't exist on the web.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.870
It just doesn't.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:07.340
And so a lot of these
technologies, a lot of stuff

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.360
we do, it's just not there.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.700
And so it's a
continuing process.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.330
And it's going to
be interesting.

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:18.810
And this is the chilling
part-- one of these days,

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:21.320
and it's already happening
around the world,

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.290
that governments are going
to be able to control

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.070
how the information
is presented.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:29.480
And when 95% of all
information is digital,

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.320
history can be rewritten
at the stroke of a key.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.990
This is something that your
company logo of Do No Evil

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:40.060
can help us fight.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:41.830
Because there are
companies and there

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:46.092
are nations around the world
rewriting history as we speak.

00:44:46.092 --> 00:44:47.550
AUDIENCE: This was
just a question.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:49.490
Do you have any
gauge on the accuracy

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:51.490
of the scientific instruments
now, and, I guess,

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:53.150
do you have any way
to calibrate them?

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:56.370
DENNIS WINGO: The magnetometer
is working as expected.

00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:00.320
We have another instrument
called the bane instrument that

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.330
seems to be working as expected.

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:04.810
We have the ability to
calibrate the others.

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:07.460
But we've been really focused
on the engineering side

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.550
to save the damn
thing, and then we

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:11.220
worry about the
scientific instruments.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.820
But in the last
couple of weeks, we've

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.781
been running in
science data mode,

00:45:15.781 --> 00:45:17.655
and so we've been able
to start that process.

00:45:18.287 --> 00:45:19.120
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.400
DENNIS WINGO: I
want your question.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.180
AUDIENCE: I had the
very same question.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.055
DENNIS WINGO: Oh, OK.

00:45:22.055 --> 00:45:26.070
So the answer's yes, and doing
the calibrations and all.

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:29.440
And I think we're going to
have some way cool products,

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.150
and a lot of the
coolness of it will

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:35.510
be because of our collaborations
with my friend Suzanne out

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:36.030
there.

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.420
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:38.753
Well, we're just about out
of time and out of questions.

00:45:38.753 --> 00:45:40.530
So if you could
join me in thanking

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:42.120
Dennis for coming
and speaking to us.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.020
It was a great talk.

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:46.670
[APPLAUSE]
