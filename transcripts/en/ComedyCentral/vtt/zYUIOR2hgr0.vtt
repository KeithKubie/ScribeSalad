Yes!
Whoo!

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:09.109
That's what I'm talking about
right here.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:13.346
This is why I don't leave
when people do drugs.

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.248
Now, I'm at a house party

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:17.784
and this guy's got
an alligator on his face.

Glad to have him here.
You guys know him

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:04.297
as the host of
"The CrabFeast" podcast.

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:06.566
Give it up for Mr. Ryan Sickler,
everybody.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.733

- You guys like drugs?

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:15.508
[cheers and laughter]

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.776
All right.

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:18.844
I don't really do drugs,
all right?

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:20.846
I smoke a little weed.

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:22.782
I drink a beer now and then.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:24.850
I've never done cocaine.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.419
I've never done acid.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:29.021
I'm not into pills.
Like, the hard stuff scares me.

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:32.592
All right,
but in a right situation,

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:36.362
I love to be around
people on drugs.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:40.266
Anything is possible
when someone's on drugs.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.602
All right, like right now,
if you said, "Hey,

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.336
"do you mind if
I smoke some heroin

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:45.938
while you tell this story?"

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:49.375
I'd say, "Fire that shit up.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:53.045
Let's see where
the night takes you."

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:55.814
So,
I'm originally from Baltimore.

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:58.651
And--grew up out in
Sykesville, Maryland.

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:00.820
And when I graduated
high school,

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.322
I played soccer for
junior college,

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:06.859
AKA community college.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.062
AKA the 13th grade.

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:11.964
[laughter]

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:14.968
And...so when you play sports

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.969
with guys in high school,
you play all four years,

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.471
you know 'em well,
you're in school with 'em,

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.973
everybody knows each other.
When I got to college,

00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:22.575
not everyone knew each other.

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:25.011
And a dude on the team said,
"Hey, man, a friend of mine

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:27.579
"is having a party tonight
down in Fort McHenry.

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.549
We should all go, get to know
one another, and hang out."

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.053
Now, quick history lesson
for you here if you don't know.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:37.523
Fort McHenry is where
Francis Scott Key wrote

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:40.225
our national anthem.
All right?

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:42.395
He wrote "The Star-Spangled
Banner" there.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:44.664
I'm going to
a house party there.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:48.334
We all have our path.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:51.904
So...I get to the door
and I knock on the door

00:02:51.904 --> 00:02:53.505
and this big dude answers.

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:55.574
And when I say "big,"
I don't want to be misleading.

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:56.876
He wasn't built like The Rock,

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:58.878
but he was more like Sloth
from "Goonies."

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:00.879
Okay?
Sizable.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.214
Dude was sizable.

00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:05.585
And he says,
"Welcome to my party.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.053
My name is Sparks."

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:09.689
I said, "Well, thank you
for having me, Sparks."

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.792
I go in, I'm hanging out
with the guys on the team,

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.360
we're drinking and smoking.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.929
Sparks is right there,
drinking and smoking with us.

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:19.198
Then he disappears downstairs.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.767
A few minutes later,
he comes back up,

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:23.536
drinking and smoking,

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.104
disappears downstairs again.

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:27.640
Now, I don't know
what's going on down there.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.974
I can hear some voices.

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:30.075
I only assume it's like,

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:31.777
buddies of his, local guys,

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:33.145
they've been there a while.

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:34.747
They're not mixing with us.

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:36.148
We're not mixing with them.

00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:39.485
But Sparks is going
back and forth.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:42.989
About the fifth time
Sparks comes up the stairs,

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.991
he's got cocaine
all over his face,

00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:49.228
and I'm just like, oh, I got it.

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:51.897
You're up here
drinking and smoking with us.

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:54.500
You're down there
doing cocaine with them.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.937
You're being a great host.

00:03:57.937 --> 00:04:00.106
So...
[laughs]

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:02.174
I don't know if you've ever
hung out with someone

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:05.844
that's done way too much cocaine
at one time,

00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:08.114
but Sparks has these big eyes

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:11.016
and this smile plastered
on his face ear to ear,

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:12.651
and he's bouncing like this
in front of us

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:15.520
in the living room like I am
in front of you all right now.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.023
And he keeps snapping his neck

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:18.857
and looking to the rear corner
of the living room.

00:04:18.857 --> 00:04:22.761
He's like...

00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:24.597
And then he walks back there.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.465
And in the corner
there's a little aquarium

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:29.502
with a blanket on it.
And he rips the blanket off.

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:32.038
All right, now,
we're in a row home, all right.

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:33.606
It's narrow but it's deep,

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:36.341
so from where I'm sitting,
at first, I'm like,

00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:38.543
man, that kind of looks like
an alligator.

00:04:38.543 --> 00:04:40.546
You know what it actually was?

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:42.982
A fucking alligator.

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:46.653
Yeah.
Sparks has a pet alligator.

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:49.988
And it's sitting in
this aquarium on some rocks

00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:51.323
and, like, half full of water.

00:04:51.323 --> 00:04:55.227
You know,
natural alligator habitat.

00:04:55.227 --> 00:04:57.563
And Sparks steps
right up next to it.

00:04:57.563 --> 00:04:59.899
And without taking his eyes
off of us,

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.734
he lays his arm in the tank

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:04.903
and he starts swaying it
back and forth in the water

00:05:04.903 --> 00:05:06.806
alongside the alligator's body.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.807
And I'm like, here we go.

00:05:08.807 --> 00:05:11.744
Here we go.
Here it is.

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:13.345
Back and forth.

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:15.748
Cocaine.
Cocaine.

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:19.584
Back and forth.
Back and forth.

00:05:19.584 --> 00:05:21.220
Then he picks the alligator up.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.025
Now there's a dinosaur
at the party.

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:27.826
Two dudes on the team leave.

00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:29.328
Guy sitting next to me is like,

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:31.396
"Hey, I think we should
get the hell out of here too."

00:05:31.396 --> 00:05:34.600
And I was like,
"What are you talking about?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.902
"This just got good.

00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:38.571
"Like, do I need to remind you
right now

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:43.575
"that you're at a party with
marijuana, alcohol, cocaine,

00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:48.413
"and an alligator,
in a historic neighborhood.

00:05:48.413 --> 00:05:51.284
"Where else do you want to be
in the country tonight, man?

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:55.187
This is the spot.
We got a front-row seat."

00:05:55.187 --> 00:05:57.923
And Sparks is holding this thing
by the belly, okay?

00:05:57.923 --> 00:05:59.024
And it's big, all right.

00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:00.525
Now, it's not Gator World big.

00:06:00.525 --> 00:06:02.127
We weren't gonna just, like,
sit on its back

00:06:02.127 --> 00:06:04.229
and take pictures,
but it's like the size

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.298
of a big cat.
I'd say from the snout

00:06:06.298 --> 00:06:08.300
to the base of the tail,
it's about this big.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.869
And then the tail hangs down.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.204
And he's holding it
with both hands by the belly

00:06:12.204 --> 00:06:14.807
with the snout right at his face
like I have this microphone

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:16.142
right now.

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:18.444
And Guns N' Roses was big
at the time.

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:22.248
I say that 'cause Sparks
busted out his best Axl Rose

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:25.551
and starts dancing
with this alligator.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:28.954
Cocaine.
Cocaine.

00:06:28.954 --> 00:06:30.489
And then he kisses it
on the mouth,

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:33.325
and I'm like,
this is what I'm talking about.

00:06:33.325 --> 00:06:37.663
This is what I'm talking about
right here.

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:39.464
And he kisses it again.

00:06:39.464 --> 00:06:41.467
And you know that little
shady side-eye

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:43.469
that alligators have?
That little eye they have,

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.471
you know?
That alligator's looking out

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:49.107
at all of us like,
"Is this motherfucker serious?"

00:06:49.107 --> 00:06:51.276
And then he kissed it
a third time,

00:06:51.276 --> 00:06:53.079
and that alligator said snap!

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:56.783
And I was like,
Oh! Oh, yes! Yes!

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:59.285
Whoo! That's what
I'm talking about right here!

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:03.689
This is why I don't leave
when people do drugs.

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:05.357
Now, I'm at a house party

00:07:05.357 --> 00:07:08.494
and this guy's got an alligator
on his face.

00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:10.529
Do you know how pissed off
I would have been

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:13.098
if I left and someone called me
the next day and said,

00:07:13.098 --> 00:07:16.168
"You're not gonna believe
what happened"?

00:07:16.168 --> 00:07:18.270
Oh, I'd have been devastated.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.772
But I didn't leave.
I stayed right there.

00:07:20.772 --> 00:07:25.010
And this alligator is
clamped down on Sparks's face.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.611
And his eyes, they're still big,

00:07:26.611 --> 00:07:29.048
completely different emotion
in there now.

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:31.383
Starting to see
the panic settle in.

00:07:31.383 --> 00:07:34.953
But I'll never forget the look
in that alligator's eyes.

00:07:34.953 --> 00:07:38.057
'Cause that's--that was
his first time tasting flesh,

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:41.527
blood, and cocaine.

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:46.131
That's like a reptile
Mega Millions right there.

00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:47.733
And it's on.
It's on tight.

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:49.235
It's not going anywhere.

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:51.837
And I'll say this, too,
for people from Baltimore,

00:07:51.837 --> 00:07:54.340
some of the toughest people
I've ever met

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.741
in my life, all right?

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:56.976
This gator is locked.

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.744
And he's not screaming.

00:07:58.744 --> 00:07:59.979
And if he is,

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:04.083
I can't hear it
over my laughter.

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:06.752
And Sparks doesn't know
what to do.

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:08.554
You know,
I'm not getting up and helping.

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:10.756
I'm not putting my hand
in an alligator's mouth.

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:13.559
I just open another beer.

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:17.028
And he knows there's
no one coming to his rescue.

00:08:17.028 --> 00:08:18.831
And he does what he has to do.

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.899
And he rips it
off of his face.

00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:22.101
[audience groans]
Yeah.

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:23.602
And he goes over

00:08:23.602 --> 00:08:26.372
and he sets it back down
in the aquarium.

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:28.707
And he's got his hand
over his face like this.

00:08:28.707 --> 00:08:32.110
He takes it off.
Cocaine's gone at this point.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.881
And he goes, "I'm not bleeding."

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.415
And he wasn't.

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:38.550
And then he put his hand
over his face again

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.918
and he took it off
and I was like...

00:08:39.918 --> 00:08:41.620
[exhales]
"Now you are.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.122
"A lot, man.

00:08:43.122 --> 00:08:45.591
"Your--your face isn't supposed
to do that, man.

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:49.361
"Maybe the cocaine acted as
a coagulant for a second,

00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:52.297
but you're gushing right now,
man."

00:08:52.297 --> 00:08:54.967
And Sparks said,
"I'm calling the cops."

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:57.603
I was like, "The cops?
For what, alligator assault?

00:08:57.603 --> 00:09:00.038
"What the hell are you
calling the cops for, man?

00:09:00.038 --> 00:09:01.440
"Like, let me remind you, man,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.644
"you've got marijuana, cocaine,
and alcohol here

00:09:05.644 --> 00:09:07.279
"with underage kids,

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:10.149
"and you just took a gator
to the face, man.

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:11.149
"The cops are just gonna
come in here

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:12.618
"and beat the hell out of us.

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:16.288
"You need medical attention.
Call 911.

00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:17.823
They don't care about
this kind of stuff."

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:21.627
He said, "No.
I'm calling the cops."

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:24.630
I said, "We'll, I'm not gonna be
here when they get here."

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.465
And I thanked Sparks
for having me,

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:28.634
hit him with a
"see you later, alligator,"

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:31.503
got the hell out of
Fort McHenry.

00:09:31.503 --> 00:09:34.640
I'm Ryan Sickler.
Thank you.
