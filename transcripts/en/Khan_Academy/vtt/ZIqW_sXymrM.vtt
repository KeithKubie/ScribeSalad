00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:02.233
- [Voiceover] So let's
try to find the solutions

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:03.789
to this equation right over here.

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:06.459
We have the quantity two
X minus three squared,

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:08.990
and that is equal to four X minus six,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.383
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:10.383 --> 00:00:11.567
and give it a shot.

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:12.821
And I'll give you a little bit of a hint,

00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:14.469
you could do this in the traditional way

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.164
of expanding this out,

00:00:16.164 --> 00:00:20.019
and then turning it into kind
of a classic quadratic form,

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.280
but there might be a faster
or a simpler way to do this

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.927
if you really pay
attention to the structure

00:00:25.927 --> 00:00:28.982
of both sides of this equation.

00:00:30.218 --> 00:00:33.262
Well let's look at this, we
have two X minus three squared

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:34.328
on the left-hand side,

00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:37.253
on the right-hand side
we have four X minus six.

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:39.900
Well four X minus six,
that's just two times

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.250
two X minus three,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.258
let me be clear there,

00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:43.313
so this is the same thing

00:00:43.313 --> 00:00:48.259
as two X minus three squared is equal to,

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:50.395
four X minus six, if I factor out a two,

00:00:50.395 --> 00:00:54.714
that's two times two X minus three.

00:00:54.714 --> 00:00:55.921
And so this is really interesting,

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:58.150
we have something squared is equal

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.215
to two times that something.

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:03.444
So if we can solve for the something,

00:01:03.444 --> 00:01:04.837
let me be very clear here,

00:01:04.837 --> 00:01:07.879
so the stuff in blue squared

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:10.990
is equal to two times the stuff in blue.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.244
So if we can solve for what

00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:14.148
the stuff in blue could be equal to,

00:01:14.148 --> 00:01:15.611
then we could solve for X,

00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:17.074
and I'll show you that right now.

00:01:17.074 --> 00:01:19.953
So let's say, let's just
replace two X minus three,

00:01:19.953 --> 00:01:21.207
we'll do a little bit of a substitution,

00:01:21.207 --> 00:01:24.731
let's replace that with P.

00:01:24.731 --> 00:01:26.521
So let's say that P

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.734
is equal to two X minus three.

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:34.520
Well then this equation
simplifies quite nicely,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.746
the left-hand side becomes P squared,

00:01:38.746 --> 00:01:40.556
P squared is equal

00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:45.037
to two times P,

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:48.753
'cause once again two X minus three is P,

00:01:48.753 --> 00:01:50.930
two times P.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.577
And now we just have to solve for P.

00:01:53.577 --> 00:01:56.224
And I'll switch to just one color now.

00:01:56.224 --> 00:01:57.780
So we can write this as,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.194
if we subtract two P from both sides,

00:02:00.194 --> 00:02:04.095
we can get P squared minus two P

00:02:04.095 --> 00:02:06.301
is equal to zero,

00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:07.996
and we can factor out a P,

00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:11.897
so we get P times P minus two

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:13.731
is equal to zero.

00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:15.612
And we've seen this shown multiple times,

00:02:15.612 --> 00:02:18.096
if I have the product of two
things and they equal to zero,

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.348
at least one of them
needs to be equal to zero,

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:23.413
so either P is equal to zero,

00:02:23.413 --> 00:02:27.500
or P minus two is equal to zero.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.009
Well if P minus two is equal to zero,

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.401
then that means P is equal to two.

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.281
So either P equals zero,

00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:35.046
or P equals two.

00:02:35.046 --> 00:02:36.323
Well we're not quite done yet,

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:37.763
because we wanted to solve for X,

00:02:37.763 --> 00:02:38.924
and not for P.

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:41.013
But luckily we know that two X minus three

00:02:41.013 --> 00:02:42.499
is equal to P.

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.249
So now we could say either

00:02:46.242 --> 00:02:50.709
two X minus three is going
to be equal to this P value,

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.497
is going to be equal to zero,

00:02:52.497 --> 00:02:57.115
or two X minus three is going
to be equal to this P value,

00:02:57.115 --> 00:02:59.112
is going to be equal to two.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:01.155
And so this is pretty
straightforward to solve,

00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:02.455
add three to both sides,

00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:04.731
you get two X is equal to three.

00:03:04.731 --> 00:03:07.378
Divide both sides by two,

00:03:07.378 --> 00:03:10.954
and we get X is equal to 3/2,

00:03:10.954 --> 00:03:13.995
or over here if we add
three to both sides,

00:03:13.995 --> 00:03:16.874
we get two X is equal to five.

00:03:16.874 --> 00:03:18.964
Divide both sides by two,

00:03:18.964 --> 00:03:23.770
and you get X is equal to 5/2.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.673
So these are the possible solutions,

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.205
and this is pretty neat.

00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:29.280
This one right over here,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.295
you could almost do this in your head,

00:03:30.295 --> 00:03:32.292
it was nice and simple.

00:03:32.292 --> 00:03:34.382
Well if you were to expand this out,

00:03:34.382 --> 00:03:35.612
and then subtract this,

00:03:35.612 --> 00:03:37.934
it would have been a much more complex set

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:39.629
of operations that you would have done.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.672
You still would have hopefully
gotten to the right answer,

00:03:41.672 --> 00:03:42.926
but it would have just
taken a lot more steps.

00:03:42.926 --> 00:03:45.178
But here we could appreciate some patterns

00:03:45.178 --> 00:03:46.734
that we saw in our equations,

00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:49.079
and namely, we have
this thing being squared

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.774
and then we have two
times that same thing,

00:03:50.774 --> 00:03:52.528
two times two X minus three.
