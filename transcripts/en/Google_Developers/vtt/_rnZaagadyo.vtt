Almost every Flutter layout
uses rows and columns,

00:00:11.075 --> 00:00:12.517
and they're pretty cool.

00:00:12.517 --> 00:00:14.373
They can hug their children tightly

00:00:14.856 --> 00:00:16.926
or spread them out and relax.

00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:18.656
But what if you'd like
one of those children

00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:20.812
to stretch and fill the extra space?

00:00:21.096 --> 00:00:23.370
Just wrap it in an Expanded widget,

00:00:24.334 --> 00:00:25.833
and watch it grow.

00:00:26.434 --> 00:00:28.928
When a row or column
lays out its children,

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:30.992
it does the inflexible ones first.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.282
Then it divides the remaining space
among the flexible ones, like Expanded.

00:00:36.272 --> 00:00:38.272
You can even set a flex factor,

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:40.692
just in case of competition.

00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:44.082

and all the other Flutter widgets,
