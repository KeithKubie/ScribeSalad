for further change is so bad hmm well

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610

can't really be a contradiction i think

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000
can't really be a contradiction i think
 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.069
can't really be a contradiction i think
it's just that some physics started from

interesting to think about chemistry

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
interesting to think about chemistry
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.219
interesting to think about chemistry
because i think the chemist is really

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
because i think the chemist is really
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.770

bit different from many other people
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.120
bit different from many other people
because we do think in terms of this

by looking at the patterns in the

by looking at the patterns in the
 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.500
by looking at the patterns in the
spectrum and by analyzing them we can

gently come to a conclusion about the

gently come to a conclusion about the
 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.510
gently come to a conclusion about the
structure of the molecule soul of the

structure of the molecule soul of the

bond length of this length and and I
 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.560
bond length of this length and and I
understand the motion of these things

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570
understand the motion of these things
 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.840
understand the motion of these things
and then but in a sense it's a bit of an

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850
and then but in a sense it's a bit of an
 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.150
and then but in a sense it's a bit of an
abstract world and by looking at these

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160
abstract world and by looking at these
 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.490
abstract world and by looking at these
spectra and analyzing the data and

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500
spectra and analyzing the data and

determine the structure you use you sort

of forget that it's a quantum picture

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380
of forget that it's a quantum picture
 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.600
of forget that it's a quantum picture
and that you you think of it in terms of

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610
and that you you think of it in terms of
 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.870
and that you you think of it in terms of
a physical object but you know that it's

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880
a physical object but you know that it's
 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.880
a physical object but you know that it's
oscillating and it has these models so

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890
oscillating and it has these models so
 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.620
oscillating and it has these models so
somehow you are locked into a classical

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630
somehow you are locked into a classical
 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.880
somehow you are locked into a classical

picture of the molecular world which is
 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:56.949
picture of the molecular world which is
a little bit suspect I think because

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959
a little bit suspect I think because
 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.570
a little bit suspect I think because
that molecular picture doesn't tell you

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580
that molecular picture doesn't tell you
 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.660
that molecular picture doesn't tell you
anything but we know now quite a lot of

anything but we know now quite a lot of

anything but we know now quite a lot of
the ways in which we take that very

much of a conflict in my mind it's more

much of a conflict in my mind it's more

much of a conflict in my mind it's more
that we have a somewhat restricted

that we have a somewhat restricted

we need that as a framework to hang the

probably because they're doing to
 

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.380
probably because they're doing to
understand the questions and or maybe if

they do I don't know what the answer is

not so much a conflict between classical
and quantum mechanics but more important

much an answer to your question but it's

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560
much an answer to your question but it's
 

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.350

they do I don't know what the answer is
