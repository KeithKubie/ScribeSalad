[RUBIK'S CUBE TURNING]

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.840
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.030
- Hey Numberphile, my name is
Lucas and I'm a speed cuber.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.920
So I'm going to solve this
Rubik's Cube for you.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.125
- I'm Adam and I'm gonna
solve the Rubik's Cube.

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:20.045
- That was about 9.6 seconds.

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:22.446
Although we've got a
little bit left.

00:00:22.446 --> 00:00:26.600
- And then you're gonna time
it with this program.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.404
- Hi.

00:00:27.404 --> 00:00:30.070
This my Rubik's Cube, solving
it for Numberphile.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.530
Nicholas.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.570
- Hi, my name is Ethan Fenlan
and I'm a big fan of Brady

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.020
Haran's videos.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.880
- I love Numberphile.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.280
It's great.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.400
And I saw the first--

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.020
- --which include Numberphile
and Sixty Symbols.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.320
- Periodic Videos,
Numberphile.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.620
- Hi Numberphile.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.966
This is me.

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:55.110
- a lot of really cool science
channels, asked for videos of

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.591
people, fans of him, solving
Rubik's Cubes.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.380
- Today, Rubik's Cubes.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.940
Why?

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.500
Because Numberphile
asked for it.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.810
- And he was looking for someone
to solve a Rubik's

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.310
Cube.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.810
- Hi, my name is Glen.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.190
And this is my contribution
to [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.130
Numberphile video, which is
about Rubik's Cubes, I guess.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.840
- OK, I actually got
a pretty easy case.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.784
- Hey, this is a video prop.

00:01:21.784 --> 00:01:22.235
Ready?

00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:24.340
- Hello YouTube and
hello Brady.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.110
This is my Rubik's Cube
attempt to solve.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.760
- Hey Numberphile, I'm Owen.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.250
I'm 10 years old and I'm going
to be solving this complete

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.635
mess in front of me.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.580
- Hello Brady.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.860
You want it solved,
so here's mine.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.956
- Here we have a Rubik's Cube.

00:01:50.254 --> 00:01:52.296
- Well, there you go Brady.

00:01:52.296 --> 00:01:53.222
Hope that's alright for you.

00:01:53.222 --> 00:01:55.537
- A quick video for
Numberphile.

00:01:55.537 --> 00:01:58.985
- Hello Brady, this is
Mathmetical Brony here, and I

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.175
hope I'm not to late, but I want
to submit a video of me

00:02:01.175 --> 00:02:02.760
solving my Rubik's Cube.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.290
- What's up Numberphile?

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.380
You wanted a Rubik's Cube
solved, so here you go.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.590
- Usually I tend to hold it a
bit lower, but in this case,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.905
I'm just going to try to have it
on camera the entire time.

00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:16.220
- One of the YouTube channels I
follow, Numberphile, the guy

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.500
behind that, Brady, was asking
for videos of people solving

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.615
Rubik's Cubes.

00:02:20.615 --> 00:02:23.520
And I'm sure I've mentioned it
before, but I can solve one.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.200
Very slowly.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.840
- OK, and this took 24
seconds, point 76.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.590
And as you can see, the
cube is solved.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.398
[RUBIK'S CUBE TURNING]

00:02:39.398 --> 00:02:42.702
- Oh, I beat my record.

00:02:42.702 --> 00:02:44.930
- Well, maybe.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.610
46.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.180
- Lock up.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.551
[RUBIK'S CUBE TURNING]

00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:48.922
-No.

00:02:48.922 --> 00:02:51.705
- Well, there you go.

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:52.180
[RUBIK'S CUBE TURNING]

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.130
- That's it.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.505
Solved the Rubik's Cube.

00:02:55.505 --> 00:02:58.830
- And now it's all solved.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.180
So--

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.820
ah--

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.550
- Hey guys, this is just gonna
be a video of me solving the

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.750
Rubik's Cube for the Numberphile
channel.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.170
- In minutes.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.040
Hey, we did it.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.673
There's my best actually.

00:03:14.673 --> 00:03:16.085
Two minutes, 40 seconds.

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:16.804
Look at that.

00:03:16.804 --> 00:03:18.196
- Hello, it's Dan.

00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:21.550
And this is me solving the
Rubik's Cube for Periodic

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.395
Videos and Numberphile.

00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:24.420
- One time I was solving it-

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.600
- Hey Brady, my name's Albert.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.193
I saw that you were taking--

00:03:29.193 --> 00:03:29.682
[RUBIK'S CUBE TURNING]

00:03:29.682 --> 00:03:32.616
- And I got a time
of 11.47 seconds.

00:03:32.616 --> 00:03:35.061
- Yes!

00:03:35.061 --> 00:03:38.760
120, a new record.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.480
- So Brady, I hope that
helps, and everyone

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.130
else, thanks for watching.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.470
- And there we go.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.950
Brady, this is your solved
Rubik's Cube.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.566
All the best, and I hope
you'll be educating and

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:56.746
entertaining us for the
coming decades.

00:03:56.746 --> 00:03:57.590
Have a good one.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.160
And I hope

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.718
this helps - Done.

00:04:00.718 --> 00:04:05.638
I guess the only challenge
left is this.
