00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.290
- [Instructor] Let's say
that we are told that 495

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.213
is equal to 621 minus blank.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.340
What would blank be?

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.680
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.490
Okay, now let's do this together,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.660
and one technique is to try

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.280
to visualize this on a number line.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.210
495 is what you get when you
subtract something from 621,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.820
so let me put those two
numbers on a number line.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.230
So, let me do the number line like this.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.150
So we're gonna start at
621, and subtract blank,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.420
to get to 495.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.420
So if this is 621, we're
going to subtract some amount

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.810
to get to 495.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.907
So let's say this right over here is 495.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.150
Now, what amount did we subtract?

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.720
So here we are subtracting blank,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.430
that's my blank over there,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.310
and so we need to figure out what that is.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.310
So how do you go from 621 to 495?

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.290
Well, one way that my brain does it,

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.440
first, we can subtract 21 to get to 600.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.340
So let me do minus 21,
would get us to 600.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.970
Then, we could subtract
another 100 to get to 500.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.470
So then we could subtract
another 100, so minus 100,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.670
to get us to 500.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.010
And then, to go from 500 to 495,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.520
we would subtract another five.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.550
So to go from 621 to 495, and I picked

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.320
these numbers intentionally, I picked 21

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.627
to subtract to get to 600,
I picked 100 to get to 500,

00:01:39.627 --> 00:01:42.460
and then I picked five to get 495,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.040
I subtracted a total of
21, then I subtract 100,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.140
then I subtracted five.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.140
So I subtracted 100, I subtracted
21, and I subtracted five,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.160
and so, how much did I subtract in total?

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.130
So let me put it this way,
this is the same thing

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.420
as 621 minus these things,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.810
that's equal to 495.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.860
So in total, let's see, if I
subtract 21 and I subtract five

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.310
that is subtracting 26,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.360
and so I subtract 126.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.373
So I subtracted a total of 126.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.927
So 495 is equal to 621 minus 126.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.020
Let's do another example.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.200
Let's say we wanna figure out,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.200
if someone tells us blank minus 435

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.380
is equal to 210, what is
blank in this situation?

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.000
Well, this is a little bit different now,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.450
because now, we're not
trying to figure out

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.230
what to subtract from the larger number,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.360
in this situation, we're trying

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.620
to figure out the larger number.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.810
The larger number minus
something is equal to 210.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.010
But as always, it's useful to
draw this on a number line,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.040
just to make sure we're
thinking about things

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.560
in a reasonable way.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.470
So we're going to start
at blank, take out 435,

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.470
and then we're going to get to 210.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.540
So we're starting here, maybe I'll put

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.760
a question mark there
so we know that point,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.760
we're starting there,
we are subtracting 435,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.010
so that's minus 435,

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.520
and we are getting to 210.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.350
So, to figure out blank, we
could go the other way around.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.290
We could start at 210, and then just add,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.173
and then just add 435.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.587
So, what's 210 plus 435?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.280
Well, there's many ways of doing it,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.440
but I encourage you to pause this video

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.660
and see if you can work that out.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.310
Well, one way to do it
is, first we can add 400,

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.460
and I'll do this in another color,

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.750
just for a little bit of variety.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.233
So, first I'll add 400.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.520
So, if I add 400 plus 400,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.890
that would get us, let's see,

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.070
if you add four hundreds to that,

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.563
that would get you to 610.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.540
And then, if I add 30 to that,

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.850
so if I add plus 30, and
I haven't drawn it exact,

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.040
but this is just to help
us think about things,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.290
that's three more 10s,
and I already have one 10,

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.710
so 10 plus 30 is 40,
so that gets us to 640,

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.860
and then I'm going to add the five.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.483
So this right over here, if
I add five to it, is 645.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.490
So there you have it.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.490
645 minus 435 is equal to 210.
