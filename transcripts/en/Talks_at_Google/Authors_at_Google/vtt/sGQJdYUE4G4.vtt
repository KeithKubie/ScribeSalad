00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:05.809
&gt;&gt;(Cliff): Good morning everyone. Figured
we'd do a morning talk today before our inboxes

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:11.540
get out of control so glad that you're able
to join us this early. The Authors at Google

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.270
program is proud to host Jonathan Spira today.
He's going to discuss an issue very near and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.830
dear to us, that of information overload.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.460
Google's mission is of course is to organize
the world's information, but what many of

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.780
the public doesn't understand is that we're
also there to make it universally accessible

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.380
and useful. So we're in a constant battle
against information overload; whether it's

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.829
the relevance of our search results, the use
of priority inbox in Gmail, or recent innovations

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.290
like the Google+ Circles as a way of sharing
information among friends.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.059
So Jonathan Spira today speaks to us about
that in his new book about information overload.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.530
He is the CEO and Chief Analyst of Basics
which is a thought leader in the world of

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.240
information overload and his interests also
extend to photography as well. He co-wrote

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.759
a very influential book about the history
of photography.

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.579
Since this book is about information overload
I'll stop my introduction here.

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.779
Please join me in welcoming Jonathan to Google.

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:17.779
[applause]

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:23.240
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: Thank you, thank you very
much Cliff. Good morning everyone both here

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.259
and in virtual. I'd like to first thank Cliff
very much for inviting me to this.

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.069
This is a topic near and dear to my heart
as I know too many people at Google and many

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:42.609
people who use Google tools. We think of information
it's kind of too much of a good thing.

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.920
But first, before we start, and both for everyone
here in the room and everyone watching virtually,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.039
how many of you here have Smartphones with
you?

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.340
[pause]

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.959
Everyone almost, no, really? Do you ever use
a Smartphone? Okay cool, that's great. A lot

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.689
of people are tethered to them. Can you just
take them out and show me, I'll hold mine

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.009
up too, if you don't mind and if you're in
virtual land just do the same with us please.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.329
Sort of like the old TV shows where you used
to connect the dots on the TV screen or something.

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.310
Could you turn them off by the way?

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.310
[laughter]

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.569
Ah, [chuckles] while you have them out just
press that off button. Ah, I do that not because

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.969
I don't want you to get any email or pay attention
to that at all, more it's a question just

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.810
to sort of point out the separation anxiety.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.760
When I do that in large physical crowds of
people, when a lot of people are not attending

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.230
virtually, if you saw the look of horror on
some people's faces, especially in like really

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:46.030
uptight business circles, they're like, "What?
You want me to turn this off? To disconnect?"

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.260
The fact that we can disconnect, the fact
that some people don't even have Smartphones

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.030
is very refreshing to me. I actually don't
get too much information over my Smartphone,

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.370
in the interest of disclosure I try and keep
that to a minimum.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.489
But it's interesting when we think of information
one of the earliest ways we kept information

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.780
was on the tablet and it's just kind of ironic
that things haven't really changed very much

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.379
in terms of our use of tablets. I can't figure
it out but we just keep using tablets for

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.379
information.

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.400
Before I really get in to this though, I did
bring a few friends of mine along to talk

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.489
about the problem of information overload.
So if you can listen to them for just a moment

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.489
I'd appreciate it.

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.120
&gt;&gt;Larry Bowen: Information overload basically
slows me down because I'm interacting with

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.580
information that's irrelevant, out of context.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.489
&gt;&gt;Peter Miles: [inaudible] the reality today
is that it comes at you at such a high volume

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:42.530
you have to learn very quickly how to prioritize
that information and filter out what's useful

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.790
and what's not useful.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.379
&gt;&gt;Max Christoff: I feel my pulse quickening
I'm so engrossed in trying to deal with the

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.109
emails that are coming in, the instant messages
that are popping up on the screen, the phone

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:02.129
calls coming in simultaneously. It's not a
good feeling.

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.310
&gt;&gt;Matt Brezina: Sometimes it gets a little
frustrating. If I don't check it I almost

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.120
feel like something's missing in my life.
If I'm sitting with no TV on, no iPhone in

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.439
my hand, and no computer in front of me I
kind of feel lonely.

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.189
&gt;&gt;Andy Chew: There's no question that the
amount of information I receive makes it harder

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:15.650
for me to prioritize.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.280
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: Well, as you can see a lot
of these people are completely broken up about

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.210
the problem. So I never saw that happen before
but.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.530
I wanna cover a couple of things and I also
want to invite you to ask any questions as

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.099
we go along. I am imminently interruptible,
I don't mind interruptions, in fact I'd love

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:39.560
to hear questions so we are sort of contextual
in where ever I am. Just stop me please, if

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.830
I don't see you just jump up a little warn
and stop me.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.750
I'm gonna cover some changes in how we work,
how we look at information overload, what

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.920
it is, and what we can do.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.840
One of the problems that I noticed, and just
by background, I've been researching the problem

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.819
of information overload indirectly for over
20 years; I've been studying how people work,

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:06.250
how people collaborate, share information,
what people do with information, and you won't

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.660
be surprised to know that there's problems,
there's things that get in the way.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:17.110
And ultimately after studying and interviewing
people and watching how people work we found

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.340
that information overload, and this goes back
15 years, was a significant problem. At the

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:30.069
time, however, everyone was so giddy about
the fact that we had email. It was just so

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:35.440
easy to cc a couple of thousand extra colleagues.
It was just so easy to share content and push

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.220
it out to so many people that it really didn't
matter. Nobody thought it was a significant

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.430
problem. People actually thought I was kind
of nuts for bringing it up because, "Oh no,

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.849
don't be silly. Just go back to your corner
do some more research. We have email. It's

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:55.789
great, it's amazing, we can email the world."
The ramifications of adding a few thousand

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.050
extra people just weren't clear to them.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.300
And the way we view the workplace, a lot of
people still have this sort of romantic and

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.780
somewhat black and white notion of what the
workplace and what the workforce really is.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:15.740
If you go back at the turn of the last century
90% of the workforce was manual and largely

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.370
agrarian in nature. That's a huge change from
today where plurality of the workforce is

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:26.520
comprised of knowledge workers, such as ourselves.
Today, in fact, you have to really look for

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.259
a manual workforce and it's about 20%. Yes?

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.110
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Sorry is that in U.S. or is that
international?

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.259
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: These figures, almost all
the figures I will cite today are U.S. If

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:42.520
I go out of a U.S. figure I will explicitly
identify it as non-U.S. or worldwide or AMIA.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.729
But thank you for mentioning that yes. As
of right now, I mean there's just so much

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:52.930
stuff we had in the U.S. that I tend to stay
with that and a lot of the data we need which

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.800
I'll get into a little later, like Bureau
of Labor Statistics and Census just isn't

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.909
as easily available worldwide.

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:04.580
Today as I mentioned knowledge workers are
the plurality of the workforce and that's

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.229
even the start contrast to 25 years ago where
a majority of the workforce was comprised

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:15.069
of industrial workers. And we saw the rise
of information workers and information professionals,

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:20.870
and this was foreshadowed in the cinema. One
of my favorite movies relating to this I don't

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.470
know, how many people here are familiar with
the movie Desk Set?

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.490
[pause]

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:32.509
Okay, 2%, no. [laughs] Spencer Tracy, Katherine
Hepburn, and the movie if you haven't seen

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:37.850
it, it's actually very relevant to what I'm
presuming most of us do. Spencer Tracy is

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:44.210
a computer salesman for a very large technology
company and he is selling and installing,

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.159
it's amazing he can do everything in this
film; he's selling and installing a large

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:55.740
mainframe. You remember those, that will run
a television network where Katherine Hepburn

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.909
who, just to show you it was 1950's, she was
the chief librarian and her name was Bunny.

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:05.960
You wouldn't quite see that happening in film
today; it's kinda, just wouldn't go over as

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.960
well.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.280
But anyway and they end up with a challenge
and the challenge, and I think this is particularly

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:17.580
relevant at Google, is to answer a question.
Now if you think about it today we still go

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:23.009
to a search box, we type in a search query,
we get search results, sometimes depending

00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:27.689
on how well we do it, and most people don't
know really how to use the tools, you get

00:08:27.689 --> 00:08:32.970
564,768 results, that's probably a typical
number although I'm sure you guys could tell

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.030
me a more typical average number.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:42.010
And the question that they posed, the challenge
question as they say on some shows in television

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:48.810
today, was what kind of car did the King of
the Watusis drive? It's not gonna give away

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:53.430
anything in the movie to say that the mainframe
didn't do terribly well in answering this

00:08:53.430 --> 00:09:00.110
and of course Bunny and her team of librarians
did. I promise that was not a spoiler.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:05.200
But it's interesting today if you go to Google
or any other tool and you just ask the same

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.330
question you're not gonna get an answer but
you'll get referred back to the movie.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.330
[laughter]

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:14.900
[laughs] So you still don't know that he drove
a specially designed Pontiac, for those of

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:20.250
you who remember the late, lamented Pontiac
brand. I've always found that's a very interesting

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.250
example.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:28.500
Now going back to how we work, as you can
see the figure that's going up, that is abstract

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:34.410
tasks. Routine tasks you can see are heading
down and declining and manual tasks which

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:39.180
declined dramatically through 1990 seem to
have plateaued and continue at that sort of

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:44.540
low level. So there's a tremendous amount
of change in just the way we look at jobs

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.540
and tasks.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.090
I mentioned already that knowledge workers
comprise a plurality of the workforce. One

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.560
of the things we found out when we surveyed
Global 2000 companies, again this probably

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:58.390
won't be surprising to you, is that 80% of
the companies we talked to in pretty much

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.680
all the Global 2000 were simply not prepared
for the types of changes we're talking about.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.750
Now what do I mean by not prepared? It's not
as if they're not using technology, they most

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.920
certainly are using technology, but they're
using a lot of technology, something I refer

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.950
to as technology sprawl which is kind of like
urban sprawl. And they have so much technology

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.260
[coughs] that they simply get in trouble because
they don't really know which system they're

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.440
using when and for what and so on.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:30.340
So you end up with a lot of fun things happening
like somebody uses one content management

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.120
system to create something and then of course
we say, "Don't use Google for search," they

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:40.330
can't find stuff. And then somebody else recreates
the entire project because they couldn't find

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.830
it and they didn't know it was in the content
management system number 33.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:52.440
I know content management is not a main thing
at Google but if you had a group of a thousand

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.880
employees, how many content management systems
do you think would be reasonable for this

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.460
like small group of a thousand employees?
What's a reasonable number?

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.460
[pause]

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.460
Anyone?

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.460
&gt;&gt;Male #1: One.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:09.200
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: One, yeah one would be actually
what I would think of, yeah one. How 'bout

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.200
97? [chuckles]

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.670
We were talking to a group at a, I'll just
say a large semiconductor company, and we

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:21.250
were helping them with, we were incorporating
some of their stuff into our research and

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:27.000
we happened to do a little inventory and they
were as shocked as I was, 97. That's a lot.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.580
It's like for every 100 employees we basically
have a content management platform. Just can't

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.940
imagine how they find things.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:39.860
So today especially with the change in where
we work and the type of work we do, with 40%

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:44.790
of the workforce working regularly, meaning
two or more times a week in non-traditional,

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.750
non-diverting environments, there's a lot
of change underfoot.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:54.760
And we have the rise of the knowledge worker,
the knowledge worker, us again. I just wanna

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.020
throw out a definition from the book. The
easy definition is what a knowledge worker

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.870
is. I just say a knowledge worker is a participant
in the knowledge economy.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:07.020
Then of course I have to define the knowledge
economy which is an economic environment where

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:12.520
information and its manipulation are the commodity.
And that's really dramatic contrast to the

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.240
industrial economy where you have raw goods.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:20.380
Now, keep in mind at the end of the day a
lot of companies still build refrigerators,

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:26.780
automobiles, washing machines, and so on.
They build things, but the amount of information

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:32.070
intensive work that even goes into the creation
of these things and also into the manufacture,

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.070
think of robotics.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:38.020
I don't know if anyone has toured a car factory
recently? if you go do the BMW tour either

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:44.170
at Munich or Spartanburg, or Leipzig you see
all these robots which in German they say,

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.580
"roborts" and people get confused about the
Roberts who are doing all the work here --

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.900
[laughter]

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:53.370
and they're doing all this stuff, it's like
a ballet carefully choreographed. So they

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.290
have to be controlled and managed so the people
on the floor who are managing them are knowledge

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.720
workers as well.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:05.110
Knowledge workers, as you here at Google know,
we own our means of production. If we leave

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:11.430
and we don't come back the next day or check
in the next day or the next week we've taken

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.981
our means of production with us and with that
a lot of valuable information. A lot of our

00:13:15.981 --> 00:13:21.000
knowledge work isn't tied to a specific location,
that's the beauty of the whole thing especially

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.970
when you have a beautiful campus like you
do, you can work almost anywhere.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:31.420
And knowledge workers, especially people coming
into the workforce now have very, very different

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.541
and widely diverging expectations about how
to work.

00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:38.200
And here's some typical knowledge workers
throughout the ages. It was very hard to get

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.590
the picture of the early knowledge workers
I should just add because they were not commonly

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.890
referred to as knowledge workers at the time
of course.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:50.080
So what do knowledge workers do? Number one,
not a big surprise, they search. People are

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.250
constantly searching for things, most of the
time as we know they don't find things. There's

00:13:54.250 --> 00:14:00.840
an oft cited stat that 50% of all searches
fail. I'd be interested actually to hear any

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.350
thoughts from the Google point of view in
general because this is a very, very, general,

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:09.810
overall statistic relating to corporate search
and all sorts of search.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:21.000
But we found that 50% of the searches people
think succeeded actually failed and they don't

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.500
realize it. So what happens is they use the
result, the answer, again this is somewhat

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.710
problematic and I'm hoping that someone here,
I'm sure people are working on more natural

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:36.050
language search 'cause we like to actually
get into a question and actually get an answer

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:43.990
or several answer type of environment ultimately
to move away from 564,000 search results.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:49.290
But if you use stuff that comes out of the
search where it's not the right thing, it's

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.760
not the best information and you don't realize
it's the old thing or of course the fact that

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.310
any clever 14 year old can create his own
website and it's really sometimes hard to

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:04.290
tell the difference between that and a well
establish site, you may end up using the wrong

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.290
information.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.400
Now people, knowledge workers, spend a lot
of time creating, a lot of time as I mentioned

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:14.520
before recreating when you can't find stuff
because somebody put the very important document

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.440
in content management system 33 and you didn't
know that 33 existed, you didn't even know

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.920
your organization had 97 content management
systems. [chuckles] Just thinking about that

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.940
number is just mind boggling. You recreate
it.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:33.070
Now recreating can be actually a very time
intensive thing because you form a team or

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:37.930
an ad hoc team, people spend lots of time
reinventing the wheel and doing what somebody

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:43.120
six months ago or three months ago already
did and never the twain shall meet. We spend

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.080
a lot of time communicating and we spend a
lot of time sharing information networking.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:55.460
Now this is a chart with our stats that ran
in the Times about two years ago and it's

00:15:55.460 --> 00:16:00.800
been updated since but I'm showing you this
not because it's old and obsolete because

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:07.170
one key number changed dramatically, the last
figure. Knowledge workers by and large think

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:11.250
for a living; we reflect, we think, that's
what I think we're supposed to be doing.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:16.530
According to the stats we came up with a few
years ago we found that by the end of the

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:23.820
day after everything that's spent in the day
we have 12% left. Well I'm sorry to say I

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:31.390
was wrong; 12 percent was wildly optimistic.
When we redid the study and we used a larger

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:36.981
group and we refined our questions we found
out that at the end of the day 5% of the day

00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:39.791
is left for thought reflection. Now that's
not very much.

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:46.530
Now if I recall correctly Google has a certain
percentage of time you can use for special

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:54.080
projects and things, am I getting that correct?
So that of course can be used for the thought

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:59.590
and reflection on whatever your current project
or special project might be. But if you don't

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:04.050
have that, if you only have 5% of your day
by the time you're just so oppressed by everything

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:07.740
else, well it doesn't really matter anymore.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:13.240
So managing knowledge, knowledge worker, and
all that, those are huge challenges. I'm gonna

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.750
skip a drop about productivity for a minute
and go straight into information overload.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:23.470
Now my book "Overload: How Too Much Information
Is Hazardous To Your Organization" is the

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.889
culmination of research as I mentioned that
I've been doing for the past 15 years. I'd

00:17:27.889 --> 00:17:32.100
also like before I say anything else about
the book to mention that the book actually

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:37.990
does not end on the last page by design. We
created a website overloadstories.com to continue

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:43.920
the book and allow knowledge workers to put
their own stories about information overload.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.610
Now there are probably about 40 or 50 stories
already in the book from people about their

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:55.970
travails with information overload but we
put the site up so that I can continue to

00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:03.059
post new research and new ideas and as well
we can have readers, or potential readers,

00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:08.340
or friends, or whoever put their own stories
and talk about either how they solved a problem

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:13.830
relative to information overload or in some
cases if you go there as you'll see, how information

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:19.870
overload is well killing them and just stopping
them from being able to finishing their work.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:24.679
So I have a little definition for overload;
I just say its information overload there's

00:18:24.679 --> 00:18:28.929
too much of a good thing because information
is good; too much information can just be

00:18:28.929 --> 00:18:35.639
oppressive. But essentially it's an excess
of information that has some pretty dramatic

00:18:35.639 --> 00:18:40.620
impact on how we work: it stops us from being
able to sometimes make decisions; it stops

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.259
us from processing information; and it stops
us from prioritizing tasks; it results in

00:18:45.259 --> 00:18:47.990
incapacitation many times; it's a challenge.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:53.600
Look at the causes of information overload
for a moment. We've dramatically, both in

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:59.629
terms of human and machine content creation,
we've increased our ability to generate content.

00:18:59.629 --> 00:19:06.059
We've increased the number of modalities that
we have available for content to hit us, but

00:19:06.059 --> 00:19:11.020
also to create the content. There's of course
email overload which is something that seems

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:15.950
to be the poster child for many people for
information overload, although in many cases,

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:21.669
probably more than 50%, email overload is
not the key problem for information overload,

00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:25.059
it just seems to be something that's the low
hanging fruit.

00:19:25.059 --> 00:19:33.549
Interruptions, interruptions in general when
I say that I'm referring to the way we have

00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:38.720
set up our technology that allows us to have
it interrupt us whether it's incoming email

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.330
alerts, instant messages, phone calls, and
other things that are inopportune.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:47.779
There is of course the fact that we have ubiquitous
connectivity which we generally think of as

00:19:47.779 --> 00:19:51.830
a good thing but sometimes it would be nice
to go away to a mountain where there is nothing.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:56.179
And there's lots of contradictory information
out there which weeding through it makes it

00:19:56.179 --> 00:20:00.379
very difficult and hopefully again that people
here at Google are working on solving that

00:20:00.379 --> 00:20:01.379
problem.

00:20:01.379 --> 00:20:06.929
So I'm not gonna go into too much depth on
this because I'm sure you know and feel this,

00:20:06.929 --> 00:20:17.210
but email is again poster child and many times
a huge challenge for all of us. We have too

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:22.700
much email and people tend to abuse it. I'll
get into some stats in a few minutes about

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.749
what happens when you do abuse it.

00:20:24.749 --> 00:20:29.070
Search, I'm not even gonna go down that road,
I think you could educate me much better than

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.309
I can educate you.

00:20:31.309 --> 00:20:34.990
Schedule, a meeting overload, I'm sure there's
some empathy here for that.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:41.070
Unnecessary interruptions: we found that in
some cases as much as 28% of the knowledge

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.690
workers' day is consumed by these. One of
the most interesting things that came up I

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:50.499
researched though and this is why interruptions
tend to be something I come back to frequently

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:54.309
is the fact that interruptions don't occur
in isolation.

00:20:54.309 --> 00:20:59.500
Interruptions come with a penalty. I found
this about seven or eight years ago and I

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.919
named it Recovery Time. Recovery Time is the
time it takes you to get back to where you

00:21:02.919 --> 00:21:08.730
were before you had the interruption. Now
the amount of recovery time is significant;

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:14.330
it's 10 to 20 times the amount of the interruption
in general. So that means I could interrupt

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:19.789
you or something or someone or some technology
could interrupt you, break your thought, which

00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:26.250
really is a distraction, even if it's only
30 seconds, it'll take five minutes for you

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.490
to get back to where you were.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:31.830
Now you don't feel this, you don't sit back
and say, "Oh well, I had my interruption now,

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.419
okay recovery time's starting, good, okay,
yes." Now that's not really how it works;

00:21:36.419 --> 00:21:40.919
it's very insidious, you don't feel it. In
the book I refer to it as "death by a thousand

00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:46.410
paper cuts." Now, I think that's just how
you feel at the end of the day, that you've

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.299
just been cut away.

00:21:49.299 --> 00:21:54.830
And actually I'm just realizing this slide
is out of date, there's 78.6 million knowledge

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:58.659
workers in the U.S., so I guess I have to
update my own slide.

00:21:58.659 --> 00:22:02.799
Another thing that really, really contributes
to information overload is our view of how

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:06.999
things are urgent and important. It seems
that everything everyone does today is both

00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:10.460
urgent and important at the same time. Now
that's a deadly combination.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:15.299
When you have somebody sending you an email
and that person believes that what he is doing

00:22:15.299 --> 00:22:19.639
is much more important than what you're doing,
it's urgent, important, he doesn't hesitate

00:22:19.639 --> 00:22:24.549
to contact you two minutes after sending an
email saying, I see people smiling at this

00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:27.490
one, "Did you get my email?" Or you get a
text or phone call, maybe both.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:32.179
Now a lot of that, and that's not to blame
any particular generation or anything, but

00:22:32.179 --> 00:22:36.400
I've noticed a trend that younger generation
coming into the workforce tend to feel more

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:44.629
entitled and we have a society that since
1973 has been steeped in instant gratification.

00:22:44.629 --> 00:22:49.620
Anyone wanna take a guess what happened in
1973 that dramatically changed the landscape

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.509
for all of us, when you absolutely, positively
had to get something somewhere overnight?

00:22:54.509 --> 00:23:00.679
Just, okay, big clue a few people recognize.
Yes. Fred Smith created FedEx. Before 1973,

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:04.320
if you wanted something absolutely, positively
overnight well you had to drive it there.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.789
Now today, think about it, you order something
and if it's not on your desk by 10:30 the

00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:11.090
next morning you're on the Web checking where
the truck is.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.090
[laughter]

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:16.549
We get a little bit obsessive, I mean okay,
"Wait he's turning left, he'll be here now."

00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:18.590
It's a little bit obsessive.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:25.730
And we take this attitude and we bring it
into our expectations and how we work. Again,

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:31.259
especially if you think about in the last
15 years a lot of people have been brought

00:23:31.259 --> 00:23:37.539
up with the, "You are very special Mister
Rogers," kind of attitude. You get awards

00:23:37.539 --> 00:23:42.769
for your teen coming in last or even behind
last if there's such a thing. So you understand

00:23:42.769 --> 00:23:47.740
why a lot of people just don't really put
this into perspective and they just don't

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:52.049
understand that you're doing something important
to you and they have to balance this.

00:23:52.049 --> 00:23:56.490
There was a very, very good article in CIO
Magazine two years ago where a 21 year old

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:03.399
intern wrote something along the lines of,
"don't give me your tired, old apps and applications.

00:24:03.399 --> 00:24:09.049
I want new, exciting, streamlined apps. If
you don't give them to me I'll leave and find

00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:10.350
another company that does."

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:15.559
Now, first I don't think she has any clue
that in a large company it takes more than

00:24:15.559 --> 00:24:22.529
a minute or two to change over your implementation
of whatever it is you have, maybe four or

00:24:22.529 --> 00:24:28.049
five years for an SAP implementation, who
knows. But second, I don't think she had any

00:24:28.049 --> 00:24:33.669
idea of what the unemployment rate for people
21 out of college might be. [laughs] I think

00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:38.259
it's like 35-40%. So if she's gonna leave
she's not gonna get enterprise apps she's

00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:41.960
gonna just get well unemployment.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.590
But that really is a perspective that people
bring to this and it's something that I don't

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:52.169
think it's anyone's fault, I think it's just
a question of we have to be able to understand

00:24:52.169 --> 00:24:57.010
this is why people burst in and interrupt
us because what I'm doing just isn't really

00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:01.059
important and what the other person is doing
in that person's mind is.

00:25:01.059 --> 00:25:05.649
So I mentioned technology-based interruptions
as well I'm just not gonna relate to them

00:25:05.649 --> 00:25:06.649
too much of that.

00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:10.389
Cognitive overload: at the end of the day
we're just feeling it. I mean there's just

00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:17.730
so much out there and we just feel our brains
shutting down; same thing for tasks.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:23.020
I wanted to show you this chart. I actually
made it five years ago and since the chart

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.850
is off the chart already I didn't really feel
the need to update it, but you can just see

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:33.980
if you go historically from the original tablet
to the point of the current tablet technology

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:41.419
how much relatively speaking our pace of information
creation, which I wrote the pace of information

00:25:41.419 --> 00:25:48.179
overload, has just dramatically increased.
When you think of the fact that we have better

00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:55.649
tools, but not necessarily tools that can
really address that type of geometric proportional

00:25:55.649 --> 00:25:58.159
increase, it's scary.

00:25:58.159 --> 00:26:01.850
Oft quoted, that's why I don't attribute this
to anyone, "More information has been produced

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:07.269
in the last 25 years than in the past five
centuries." But it's not a new problem. In

00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:14.169
1545, Konrad Gesner warned of "a confusing
and harmful abundance of books." He wasn't

00:26:14.169 --> 00:26:20.289
alone because in 1685, Adrian Baillet had
"fear of the multitude of books which grows

00:26:20.289 --> 00:26:22.570
in a prodigious fashion every day."

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:27.820
Now, the cost of all this? We figure that
information overload costs the U.S. economy

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:35.309
$997 billion in 2010, and I'm probably being
conservative. I hate to say it but I'm probably

00:26:35.309 --> 00:26:37.460
being conservative.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.590
I know I've been going at a fast pace I just
wanna stop and make sure if there are any

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.580
questions that address anything?

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.710
Okay.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:49.130
One computer, yea.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:27:00.549
I wanted to mention how much reading 100 email
messages can take away from someone's day.

00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:04.999
When we've surveyed people and studied over
their shoulder how they work, by the time,

00:27:04.999 --> 00:27:10.309
on average, and this was I think we studied
100 people and again when you're doing this

00:27:10.309 --> 00:27:15.789
type of work you can't, no one has the resources
to watch thousands and tens of thousands of

00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:18.320
people, but we think it's a representative
grouping.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:24.320
You can spend a half a day on 100 emails and
the typical amount I believe we calculated

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:30.580
the average amount of incoming email is 93,
so we're pretty close to what people get.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:36.610
This is what information overload does do
to us: it lowers productivity; it lowers our

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.820
ability to comprehend things; it lowers our
concentration level.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:45.059
I wanted to mention an interesting study by
a Swiss novelist, Rolf Dobelli, who maybe

00:27:45.059 --> 00:27:49.559
Cliff can get him in to speak at some point
if Rolf is here I think he'd really do well

00:27:49.559 --> 00:28:00.029
we well. Rolf wrote a white paper on how our
news addiction dulls our brain. Now before

00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:06.080
I read Rolf, and I read Rolf's treatise in
April, I had actually cut back on my news.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:13.549
I'll admit it I was a news junkie. I was addicted
to all sorts of news around the world: political,

00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:18.649
international, just everything. I could read
lots of newspapers on the Web or on the tablet.

00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:24.389
I could absorb all this and I didn't realize
what all this crack was doing to me.

00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:28.830
And I decided to take a news holiday around
February because I was traveling a lot and

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:34.489
I just said, "I just can't deal with this,"
and I found that my ability to absorb more

00:28:34.489 --> 00:28:40.860
lengthy, intense, deeper information improved.
I found myself more relaxed as well; I also

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.760
found I wasn't reaching for the tablets, "I
need that news."

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:51.190
And then in April a colleague found this white
paper that Dobelli wrote and he demonstrated

00:28:51.190 --> 00:29:01.309
fairly scientifically how too much news simply
removes our ability greatly to digest deeper

00:29:01.309 --> 00:29:06.309
tracts. And that's a huge challenge. If you
think about it, all these tiny sound bites

00:29:06.309 --> 00:29:09.429
are just chipping away at our ability to comprehend
things.

00:29:09.429 --> 00:29:18.029
So it's really a huge challenge for everyone,
but if we understand it we can do a lot to

00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:23.340
try and mitigate the problem and address it.
That's one of the reasons I wrote the book

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:28.809
was because I felt that if we raise awareness
about the problem and we get a dialog going,

00:29:28.809 --> 00:29:33.129
and we actually put out what the costs are
both in terms of the human toll as well as

00:29:33.129 --> 00:29:36.429
the financial and emotional toll, maybe people
will do things about it.

00:29:36.429 --> 00:29:44.330
For every 100 people who might be unnecessarily
copied on an email, thanks to the phenomena

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:49.279
of recovery time which I mentioned earlier,
we lose approximately eight hours of time.

00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:54.159
Think of how many times you get an email where
there might be 50 or 100 people who really,

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:58.590
really didn't have to be on that email and
just imagine every time somebody replies and

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:03.549
we're all polite we write, "Great, thanks,"
and we hit reply to all just to make sure

00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:09.210
that everybody sees how polite we are. And
each one starts this little cycle of this

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:15.252
recovery time, interruption, and your brain
stops and your flow stops and after all that

00:30:15.252 --> 00:30:17.179
it's really easy to see where this goes.

00:30:17.179 --> 00:30:22.489
In research we did at the end of 2010, 66%
of knowledge workers told us that they don't

00:30:22.489 --> 00:30:26.279
have time in the day to get all of their work
done. That's not a surprise but this one is.

00:30:26.279 --> 00:30:31.399
Ninety-four percent of the same group told
us that at some point in the day they typically

00:30:31.399 --> 00:30:41.379
feel incapacitated and overwhelmed by information.
That 94%, that means 6% are taking a day off?

00:30:41.379 --> 00:30:44.370
I mean I'm not quite sure what happened to
the 6%.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:50.559
I wanted to discuss what a few companies are
doing. In particular I wanna use two examples

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:55.470
here: one, how many people here heard about
on Nielsen's Reply-to-All Experiment about

00:30:55.470 --> 00:31:01.630
a year and half ago? On their Outlook client
they removed the reply to all button, they

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:07.539
didn't remove the functionality however. So
the first round of emails had to do with,

00:31:07.539 --> 00:31:13.030
"Hey, they've taken away our reply-to-all."
The second had to do with, "Here's the keystrokes

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:15.070
you use to actually get reply-to-all."

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:19.789
Now just imagine how much time that wasted
and then the bad press picked it up and it

00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:25.500
was just a fiasco because what they really
should have done, at least from my perception

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:29.609
and use a new UI design, is they should have
just separated the buttons if they were really

00:31:29.609 --> 00:31:33.619
worried because make the knowledge worker,
make the user make a conscious thought, "Do

00:31:33.619 --> 00:31:37.090
I wanna hit reply-to-all all the way on the
right or do I wanna just hit replay on the

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:41.080
left." That would have been my easy example
of what to do. I'm sure there are other things

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:46.600
that we could come up with as well, especially
if you are ccing a lot of people a little

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:51.721
warning box comes up and says, "Oh did you
really wanna cc 2,468 people? You're sure

00:31:51.721 --> 00:31:54.320
about that?" Things like that.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.390
On the other hand, I got a wonderful example
from the U.S. Air Force from a CIO there,

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:05.179
Peter Marksteiner, about a really great technique
he uses because a lot of people don't read,

00:32:05.179 --> 00:32:08.999
no surprise I'm sure, most of the text of
an email.

00:32:08.999 --> 00:32:14.750
We found that people on average make it through
the second paragraph barely. So if you have

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:18.360
the really important stuff in the third paragraph
or the fourth paragraph, how many times do

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:23.549
you send an email and the person is asking
you a question about what's in the fourth

00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:27.109
paragraph? It's already been covered so you
have emails back and forth and back and forth

00:32:27.109 --> 00:32:30.730
and it's like you have to answer the question
but it was originally there.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:35.779
So what Colonel Marksteiner does and the great
thing about being in the military is that

00:32:35.779 --> 00:32:41.230
he can actually order people to do this. It's
not like you have a real choice like, "you

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:45.840
will do this." He used this system which he
didn't invent but he discovered called BLUF.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:51.480
If I had a chalkboard here I'd write it but
b-l-u-f, bottom line up front. And what he

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:58.100
would do is basically give a preamble to his
email saying, "I'm gonna cover, A, B, C, and

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:02.850
D." So he put the person on notice saying,
"I'm covering multiple topics and these are

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:04.309
the topics I'm gonna cover."

00:33:04.309 --> 00:33:11.320
Now I tried doing that but unfortunately everybody
would email me back and say, "What's BLUF,"

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:15.529
as opposed to actually addressing the email
which shows, but then I started saying, "Okay

00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:23.869
if I don't use the word BLUF but I follow
the concept I just write, 'Dear Sam and John

00:33:23.869 --> 00:33:30.200
and Peter and Mary and Alice, I'm going to
cover these five topics in this email A, B,

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.749
C, D, and E,'" I found that people actually
paid more attention to what was in the email

00:33:34.749 --> 00:33:37.289
as opposed to ignoring stuff.

00:33:37.289 --> 00:33:42.049
I do try to keep my emails to one subject
whenever possible but I just wanted to mention

00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:46.710
this because according to Marksteiner, I think
he said there must be at least 10,000 people

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:51.039
now using this in the Air Force and he gets
a tremendous amount of positive feedback.

00:33:51.039 --> 00:33:55.840
It may not be for everyone and clearly were
not in organizations where we can order people

00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:00.149
to do this, but if you actually set a little
preamble out without using BLUF, based on

00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:05.149
my experience, you don't really need the back
and forth saying, "What's BLUF?" It may work.

00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:08.200
Now, I wanted to share this email with you
[chuckles], this is from Marsh &amp; McLennan

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:12.950
which is a large company in the insurance
field. Anybody wanna guess, and these people

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:19.040
own the to field, it's not the cc or bcc field,
I just wanna, and by the way on average five

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:24.190
emails like this per day went out. Anybody
wanna guess how many people are in the to

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:28.850
field here? We gave this to an intern to count.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:29.850
[laughter]

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:34.669
[laughs] That's what interns are for. Sorry
if there are any in the room.

00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:43.340
There's 5,000 people in the to field and this
was a very typical letter email that people

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.179
at Marsh would send out saying, "Hey, does
anybody know anybody at this company?" It

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:51.380
was called an all hands, it even had a name
it was called an all hands email and that

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:55.610
was a huge challenge because they would get
all these and of course what happened? Somebody

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:59.830
hits reply to all, to all 5,000 says, "No,
sorry, I don't." And then of course somebody

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:04.260
else hits reply to all saying, "Take me off
this list," things like that. Does that sound

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.260
familiar?

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:10.570
There was a meltdown actually Colonel Marksteiner
had told me about this great email meltdown

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:14.900
at Maxwell Air Force Base where he was attending
a conference with some really big brass, the

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.760
generals with the stripes and all that.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:22.590
And when you go into a secure briefing room
you have to leave your Smartphone behind and

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:26.680
while they were in this briefing on the threat
from Russia and China and all that, really

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:34.290
high level information warfare stuff, somebody,
a clerk at Maxwell Air Force Base sent out

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:40.520
this little email about some sort of Bunco
card game or something like that and she accidentally

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:46.760
sent it to two bases, so it was about 50,000
people on the total mailing list.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:51.630
Of course everybody hit reply to all, some
people commented, some people said, "Take

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:57.080
me off this God damned list," and things like
that. And by the time all the big brass got

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:02.320
out of the meeting, they went; they turned
their Smartphones back on and there was no

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.450
email.

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:08.470
While they were discussing this huge threat
from China, Russia, where ever the threat

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:15.350
is may be coming from [chuckles] this little
email about a Bunco card game completely brought

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:21.430
down the Air Force base, two bases actually.
So it's really interesting to see what can

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:22.430
happen.

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:28.710
I've been sort of giving tips a little bit,
which here may be preaching to the choir,

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:33.360
but I do tell people to read what people send
you and to read what you send. I get so many

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.780
emails where clearly the person just hasn't
read anything of what they put into the email

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.100
and it makes no sense.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:44.590
I really try to practice what I preach and
read what I'm about to send someone, I try

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:50.140
and have some degree of empathy for people.
I try to use a variety of search tools, I

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:55.760
try to use arguments in my search, again I'm
at Google, you guys know this way better than

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.930
I do. And I try to do little things like I
keep my instant message status updated and

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:00.930
stuff like that.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:03.040
I did wanna share a couple of things.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:09.520
Some really interesting things from the surveys
that we do where people tell us how they remain

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:15.680
focused, obvious things like headphones, those
are pretty easy. I like the people who take

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.440
laptops and hide somewhere. One person talked
about going to the conference room, turning

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:24.501
the lights off, drawing the curtains, and
actually sitting under the conference room

00:37:24.501 --> 00:37:25.501
table.

00:37:25.501 --> 00:37:26.501
[laughter]

00:37:26.501 --> 00:37:31.940
Somebody else talked about going to cafes
and Starbucks across town so nobody would

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:36.240
know them and then they were able to get work
done. But I really like the guy who turns

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.920
grumpy to the point of where no one will actually
talk to him until he's finished. I mean that's

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:48.500
just, "Get away from me." That'll get people
to leave you alone right? And stuff like that.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:55.890
So this is a little logo we created. Information
Overload Awareness Day is October 18th this

00:37:55.890 --> 00:38:02.560
year. We hope that you will commemorate that
day with us, we're going to actually, it's

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:08.500
the third time we're celebrating Information
Overload Awareness Day, the last two events

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:14.790
we did were online. This year we're planning
on doing an event both in person and online,

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:21.400
details to be announced. But we're bringing
a variety of people to just discuss the problem

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.760
and to discuss solutions of what can be done.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:32.690
And with that I'd really invite you to share
your stories on overloadstories.com. Hoping

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:37.520
you have some good stories to talk about,
about the problem of information overload

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:43.110
that may help other people and to also read
what other people have already contributed.

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:49.920
And I'd like to thank Cliff for inviting me.
This is really coming to a place where information

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:56.570
is so important to people here and to the
business and to the future of society, I feel

00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:01.360
very, very privileged to be here talking about
what I've done about information overload

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.720
compared to what you all are doing.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.690
So thank you very much for having me and if
there are any questions I'm here for a while

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:07.690
so thank you.

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:08.690
[applause]

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:16.530
&gt;&gt;Male #2: My question, so I gather that you
don't like reply to all?

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:19.980
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: Oh no I think it's useful
for certain purposes --

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.980
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Okay.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.920
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: I don't like when people
don't realize they're replying to all to 5,000

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.070
of their closest colleagues without realizing
it --

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:26.070
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Right.

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:27.070
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: and just saying, "Great,
thanks."

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:28.070
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Okay.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.070
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: There are nuance levels
?

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:30.070
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Yes.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:32.041
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: of doing this here. It's,
I'm not against reply to all --

00:39:32.041 --> 00:39:40.050
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Okay, I was gonna make the argument
for it. That if you ask a question and everybody

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:43.460
replies individually then they all reproduce
each other's work because they don't know

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:51.000
the question's already been answered. So given
that trade off do you have any specific rules

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.410
for how people can fix it or just hopefully
people will be intelligent --

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:54.410
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: I have --

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:55.410
&gt;&gt;Male #2: about it.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:58.550
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: I have some idea, I didn't
mean to cut you off, I'm sorry. I have some

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:03.200
ideas. I think it's a question of reading
what people are asking and there are certain

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:08.590
emails where I say, "Please reply to me individually
because it's not important for the group to

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:13.960
see the answer." On other cases it's very
important and I emphasize, "Please reply to

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.650
all because I think it's very important for
the group to see everything."

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:23.690
But the problem is that in, I'd say more cases
than not, it's not necessarily important and

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:29.920
especially when you cc people unnecessarily
to begin with. I'd say the cc problem is worse

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:34.780
than the reply to all problem. We probably
wouldn't be having this question come up if

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:42.980
people kept the right number of people and
didn't tend to overly CYA their emails unnecessarily.

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:49.670
So it's not necessarily about the reply to
all but when you over cc people on the email,

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:55.660
reply to all can sometimes become dangerous
as the Air Force example gives us. But I'm

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:59.440
not against it at all. I use it all the time.
I just use it in the right place where I think

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.440
it's appropriate.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.440
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Thanks.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.480
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: No, thank you.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.480
[pause]

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.060
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Hi.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.990
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: Hello.

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:13.800
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I work in Internal Communications
and so we're super cognizant of not sending

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:18.601
emails that aren't important, but we have
a proliferation of modalities and I saw that

00:41:18.601 --> 00:41:22.420
go by on one of the slides and I'd be really
interested in your thoughts about how other

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.310
organizations have handled what information
has to go to everyone in the company; what

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:31.230
information is just informational and need
to know; how do you separate out what's going

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:33.321
on in a building versus HR things.

00:41:33.321 --> 00:41:38.050
We have just multiple kinds of information
and multiple modalities and we're sorting

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:39.512
it out and wonder if you had any thoughts
to share?

00:41:39.512 --> 00:41:43.190
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: It's a huge challenge and
I'd be happy to give you the longer answer

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:44.190
after --

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:45.190
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Okay.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:46.190
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: so I don't --

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:47.190
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Sure.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:48.190
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: but the short answer --

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.190
&gt;&gt;Female #2: They won't be bored 'cause they
--

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:50.190
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: Okay.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.190
&gt;&gt;Female #2: get a lot of emails from us.
[laughs]

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:53.980
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: The short answer or the
medium answer is basically it's a very tough

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:58.690
question and it's a question of fine tuning
to your audience.

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:03.270
I'll give you an example: I had a conversation
with Jim O'Donnell who's the CEO of BMW of

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:07.870
North America and we were talking, this was
at a cocktail party, and he said, "Oh yeah

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:14.470
information overload, I had somebody print
out everything we send to our dealerships

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:18.600
and it was so and so many feet every week
of communication."

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:23.740
Now I had never thought until Jim mentioned
this of measuring information overload by

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:29.420
feet. I thought that was a great idea I said,
"Jim this is brilliant. I've never measured

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:33.540
how many feet or yards or meters information
overload could be." And he said, "Yeah, we

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:39.750
had like," I think he said seven feet or something,
and this is paper, printed, vertically stacked.

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:45.040
No one could digest, no one in a dealership
or anywhere, no human could digest all of

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.710
this information. So he said, "We have to
figure out something to figure out whom to

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:55.110
get the information to and via what modality
and what has to be pushed versus what has

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:56.570
to be pulled."

00:42:56.570 --> 00:43:02.191
And I'm using that as an example because it's
a different type of problem but it's a very

00:43:02.191 --> 00:43:09.200
similar problem at the same time. It's just,
it shows that you really have to think of

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:14.440
your audience and understand and then develop
strategies to not necessarily put everything

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:20.411
in front of someone's nose as opposed to just
making it available and hoping, but you can't

00:43:20.411 --> 00:43:22.470
just have things where you hope somebody'll
know.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:27.850
I mean that gets into the urgent and important
thing as well. I think the key thing here

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:33.770
is that we've lost our ability to understand
urgent, important, and all that. And until

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:39.770
we regain that balance, that gleichgewicht
in German, the sense of balance that keeps

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:47.100
us from going crazy, it's going to be a very
difficult challenge in corporate communications

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.700
and also external communications.

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:53.470
People who have to communicate massive amounts
of information about products, technology,

00:43:53.470 --> 00:44:01.170
services, the government I mean there's, everything,
there's just so much you have to figure out

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:04.900
and nobody does it, you're never gonna satisfy
the audience.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:09.080
I think you have to recognize that from the
beginning no matter what you're never gonna

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:14.610
get 100% satisfaction from your audience,
but you may find better ways especially by

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:19.930
going and polling your audience, by giving
choices.

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:24.260
And I would conclude my answer, which is actually
more long winded than I thought it would be,

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:29.940
by trying to develop multiple modalities so
that each person can actually choose how he

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:34.470
or she wants to receive information.

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:42.390
I always use the example one person's junk
mail is another person's L.L. Bean catalog.

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:46.000
If you don't care about L.L. Bean and you
don't want the boots, you're not really gonna

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.410
be happy that the catalog came. However if
you like L.L. Bean you're gonna be like, "Oh

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:54.600
great! I just needed to order something and
the catalog came," or "I got an email from

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.080
them," or something like that.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:01.190
So it's really a question of perspective,
but I'd say the ability to give people a choice,

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:04.250
and again I'm happy to talk to you more about
this after and share some of our research

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:10.480
that looks at this in more even what Jim O'Donnell
said. But it's a matter of choice, giving

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.840
people choice.

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.840
I know you had a question.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.251
&gt;&gt;Male #3: It was answered.

00:45:15.251 --> 00:45:16.350
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: It was answered, oh, okay,
groovy.

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:20.460
&gt;&gt;Male #4: I'll wrap up with a final question
then. So first of all thank you for coming,

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:26.040
we have a lot of GTD acolytes here that believe
in getting things done and so we really believe

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.040
in that technique.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:31.760
But I wanted to go back to your question on
the difference between urgent and important

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:38.030
and the issue seems like a cultural one, one
you can't really solve by sending out an email

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:40.620
about what people should consider as urgent
and important.

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:47.330
So how have organizations tackled this and
basically made people aware of conflicting

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:51.120
priorities that are not within their own window,
that other people are working on important

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.120
things too?

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.360
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: Well one of the things I've
recommended to people in terms of getting

00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:00.860
the question of urgent versus important across
and it is a very, very tricky question and

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:07.810
it is cultural, generational, educational.
There are lots of things that come up in this,

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:12.810
is basically to put it all out on the table;
to give people an opportunity to say, to have

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:16.360
a discussion and to make, within work groups
in particular.

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:22.500
I think it actually is more pertinent in small
groups than on large organizational charts,

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:27.180
to make it clear, especially if you if you
start to see a problem crop up, that there

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:33.590
are way too many urgent and important requests
and that not everything, because I would say

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:38.290
if anything close to 80% of what people tend
to believe their doing is urgent and important

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:43.620
at the same time, is really to put this into
perspective.

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:51.320
If you can, if a manager within a work group
can have a dialog that establishes a protocol

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:58.410
and brings people into thinking about it,
again raising even the topic because people

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:03.130
are blithely unaware this is a problem to
being with. It's not as if people do this

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:12.400
deliberately, there's no design here. It's
more a question of it's a lack of awareness.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:18.300
And just like with information overload I
know from what we've done when we've talked

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:24.631
to large corporations we know that just simply
raising a few facts about information overload,

00:47:24.631 --> 00:47:29.660
some of the facts I've covered here, tends
to actually bring down the incidents of information

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:31.330
overload by 10 to 15%.

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:35.300
It's not a technology problem in fact I should
have said this earlier. I don't see information

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:42.160
overload today as a technology problem nor
do I see a lot of the solutions as being technology

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.160
based now.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:47.940
I think that there are future things that
can be solved by technology but ultimately

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:53.021
I think that what we're really after is raising
awareness so we understand it's a very, very

00:47:53.021 --> 00:47:58.680
human problem. It goes to core human frailties
and if we're able to address those I think

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:05.100
then we have a much greater likelihood of
being able to lower the overall incidents

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:10.450
of information overload and restore what really
we've decimated in the work life balance,

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:15.691
bring some time back both for us personally
as well as some productivity to the workplace.

00:48:15.691 --> 00:48:20.390
And I think we'll all be just happier, more
relaxed, and more chill at the end of the

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:21.760
day. So that's really it.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:25.621
&gt;&gt;Cliff: Alright, well thanks very much for
speaking with us today. It was an amazing

00:48:25.621 --> 00:48:26.621
speech.

00:48:26.621 --> 00:48:29.300
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Spira: Cliff, thank you so much
for having me and inviting me here. It's truly

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:29.680
an honor.
