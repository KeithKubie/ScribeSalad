00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.068
Hey it's me Destin.

00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:02.775
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.775 --> 00:00:03.810
You've heard people say,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.201
"It's just like riding a bike"

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:07.868
meaning it's really easy and you can't forget how to do it, right?

00:00:07.868 --> 00:00:09.451
But I did something.

00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:11.505
I did something that damaged my mind.

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:13.107
It happened on the streets of Amsterdam

00:00:13.107 --> 00:00:15.233
and I got really scared honestly.

00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:18.473
I can't ride a bike like you can anymore.

00:00:18.473 --> 00:00:20.154
Before I show you the video of what happened

00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:21.899
I need to tell you the back story.

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:23.945
Like many six year olds with a MacGyver mullet

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:26.189
I learned how to ride a bike when I was really young.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.999
I had learned a life skill and I was really proud of it.

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.656
Everything changed though when my friend Barney called me 25 years later.

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:36.429
Where I work, the welders are geniuses, and they like to play jokes on the engineers.

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:37.858
He had a challenge for me.

00:00:37.858 --> 00:00:41.124
He had built a special bicycle and he wanted me to try to ride it.

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:42.472
He had only changed one thing.

00:00:42.472 --> 00:00:45.787
When you turn the handlebar to the left, the wheel goes to the right.

00:00:45.787 --> 00:00:48.814
When you turn it to the right, the wheel goes to the left.

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:50.882
I thought this would be easy so I hopped on the bike

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:52.918
ready to demonstrate how quickly I could conquer this.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:54.318
- And here he is ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:54.318 --> 00:00:55.756
Mr Destin Sandlin.

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:58.445
First attempt riding the bicycle.

00:01:05.906 --> 00:01:06.806
- Yeah, yeah.

00:01:07.093 --> 00:01:08.319
I couldn't do it.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:11.169
You can see that I'm laughing but I'm actually really frustrated.

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:14.472
In this moment I had a really deep revelation.

00:01:14.472 --> 00:01:16.297
My thinking was in a rut.

00:01:16.297 --> 00:01:19.579
This bike revealed a very deep truth to me.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.012
I had the knowledge of how to operate the bike,

00:01:22.012 --> 00:01:24.474
but I did not have the understanding.

00:01:24.474 --> 00:01:28.044
Therefore, knowledge is not understanding.

00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:29.040
Look I know what you're probably thinking.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.428
Destin's probably just an uncoordinated engineer and can't do it.

00:01:31.428 --> 00:01:32.728
But that's not the case at all.

00:01:32.728 --> 00:01:35.071
The algorithm that's associated with riding a bike,

00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:37.212
in your brain, is just that complicated.

00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:38.194
Think about it.

00:01:38.194 --> 00:01:39.391
Downwards force on the pedals,

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:40.349
leaning your whole body,

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:41.528
pulling and pushing the handlebars,

00:01:41.528 --> 00:01:43.200
gyroscopic procession in the wheels,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.402
every single force is part of this algorithm.

00:01:45.402 --> 00:01:48.671
And if you change any one part it affects the entire control system.

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:51.480
I do not make definitive statements that often,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.545
but I'm telling you right now,

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:55.784
you cannot ride this bicycle.

00:01:55.784 --> 00:01:57.647
You might think you can, but you can't.

00:01:57.647 --> 00:02:00.776
I know this because I'm often asked to speak at universities and conferences

00:02:00.776 --> 00:02:02.077
and I take the bike with me.

00:02:02.077 --> 00:02:03.491
It's always the same.

00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:06.694
People think they're gonna try some trick or they're just gonna power through it.

00:02:06.694 --> 00:02:08.165
It doesn't work.

00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:10.668
Your brain cannot handle this.

00:02:10.668 --> 00:02:12.469
For instance, this guy.

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.965
I offered him two hundred dollars just to ride this bike ten feet across the stage.

00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:19.101
Everybody thought he could do it.

00:02:19.437 --> 00:02:23.706
[crowd exclaims] No no no. You didn't understand.

00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:26.776
So.. this way, not that way. [crowd laughs]

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:32.088
Alright so, whenever you're ready.

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.120
Remember you have to keep your feet on.. [crowd laughs]

00:02:41.262 --> 00:02:42.981
[laughing crowd]

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.483
You've gotta start rolling at least. And go.

00:02:53.855 --> 00:02:55.518
Keep your feet on the pedal, go.

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.644
[laughing crowd]

00:03:05.596 --> 00:03:07.916
Just keep your feet on the pedals.

00:03:12.505 --> 00:03:14.721
Alright, one more time.

00:03:15.063 --> 00:03:17.899
Once you have a rigid way of thinking in your head,

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:22.102
sometimes you cannot change that, even if you want to.

00:03:26.293 --> 00:03:27.532
So here's what I did.

00:03:27.532 --> 00:03:28.703
It was a personal challenge.

00:03:28.703 --> 00:03:30.038
I stayed out here in this driveway

00:03:30.038 --> 00:03:32.107
and I practiced about 5 minutes every day.

00:03:32.107 --> 00:03:33.242
My neighbors made fun of me.

00:03:33.242 --> 00:03:34.377
I had many wrecks.

00:03:34.377 --> 00:03:37.674
But after 8 months, this happened.

00:03:37.674 --> 00:03:40.341
One day I couldn't ride the bike, and the next day I could.

00:03:40.341 --> 00:03:44.191
It was like I could feel some kind of pathway in my brain that was now unlocked.

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:45.497
It was really weird though.

00:03:45.497 --> 00:03:47.283
It's like there's this trail in my brain,

00:03:47.283 --> 00:03:49.061
but if I wasn't paying close enough attention to it,

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:53.356
my brain would easily lose that neural path and jump back onto the old road it was more familiar with.

00:03:53.356 --> 00:03:56.391
Any small distractions at all, like a cellphone ringing in my pocket,

00:03:56.391 --> 00:03:59.743
would instantly throw my brain back to the old control algorithm and I would wreck.

00:03:59.743 --> 00:04:01.513
But at least I could ride it.

00:04:01.513 --> 00:04:03.470
My son is the closest person to me genetically

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.725
and he's been riding a normal bike for 3 years,

00:04:05.725 --> 00:04:07.207
that's over half his life.

00:04:07.207 --> 00:04:10.357
I wanted to know how long it would take him to learn how to ride a backwards bike

00:04:10.357 --> 00:04:12.515
so I told him if he learned how to ride a backwards bike

00:04:12.515 --> 00:04:15.879
he could go with me to Australia and meet a real astronaut.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:16.887
Are you gonna give up?

00:04:16.887 --> 00:04:17.712
- No.

00:04:17.712 --> 00:04:19.683
- Go ahead.

00:04:20.483 --> 00:04:21.860
This is how it starts.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.191
Look at this.

00:04:23.191 --> 00:04:24.899
This is such a big deal.

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:26.061
Get up, you got it.

00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:28.041
Did you see his brain get it?

00:04:28.041 --> 00:04:31.896
So he, in.. How many weeks we been doing this? Two weeks?

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:35.955
In two weeks he did something that took me 8 months to do,

00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:39.381
which demonstrates that a child has more neural plasticity,

00:04:39.381 --> 00:04:40.350
am I even saying that right?

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.642
Than an adult.

00:04:41.642 --> 00:04:45.513
It's clear from this experiment that children have a much more plastic brain than adults.

00:04:45.513 --> 00:04:48.985
That's why the best time to learn a language is when you're a young child.

00:04:48.985 --> 00:04:50.387
Alright, today's bike log.

00:04:50.387 --> 00:04:52.455
I can ride smooth, I can ride fast.

00:04:52.455 --> 00:04:54.925
I'm thinking the experiment is over.

00:04:54.925 --> 00:04:56.437
OK now I'm in Amsterdam,

00:04:56.437 --> 00:04:58.418
a city that has more bicycles than people.

00:04:58.418 --> 00:05:01.500
The question is, can I ride a normal bike now.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.057
I mean I have spent all this time unlearning how to ride a bike,

00:05:04.057 --> 00:05:07.399
If I go back and try to ride a normal one will my brain mess up.

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:10.593
So I've tweeted a Smarter Every Day.. meetup, if you will.

00:05:10.593 --> 00:05:14.347
And I'm gonna see if somebody brings a bicycle and I'm gonna try to ride a normal bike.

00:05:18.367 --> 00:05:20.190
It's backwards, it's backwards.

00:05:20.413 --> 00:05:22.792
This was one of the most frustrating moments of my life.

00:05:22.792 --> 00:05:24.397
I had ridden a normal bike since I was six,

00:05:24.397 --> 00:05:26.364
but in this moment I couldn't do it any more.

00:05:26.364 --> 00:05:30.091
I had set out to prove that I could free my brain from a cognitive bias,

00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:33.984
but at this point I'm pretty sure that all I've proved is that I can only re-designate that bias.

00:05:33.984 --> 00:05:38.035
So what you're not seeing is there's a group of people here,

00:05:38.035 --> 00:05:38.967
looking at me.

00:05:38.967 --> 00:05:40.532
Looking at the strange American,

00:05:41.772 --> 00:05:44.377
that can't ride a bike, cause they think I'm dumb.

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:46.112
But I'm actually two levels deep into this,

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:48.530
because I've learned and un-learned. Alright.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.784
After 20 minutes of making a fool out of myself,

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:53.252
suddenly my brain clicked back into the old algorithm.

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:57.022
I can't explain it, but it happened in a very specific moment.

00:06:00.823 --> 00:06:02.100
[laughter]

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.074
I've got it, I've got it, I've got it.

00:06:03.074 --> 00:06:03.991
I'm back.

00:06:03.991 --> 00:06:05.088
Oh it clicked. It clicked.

00:06:05.088 --> 00:06:07.402
I've got it, I've got it.

00:06:07.402 --> 00:06:08.273
OK there it is.

00:06:08.273 --> 00:06:10.273
There was the moment.

00:06:10.273 --> 00:06:11.808
OK I can ride a bike.

00:06:11.808 --> 00:06:13.610
I tried to explain this to the people around me,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.047
and they just didn't get it.

00:06:15.047 --> 00:06:17.340
They thought I was faking the previous 20 minutes

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.995
and I couldn't get anybody to believe me.

00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:20.175
That looked like I faked it, didn't it.

00:06:20.175 --> 00:06:22.346
You think I'm faking. You don't believe me.

00:06:22.346 --> 00:06:24.247
- It looked so weird...

00:06:24.247 --> 00:06:26.817
- You think I'm lying don't you.

00:06:26.817 --> 00:06:28.286
I'm not lying.

00:06:28.286 --> 00:06:32.222
I felt like the only person on the planet who had ever un-learned how to ride a bike,

00:06:32.222 --> 00:06:33.792
and I couldn't articulate it to anyone

00:06:33.792 --> 00:06:37.654
because everybody just knew that you can't forget how to ride a bike.

00:06:39.601 --> 00:06:41.641
So I learned 3 things from this experiment.

00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:44.261
I learned that welders are often smarter than engineers,

00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:46.938
I learned that knowledge does not equal understanding,

00:06:46.938 --> 00:06:48.609
and I learned that truth is truth.

00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:50.735
No matter what I think about it.

00:06:50.735 --> 00:06:52.745
So be very careful how you interpret things

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:54.870
because you're looking at the world with a bias

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.304
whether you think you are or not.

00:06:57.304 --> 00:06:58.384
I'm Destin,

00:06:58.384 --> 00:06:59.646
you're getting Smarter Every Day,

00:06:59.646 --> 00:07:00.756
have a good one.

00:07:01.156 --> 00:07:02.892
OK if you wanna support Smarter Every Day

00:07:02.892 --> 00:07:06.017
you can download a free audio book at audible.com/smarter

00:07:06.017 --> 00:07:07.954
I recommend Commander Hadfield's book

00:07:07.954 --> 00:07:10.186
which is An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth.

00:07:10.186 --> 00:07:11.759
I read it, it was awesome.

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.788
If you think about it, I had to learn how to ride a different kind of bicycle

00:07:14.788 --> 00:07:16.127
and my son did it as well,

00:07:16.127 --> 00:07:19.903
but Commander Hadfield had to learn how to ride a different space ship.

00:07:19.903 --> 00:07:22.374
Not only that, but a different type of space station.

00:07:22.374 --> 00:07:25.311
He was on Mir and the International Space Station.

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:27.436
Anyway, if you're interested in supporting Smarter Every Day,

00:07:31.288 --> 00:07:33.656
I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:07:33.656 --> 00:07:34.621
Have a good one.

00:07:43.561 --> 00:07:45.474
[crowd cheers]

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.480
Everything is wrong... My instinctive reaction is wrong.

00:07:48.466 --> 00:07:50.136
(Destin) Why don't you ride it? You just build it?

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.752
- I can't ride it, I just build it.

00:07:52.044 --> 00:07:53.011
[laughs]
