00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
that is exactly what a carbonated soda
should look like hey guys King Yoshi

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.740
left the comment down below asking if WE
could make our own carbonated drinks

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.360
using dry ice with almost 800 likes this
is by far the most popular comment so

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.289
that's what we're trying today we're
making fizzy drinks on the DIY now we're

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.990
all familiar with that customary hiss
that you hear when you open a bottle of

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.470
soda the actual noise that we hear is
the pressure in the bottle rapidly

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.859
escaping at the top and the reason that
most sodas begin to fizz as you do is

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.039
because the carbon dioxide dissolved in
the solution begins to nucleate and

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.239
rapidly come back out now the first step
in making fizzy soda or a fizzy drink is

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.360
to start off by making fizzy water now I
just went down to the grocery store and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.020
pick up a bottle of San Pellegrino
sparkling natural mineral water very

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.230
posh stuff right but if you open it up
and pour some out you'll find that it's

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.770
basically just water with a little bit
of fizz and that fizz is really the only

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.410
thing that makes it Sparkle there's
really no sweet taste to it at all it

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.160
literally is just fizzy water and that's
exactly what we're going to make next so

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.770
now that we know what high quality fizzy
water tastes like let's go ahead and

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.820
take a shot at making our own quick
update guys here's what I just did I

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.820
took a little water import it into a
separate glass and then got a chunk of

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.240
dry ice and picked up the grocery store
and use my mini master sword to smash it

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.900
up into small chunks now watch very
carefully to what happens if we grab

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.049
some of those smaller chunks and toss
them into the water that's pretty much

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.040
the typical dry ice water reaction but
something else is taking place that you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.030
may not have realized the last time you
said it's done the water around the dry

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.990
ice is actually getting fizzy eventually
the water around the dryest will get so

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.200
cold it will form a layer of ice which
will acts as an insulator and will

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.009
actually prevent the dry from bubbling
off as quickly but right now you can see

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.060
it's forming a vapor barrier a gas
barrier around the dry ice which looks

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.159
really really cool it almost makes it
look lacquered alright guys so it's been

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.579
about 4 minutes our driest is almost
completely dissolved now occasionally

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.400
I'll get somebody who asked me what
would happen if you drank the water has

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.360
the dry ice  in it so I'm going to try
that for you now

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.840
Hmm, its fizzy and you know what it almost tastes
the same as our San Pellegrino we just

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.720
made fizzy water by throwing dry ice
into it isn't that interesting the San

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.660
Pellegrino does have more of a bite more
fizz and I'm pretty sure that's because

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.230
it's got more carbon dioxide dissolved
into the water however if we drop in

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.709
more dry ice and let it run longer I'm
pretty sure we can achieve a very

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.940
similar effect with our homebrew so now
that we know we can make our own

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.450
sparkling water using just a few chunks
of dry ice let's go ahead and take it to

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.970
the next level and see if we can make
carbonated drinks

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:11.580
so all the gusto it like turned into a
mash okay so not a great way to get

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:25.020
orange juice

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.360
so here we are guys they just poured
some drinks and cut up some fruit and

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.810
now we're left with four different
glasses we've got lemonade apple juice

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.070
orange juice and watermelon juice now as
is none of these drinks are fizzy at all

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.280
I've tasted each of them and they're
completely flat so the next step is to

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.120
grab a few handfuls of dry ice fill our
glasses full and let them sit for about

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.570
20 minutes to see if our drinks
carbonates them sell quick word of

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.300
advice if you ever try making orange
juice for yourself don't include the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.920
peels this stuff tastes terrible yeah
mmm oh yeah

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.590
watermelon that's a win here we go

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.639
guys here we are it's been about 25
minutes and each of our cups is still

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.939
bubbling away however one thing that's
very interesting is the dry ice is so

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:47.539
cold it actually forms a layer of ice
around it and acts as a little bit of an

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.109
insulator so it does slow down the
bubbling process quite a bit so this is

00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:54.169
all looked really cool we made a huge
mess but here's the real question after

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.609
20 minutes of experimenting have our
drinks turned into fizzy drinks here we

00:04:58.609 --> 00:05:07.759
go very cold and I do feel the carbon
dioxide bubbles tingling on my tongue

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.359
just like you would with a soda we've
effectively just turned our apple juice

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.580
into sparkling cider that's very cool
it's too bad half of its frozen, You know

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.269
it had an idea for that frozen stuff if
we scoop that out we've got ourselves a

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:29.659
nice carbonated slushy mmm cool fizzy and
refreshing alright next up we got our

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:35.949
sparkling lemonade as I call it chilled
beverage see how it tastes

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.360
yeah it's fizzy it's carbonated that
actually has a really Pleasant taste to

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.390
it

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.450
mmm it's tickling my throat that's cool
yeah I quite like that I highly

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.470
recommend dry some lemonade
good combination all right this

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:06.600
monstrosity of orange juice that I
attempted to make very fizzy it tastes

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:14.130
terrible but it definitely is fizzy very
cool this one I'm very much looking

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.460
forward to this is the watermelon which
tasted great before can't wait to see

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:27.750
how it tastes
fizzy effervescent yep pretty much what

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.650
you'd expect carbonated watermelon juice
it tastes like it is nice but honestly I

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.320
think I prefer this one flat big win on
the lemonade's oh that's good stuff go

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.770
try that..now just for fun I went ahead
and filled up a big bowl with the rest

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.080
of the apple juice through in a few
chunks of dry and just let it sit for

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.230
about 20 minutes then I took some of
that juice and I transferred it using a

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.070
funnel into this coke bottle and screw
the cap on tight and if you shake it up

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.450
you can actually feel it pressurized and
looking at it you can see all the same

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.470
soda bubbles and fizz they would expect
to see out of a carbonated drink so I

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.140
think at this point we've effectively
turned regular apple juice into

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.890
something very similar to that sparkling
cider you get for special occasion

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:13.050
homebrew non-alcoholic sparkling cider
and if I remove the cap yep I'd say

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:18.330
that's fizzy we did it homemade fizzy
drinks makes the mess just like the rest

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:24.810
taste test

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.410
you can see as we were pouring those out
the Martinelli's actually had a little

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.440
bit more foam for us a little bit more
of a head at the top there and that's

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.040
because it's got more carbon dioxide
actually dissolved in the fluid but now

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.900
that's sitting out at standard
atmosphere let's go ahead and give it a

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:53.660
taste test .Oh! my goodness that is
really really good I mean really good

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:59.500
that's our homemade stuff - all right
original Martinelli

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.610
almost identical they taste almost
identical that is super cool

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:13.759
I'd say this one pickles the tongue is a
little bit more now I take that back

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:18.650
this one is distance busy so ad standard
atmospheric pressure these things taste

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:23.029
almost identical this one tickles your
tongue it's got a nice aftertaste

00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:26.689
it's delicious they taste identical and
I think I prefer this one because you

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:30.620
know we'll look closer a natural side
effect amusing drives so interesting

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.050
stuff guys the purpose of this
experiment was to see if we could use

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.219
dry ice to make our own improvised
carbonated beverages and apparently the

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:41.329
answer is yes we can although it's not
nearly as practical or as easy as just

00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:45.079
going down to store buying something but
it definitely is a lot of fun you might

00:08:45.079 --> 00:08:48.380
be wondering if you can use this trick
to rejuvenate a flat soda as well the

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.490
answer is yes if you take a very small
chunk of dry sand I mean very small like

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.089
no bigger than your thumbnail and drop
that down into your container and screw

00:08:56.089 --> 00:08:59.540
the cap on site the bottle immediately
begins pressurizing and the carbon

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.660
dioxide begins to dissolve back into
liquid and honestly this really isn't

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.149
something that you should try at home
because putting dry ice in a sealed

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:09.230
container in a lot of cases will make it
explode so there you have a guys that's

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.230
how to use a little bit of dry ice some
juice some water or whatever else you

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.040
like to make your own carbonated drinks
at home just make sure you don't use too

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.829
much dry ice and don't put it in a
sealed container because it could

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:21.949
explode and of course a big thanks to
King Yoshi for requesting this

00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:24.860
experiment and to everyone who helps
support them go ahead and check your

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.470
experiment I'll be looking for you the
next one talk to you then is it a really

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:39.470
cool shimmer it's so shiny yeah this one
I'm very much looking forward to this is

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.949
our watermelon juice it tasted so good
before I'm very much looking forward to

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:49.339
how it tastes now hey guys thanks for
