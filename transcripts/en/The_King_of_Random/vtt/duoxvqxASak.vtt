00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.820
For this video, I’m going to show you how
to make a handful of remote controlled, electric

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.720
ignitors from things you already have around
the house. That will ignite fireworks safely,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.460
and from a distance. Or launch your homemade
rockets, with the simple press of a button.

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.880
To start this project, you’ll just need
a book of paper matches, some tape, and an

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.670
old cell phone charger. Chances are you have
a spare charger somewhere in the house, but

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.240
if not, you can easily find them at thrift
stores for about a dollar.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.460
Now get to work with a pair of scissors, and
carefully chop the head and charge controller

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.510
off of the cable, then cut it up into smaller
pieces around 2” long.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.070
If we remove the outer jacket, you can see
there are two insulated wires inside, made

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.839
of very thin, stranded copper wires. And for
this project, the thinner the wires are, the

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:43.640
better the ignitors will work.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.710
Now we don’t need the outer sheathing at
all, so go ahead and pull the wires out and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.469
strip the other ends down about half an inch.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.670
Carefully single out one copper strand, from
the bundle of wire, and pull it to off the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.149
side. And now the other frayed wires, are
all garbage, so just twist them together,

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.449
and use a pair of scissors to snip them off
at the base.

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.159
Now let’s take a close look at the other
wire. If it has nylon cording mixed in with the

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.909
copper strands you need to get rid of it.
And the most effective way to eliminate it,

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.570
is to lick it with a flame from a candle,
or a BBQ ignitor.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.799
Now hold the two cables side by side about
1/4” apart, then twist the bridge wire from

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.110
the first cable, so it binds together tightly,
and meshes in with the other strands. This

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.560
will ensure the bridge wire has great electrical
contact, and should prevent it from unravelling.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.180
To hold the wires in place, simply lay a small
piece of tape on the table, so it’s facing

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.479
sticky side up, and press the wires down into
the center.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.890
Now make sure the bridge wire is poking out
around 1/4” from the top, then bend the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.659
excess wire back, and press it down beside
the wires on the inside.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.880
Alright the ignitor leads are completed, so
let’s take a quick break from all that,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.740
and spend some time modifying the match heads.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.030
Take the matches, one at a time, and carefully
slide them down the edge of a sharp pair of

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.630
scissors. You can see it scores a very small
grove, right down the center of the tip.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.990
Now bring back the ignitor leads, and line
the bridge wire up with the groove in the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.659
match-head, and secure it firmly in place
by wrapping one side of the tape tightly over

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.679
the base of the match, then reinforce it again,
by firmly wrapping the other half of the tape

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.229
the other direction.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.999
For one finishing touch, it’s good practice
to burn the nylon strands on the ignitor leads

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.819
as well, then twist them together tightly
so they’ll make better contact.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.030
At this point, your electric match is finished,
and ready to go to work.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.180
To test them out, I tried connecting alligator
clips to the leads of the ignitor, then running

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.180
the wires to two 9 volt batteries, in parallel.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.459
Now all it takes for ignition, is the press
of a button to complete the circuit. Or in

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.349
this case, a touch of the wires to the battery
terminals.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.440
The matches light off because when the circuit
is completed, over 6 amps of electrical current

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.319
surge through the tiny bridge wire on top,
and the electricity gets the wire so hot it

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.349
ignites the chemicals in the match head, causing
it to burst into flames. And you can see that

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.370
all happens very quickly.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.840
Now just for fun, I got an old N64 controller
and converted it, into a rocket launch controller.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.019
So now I can launch homemade sugar rockets
with the the press of a button. Look for how

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.810
I made this in another project video.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.370
Well now you know how to mass produce electric
ignitors, with junk you probably have lying

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.540
around the house.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.599
By the way, if you try using different colored
tape, you can give your ignitors your own

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.579
custom touch. And if you can’t find paper
matches, wooden matches will work just as well.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.000
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
video, perhaps you’ll like some of 
my others.
