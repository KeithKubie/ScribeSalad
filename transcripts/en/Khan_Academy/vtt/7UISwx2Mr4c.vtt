00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.089
So we're starting off
with triangle ABC here.

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:05.880
And we see from the
drawing that we already

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.650
know that the length of AB
is equal to the length of AC,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.700
or line segment AB is
congruent to line segment AC.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.530
And since this is a triangle
and two sides of this triangle

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.010
are congruent, or they
have the same length,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.490
we can say that this is
an isosceles triangle.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.500
Isosceles triangle, one of the
hardest words for me to spell.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.852
I think I got it right.

00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:33.560
And that just means
that two of the sides

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.290
are equal to each other.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.950
Now what I want to
do in this video

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.040
is show what I want to prove.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.600
So what I want to prove here
is that these two-- and they're

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.330
sometimes referred to as base
angles, these angles that

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.860
are between one of the
sides, and the side that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.540
isn't necessarily equal to
it, and the other side that

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.487
is equal and the side
that's not equal to it.

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:56.070
I want to show that
they're congruent.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.630
So I want to prove
that angle ABC, I

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.269
want to prove that that
is congruent to angle ACB.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.130
And so for an
isosceles triangle,

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.370
those two angles are
often called base angles.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.040
And this might be called
the vertex angle over here.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.470
And these are often
called the sides

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.280
or the legs of the
isosceles triangle.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.995
And these are--
obviously they're sides.

00:01:23.995 --> 00:01:26.190
These are the legs of the
isosceles triangle and this one

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.650
down here, that
isn't necessarily

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.720
the same as the other two,
you would call the base.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.440
So let's see if
we can prove that.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.470
So there's not a
lot of information

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.380
here, just that these
two sides are equal.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.010
But we have, in
our toolkit, a lot

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.990
that we know about
triangle congruency.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.780
So maybe we can construct
two triangles here

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.580
that are congruent.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.710
And then we can use
that information

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.990
to figure out whether this
angle is congruent to that angle

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.697
there.

00:01:50.697 --> 00:01:52.780
And the first step, if
we're going to use triangle

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.010
congruency, is to actually
construct two triangles.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.190
So one way to construct
two triangles is let's

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.670
set up another point
right over here.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.350
Let's set up another
point D. And let's just

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.560
say that D is the midpoint of
B and C. So it's the midpoint.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.039
So the distance
from B to D is going

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.959
to be the same thing
as the distance-- let

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.500
me do a double slash
here to show you

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.270
it's not the same
as that distance.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.770
So the distance
from B to D is going

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.110
to be the same thing as
the distance from D to C.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.560
And obviously, between any two
points, you have a midpoint.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.010
And so let me draw segment AD.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.130
And what's useful about
that is that we have now

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.610
constructed two triangles.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.170
And what's even cooler is that
triangle ABD and triangle ACD,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.582
they have this
side is congruent,

00:02:41.582 --> 00:02:43.290
this side is congruent,
and they actually

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.320
share this side right over here.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:57.390
So we know that
triangle ABD we know

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.440
that it is congruent
to triangle ACD.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.640
And we know it because
of SSS, side-side-side.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.960
You have two triangles that have
three sides that are congruent,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.400
or they have the same length.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.990
Then the two triangles
are congruent.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.830
And what's useful about that
is if these two triangles are

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.150
congruent, then their
corresponding angles

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.380
are congruent.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.000
And so we've actually
now proved our result.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.370
Because the corresponding
angle to ABC in this triangle

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.700
is angle ACD in this
triangle right over here.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:46.260
So that we then know that angle
ABC is congruent to angle ACB.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.790
So that's a pretty neat result.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.570
If you have an
isosceles triangle,

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.920
a triangle where two of
the sides are congruent,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.360
then their base angles,
these base angles,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.715
are also going to be congruent.

00:03:57.715 --> 00:03:59.340
Now let's think about
it the other way.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.673
Can we make the other statement?

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:02.070
If the base angles
are congruent,

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.120
do we know that these two legs
are going to be congruent?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.940
So let's try to
construct a triangle

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.180
and see if we can
prove it the other way.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.050
So I'll do another
triangle right over here.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.370
Let me draw another
one just like that.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.410
That's not that
pretty of a triangle,

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.700
so let me draw it
a little nicer.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.630
I'm going to draw it like this.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.260
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.820
So I'll call that A.
I will call this B. I

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.750
will call that C
right over there.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.970
And now we're going to
start off with the idea

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.260
that this angle, angle ABC,
is congruent to angle ACB.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.854
So they have the
same exact measure.

00:04:41.854 --> 00:04:43.520
And what we want to
do in this case-- we

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.470
want to prove-- so let
me draw a little line

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.670
here to show that we're
doing a different idea.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.524
Here we're saying if these
two sides are the same,

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:53.440
then the base angles are
going to be the same.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.240
We've proved that.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.080
Now let's go the other way.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.460
If the base angles
are the same, do we

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.010
know that the two
sides are the same?

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:10.240
So we want to prove that
segment AC is congruent to AB.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.094
Or you could say that
the length of segment AC,

00:05:13.094 --> 00:05:14.510
which we would
denote that way, is

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.470
equal to the length
of segment AB.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.029
These are essentially
equivalent statements.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.570
So let's see.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.567
Once again in our toolkit, we
have our congruency theorems.

00:05:25.567 --> 00:05:27.150
But in order to apply
them, you really

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.200
do need to have two triangles.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.470
So let's construct
two triangles here.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.950
And this time, instead
of defining another point

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:41.935
as the midpoint, I'm going to
define D this time as the point

00:05:41.935 --> 00:05:43.980
that if I were to
go straight up,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.700
the point that is
essentially-- if you view

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.300
BC as straight horizontal, the
point that goes straight down

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.380
from A. And the reason
why I say that is there's

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.290
some point-- you could
call it an altitude-- that

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.000
intersects BC at a right angle.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.470
And there will definitely
be some point like that.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.220
And so if it's a right
angle on that side,

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.940
if that's 90
degrees, then we know

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.880
that this is 90 degrees as well.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.520
Now, what's
interesting about this?

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.690
And let me write this down.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:31.870
So I've constructed AD such
that AD is perpendicular to BC.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.250
And you can always
construct an altitude.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.990
Essentially, you just have to
make BC lie flat on the ground.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.990
And then you just have
to drop something from A,

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.980
and that will give you
point D. You can always

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.410
do that with a
triangle like this.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.320
So what does this give us?

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.220
So over here, we have
an angle, an angle,

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.420
and then a side in common.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.350
And over here, you have an angle
that corresponds to that angle,

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.016
an angle that corresponds
to this angle,

00:06:59.016 --> 00:07:01.760
and the same side in common.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.000
And so we know that these
triangles are congruent by AAS,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.280
angle-angle-side,
which we've shown

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.190
is a valid congruent postulate.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:19.300
So we can say now
that triangle ABD

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.810
is congruent to triangle ACD.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.860
And we know that by
angle-angle-side.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.610
This angle and this
angle and this side.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.756
This angle and this
angle and this side.

00:07:33.756 --> 00:07:35.880
And once we know these two
triangles are congruent,

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.090
we know that every corresponding
angle or side of the two

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.220
triangles are also
going to be congruent.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.680
So then we know that AB is
a corresponding side to AC.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.930
So these two sides
must be congruent.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:59.370
And so you get AB is going
to be congruent to AC,

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.110
and that's because these
are congruent triangles.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.800
And we've proven what
we wanted to show.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.934
If the base angles are
equal, then the two legs

00:08:05.934 --> 00:08:06.850
are going to be equal.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.266
If the two legs are equal,
then the base angles are equal.

00:08:09.266 --> 00:08:12.050
It's a very, very, very
useful tool in geometry.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.730
And in case you're curious,
for this specific isosceles

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.720
triangle, over here we set
up D so it was the midpoint.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.420
Over here we set up D so
it was directly below A.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.290
We didn't say whether
it was the midpoint.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.873
But here, we can actually show
that it is the midpoint just as

00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:28.130
a little bit of a bonus
result, because we

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.710
know that since these two
triangles are congruent,

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.870
BD is going to be
congruent to DC

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.780
because they are the
corresponding sides.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.480
So it actually
turns out that point

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.400
D for an isosceles triangle,
not only is it the midpoint

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.780
but it is the place where,
it is the point at which AD--

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:53.640
or we could say that AD is a
perpendicular bisector of BC.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.930
So not only is AD perpendicular
to BC, but it bisects it.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.860
That D is the midpoint
of that entire base.
