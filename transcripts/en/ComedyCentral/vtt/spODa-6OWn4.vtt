00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550
- Alright I guess
that just goes to show

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.990
that you can lead
a horse to water

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.600
but you can't
make him butt chug.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.660
We'll see you next time on
Every Damn Day.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.000
- Okay that's a cut guys.
Amazing, everybody gets an Emmy.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.830
- Alright those scripts are due
by the end of the day

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.940
so let's take a quick lunch,
work through it.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.854
- Cool, thank you.

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:18.210
- Me so hungy.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.509
I'm going to eat
like four lunches after this.

00:00:30.058 --> 00:00:34.685
(loud chewing)

00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:41.163
- Is Jordan's chewing
distracting anyone?

00:00:41.163 --> 00:00:42.080
- Yes.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.850
- Maybe he's not chewing,
maybe he's teething?

00:00:47.644 --> 00:00:48.910
- What happened?
- You chew like a vulture.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.210
- I'm just eating my launch.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.630
- You're doing a lot more
than that to it.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.990
- I'm going to punch you
in the throat.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.660
- Fine. I guess I'll just eat
the soup I got instead.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.487
- Cool.

00:01:06.454 --> 00:01:08.140
Are you chewing on soup?

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.220
- If teeth are the problem
I can take them off your mouth.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.855
- Wow, I guess soup is bad too.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.070
- Just open the bag
or I'll shove it down the hole

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.580
I punch in your throat.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.050
- You know what I was trying
to open the bag

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.470
slowly out of respect
for you guys

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.970
but I guess lunch
is illegal now.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.225
- You want to suck on a peanut?
- Excuse me?

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:42.460
- I eat loud too.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.190
So I eat when no one
is around.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.840
And I suck on a peanut
to the curb the between time.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.380
- Oh ok yeah sure thanks.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.582
- Be good.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.900
- Sorry my ringtone
is a loud chewing sound.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.560
I thought it'd be funny
but it's not funny.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:19.695
- It's kind of funny.
- A little funny.

00:02:19.695 --> 00:02:20.496
Is this another?

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:22.169
- No, no he's choking.
He's choking!

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.530
- Come on!
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.570
- Let me, here. He's gone.
Time of death, right now.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.070
- Why is it so loud in here?
- Jordan's just eating.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.280
- Oh, carry on.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.000
- Jordan?
He's dead.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.470
- What?

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.849
Jordan is dead and Nate
will not be happy about this.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:50.653
- Do something!

00:02:50.653 --> 00:02:51.840
Watch out everybody,
watch out.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.881
Defibrillate him, Chris!

00:03:01.262 --> 00:03:02.760
Cake?
- Pluto is a planet again.

00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:07.761
- So cool. Wow!

00:03:07.761 --> 00:03:09.010
- Yeah please.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.441
- Pass it down. Cheers!

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:17.506
(loud chewing)

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:22.460
- Oh I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.420
I think we all deserve
to chew loudly today.
