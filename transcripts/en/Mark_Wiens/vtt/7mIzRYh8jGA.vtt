00:00:00.054 --> 00:00:02.127
- Hey, everyone, it's Mark
Wiens, and I just wrapped up

00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:04.976
a 16 day food and travel
trip, but more than a trip,

00:00:04.976 --> 00:00:07.907
it was an experience and a
journey through Pakistan.

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:09.410
We began our journey in Lahore,

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.917
which is an amazing city
of history and food,

00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:15.062
before continuing on
to Gujranwala, Chakwal,

00:00:15.062 --> 00:00:18.351
Islamabod, Peshawar,
and then after Peshawar,

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.474
we continued to the North.

00:00:19.474 --> 00:00:23.159
The northern mountainous
region of Gilgit-Baltistan,

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.347
which was incredibly
beautiful, and from there

00:00:26.347 --> 00:00:28.017
we continued on to Karachi.

00:00:28.017 --> 00:00:30.368
There are three main ideas
or concepts that really

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:32.647
stood out to me during
my trip to Pakistan.

00:00:32.647 --> 00:00:36.067
Number one, is the welcome
and the hospitality of people,

00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:37.737
and we were filming food
video, so we were going

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:38.657
from restaurant to restaurant

00:00:38.657 --> 00:00:40.416
and street food stall
to street food stall,

00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:42.552
but there was not one day that went by

00:00:42.552 --> 00:00:45.268
during this trip to Pakistan,
where we tried to pay

00:00:45.268 --> 00:00:47.880
for the food, and one
of the vendors would not

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.146
accept our payment.

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:50.207
They said it would dishonor them

00:00:50.207 --> 00:00:52.854
if we paid them money for the food,

00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:55.604
and so that was so heart-warming,

00:00:56.861 --> 00:00:59.203
and every single day people would come up.

00:00:59.203 --> 00:01:00.501
They would want to shake our hands,

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:02.278
they want to take a photo.

00:01:02.278 --> 00:01:03.860
They would just want to
welcome us to Pakistan

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.839
and say thank you for being here,

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:08.486
for traveling to Pakistan.

00:01:08.486 --> 00:01:09.867
Number two is the food.

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:11.756
And of course we traveled
to Pakistan for the food.

00:01:11.756 --> 00:01:14.604
The food was unbelievable,
from karachis to kabobs

00:01:14.604 --> 00:01:17.960
to niharis to piyas and all
the street food in between.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.176
You'll find food everywhere
and it's so rich,

00:01:21.176 --> 00:01:22.553
it's so flavorful.

00:01:22.553 --> 00:01:23.689
Food was incredible.

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.031
Finally, number three is
the unbelievable landscapes

00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:27.454
and the scenery of Pakistan.

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:28.580
Especially when you travel around

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.131
the Gilgit-Baltistan region.

00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:32.002
The mountainous regions,
the Karakoram Mountains

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:32.835
and the Himalayas.

00:01:32.835 --> 00:01:35.797
We traveled all the way
up to the Khunjerab Pass,

00:01:35.797 --> 00:01:37.739
which is at 16,000 feet,

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:40.851
all the way down to Karachi at sea level.

00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:42.816
And in between, you'll find deserts,

00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:44.794
you'll find mountain valleys.

00:01:44.794 --> 00:01:49.510
It's some of the most rugged,
jagged mountain scenery

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.290
and glaciers I've ever seen in my life,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.938
and I was amazed by the
scenery of Pakistan.

00:01:53.938 --> 00:01:55.570
I want to say a massive thank you to Ali

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.882
from Pakistan Travel Mart.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:02:00.399
He organized our trip, he
helped with everything.

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:01.788
We traveled with him we ate with him.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.523
He's so much fun to hang out with

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:06.145
and without Ali, it
wouldn't have been possible.

00:02:06.145 --> 00:02:07.886
So, huge thank you to Ali

00:02:07.886 --> 00:02:09.757
for making this entire trip happen.

00:02:09.757 --> 00:02:11.167
And finally, I want to
mention that Pakistan

00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:15.807
hasn't always received the
most positive impression,

00:02:15.807 --> 00:02:19.482
and it has faced many
struggles and conflicts,

00:02:19.482 --> 00:02:22.261
but recently and then
in the past few years,

00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:25.089
Pakistan has made huge, major improvements

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:27.387
in safety and security.

00:02:27.387 --> 00:02:29.229
And for what it's worth, I would mention

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:30.914
that on my 16 day trip,

00:02:30.914 --> 00:02:33.728
and we traveled pretty extensively through

00:02:33.728 --> 00:02:37.838
many regions of Pakistan,
that not even on one occasion,

00:02:37.838 --> 00:02:41.322
even in the major cities,
even the remote destinations,

00:02:41.322 --> 00:02:44.628
did I feel threatened or in danger.

00:02:44.628 --> 00:02:46.519
And actually, it was the total opposite.

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.181
People just walking along
the streets, random people,

00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:52.646
they wanted to shake our hands.
They wanted to say welcome.

00:02:52.646 --> 00:02:53.640
They wanted to greet us.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.705
They wanted to say thank
you for visiting Pakistan.

00:02:56.705 --> 00:02:58.888
So, I owe it to the people of Pakistan.

00:02:58.888 --> 00:03:02.645
I'm so grateful for the
opportunity that I had to visit.

00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:07.173
It was privilege, and it was
one of the most memorable,

00:03:07.173 --> 00:03:08.692
one of the most unforgettable trips

00:03:08.692 --> 00:03:10.074
that I've ever had in my life.

00:03:10.074 --> 00:03:12.635
And one more thing. My new
favorite pair of footwear.

00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:16.294
Peshawari Chappals, with the thick soles.

00:03:16.294 --> 00:03:17.891
(laughing) Okay, that's
all. Thank you so much!

00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:20.309
Pakistan, it was the trip of a lifetime.

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:22.146
- [Man] Hey, how are
you? Nice to meet you!

00:03:22.146 --> 00:03:23.412
- How are you? I was out walking earlier

00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:25.421
in the morning, and I was thinking,

00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.074
how can I welcome you to Pakistan?

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:29.436
- [Man] Thank you very much!

00:03:29.436 --> 00:03:32.019
(lively music)
