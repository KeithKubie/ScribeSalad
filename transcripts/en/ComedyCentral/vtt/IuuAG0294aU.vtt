00:00:03.268 --> 00:00:06.205
 - Groundhog day, Super Bowl.

00:00:06.238 --> 00:00:08.541 align:start position:0%
 Seventh Super Bowl for the
 Patriots, and this new regime,

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:13.479 align:start position:0%
 I always have to clarify that
 now, because it's actually

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:16.182
 Patriot knucklehead fans who
 come out and say "oh we're

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:20.387 size:88% position:44%
  "nine, '85 Bears, and then
  we lost to the Packers."

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.756 align:start position:0%
 I'm talking about the regime,
 I'm talking Belichick,

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.025 align:start position:0%
 Brady, this particular regime
 being the greatest sports'

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:27.894
 dynasty of all time.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:31.497 size:88% position:44%
 It was a blowout, Patriots
 won easy, Falcons won easy.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.801
 So interesting game for the
 Super Bowl, listen, I watched

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:38.638
 the game, it was methodical,
 there was never any doubt,

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.840 size:84% position:42%
  I don't think there's any
  way the Patriots lose to

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:42.942
the Falcons, I close my
eyes try to imagine it,

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.711 size:88% position:44%
 I try to think, how can the
 Falcons beat the Patriots?

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:48.081 align:start position:0%
 I don't think there is a
 chance, I don't know what's

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.816
 gonna happen, the Falcons if
 they weren't, this is gonna

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:52.251 align:start position:0%
 sound weird, if the Falcons
 weren't the Falcons--

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.420
 - Yeah that's the biggest
 problem, the biggest problem

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:56.289 align:start position:0%
 with this team is that
 they're the Atlanta Falcons..

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.424 align:start position:0%
  - Right, so having said
  that, they're a good team,

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.726
 and it almost in a weird way
 reminds me of the Arizona

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:04.297 align:start position:0%
Cardinals who lost to the
Steelers, and the Steelers are--

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.798
 - You're not gonna beat them.

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.934
 - Yeah, Larry Fitzgerald had
 a huge game, and they were

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.937
 very good, and maybe better,
 I don't know what happens here

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
 but I know the Patriots are
 gonna win, and I'm gonna

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:17.076 align:start position:0%
get my revenge on Roger
Godell, with a crowd of Patriot

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.212 size:88% position:44%
  fans, which to be honest,
  the more I think about it,

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:23.116 align:start position:0%
 I don't know how part of that
 vendetta, that mob scene,

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.386 size:84% position:42%
  of people trying to just
  assassinate Roger Godell,

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:29.422
I mean what can you say?

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:32.992 size:84% position:42%
  Both games stunk,
  absolute stunk.

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:34.527
- It was not enjoyable to watch.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.062 align:start position:0%
 - And this whole season seems
 like a forgone conclusion

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.697 size:88% position:44%
 for the Patriots to
 win the Super Bowl.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.799
 - Every year, especially as
 a Patriot's hater, it's every

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:42.235 align:start position:0%
 year I just assume it's
 going to happen, and when it

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.770 align:start position:0%
 doesn't, that's the surprise,
 that's where it's at.

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:47.874
 - I agree with the name of the
 Atlanta Falcons, kind of like

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:50.343
 the Tampa Bay Rays,
 you just can't ever,

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.078
 you know what I mean?

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.613 size:84% position:42%
  (talking over each other)

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.848
 The Diamond Backs have won a
 World Series, but you're still

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:57.383 size:84% position:42%
  like "the Diamond Backs."

00:01:57.416 --> 00:01:59.785 size:84% position:42%
  The Falcons though, they
  are a very exciting team,

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:01.654 align:start position:0%
 that offense is like a video
 game, I know you're not

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:03.990 size:88% position:44%
 worried at all Dave, I know
 you're gonna say any time

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:07.260
I try to say "you know, this
team actually has some talent,"

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.796 align:start position:0%
they do have talent, the
defense has come on, I mean they

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.732 align:start size:88% position:13%
 shut out Aaron Rogers
 in the first half.

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:15.968 align:start position:0%
 That was legit, you don't
 just do that like by accident.

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:17.470
 And Matt Ryan is playing out
 of his mind, Julio Jones,

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:21.641 align:start position:0%
 Julio Jones is gonna be the
 best player on the field

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.709
in my mind on Super Bowl Sunday.

00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:25.244
- Better than Tom Brady?

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:26.712
 - At their current state, yes.

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:29.248 align:start position:0%
 - The problem though, is
 that the Patriots will just

00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:30.550
have someone step up and
play like Julio Jones,

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.051 size:88% position:44%
  like Chris fucking Martin!

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:33.886
 It doesn't matter who the
 stars are, the Patriots just

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.354
 always fucking do it anyway.

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:38.891 align:start position:0%
 - I just gotta do a callback
 here to what you just,

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:42.228 size:84% position:42%
  Tom Brady's playing as
  well as he's ever played,

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:43.829 align:start size:88% position:13%
and he's arguably the
best player of all time.

00:02:43.862 --> 00:02:46.566 size:84% position:42%
  - Julio Jones is making
  plays and running like a,

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.802 size:88% position:44%
 the plays he makes, I don't
 know how anyone could ever

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:52.171 size:88% position:44%
 guard him, I'm just saying.

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:55.174 align:start position:0%
That's one man's opinion, I
know you're obviously on Patriot

00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:56.642
mode right now.

00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:58.578
- I feel like the last
week it was Aaron Rogers

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.479 size:88% position:44%
  versus Tom Brady, and then
  like Rogers gets shut out

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:02.114
 and we just forget we
 had that conversation.

00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:04.283 align:start position:0%
 Julio Jones is a great
 player, but Brady is playing

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:06.018 align:start position:0%
 as well as he's ever played,
 he is the best player

00:03:06.051 --> 00:03:07.486
 of all time.

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:08.921 align:start position:0%
  - Any time Tom Brady steps
  on the football field

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:10.289 align:start position:0%
  he is the most influential
  player of that game,

00:03:10.322 --> 00:03:12.158 size:88% position:44%
  no matter who he's
  facing up against.

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.593
 - Yeah, that's probably fair.

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:16.596 align:start position:0%
 Julio Jones, I haven't
 seen, the stuff Julio Jones

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:17.797 size:88% position:44%
  is doing is like--

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.232
- I also like to say Belichick--

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.133 align:start position:0%
 - That's the difference,
 it's probably because Brady's

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:23.236 size:88% position:44%
  been doing it for so long,
  and it's the same Brady,

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.638 size:88% position:44%
  Julio Jones is doing shit,
  and I'm like "holy fuck,

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:27.540 size:84% position:42%
  "how is this guy catching
  balls at the same pace?"

00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:28.941 size:84% position:42%
  - I agree he's a great
  player, but there's also,

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:30.643 align:start position:0%
we're actually doing it
because, I know people are like

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:32.445
 "oh I'm not really thinking
 about that, I'm thinking about

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:35.081 size:88% position:44%
 "just, I'm so convinced the
 Patriots are gonna win this

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:37.350 align:start size:88% position:13%
 "game, I can't imagine
 a scenario they
 don't, because it's

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:38.951
 "the Atlanta Falcons."

00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:42.288
 But X's and O's wise, we will
 take Julio Jones out of the

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:45.358
 game, like the Patriots take
 your best offensive player

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.760 size:88% position:44%
  and somebody else is gonna
  have to beat the Patriots.

00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:50.963
 - Yeah, and the Falcons have
 all their guys, I mean some

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:53.833 align:start position:0%
  of the guys, Coleman,
  he's lie another guy who's

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.668 size:84% position:42%
  been making plays, you're
  like "holy shit, this guy

00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:57.136 size:88% position:44%
  "is a video game."

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.138 align:start position:0%
- Quick shout out to the stoolie
who pulled the fire alarm

00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:00.540
on the Steelers.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.342 align:start position:0%
 And then we got an email
 that they were talking about

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:06.178 align:start position:0%
all day, we got the police
report of him getting arrested.

00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:10.249
 That quote "I'm dumb, I'm
 drunk, and I'm a Pat's fan."

00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:13.986
 - And I love it, and
 to be honest, I think
 that's fair game.

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.589 align:start position:0%
 I think pulling fire alarms
 when you're on the road.

00:04:16.622 --> 00:04:20.693 align:start position:0%
 In the Super Bowl, we guarded
 the Patriot's fire alarm

00:04:20.726 --> 00:04:22.528
 because it got pulled twice.

00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:25.231
 If you don't want your fire
 alarms pulled, get home field

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:26.966 size:88% position:44%
  advantage, and by the way,
  don't let people find out

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.302
where you're staying, so
shout out to that guy,

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:30.970
tip of the cap.

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:33.239
 He did get arrested, I don't
 know what's gonna happen,

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:34.840
 but they should send
 him to the Super Bowl.

00:04:34.873 --> 00:04:37.343 align:start position:0%
 Good job by him, I don't know
 if you guys feel that way

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:39.645 size:88% position:44%
 or not, but I want to give
 him a shine since they sent

00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:41.414
 us the police report.

00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:44.016 align:start position:0%
 Moving on, away from the
 Super Bowl, and there will be

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:45.584
 a lot of Patriot talk.

00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:48.154 align:start size:88% position:13%
 By the way, the
 Falcons have no fans.

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:50.423 align:start position:0%
 I did this on the serious
 show, even the fans were like,

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.658 size:84% position:42%
  any Falcons fans call in,
  they didn't even call in,

00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:56.896 size:88% position:44%
  we had the number one like
  Falcon Atlanta radio show

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:59.398
 host, Ryan Finneran,
 we had him call in.

00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:02.835 align:start position:0%
  He was so boring, he
  couldn't even get excited.

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:05.237
If I was saying these things
that people are saying Atlanta,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.373 align:start position:0%
 I'm like "it's the worst
 city, no fans, they only have

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:11.010 align:start position:0%
 "strip clubs, it's a
 franchise nobody cares about,"

00:05:11.043 --> 00:05:12.578 size:88% position:44%
  they're like "yeah
  you may be right."

00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:15.682 size:88% position:44%
 I mean that's who
 we're dealing with.
