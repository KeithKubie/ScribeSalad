00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.080
Revenge is sweet, and a dish best served cold.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:10.440
Wait a second, is revenge ice cream?

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.330
Hello revengers, Jules here for DNews.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.330
We’ve all been there: a co-worker eats your
lunch out of the fridge, someone cuts you

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.780
off in traffic, a six fingered swordsman kills
your father, and you dedicate your life to

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.109
the pursuit of vengeance.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.170
But why do we have this impulse?

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.369
Why do we seek revenge?

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.180
Maybe it’s obvious: revenge is retribution,
it is an equal and opposite reaction, and

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.329
so it balances things and “feels good”.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:33.880
Or at least it’s supposed to.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.540
But research has shown that revenge doesn’t
actually make us feel how we expect.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.700
In 2004 Swiss researchers scanned the brains
of people contemplating revenge on a teammate

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.700
who had wronged them in a game.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.860
They found the caudate nucleus, an area associated
with reward, was active while the participant

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.870
mulled over how best to get back at their
cheating partner.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.030
But while it feels good to have that part
of your brain stimulated, actually acting

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.740
on those musings turns out to be a dead end.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.790
A 2008 study led by Kevin Carlsmith of Colgate
university asked participants to play a game.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.240
A group of people had the option to put a
dollar in a pool or keep the money for themselves.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.750
Whatever money went into the pool would be
increased by 40% and redistributed.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.340
Unbeknownst to the participants, one person
was planted to withhold their dollar and get

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.470
a free ride.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.110
After the game, participants were given the
option of punishing the freeloader, and were

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.479
then surveyed about how they felt immediately
after and again 10 minutes later.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.560
Surprisingly, people who chose retribution
reported they were still angry, even after

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.979
10 minutes when most others had moved on.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.600
They had delivered justice but they just couldn’t
get over the original transgression.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.859
Justice doesn’t simply cancel out the original
wrong.

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:46.499
But another study from this year muddies the
waters a bit.

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:50.270
Researchers from Washington University in
St. Louis set out to distinguish moods from

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.719
emotions, claiming Carlsmith’s study focused
more on moods which are lower intensity and

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.450
longer lasting.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.619
Researchers compared how Americans felt after
reading about something benign like food allergies

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.829
versus how they felt after reading about the
death of Osama Bin Laden.

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.530
They concluded that revenge puts people in
a bad mood because they dwell on the original

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.739
act, much like Carlsmith’s findings.

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.110
But revenge also does make people feel good,
at least for a little while.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.319
It’s a mixed bag.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.040
Temporary satisfaction for a trade off of
long-term dwelling.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.090
So if the arc of revenge is long and bends
toward dissatisfaction, why do we still do

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.090
it?

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.489
There are a few different takes.

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.650
Maybe vengeance is a holdover from when we
were simple herds of humans without a justice

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.650
system.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.239
If caveman Ook wants to steal caveman Grog’s
coconuts but fears Grog will bash his coconut

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.120
in, then Ook stays in line, Grog keeps his
coconuts, and society keeps on truckin’.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.920
Another angle is that we need revenge to be
a tool to teach lessons.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.560
One experiment by Mario Gollwitzer had people
play a game with a partner.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.140
I think you see where this is going.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.020
When their partner who was a secret plant
inevitably tried to cheat them, the participants

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.380
could take revenge AND send a message.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.110
Their partner would then either send back
an indignant response, an apologetic one,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.380
or no response at all.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.959
Only when they received acknowledgement of
wrongdoing did the avengers feel any better.

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.549
Otherwise they walked away feeling worse than
if they had done nothing at all.

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.000
When you consider that people who have been
retaliated against rarely feel it was warranted

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.719
or fair, you can see how this can become an
endless cycle where all parties feel wronged

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:20.360
and no one is satisfied.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.200
In the end, it looks like the best revenge
is to do nothing at all.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.909
If you want to end the vicious cycle and quell
those vengeful urges, it helps to be emotionally

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:29.909
intelligent.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:36.799
Laci explains exactly what that is here.

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:49.909
Have you ever pulled off the perfect revenge?

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.430
How did you feel afterwards, or how do you
feel thinking about it right now?
