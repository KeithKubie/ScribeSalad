00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.900
Voiceover:Rahul's two favorite foods

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.533
are bagels and pizza.

00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:08.633
Let A represent the event that he eats

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:13.233
a bagel for breakfast and let B represent

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:15.400
the event that he eats pizza for lunch.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.666
Fair enough.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.633
On a randomly selected
day, the probability

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:22.566
that Rahul will eat a bagel for breakfast,

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.767
probability of A, is .6.

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:25.933
Let me write that down.

00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:28.966
So the probability that he eats a bagel

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:32.333
for breakfast is 0.6.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:35.766
The probability that he
will eat a pizza for lunch,

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.933
probability of event B ...

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:40.233
So the probability of ...

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:41.666
Let me do that in that red color.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.166
The probability of event B, that he eats

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.733
a pizza for lunch, is 0.5.

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:52.340
And the conditional
probability, that he eats

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.766
a bagel for breakfast given that he eats

00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.500
a pizza for lunch, so
probability of event A

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500
happening, that he eats
a bagel for breakfast,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.300
given that he's had a pizza for lunch

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.933
is equal to 0.7, which is interesting.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.330
So let me write this down.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:15.100
The probability of A given,
given that B is true.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.000
Given B, is not 0.6, it's equal to 0.7.

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.433
And because these two
things are not the same,

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:27.330
because the probability of A by itself

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.833
is different than the probability of A

00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:32.701
given that B is true, this tells us that

00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:35.133
these two events are not independent.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.766
That we're dealing with
dependent probability.

00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:38.933
This shows us.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
The fact that B being true has changed

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.566
the probability of A
being true, this tells us

00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:47.667
that A and B are dependent.

00:01:47.968 --> 00:01:49.933
Dependent.

00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:51.900
And so when we start thinking ...

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.433
Well actually let's just, before I start

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:55.833
going on my little soapbox
about dependent events,

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:57.166
let's just think about what they actually

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.400
want us to figure out.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.566
So the probability, the probability of A

00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:04.566
given B is equal to 0.7, that's what

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:05.867
we wrote right over here.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.350
Based on this information,
what is the probability

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.133
of B given A?

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:12.433
So they want us to figure
out the probability

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:14.933
of B given ...

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.533
Probability of B given A.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.300
That's what they want us to figure out.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.566
The conditional probability that Rahul

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:25.167
eats pizza for lunch, given that he eats

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:28.300
a bagel for breakfast, rounded to the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.800
nearest hundredth.

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:31.966
So how would we think about this?

00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:33.366
And I encourage you to
pause this video before

00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:34.866
I work through it.

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:37.733
So I'm assuming you've given a go at it.

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:40.151
So the best way to tackle this is to just

00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:42.279
think about, well, what's
the probability that

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:46.670
both A and B are going to happen?

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:49.800
Well, the probably of
A and B happening ...

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:51.267
And let me do this in a new color.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.533
The probability of A and B happening.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.300
A and B.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.933
I want to stay true to the colors.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.700
Is equal to ...

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.733
There's a couple of ways
you could write this out.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.827
This is equivalent to,
this is equivalent to

00:03:09.827 --> 00:03:15.466
the probability, probability of A given B.

00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:21.466
Given B, times the probability of B.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.734
And hopefully that makes sense.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.100
The probability that B happens and that

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.900
given that B had happened, the probability

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.200
that A happens.

00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:30.466
And that would also be equal to ...

00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:32.833
So obviously this is A and B is happening,

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:34.500
or you could do it the other way around.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.767
You could view it as
the probability that B,

00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:42.133
the probability that B given A happens.

00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:47.600
Given A happens, times
the probability of A.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.833
Times the probability of A.

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:51.766
This also makes sense.

00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:54.333
What's the probability that A happened?

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:55.900
And that, given A happened, what's the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.670
probability of B?

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.833
You multiply those together, you get the

00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:00.800
probability that both happened.

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.600
So why is this helpful for us?

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:05.833
Well, we know a lot of this information.

00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:10.660
We know the probability
of A given B is 0.7.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.700
So let me write that, I'll
scroll down a little bit.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.467
This is 0.7.

00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:17.933
We know that the probability of B is 0.5.

00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:20.867
So this is 0.5.

00:04:20.967 --> 00:04:23.100
So we know that the probability of A and B

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.800
is the product of these two things.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.666
That's going to be 0.35.

00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:32.166
Seven times five is 35
or, I guess you could say,

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:35.333
half of .7 is 0.35.

00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:37.134
.5 of .7.

00:04:37.367 --> 00:04:39.567
And that is going to be
equal to what we need

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:40.566
to figure out.

00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:43.300
Probability of B given A
times probability of A.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.600
But we know probability of A.

00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:47.467
We know that that is 0.6.

00:04:47.835 --> 00:04:50.266
We know that this is 0.6.

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:53.166
So just like that, we've
set up a situation,

00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:55.500
an equation, where we can
solve for the probability

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.733
of B given A.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.466
The probability of B given A.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.100
Notice, let me just
rewrite it right over here.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.667
Actually, I'll write this part first.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:12.166
0.6, 0.6 times the
probability of B given A.

00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:13.800
Times that, right over there.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.166
And I'll just copy and paste it so I don't

00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:16.933
have to keep changing colors.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.266
That, over there, is equal to 0.35.

00:05:20.566 --> 00:05:23.933
Is equal to 0.35.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:25.833
And so to solve for the probability of

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:29.200
B given A, we can just
divide both sides by 0.6.

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:34.700
0.6, 0.6 and we get the probability of

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.233
B given A is equal to ...

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:38.600
Let me get our calculator out.

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:49.767
So 0.35 divided by, divided by 0.6

00:05:49.767 --> 00:05:52.660
and we deserve a little
bit of a drum roll here,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.730
is .5833 ...

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.230
It keeps going.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.200
They tell us to round to
the nearest hundredth.

00:05:58.366 --> 00:06:00.666
So it's 0.58.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:07.333
Is approximately, is approximately 0.58.

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:09.733
So notice, this is equal to 0 ...

00:06:09.767 --> 00:06:14.734
or I'll say approximately equal to 0.58.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.700
Once again, verifying
that these are dependent.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.900
The probability that B
happens given A is true,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.566
is higher than just the probability that B

00:06:25.566 --> 00:06:28.766
by itself, or without
knowing anything else.

00:06:28.766 --> 00:06:31.300
Just the probability of B is lower

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.500
than the probability of
B given that you know,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.700
given that you know A has happened,

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.933
or event A is true.

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:41.600
And we're done.
