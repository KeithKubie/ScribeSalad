00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.610
- [Instructor] The food cart has become

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.060
a popular business venture,
due to the low start-up cost,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.380
due to the low start-up
and overhead costs.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.910
So I read it the way it was
written with a comma here.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.980
So I pause a little bit,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.600
but that just felt strange.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.100
It feels like I don't need that comma.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.933
Let's read it without it.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.370
The food cart has become
a popular business venture

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.060
due to the low start-up
and overhead costs.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.100
Yeah, this is an unnecessary comma here.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.780
No reason why I would need
a pause in my speaking

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.420
at that point, or in my
reading at that point.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.040
So I wanna get rid of that comma.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.410
So I'm definitely gonna change it.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.130
And this is the only choice
that gets rid of that comma.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.680
This one over here goes even stronger.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.040
It puts a semicolon there,
which is really strange.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.350
The food cart has become a
popular business venture,

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.710
semicolon, due to the low
start-up and overhead costs.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.960
A semicolon should be separating
two independent clauses

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.390
if it's not being used to list things.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.740
And you would only use it to list things

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.680
is if you're listing things
that had other punctuation,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.020
especially commas, in it.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.030
But here, due to the low
startup and overhead costs,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.660
that's not an independent clause.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.970
So definitely wouldn't
wanna use the semicolon.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.640
And here, not only do they
keep the original comma,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.150
they add another comma at the end.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.090
So if I were to try to read it or write it

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.750
the way that this one describes it,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.740
or the way this choice is I would say

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.380
the food cart has become
a, the food cart has become

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.380
a popular business venture,
due to the low startup,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.770
and overhead costs.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.990
So that's really, there's
no reason why I would wanna

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.600
put a pause there and there.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.733
So rule that out.
