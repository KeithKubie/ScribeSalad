00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.590
Graphs of f of t is equal to
the natural log of t plus 5,

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.490
and h of t is equal to 2e to
the t minus 1 are shown below.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.590
So this is f of t
right over here.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.220
This is h of t right over here.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.587
Drag the variables to show which
equations they must satisfy.

00:00:14.587 --> 00:00:16.670
There can be any number
of variables per category,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.160
and some variables might
not go into any category.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.530
So what are they talking about?

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.820
Well, we have all of
these variables here

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.770
and they want us to drag them
into different categories.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.430
And if we look at
the actual graph,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.680
we see that these
variables correspond

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.520
to either the t-
or the y-coordinate

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.950
for each of these
points that they've

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.480
picked out right over here.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.880
And so we need to figure out if
you were to, for example, drag

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.100
this into this box,
that means you believe

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.810
that 2e to the t
sub 1 minus 1 is

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.790
equal to the natural
log of t sub 1 plus 5,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.070
that this variable, if you
substitute it in for t,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.410
that it's going to make
this equation true.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.860
If, for example, you were
to substitute this y1 in,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.720
that means that you think
2e to the y sub 1 minus 1

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.350
is equal to the natural
log of y sub 1 plus 5.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.110
And so the three
different buckets

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.060
that they give us are
essentially setting the two

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.600
functions equal to each other,
setting 2e to the t minus 1,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.550
which was h of t.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.680
So this is essentially
setting h of t equaling 0,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.620
and this is f of t equaling 0.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.360
So let's take each
of them in turn,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.940
and I copied and pasted
this onto my scratch pad

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.930
so that we can work
through the math.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.760
So the first case that they had
was setting these two things

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.450
being equal to each other.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.060
So what can we
substitute in for t

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.570
so that the natural
log of t plus 5

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.520
is equal to 2e to the t minus 1?

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.660
And that's another way of
saying for what values of t

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.190
is f of t-- this is another
way-- for what values of t

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.790
is f of t going to
be equal to h of t?

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.419
Well, two functions are equal
to each other at a given t

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.740
is, if you put that t in, they
both give you the same function

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.240
value.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.656
They both give
you-- in this case,

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:16.530
if we say y is equal to f of
t and y is equal to h of t--

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.370
they'll both give
you the same y value.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.930
So if when you input some
t in here to both of them,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.680
so you input the same
t into both of them,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.960
and if you get the same
output out of both of them,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.800
that would correspond
to the same point.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.380
So we're essentially saying,
where do these two functions

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.940
intersect each other?

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.100
And we see that they intersect
each other in two places.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.640
There's this place over
here, where the coordinate

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.130
is t sub 5 comma y sub 5.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.330
So you input t sub 5-- so this
is t sub 5 right over here--

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.190
you input t sub 5
into either function,

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.200
and you're going to get y sub 5.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.910
Or another way of writing
this is, f is y sub 5

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:07.500
is equal to f of t sub 5, and y
sub 5 is equal to h of t sub 5.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.750
You see that right over there.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.029
Take t sub 5, evaluate
your function h.

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:12.070
There you get to y sub 5.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.160
Evaluate your function f.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.500
There you get to y sub 5.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.345
Or you could say that f of t
sub 5 is equal to h of t sub 5.

00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:23.720
And I'm just writing it in a
million different ways-- not

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.011
a million different ways,
but a lot of different ways--

00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:27.060
so that you get the idea.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.210
And this is the same thing
as saying, of course,

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.870
that the natural log
of t sub 5 plus 1

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.580
is equal to 2e to
the t sub 5 minus 1.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.640
So this is definitely
going to be true,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.480
if t is equal to t sub 5.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.460
So let me just make
sure that we-- so

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.870
let me write t sub 5 there.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.375
So t sub 5 definitely
fits into this category.

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:55.590
You put t sub 5 in there,
then this is going to be true.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.120
And then we have another point
where these two functions

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.540
intersect right over here.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.090
If you input t sub 1 into
either function, t sub 1,

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.290
you get y sub 1.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.190
So once again, same
exact logic, t sub 1.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.810
This is also going to be true
if t is equal to t sub 1.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.420
So this is also going
to be true for t sub 1.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.220
So that first category we
could put t sub 5 and t sub 1.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.040
Let make sure you can
see what I'm doing.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.440
So that first category,
I could put t sub 1,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.360
and I could put t sub 5.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.750
Now, the next
category we're saying,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.010
when does 2e to the t
power minus 1 is equal 0?

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.130
So let's give myself a
little bit more real estate.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.680
So they're saying, when does--
let me draw a little line here,

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.340
because it's the next category--
when does 2e to the t minus 1

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.490
equal 0?

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.160
Which is another way of saying,
when does h of t equal 0?

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.824
And so if h of t is equal
to 0, and if we're saying

00:05:02.824 --> 00:05:04.490
and if we're applying
the function of 8y

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.906
is equal to h of
t, or essentially

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:08.660
when does y equal
h of t equal 0?

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.950
Or another way of saying this,
when does h of t intersect

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.380
the horizontal axis?

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.480
When is that graph
not above or below it?

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.410
Our y value here is 0.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.810
Well, h of t is the blue graph.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.880
It intercepts the
t-axis right over here.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.650
It intercepts the
t-axis right over there.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.170
We see that h of t
sub 3 is equal to y

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.870
sub 3, which is equal to 0.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.582
Or actually, I could even
write it this way. h of t sub 3

00:05:39.582 --> 00:05:43.660
is equal to 2e to
the t sub 3 minus 1--

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.690
that's just from the
definition of h of t--

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.020
and that we know that's
going to be equal to y sub

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.700
3, which is equal to 0. y
sub 3 is clearly equal to 0.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.770
We're clearly intersecting
the t-axis there.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.510
So t sub 3 would fall
into that second bucket.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.360
And that's the only place
where on the graph of h of t

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.740
where it intersects the t-axis.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.570
So t sub 3 is the only variable
I would throw into that bucket.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.690
So let's do that.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.947
So I would throw t sub
3 into this bucket.

00:06:07.947 --> 00:06:10.280
And then the last bucket,
we're doing the same thing now

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.880
for f of t.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.950
So f of t is the
natural log of t plus 5,

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.090
when does that
intersect the t-axis?

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.300
So this is f of t
right over here.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.470
We clearly see right at
this point, f of t sub 2

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.960
is equal to the
natural log of t sub 2

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:39.030
plus 5, which is equal to y
sub 2, which is equal to 0.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:45.310
So that last bucket, this
thing, natural log of t plus 5

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.480
is equal to 0-- this
was that last bucket--

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.580
this is going to be true for
when t is equal to t sub 2.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.190
So we could throw a t sub
2 in that last bucket.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.420
So let's do that. t sub 2 has
to go into that last bucket.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.060
And we are done.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.440
These other ones we
are not going to use.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.140
I mean the rest
of them, these are

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.460
the y values that
the functions take on

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.740
at those different points.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:15.070
And t sub 4, t sub 4
is kind of interesting.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.970
t sub 4 is actually
clearly equal to 0,

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.410
because that's when we
intersect the y-axis.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.300
So it's an interesting point,
but not one of the points

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.410
that would satisfy
those buckets.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.690
And now we can check our
answer, and we got it right.
