00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.238
To see the Ecommerce data, go to
Conversions &gt; Ecommerce &gt; Overview.

00:00:06.238 --> 00:00:10.695
So far, nobody's actually bought
anything in my app so I have no revenue.

00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:12.440
Let's look at shopping behavior.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.570
Shopping Analysis &gt; Shopping Behavior,
okay, that looks a bit more colorful.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.485
I had some sessions where some users,

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:23.715
who are actually all me at this stage,
viewed some products.

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:28.002
Then there was another session where
a user added the product to the cart.

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.942
But I still haven't implemented
the checkout code, so

00:00:30.942 --> 00:00:36.262
no checkouts, which is confirmed if
I look at the Checkout Behavior page.

00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:38.092
Nobody started checkout.

00:00:38.092 --> 00:00:40.190
Let's look at Product Performance.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.920
I see the product dinner listed, but
it hasn't brought any money in yet.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.304
This report includes products that
got as far as at least being added to

00:00:48.304 --> 00:00:48.983
the cart.

00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:53.348
If I drill down into the product, I see
a list of the SKUs, which is the same as

00:00:53.348 --> 00:00:58.250
product IDs for the products that were
involved in the shopping process.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.954
If I set the Secondary dimension
to Ecommerce &gt; Product Variant,

00:01:02.954 --> 00:01:06.986
I can see the names of the dinners
as well as the dinner ID.

00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:10.380
And feel free to explore what other
Secondary dimensions you can view.
