00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020
Honestly, the only reason
I'm doing this is 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.640
because nobody ever tags me in
these survey things and I feel left out. 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.110
So, there's the truth. 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.690
I didn't do this last year, so today
I'm going to answer all of the questions 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.460
from both of the surveys from last year
and this year in no particular order. Let's go. 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.130
My full name is
Charles Joseph McDonnell, 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.820
McDonnell meaning "son of Donnell,"
which I've never really understood, 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.890
although we do have a
family crest, so that's quite cool. 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.550
Joseph was my paternal
granddad's name, 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.120
and Charles came because
my parents liked it, 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.320
although I didn't,
clearly, hence Charlie. 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.050
My username came about because
I originally wanted charlieiscool, 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.550
but that was taken, so I added some
more words, and that's the whole story. 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.300
So this coat is my most
expensive item of clothing. 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.770
£50 at Topman. 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.860
I am not an adventurous
clothes buyer, sorry. 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.140
I do, however, sometimes spend embarrassingly
large amounts of money on other things. 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.900
For example, my chair
cost me over £700, 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.020
which is more money than some
people spend on their first car, 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.340
and my chair doesn't
have an engine. 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.530
Now although there's no correct
time to have your first kiss, 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.210
as one of the later bloomers
in the area of "lady intimacy," 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.760
I was pretty obsessed with the fact
that I just had to have my kiss 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.100
because I just felt
like I deserved it. 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.490
I was very shy kid,
so it did take me a while, 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:11.380
but when it finally did happen,
it was slimy and not particularly enjoyable, 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.870
but I was still incredibly
proud of myself. 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.830
The first gig I ever went to was
The Magic Numbers in Bristol somewhere, 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.470
which was nice but not a
particularly interesting story. 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.140
However, the first gig that I ever played
was when I was in my first band. 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.740
We were called
"Half Wink." 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.800
No we didn't realize
how stupid the name was. 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.230
We played two songs at
our school's Christmas fair. 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.910
I wrote both of them and
have no memory of either, 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.250
and although the attentive audience
consisted exclusively of our parents, 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.430
I still remember
it being quite fun. 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.600
Now although I don't have any memory
of wanting a job when I was little, 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.080
I do have this one distinct memory
of me in my first year of school 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.020
sitting in front of a computer and deciding
that I, Charlie McDonnell, little Charlie, 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.470
wanted to be a stay-at-home dad
with brown curly hair and a beard. 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.060
Needless to say, that is
still my ultimate life goal. 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.300
In day to day life, the strangest thing
I've probably eaten is pheasant, 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.790
which, boringly, is sort of
just like fancy chicken, 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.960
although when I had mine,
it came with bullets still in the bird, 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.350
and I didn't know
that at the time, 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.380
so I could have killed
myself chocking. Yay. 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.900
I did once drink a
milkshake containing 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.090
ketchup and fish fingers
among other things though,

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.730
so apparently, my dietary choices
can be pretty out there 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.500
so long as it's for the
purposes of the internet. 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.000
Now personally,
I appreciate the fact that 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.310
my name is relatively simple,
common, and uncomplicated 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.180
because it just made
my life nice and easy, 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.140
so naturally when
I have children, 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.310
I'm going to name all
eight of them Charlie. 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.160
No surname either,
just Charlie. 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.850
No, in terms of specific names,
that's up to me and the person 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.670
that I decide to have the babies
with if I even decide to have babies, 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.620
which I don't know yet. 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.060
Now although I don't have
a favorite school teacher, 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.100
my favorite teacher,
generally, is Mrs. McKuen, 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.290
who used to give me speech and drama
lessons after school every single week. 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.970
I was such a shy kid
when I was younger, 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.300
and so I don't think that I would have started
YouTube if it hadn't been for Mrs. McKuen 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.310
giving me the confidence to put
myself out there into the world. 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.110
So, thanks Vivian. 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.810
That was good. 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.020
I never had a group
of school friends. 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.170
There is no fun way to
say that sentence. 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.570
Now, I don't think
anybody hated me. 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.650
In fact, I could get along pretty well
with just about anybody in school, 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.050
but I just never
found my place. 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.160
It was only after I left school
and discovered YouTube 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.090
that my choice of potential friends
widened exponentially, 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.500
and I found people that I really connected
with, so thank you the Internet. 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.170
My favorite place in the
world is right here, 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.410
in my office, in my house,
in London. 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.000
It's not particularly exciting or
thrilling or anything like that. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.940
It's just comfortable,
and it's where my friends are, 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.500
or if they're not here right now,
it's where they can always come. 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.390
And ultimately, that's just what
means more to me. 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.020
Not the places in my life
but the people. 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.940
I'm only going to
tag one person: 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.020
because you can't have
over a thousand subscribers 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.710
and not have even one video
on your channel. 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.150
It's just rude, alright. 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.620
Bye! 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.980
STEPHEN FRY VOICE:You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike, 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.660
which makes you, like, cool. 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.810
Here's something I probably should
have told you about ages ago. 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.440
Whoo! 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.810
QualiTea T-shirts. 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.570
Imagine the size of the stamp
that was required to create that beast. 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.750
I'm yet to get over my discomfort
of selling things to you, 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.860
which is probably
a good thing, 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.810
but I wouldn't have made this if
people hadn't asked me to make it, 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.300
so if you want it,
here it is, 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.640
and if you don't want it,
how'd you like that? 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.700
Whooooaaaa oooooh!
