00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.570
Phil.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.930
PHIL: Hey.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.630
MIKE: Man, you got the Matchless
bobber thing going on here.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.500
Oh, that is cool.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.470
- How you doing, buddy?
- OK.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.500
- Hey, I'm Mike.
- Hey, Mike.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.430
How are you?

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.430
You talked to
Dani on the phone?

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.370
- Yeah, I did.
- Yeah, this is Frank.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.330
Phil, how you doing?
I'm Frank.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.130
- Hey, Frank.
- Nice to meet you.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.800
Pleasure.
- This is cool.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.770
What is this, '40s?

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.270
This is a 1947.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.670
You know, Brando had
a Matchless scrambler.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.670
Not in "The Wild One."

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.230
In "The Wild One,"
he rode a Triumph.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.970
FRANK: Is this
something you'd sell?

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.200
PHIL: Yep.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.630
FRANK: So, you know, I'm
checking out the motorcycle

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.500
a little bit, and I want
to see if the motor's free,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.870
so I kick through.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.230
Motor's free, sounds a little
gravelly in there, you know?

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.630
When bikes sit, all the oil
goes down into the crankcase,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.500
so it might need a
little top-end oil,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.770
make it a little smoothed out.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.300
It's just this kind of
bike needs to be run.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.200
Battery put in it, fresh
gas, throttle cable

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.230
fixed, and try to start it.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.430
Well, what would you
have to have for it?

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.800
I was thinking maybe 8.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.970
$8,000?

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.930
That's about a $4,500
bike, if it's running.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.730
I appreciate you putting a
price on it, but at $8,000,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.100
I'm probably not a player.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.900
Well, you haven't seen the
rest of the stuff I've got yet.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.300
FRANK: Right.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.370
Hopefully, Phil's not going be
pricing the rest of his stuff

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.630
like he's pricing this bike.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.170
So how long have you
been on this property?

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.200
We've been on this
property for 45 years.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.300
Really?

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.570
No kidding.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.930
So when you bought this,
were any of these houses here

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.130
and stuff.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.530
PHIL: It was completely--
that was a cattle ranch.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.730
There were no trees.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.100
MIKE: Really?

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.670
So you were, like, out of town
when you bought this thing.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.100
We were out of town.
Ugh!

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.570
Here, need some help?

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.800
Hasn't been opened in a while.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.630
MIKE: Whoa.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.570
FRANK: So you're into wood?

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.800
MIKE: Yeah, you like the wood.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.770
Hey, wood's expensive.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.170
PHIL: Watch your step going up.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.100
MIKE: All right, buddy.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.630
Oh, wow.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.330
PHIL: Just a lot of
architectural stuff,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.930
the old wood from the barns.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.030
When I started
collecting, I always

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.100
liked the looks of
things, and I thought,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.270
well, I can bring
this one piece home,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.930
maybe we'll use it in the house.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.330
And then it was the next
piece, and then the next piece,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.170
and it just got overwhelming.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.230
And now I don't even
know what I've got.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.330
Phil, man, you got
some doors, dude.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.530
PHIL: A few.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.670
MIKE: Oh, yeah.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.970
Phil has an unbelievable
amount of doors here.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.670
I mean, they're to my
left, they're to my right,

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.030
they're below me.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.300
Oh, my gosh.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.570
How many doors you got?

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.600
PHIL: Mm, few hundred of them.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.830
Ooh, look at
those double doors.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.730
You could tell that this guy did
a lot of architectural salvage.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.370
I mean, guys that collect that
stuff have a different eye,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.770
a very creative eye.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.500
There's a lot of
work here, Phil.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.770
They see it not just
in the application

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.200
that it was pulled away
from, but what it possibly

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.300
could be in a new life.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.130
This mantle's cool.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.470
Yeah.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.670
MIKE: This mantle is from
the Arts and Crafts movement.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.030
I like that.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.130
The Arts and Crafts movement
was about getting the craftsmen

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.700
back into the process.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.300
They wanted to show the
beauty of the furniture

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.970
and how it was made, and not
hide it behind embellishments.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.070
How long have you
had this piece?

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.230
Do you remember
where you got it?

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.330
Well, I got it, probably,
in the early '70s.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.670
It was out Grand River from
Detroit on the west side.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.230
It's been in this barn
for over 40 years.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.130
But if you were buying all
this architectural salvage

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.400
stuff, what were
your plans, overall?

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.200
What was the end result?

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.670
To use it.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.670
I've got a lot of stuff, and
I always figured I'd maybe

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.870
strip it, and then sell it.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.700
And now I should
be getting time,

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.730
because I'm getting old enough
that I can start working on it,

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.000
if I get room.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Would you sell it?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.270
Sure.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.230
MIKE: What do you got to
have for something like this?

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.600
$250.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.330
Man, I think it's incredible.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330
I'd do the $250.
I love it.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.830
I mean, the thing is
with Arts and Crafts

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.830
stuff, it's timeless.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:36.530
Yeah.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.230
MIKE: It really is.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.670
It's truly timeless.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.470
The great thing about
architectural salvage

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.930
is you can try to recreate
this kind of stuff,

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.770
but to have it be cost efficient
and to have it have the look,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.200
you're never going to get there.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.270
It's incredible.
