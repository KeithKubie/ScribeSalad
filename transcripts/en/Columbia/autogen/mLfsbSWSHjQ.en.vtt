about going around on a tour on the back

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540
about going around on a tour on the back
 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.270
about going around on a tour on the back
of a pickup truck and he was with an

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280
of a pickup truck and he was with an
 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.750
of a pickup truck and he was with an
aboriginal historian who was telling him

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760
aboriginal historian who was telling him
 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.470

various stories about the hills over

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480
various stories about the hills over
 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.510
various stories about the hills over
there and the river that they just

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520
there and the river that they just
 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.020
there and the river that they just
passed he realized that the stories were

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030
passed he realized that the stories were
 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.090
passed he realized that the stories were
going very quickly he could barely make

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100
going very quickly he could barely make

going very quickly he could barely make
out what was going on in one story

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900
out what was going on in one story
 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.440
out what was going on in one story
before the storyteller started narrating

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450
before the storyteller started narrating
 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.890

something else and after about 20

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900
something else and after about 20
 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.540
something else and after about 20
minutes he realized that the stories

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550
minutes he realized that the stories
 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.630
minutes he realized that the stories
were meant to be told while walking not

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640
were meant to be told while walking not
 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.550
were meant to be told while walking not
while driving around in a pickup truck

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560
while driving around in a pickup truck
 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.720
while driving around in a pickup truck
and they were really the stories by

and they were really the stories by
 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.690
and they were really the stories by
which the recorded memory of that tribe

which the recorded memory of that tribe

which the recorded memory of that tribe
was kept

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390
was kept
 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.560
was kept
and they were attached to symbols so

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570
and they were attached to symbols so
 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.850

mountains certain rivers and so on and I

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860
mountains certain rivers and so on and I
 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.550
mountains certain rivers and so on and I
tell you the story because this has a

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560
tell you the story because this has a
 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.430
tell you the story because this has a
link to mathematics believe it or not

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440
 
 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.250
 
mathematics is not something to be done

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260
mathematics is not something to be done
 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.380
mathematics is not something to be done
while driving around in the back of a

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390
while driving around in the back of a
 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.420
while driving around in the back of a
pickup truck which is effectively what

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430

we're going to be doing today because

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460
we're going to be doing today because
 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.200
we're going to be doing today because
we've got nine hours off of mathematics

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210
we've got nine hours off of mathematics
 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.060
we've got nine hours off of mathematics
and statistics and probability which we

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070
and statistics and probability which we
 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.510
and statistics and probability which we
really ought to take a couple of years

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520
really ought to take a couple of years
 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.470
really ought to take a couple of years
to do so this is obviously not the way

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480
to do so this is obviously not the way
 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.210
to do so this is obviously not the way
to learn mathematics but that's the

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220
to learn mathematics but that's the
 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.000
to learn mathematics but that's the
nature of our our culture and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010
nature of our our culture and
 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.980
nature of our our culture and
civilization so you have to learn it in

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990
civilization so you have to learn it in
 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.920
civilization so you have to learn it in
nine hours so that's one thing the other

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930
nine hours so that's one thing the other
 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.960
nine hours so that's one thing the other
thing is that mathematics is a language

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970
thing is that mathematics is a language
 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.650
thing is that mathematics is a language
for us for for our civilization in the

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660
for us for for our civilization in the
 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.040

it was so important for you to learn
 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.730
it was so important for you to learn
mathematics since you're presumably

it's a very important part of economics

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:51.550
it's a very important part of economics
 

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.050
it's a very important part of economics
but also an important part of

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.060
but also an important part of
 

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.600
but also an important part of
quantitative analysis in general and the

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:57.610
quantitative analysis in general and the
 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.430
quantitative analysis in general and the
science courses that you'll need to take

00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440
science courses that you'll need to take
 

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:07.500
science courses that you'll need to take
as part of the program in having worked

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:07.510
as part of the program in having worked
 

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.130
as part of the program in having worked
in interdisciplinary fields for a long

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:11.140
in interdisciplinary fields for a long
 

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.150
in interdisciplinary fields for a long
time I found that the intersection

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:15.160
time I found that the intersection
 

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.350
time I found that the intersection
between disciplines is always used to

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360
between disciplines is always used to
 

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:25.800
between disciplines is always used to
intimidate so for example when I was

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:25.810
intimidate so for example when I was
 

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.490
intimidate so for example when I was
studying for my PhD an important field

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:29.500
studying for my PhD an important field
 

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.620
studying for my PhD an important field
was law in economics you know so looking

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:34.630
was law in economics you know so looking
 

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.209
was law in economics you know so looking
at laws looking at the economic

00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:38.219
at laws looking at the economic
 

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:40.920
at laws looking at the economic
foundations of laws and since economics

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:40.930
foundations of laws and since economics
 

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.050
foundations of laws and since economics
was a relatively quantitative subject

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:43.060
was a relatively quantitative subject
 

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.800
was a relatively quantitative subject
and lawyers tended to ask you

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:45.810
and lawyers tended to ask you
 

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.980
and lawyers tended to ask you
mathematics and economics I found that

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:49.990
mathematics and economics I found that
 

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.410
mathematics and economics I found that
economists would use mathematics to

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:52.420
economists would use mathematics to
 

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:58.020
economists would use mathematics to
obfuscate their analysis for lawyers in

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.030
obfuscate their analysis for lawyers in
 

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:02.820
obfuscate their analysis for lawyers in
the same way in economics there were

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:02.830
the same way in economics there were
 

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.680
the same way in economics there were
those who were very mathematical and

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:04.690
those who were very mathematical and
 

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.720
those who were very mathematical and
those who were not so mathematical and

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:06.730
those who were not so mathematical and
 

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.630
those who were not so mathematical and
so the mathematicians who did economics

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640
so the mathematicians who did economics
 

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.340
so the mathematicians who did economics
use mathematics

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:11.350
use mathematics
 

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.720
use mathematics
obfuscate to the economist so there's

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:13.730
obfuscate to the economist so there's
 

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:18.100
obfuscate to the economist so there's
this chain of obfuscation which often

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.110
this chain of obfuscation which often
 

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.170
this chain of obfuscation which often
takes place in interdisciplinary work

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:20.180
takes place in interdisciplinary work
 

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.920
takes place in interdisciplinary work
and it's to break through that chain

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:22.930
and it's to break through that chain
 

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.850
and it's to break through that chain
that it is important for you to learn

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:26.860
that it is important for you to learn
 

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.790
that it is important for you to learn
the disciplines and not be intimidated

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800
the disciplines and not be intimidated
 

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.020
the disciplines and not be intimidated
by them so the key point of this math

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.030
by them so the key point of this math
 

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.860
by them so the key point of this math
camp but also of the sustainability

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:38.870

sort of approach where you read an

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:49.100
sort of approach where you read an
 

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.110
sort of approach where you read an
article and you gloss over the equations

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:52.120
article and you gloss over the equations

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.530
and then you can show the solutions
immediately so I encourage you to

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:17.540
immediately so I encourage you to
 

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.210
immediately so I encourage you to
actually try to do some of the problems

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:19.220
actually try to do some of the problems
 

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.759
actually try to do some of the problems
before you show the solution

00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:22.769
before you show the solution
 

00:11:22.769 --> 00:11:28.879
before you show the solution
and also there are primers in in most

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:28.889
and also there are primers in in most
 

00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:32.849
and also there are primers in in most
economics textbooks those will tend to

00:11:32.849 --> 00:11:32.859
economics textbooks those will tend to
 

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:35.159
economics textbooks those will tend to
be more concise and are more appropriate

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:35.169
be more concise and are more appropriate
 

00:11:35.169 --> 00:11:37.349
be more concise and are more appropriate
if you already know the material and

00:11:37.349 --> 00:11:37.359
if you already know the material and
 

00:11:37.359 --> 00:11:44.519
if you already know the material and
want a a quick review okay let me give

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:44.529
want a a quick review okay let me give

want a a quick review okay let me give
you the outline here so today we're

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:47.049
you the outline here so today we're
 

00:11:47.049 --> 00:11:53.759
you the outline here so today we're
going to go very slowly we'll simply

00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:53.769
going to go very slowly we'll simply
 

00:11:53.769 --> 00:11:59.789
going to go very slowly we'll simply
talk about functions and equations this

00:11:59.789 --> 00:11:59.799
talk about functions and equations this
 

00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:04.559
talk about functions and equations this
should be high school mathematics so it

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:04.569
should be high school mathematics so it
 

00:12:04.569 --> 00:12:07.369
should be high school mathematics so it
really should be review for everybody

00:12:07.369 --> 00:12:07.379
really should be review for everybody
 

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:12.389
really should be review for everybody
and just a way to get those mental

00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399
and just a way to get those mental
 

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:19.319
and just a way to get those mental
processes working again on Thursday we

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:19.329
processes working again on Thursday we
 

00:12:19.329 --> 00:12:22.079
processes working again on Thursday we
are going to attack calculus and that

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:22.089
are going to attack calculus and that
 

00:12:22.089 --> 00:12:27.989
are going to attack calculus and that
will be a very dense session I expect

00:12:27.989 --> 00:12:27.999
will be a very dense session I expect
 

00:12:27.999 --> 00:12:30.769
will be a very dense session I expect
that there may be some students on

00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:30.779
that there may be some students on
 

00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:33.659
that there may be some students on
Thursday who have not met calculus

00:12:33.659 --> 00:12:33.669
Thursday who have not met calculus
 

00:12:33.669 --> 00:12:37.819
Thursday who have not met calculus
before or are quite rusty on calculus so

00:12:37.819 --> 00:12:37.829
before or are quite rusty on calculus so
 

00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:41.419
before or are quite rusty on calculus so
it'll be quite a lot to cover in one day

00:12:41.419 --> 00:12:41.429
it'll be quite a lot to cover in one day
 

00:12:41.429 --> 00:12:46.169
it'll be quite a lot to cover in one day
but we will we'll go through it and I

00:12:46.169 --> 00:12:46.179
but we will we'll go through it and I
 

00:12:46.179 --> 00:12:47.879
but we will we'll go through it and I
will certainly at least figuratively

00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:47.889
will certainly at least figuratively
 

00:12:47.889 --> 00:12:51.899

a lot of what's in probability and
 

00:13:24.939 --> 00:13:27.779
a lot of what's in probability and
statistics there's not much in the

00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:27.789
statistics there's not much in the
 

00:13:27.789 --> 00:13:30.629
statistics there's not much in the
primer on calculus and and there's a

00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639
primer on calculus and and there's a
 

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:32.729
primer on calculus and and there's a
little bit on the statistics which I'll

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:32.739
little bit on the statistics which I'll
 

00:13:32.739 --> 00:13:35.199
little bit on the statistics which I'll
show you on the third day we

show you on the third day we
 

00:13:35.209 --> 00:13:39.639
show you on the third day we
is not actually in the primer also the

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:39.649
is not actually in the primer also the
 

00:13:39.649 --> 00:13:43.629
is not actually in the primer also the
aim in the primer is not intimidate too

00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:43.639
aim in the primer is not intimidate too

we'll talk a little bit about special

00:14:40.539 --> 00:14:40.549
we'll talk a little bit about special
 

00:14:40.549 --> 00:14:44.499
we'll talk a little bit about special
nonlinear functions that we often use in

00:14:44.499 --> 00:14:44.509
nonlinear functions that we often use in
 

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:46.269
nonlinear functions that we often use in
some of the science classes and in

00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279
some of the science classes and in
 

00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:50.769
some of the science classes and in
economics and we'll wrap up by talking

00:14:50.769 --> 00:14:50.779
economics and we'll wrap up by talking
 

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:52.689
economics and we'll wrap up by talking
about inverse functions and implicit

00:14:52.689 --> 00:14:52.699
about inverse functions and implicit
 

00:14:52.699 --> 00:14:56.049
about inverse functions and implicit
functions it will probably spend quite a

00:14:56.049 --> 00:14:56.059
functions it will probably spend quite a
 

00:14:56.059 --> 00:15:03.129
functions it will probably spend quite a
bit of time on a couple of examples okay

00:15:03.129 --> 00:15:03.139
bit of time on a couple of examples okay
 

00:15:03.139 --> 00:15:10.680
bit of time on a couple of examples okay
so what's a function

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:10.690
 
 

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:16.320
 
it's a rule a rule that assigns an

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:16.330
it's a rule a rule that assigns an
 

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:21.510
it's a rule a rule that assigns an
output to an input so you could think of

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:21.520
output to an input so you could think of
 

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:27.280
output to an input so you could think of
any rule as essentially a function for

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:27.290
any rule as essentially a function for
 

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.930
any rule as essentially a function for
example the function 2x takes any number

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:31.940
example the function 2x takes any number
 

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.240
example the function 2x takes any number
an arbitrary number or an arbitrary

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:34.250
an arbitrary number or an arbitrary
 

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:38.530
an arbitrary number or an arbitrary
quantity X multiplies it by 2 and gives

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:38.540
quantity X multiplies it by 2 and gives
 

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:44.440
quantity X multiplies it by 2 and gives
you the output which is 2x given that if

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:44.450
you the output which is 2x given that if
 

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.860
you the output which is 2x given that if
X is equal to five then 2x is equal to

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:47.870
X is equal to five then 2x is equal to
 

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.920
X is equal to five then 2x is equal to
10 right everybody feel comfortable with

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:50.930
10 right everybody feel comfortable with
 

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.220
10 right everybody feel comfortable with
the idea of function right we owe

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:54.230
the idea of function right we owe
 

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:59.650
the idea of function right we owe
leonhard euler the name you'll hear many

00:15:59.650 --> 00:15:59.660
leonhard euler the name you'll hear many
 

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:04.660
leonhard euler the name you'll hear many
times for the notion of a function or

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:04.670
times for the notion of a function or
 

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.490
times for the notion of a function or
the mathematical definition of a

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:06.500
the mathematical definition of a
 

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.940
the mathematical definition of a
function so an example of a function

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:11.950
function so an example of a function
 

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:15.430
function so an example of a function
this is this this was when I taught the

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440
this is this this was when I taught the
 

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.450
this is this this was when I taught the
math camp last year so this was fresh

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:18.460
math camp last year so this was fresh
 

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.510
math camp last year so this was fresh
this was in the news last years perhaps

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:22.520
this was in the news last years perhaps
 

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:28.510
this was in the news last years perhaps
less apropos today but so around this

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:28.520
less apropos today but so around this
 

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.330
less apropos today but so around this
time last year of course they were

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:30.340
time last year of course they were
 

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.430
time last year of course they were
actually maybe even two years ago there

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440
actually maybe even two years ago there
 

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:39.040
actually maybe even two years ago there
was the the Fed had a program to write

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:39.050
was the the Fed had a program to write
 

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:43.630
was the the Fed had a program to write
checks to large banks that lost money so

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:43.640
checks to large banks that lost money so
 

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.960
checks to large banks that lost money so
you might imagine a policy function that

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:46.970
you might imagine a policy function that
 

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:51.370
you might imagine a policy function that
says if a bank loses X dollars then the

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:51.380
says if a bank loses X dollars then the
 

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.770
says if a bank loses X dollars then the
Fed will write them a check for 2 X

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:53.780
Fed will write them a check for 2 X
 

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.070
Fed will write them a check for 2 X
dollars okay and so that would be a

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:57.080
dollars okay and so that would be a
 

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.310
dollars okay and so that would be a
function so any bank which loses X

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320
function so any bank which loses X
 

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.319
function so any bank which loses X
billion will receive 2x billion in in

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:05.329
billion will receive 2x billion in in
 

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:08.679
billion will receive 2x billion in in
low-interest loans okay so you can

00:17:08.679 --> 00:17:08.689
low-interest loans okay so you can
 

00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:14.679
low-interest loans okay so you can
represent a function in a tabular way so

00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:14.689
represent a function in a tabular way so
 

00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:17.740
represent a function in a tabular way so
when you see tables very often you're

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:17.750
when you see tables very often you're
 

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.870
when you see tables very often you're
really seeing a function

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:19.880
really seeing a function
 

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.410
really seeing a function
you may not see all the points in the

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:23.420
you may not see all the points in the
 

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:27.130
you may not see all the points in the
domain of that function in a table but

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:27.140
domain of that function in a table but
 

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.570
domain of that function in a table but
you are seeing an underlying function in

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:30.580
you are seeing an underlying function in
 

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.210
you are seeing an underlying function in
in that table you'll have a row with

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:34.220
in that table you'll have a row with
 

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.900
in that table you'll have a row with
inputs and a row with outputs remember

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:37.910
inputs and a row with outputs remember
 

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.480
inputs and a row with outputs remember
the function is just a rule that

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:39.490
the function is just a rule that
 

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:49.050
the function is just a rule that
associates inputs to outputs okay okay

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:49.060
 
 

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.760
 
this is probably a little hard to see

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:53.770
 
 

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:58.600
 
but let's okay so how many people here

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:58.610
but let's okay so how many people here
 

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:04.960
but let's okay so how many people here
have not met the Cartesian plane okay so

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:04.970
have not met the Cartesian plane okay so
 

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.820
have not met the Cartesian plane okay so
let's let's talk briefly about the

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:06.830
let's let's talk briefly about the
 

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:13.120
let's let's talk briefly about the
Cartesian plane it is simply a method of

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:13.130
Cartesian plane it is simply a method of
 

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:18.520
Cartesian plane it is simply a method of
graphically displaying two sets of

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:18.530
graphically displaying two sets of
 

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.510
graphically displaying two sets of
numbers paired sets of numbers so the

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520
numbers paired sets of numbers so the
 

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.440
numbers paired sets of numbers so the
function remember gives me an output for

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:26.450
function remember gives me an output for
 

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.270
function remember gives me an output for
an input a function is a rule that

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:28.280
an input a function is a rule that
 

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.050
an input a function is a rule that
assigns an output to an input the

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:32.060
assigns an output to an input the
 

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.780
assigns an output to an input the
Cartesian plane is a way of displaying

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:34.790
Cartesian plane is a way of displaying
 

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:39.430
Cartesian plane is a way of displaying
paired sets of numbers we use the

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440
paired sets of numbers we use the
 

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.840
paired sets of numbers we use the
Cartesian plane to display the graph of

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:43.850
Cartesian plane to display the graph of
 

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:49.000
Cartesian plane to display the graph of
a function and the graph is constructed

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:49.010
a function and the graph is constructed
 

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.810
a function and the graph is constructed
by taking as paired points the input and

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:52.820
by taking as paired points the input and
 

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:58.890
by taking as paired points the input and
output we usually think of the x axis as

00:18:58.890 --> 00:18:58.900
output we usually think of the x axis as
 

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:03.070
output we usually think of the x axis as
the input as the metric on which the

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080
the input as the metric on which the
 

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.640
the input as the metric on which the
input is displayed and the y axis as the

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:06.650
input is displayed and the y axis as the
 

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.370
input is displayed and the y axis as the
metric on which the output is displayed

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:08.380
metric on which the output is displayed
 

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.700
metric on which the output is displayed
so if

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:11.710
so if
 

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:19.080
so if
play the pair set of numbers 23 we

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:19.090
play the pair set of numbers 23 we
 

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:24.090
play the pair set of numbers 23 we
assign the value 2 to the x axis so we

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:24.100
assign the value 2 to the x axis so we
 

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.769
assign the value 2 to the x axis so we
move two squares of the right and we

00:19:28.769 --> 00:19:28.779
move two squares of the right and we
 

00:19:28.779 --> 00:19:31.769
move two squares of the right and we
assign the value 3 to the y axis we move

00:19:31.769 --> 00:19:31.779
assign the value 3 to the y axis we move
 

00:19:31.779 --> 00:19:37.620
assign the value 3 to the y axis we move
3 units up along the wire yeah okay if

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:37.630
3 units up along the wire yeah okay if
 

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.260
3 units up along the wire yeah okay if
you if you didn't know what a Cartesian

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:40.270
you if you didn't know what a Cartesian
 

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:42.240
you if you didn't know what a Cartesian
plane was before I'm afraid that my

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:42.250
plane was before I'm afraid that my
 

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:45.120
plane was before I'm afraid that my
explanation probably did not help you

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:45.130
explanation probably did not help you
 

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:53.539
explanation probably did not help you
but hopefully it it reminded you okay

00:19:53.539 --> 00:19:53.549
but hopefully it it reminded you okay
 

00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:56.070
but hopefully it it reminded you okay
okay so here's a graphical

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080
okay so here's a graphical
 

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.139
okay so here's a graphical
representation of the function we just

00:19:58.139 --> 00:19:58.149
representation of the function we just
 

00:19:58.149 --> 00:20:03.950
representation of the function we just
discussed we have the x-axis the input

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:03.960
discussed we have the x-axis the input
 

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:09.810
discussed we have the x-axis the input
loss amount for the bank the y-axis the

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:09.820
loss amount for the bank the y-axis the
 

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:14.010
loss amount for the bank the y-axis the
output the loan amount received by the

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:14.020
output the loan amount received by the
 

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.269
output the loan amount received by the
bank given to them by the federalism we

00:20:18.269 --> 00:20:18.279
bank given to them by the federalism we
 

00:20:18.279 --> 00:20:22.789
bank given to them by the federalism we
could draw for every potential loss an

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799
could draw for every potential loss an
 

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:27.330
could draw for every potential loss an
associated level of loan for example a

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:27.340
associated level of loan for example a
 

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.539
associated level of loan for example a
loss of five and associated level of

00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:30.549
loss of five and associated level of
 

00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:34.350
loss of five and associated level of
loan of ten join all the points together

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:34.360
loan of ten join all the points together
 

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:39.510
loan of ten join all the points together
that would be called a locus so that is

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520
that would be called a locus so that is
 

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.440
that would be called a locus so that is
every pair of numbers that satisfies the

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:43.450
every pair of numbers that satisfies the
 

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.500
every pair of numbers that satisfies the
rule would be the definition of the

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:46.510
rule would be the definition of the
 

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.289
rule would be the definition of the
graph of a function every pair of

00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:49.299
graph of a function every pair of
 

00:20:49.299 --> 00:20:54.659
graph of a function every pair of
numbers that satisfy the rule okay this

00:20:54.659 --> 00:20:54.669
numbers that satisfy the rule okay this
 

00:20:54.669 --> 00:20:58.620
numbers that satisfy the rule okay this
of course only works this Cartesian

00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:58.630
of course only works this Cartesian
 

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.600
of course only works this Cartesian
plane here the way I've drawn it only

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:00.610
plane here the way I've drawn it only
 

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.850
plane here the way I've drawn it only
works where you have one input and one

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:02.860
works where you have one input and one
 

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.560
works where you have one input and one
output there you can imagine a Cartesian

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:07.570
output there you can imagine a Cartesian
 

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.350
output there you can imagine a Cartesian
plane in many dimensions and we'll talk

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:10.360
plane in many dimensions and we'll talk
 

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.590
plane in many dimensions and we'll talk
about that next time when we when we

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600
about that next time when we when we
 

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.570
about that next time when we when we
talk about multivariate function

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:17.580
talk about multivariate function
 

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:22.110
talk about multivariate function
okay let's get to a little bit of

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120
okay let's get to a little bit of
 

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:29.250
okay let's get to a little bit of
notation y equals FX I'm sure you've

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:29.260
notation y equals FX I'm sure you've
 

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.110
notation y equals FX I'm sure you've
seen this obviously in the primer so

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120
seen this obviously in the primer so
 

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.910
seen this obviously in the primer so
many times indicates that the variable Y

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:35.920
many times indicates that the variable Y
 

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:41.280
many times indicates that the variable Y
is a function f of X so X is an input

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:41.290
is a function f of X so X is an input
 

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.630
is a function f of X so X is an input
and y is an output both x and y are

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640
and y is an output both x and y are
 

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.360
and y is an output both x and y are
variables that is their concepts that

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:48.370
variables that is their concepts that
 

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:53.220
variables that is their concepts that
are measurable and can vary f is the

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:53.230
are measurable and can vary f is the
 

00:21:53.230 --> 00:22:00.060
are measurable and can vary f is the
rule that assigns f of X 2 X okay exit

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:00.070
rule that assigns f of X 2 X okay exit
 

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.890
rule that assigns f of X 2 X okay exit
the input variable so known as the

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:01.900
the input variable so known as the
 

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.580
the input variable so known as the
independent variable Y is the output

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:05.590
independent variable Y is the output
 

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:09.230
independent variable Y is the output
variable known as the dependent variable

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240
variable known as the dependent variable
 

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:14.670
variable known as the dependent variable
F is the rule now a common source of

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:14.680
F is the rule now a common source of
 

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.230
F is the rule now a common source of
confusion is to think of f of X as a

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.240
confusion is to think of f of X as a
 

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.750
confusion is to think of f of X as a
function and this is a common source of

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760
function and this is a common source of
 

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:28.860
function and this is a common source of
confusion because everybody makes that

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:28.870
confusion because everybody makes that
 

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:34.590
confusion because everybody makes that
confusion but note that the rule is

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600
confusion but note that the rule is
 

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:40.020
confusion but note that the rule is
actually s an f of X is actually the

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:40.030
actually s an f of X is actually the
 

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:54.919
actually s an f of X is actually the
output so f is the rule and f of X is

00:22:54.919 --> 00:22:54.929
 
 

00:22:54.929 --> 00:23:01.319
 
the output because of course y is equal

00:23:01.319 --> 00:23:01.329
the output because of course y is equal
 

00:23:01.329 --> 00:23:06.899
the output because of course y is equal
to f of X and Y is the output and this

00:23:06.899 --> 00:23:06.909
to f of X and Y is the output and this
 

00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:10.339
to f of X and Y is the output and this
is a useful distinction to keep in mind

00:23:10.339 --> 00:23:10.349
is a useful distinction to keep in mind
 

00:23:10.349 --> 00:23:14.069
is a useful distinction to keep in mind
when you do calculus because one of the

00:23:14.069 --> 00:23:14.079
when you do calculus because one of the
 

00:23:14.079 --> 00:23:16.759
when you do calculus because one of the
things you'll do is change of variables

00:23:16.759 --> 00:23:16.769
things you'll do is change of variables
 

00:23:16.769 --> 00:23:19.979
things you'll do is change of variables
and so you want to make sure you

00:23:19.979 --> 00:23:19.989
and so you want to make sure you
 

00:23:19.989 --> 00:23:21.949
and so you want to make sure you
understand what's the function and

00:23:21.949 --> 00:23:21.959
understand what's the function and
 

00:23:21.959 --> 00:23:32.749
understand what's the function and
what's the optimum an example function

00:23:32.749 --> 00:23:32.759
 
 

00:23:32.759 --> 00:23:36.539
 
commonly seen manufacturing cost is

00:23:36.539 --> 00:23:36.549
commonly seen manufacturing cost is
 

00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:39.649
commonly seen manufacturing cost is
often thought of in economics as a

00:23:39.649 --> 00:23:39.659
often thought of in economics as a
 

00:23:39.659 --> 00:23:43.979
often thought of in economics as a
function of the quantity produced and so

00:23:43.979 --> 00:23:43.989
function of the quantity produced and so
 

00:23:43.989 --> 00:23:50.899
function of the quantity produced and so
you would have C as a function of Q

00:23:50.899 --> 00:23:50.909
 
 

00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:53.909
 
desired residential square footage as a

00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919
desired residential square footage as a
 

00:23:53.919 --> 00:23:56.939
desired residential square footage as a
function of family size but for example

00:23:56.939 --> 00:23:56.949
function of family size but for example
 

00:23:56.949 --> 00:24:01.589
function of family size but for example
okay so suppose that I give you the

we can just do it we can we can just do
it we can work it out yes Richard okay

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520
it we can work it out yes Richard okay
 

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.550
it we can work it out yes Richard okay
so that's a good question Richard the x

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:10.560
so that's a good question Richard the x
 

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.120
so that's a good question Richard the x

everybody see how to apply functions

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:55.090
everybody see how to apply functions
 

00:27:55.090 --> 00:28:00.940
everybody see how to apply functions
