00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well let's plug into this equation.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
When we carry out this multiplication, we get a result of -1.35 x10ยนโฐ J.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now notice that this is a negative number and in fact, if r were smaller,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so these were closer together, it would have been a more negative number.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It would have been a lower potential energy.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now in genuine physics, objects like to be in a low energy state.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Balls like to roll downhill and positive charges like to be with negative charges.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And we can see in this equation that if one charge is positive and the other negative,

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
well this energy will be negative, and this r want to be as small as it possibly can.
