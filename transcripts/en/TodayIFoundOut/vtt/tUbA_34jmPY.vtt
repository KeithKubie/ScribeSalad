00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:19.730
The 
British Special Air Service, better known

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.160
simply as the SAS has one of the toughest
and most unforgiving selection processes of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.130
any military unit on Earth.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.730
With a washout rate of around 95%, depending
on which source you consult, there are only

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.360
a handful of individuals who can claim to
have completed this fiendishly difficult course,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:45.360
and only one who can claim to have done it
twice-once with a broken ankle.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.870
This is the story of Donald Large.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.450
An almost mythical figure in SAS history,
Donald “Lofty” Large was born in 1930,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.000
spending his formative years watching soldiers
take part in field exercises during WW2 near

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.480
his childhood home in the Cotswold’s.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.009
Large was pretty much set on joining the military
from the moment he could shoot a gun- which

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.560
according to him, was about age 9.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.630
(His dad often took him game hunting.)

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.620
Serving with the Army Cadet Force in his early
teens and later joining the actual Army at

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.370
just age 15, as he matured into man, Large’s
height swelled to six and a half feet (1.98

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.729
metres), earning him the nickname “Lofty”
which would stick with him for life.

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.549
Over the next five years, Large honed his
skills in Germany and Hong Kong, but became

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.990
frustrated with the lack of action he saw
at the various British depots and bases he

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.159
was stationed at.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.250
This culminated in Large requesting a transfer
in 1951 to the Gloucestershire Regiment for

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.799
the sole purpose of fighting in the Korean
war, which he nonetheless admitted he thought

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.510
was a “useless” war.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.970
After being trained in Japan, Large saw combat
in Korea, taking part in the Battle of Imjin

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.340
and then defending a location that came to
be known as Gloster Hill in honor of the ferocious

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.460
defence his regiment mounted during the fight.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.819
During the battle, Large was shot through
the shoulder and was ultimately captured along

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.060
with several other men from his regiment.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.189
Despite a bullet and a lot of shrapnel embedded
in his body and with only basic medical attention,

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:22.049
he then survived a ten day forced march to
a POW camp near Chongsung.

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.749
During his internment at the camp, Large was
shot again, endured the pain of the bullets

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:32.779
and shrapnel still embedded in his body, came
down with a host of tropical diseases, and

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:37.010
generally had a pretty rough time.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.879
He would later recount that he learned to
cope with the pain by smoking the wild marijuana

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.709
that grew around the camp and reading the
exceptionally few letters from his future

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.760
wife, Ann (a nanny he met in 1951 while in
Hong Kong), that managed to get through to

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.760
him.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.650
(According to Large, it was about 1 in 5 that
made it to him, with Ann writing him almost

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.909
every day.)

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:05.989
Large spent two years in the POW camp going
from a muscular 217 lbs (98 kg) on that 6

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:16.599
foot 6 inch frame down to a mere 136 lbs (62
kg) upon his release as part of a wounded

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.200
prisoner exchange.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.840
As a result of two years of inactivity, his
injured left arm was almost atrophied to the

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.809
point of uselessness and most all the rest
of his muscle mass was long gone.

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:31.859
The extent of Large’s injuries were such
that the Army tried to discharge him on medical

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:37.550
grounds upon his return, but Large made it
known that his intent was to regain the full

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.000
use of his now withered limb and weakened
body and to return to active service.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.069
Four years later, during which time Large
had functioned variously as an instructor,

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.930
a military police officer and a quartermaster
for the Army, all while enduring daily excruciating

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.370
pain as he slowly built back the muscle he’d
lost in his arm, Large was once again fighting

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.569
fit.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.239
Almost as soon as he was declared fit to return
to service, he volunteered to join the SAS.

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.389
When asked why he wanted to volunteer, Large
responded simply: “I’m tired of all the

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:07.389
bullshit.”

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:13.099
He had grown to resent the monotony of daily
drills and military bureaucracy and wanted

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.529
to return to actual soldiering.

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:19.750
By all accounts, Large breezed through the
SAS’s notoriously difficult selection course,

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.990
which was specially designed to test the limits
of a given volunteers’ fitness and mental

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.310
toughness, with his only real issue being
his crippling fear of heights- kind of a problem

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.760
given that the regiment was called the Special
Air Service.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.960
As recounted by one of Large’s cohorts in
the SAS, his fear of heights came to a head

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.560
when he was required to learn how to parachute
from a plane and it became apparent his size

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.030
was going to cause issues.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.990
You see, Large weighed almost 240 pounds (108
kg) at this time, which, combined with the

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.860
equipment he had to carry, meant he’d fall
faster and hit the ground harder than other

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.860
commandos.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.750
This was even more of an issue at this time
because the parachutes were specifically designed

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.870
to ensure a typical sized soldier would fall
relatively fast anyway to avoid being a slow

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.170
moving target for any enemies on the ground.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.790
These now antiquated parachutes also had somewhat
limited control, so falling fast also helped

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.120
ensure the soldier wouldn’t land too far
away from the target zone.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.260
Another issue was that Large was so, well,
large that he couldn’t comfortably jump

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.260
out of a plane.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.240
In fact, he nearly died when he, in an attempt
to squeeze out of a plane’s fuselage early

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.890
in his training, became unbalanced (due to
the heavy load on his back and having to bend

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.400
so far down to exit the plane) and did an
awkward forward roll out of the aircraft.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.470
Things became dire when an equipment container
attached to his legs (along with his legs)

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.560
became tangled in his parachute’s cords
as he plummeted to the ground.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.760
Not for nothing is Large a legend in the SAS,
however.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.970
Keeping his composure while the ground rushed
up at him, despite Large being more or less

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.390
in an upside down position with his parachute
deployed, he managed to detach the equipment

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.500
container from his leg, and kick that leg
free of the parachute lines.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.440
Using his now freed leg, he then kicked the
tangled lines off his other leg, which resulted

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.950
in his body swinging around the right way
up and his parachute fully deploying, reportedly

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.700
very shortly before he hit the ground.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.700
Despite these setbacks, Large did complete
his parachute training to a satisfactory degree,

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.170
though it was noted in his records that he
was: “not suited to parachuting – either

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.000
in size or inclination.”

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.280
But here’s where things get ridiculous-
after completing what was, at the time, arguably

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.090
the most grueling selection course of any
military unit on Earth, Large crashed his

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.530
motorbike, shattering his ankle and injuring
his foot in the process.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.300
Thus, to prove he was still capable, he had
to pass the whole thing again.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.400
Large spent four weeks recovering and ended
up going through the selection process again;

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.000
this time wearing an oversized boot on his
injured foot to account for the bandages and

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.220
swelling.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.780
Knowing that he was able to pass the SAS’s
training course twice, the second time while

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.210
injured, it’s probably no surprise that
Large had no real problems serving with the

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.920
unit, taking part in countless combat and
reconnaissance missions across the world.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.140
During one mission, Large cemented his reputation
as a man you wouldn’t want to mess with

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.240
by punching out a donkey because it and its
owner annoyed him.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.010
The incident occurred while he was stationed
in Oman, helping to suppress a rebellion in

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.600
1958.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.600
Large stated of this,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.540
…All the donkey handler did was laugh.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.480
Just as I turned round, the donkey’s face
was right by me and it shook its head and

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.590
I stuck a punch in among it somewhere, and
the donkey went down like it was shot … much

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:20.690
to my amazement.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.470
But not as much amazement as the donkey handler’s
– I’ve never seen a bloke sober up so

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.470
quick.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.290
It was a hole in one: the donkey struggled
to its feet and looked really willing to go

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.060
up the hill and the donkey handler lost his
laugh.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.230
In a slightly more humane display, while in
Indonesia during Operation Claret, Large and

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.250
an SAS patrol were sneaking through the jungle
looking to kill Colonel Leonardus Moerdani,

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.260
the commander of the Indonesian Armed Forces.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.590
However, when they finally found him passing
by on a river boat, Large called off the hit.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.590
Why?

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.680
There was a female civilian on the boat.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.680
He stated of this,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.610
There could have been other women and there
could have been children on the boat.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.620
And we don’t do that sort of target, so
… it went.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.169
And it was in fact the very man we’d been
looking for for three months: Colonel Moerdani

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:09.070
of the Indonesian paracommando unit, and he
was on the end of my rifle and I let him go

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.730
– but … you can’t blat women and kids.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.710
Large stayed with the SAS after retiring from
active duty, training the next generation

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:21.690
of SAS commandos before retiring in 1973 to
enjoy time with his wife.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:26.020
For the most part, Large’s final years were
uneventful (at least compared to his antics

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.800
as a young man) though he did notably return
to the jungles of Borneo in 2003 as part of

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.039
a documentary about his regiment’s exploits.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:39.500
Large passed away at the age of 76 in 2006
after struggling with Leukemia for a few years.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:44.839
Today, a small memorial to this larger than
life man exists in the Allied Special Forces

00:08:44.839 --> 00:09:24.410
Memorial Grove in the form of a bench, donated
by his comrades in 2012.
