00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.960
So, here we are, back at the

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.100
prisoner's dilemma, again. You may recall this picture.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.650
&gt;&gt; Vaguely.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.590
&gt;&gt; Let's add to this, the minmax, or security level

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.070
profile. So, for prisoner's dilemma, what is the, the minmax?

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.660
&gt;&gt; Isn't it d comma d?

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.200
&gt;&gt; It is indeed. D comma d. Right so this

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.770
is value that you can guarantee yourself against a malicious adversary.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.690
Malicious adversary is just going to defect on you, and the

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.558
best thing you can do in that case is defect yourself.

00:00:22.558 --> 00:00:22.818
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:22.818 --> 00:00:23.818
&gt;&gt; Agreed, agreed?

00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:24.930
&gt;&gt; Agreed.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.025
&gt;&gt; Alright, so now let's take a look at the intersection of the following two regions.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:29.583
There's this nice yellow region that we've already got, and

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:33.281
then we've got a new region that's defined by this

00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:36.800
minmax point. This minmax profile. So the region that is

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.860
above and to the right of this, of this minmax point.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.301
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:44.210
&gt;&gt; So, the, that's the region. This, this region, alright we

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.910
already said that this yellow region is called the feasible region.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.380
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, or orange or whatever color it is.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.792
&gt;&gt; So,

00:00:49.792 --> 00:00:53.500
I'm thinking we can call this other region

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.902
the acceptable region. And it, and, the, what I

00:00:56.902 --> 00:00:58.414
mean by that is if you think about

00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:01.046
it, payoffs in this region are, smooth, getting more

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:03.062
than what smooth can guarantee itself in an

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:06.866
adversarial situation. And Curly getting more than Curly could

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:10.990
guarantee himself in an adversarial situation. So, these are

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.140
all, like, you know, better than it could be.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.620
&gt;&gt; So, why not call it the preferable region?

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.910
&gt;&gt; The

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.700
preferable regions, preferable to not being in this region.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.950
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.740
&gt;&gt; The intersection of these two

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.620
Is the feasible preferable acceptable reason?

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.940
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly. It's kind of, you

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.592
know, special, from the perspective that it

00:01:28.592 --> 00:01:33.100
is both feasible and preferable. And now we are ready to state the Folk Theorem.
