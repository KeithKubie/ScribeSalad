00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560
today I have a car trick I'm going to
 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.889
today I have a car trick I'm going to
show you this card trick here we go just

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899
show you this card trick here we go just
 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.619
show you this card trick here we go just
a bunch of cards and I need someone to

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629
a bunch of cards and I need someone to
 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:07.309
a bunch of cards and I need someone to
pick a card

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.980
pick a card
so let's randomly pick a card out of

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990
so let's randomly pick a card out of
 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.290
so let's randomly pick a card out of
there we go there's your card I haven't

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300
there we go there's your card I haven't
 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.690
there we go there's your card I haven't
seen it you're memorizing it and you can

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700
seen it you're memorizing it and you can
 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.730
seen it you're memorizing it and you can
stick it back in the pile here anywhere

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740
stick it back in the pile here anywhere
 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.779
stick it back in the pile here anywhere
anywhere you like

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789
anywhere you like

okay all right and just to be extra
 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.939
okay all right and just to be extra
careful that I didn't see anything it's

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949
careful that I didn't see anything it's
 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.460
careful that I didn't see anything it's
really mixed up in there there's no way

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470
really mixed up in there there's no way
 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.200
really mixed up in there there's no way
I could know it I'm going to shuffle

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210
I could know it I'm going to shuffle
 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.900
I could know it I'm going to shuffle
these cards and then now I'm going to

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910
these cards and then now I'm going to
 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.200
these cards and then now I'm going to
deal them out into three piles and for

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
deal them out into three piles and for
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.680
deal them out into three piles and for
show I need you to remember this card so

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
show I need you to remember this card so
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.139
show I need you to remember this card so
that you can mentally pass along that

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
that you can mentally pass along that
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.930
that you can mentally pass along that
information to me and we can help that

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940
information to me and we can help that
 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.410
information to me and we can help that
card rise to the top okay so you point

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
card rise to the top okay so you point
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.229
card rise to the top okay so you point
to which column you see your card I see

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
to which column you see your card I see
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.080
to which column you see your card I see
it this one here okay perfect

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090
 
 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.760
 
all right so we're going to divide them

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770
all right so we're going to divide them
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.930
all right so we're going to divide them
up again and I hope you remembering your

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940
up again and I hope you remembering your
 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.729
up again and I hope you remembering your
cards because otherwise this trick might

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739
cards because otherwise this trick might
 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.950
cards because otherwise this trick might
not work all right and now where do you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
not work all right and now where do you
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.640
not work all right and now where do you
see it yeah okay that makes me a little

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
see it yeah okay that makes me a little
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.820
see it yeah okay that makes me a little
nervous but that's alright alright one

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830
nervous but that's alright alright one
 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:27.380
nervous but that's alright alright one
more time just to be safe okay so think

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
more time just to be safe okay so think
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.210
more time just to be safe okay so think
hard about this card and where is it now

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220
hard about this card and where is it now
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.800
hard about this card and where is it now
it is this one this one oh all right I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
it is this one this one oh all right I
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:47.160
it is this one this one oh all right I
think that's okay all right

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170
 
 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.280
 
okay so point to four piles for me

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290
okay so point to four piles for me
 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.480
okay so point to four piles for me
please yeah let's go with that these

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490
please yeah let's go with that these
 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.850
please yeah let's go with that these
four here these four here okay great

four here these four here okay great
 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.580
four here these four here okay great
and now how about two piles from these

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590
and now how about two piles from these
 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.000
and now how about two piles from these
ones left these two on the end the two

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010
ones left these two on the end the two
 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.230
ones left these two on the end the two
on the end okay

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240
on the end okay
 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.190
on the end okay
and one more the one closest ta

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200
and one more the one closest ta
 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.080
and one more the one closest ta
this one okay oh no I'm feeling nervous

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090
this one okay oh no I'm feeling nervous
 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.490
this one okay oh no I'm feeling nervous
okay one of these cards please

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500
 
 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.670
 
middle one middle one how did we do

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680
middle one middle one how did we do
 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.300
middle one middle one how did we do
did we do it

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310
did we do it
 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.680
did we do it
oh wait did I not make it you got it I

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690
oh wait did I not make it you got it I
 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.720
oh wait did I not make it you got it I
got it oh think I was a little nervous

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730
 
 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.780
 
[Laughter]

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790
[Laughter]
 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.070
[Laughter]
that was very good right I imagined the

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080
that was very good right I imagined the
 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.810
that was very good right I imagined the
people in the audience are probably a

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820
people in the audience are probably a
 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.770
people in the audience are probably a
little more excited right maybe I'm a

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780
little more excited right maybe I'm a
 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.990
little more excited right maybe I'm a
little more relieved let's break it down

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000
little more relieved let's break it down
 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.120
little more relieved let's break it down
so the first thing we need to know is

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130
so the first thing we need to know is
 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.710
so the first thing we need to know is
the name of this trick is actually the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720
the name of this trick is actually the
 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.660
the name of this trick is actually the
21 card trick so the one piece of

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670
21 card trick so the one piece of
 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.280
21 card trick so the one piece of
information I kept from you is how many

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290
information I kept from you is how many
 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.560
information I kept from you is how many
cards I have so I have twenty-one cards

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570
cards I have so I have twenty-one cards
 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.690
cards I have so I have twenty-one cards
in my hand and so you can really start

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700
in my hand and so you can really start
 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.090
in my hand and so you can really start
thinking about this in terms of modular

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100
thinking about this in terms of modular
 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.660
thinking about this in terms of modular
arithmetic so I'm thinking about numbers

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670
arithmetic so I'm thinking about numbers
 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.300
arithmetic so I'm thinking about numbers
and when I divide that number by some

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310
and when I divide that number by some
 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.550
and when I divide that number by some
fixed number like three I can ask for

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560
fixed number like three I can ask for
 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.860
fixed number like three I can ask for
which remainder does that number have it

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870
which remainder does that number have it
 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.810
which remainder does that number have it
can have remainder zero so maybe it's

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820
can have remainder zero so maybe it's
 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.449
can have remainder zero so maybe it's
like six divided by three has no

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459
like six divided by three has no
 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.870
like six divided by three has no
remainder 7 has remainder 1 so 7 divided

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880
remainder 7 has remainder 1 so 7 divided
 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.470
remainder 7 has remainder 1 so 7 divided
by 3 I can get 3 times 2 is 6 plus 1 so

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480
by 3 I can get 3 times 2 is 6 plus 1 so
 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.780
by 3 I can get 3 times 2 is 6 plus 1 so
I can get 1 and then I can also have 2

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790
I can get 1 and then I can also have 2
 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.240
I can get 1 and then I can also have 2
so like 8 divided by 3 has remainder 2

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250
so like 8 divided by 3 has remainder 2
 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.550
so like 8 divided by 3 has remainder 2
okay so I can think about dividing up my

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560
okay so I can think about dividing up my
 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.789
okay so I can think about dividing up my
numbers any integer divided by 3 into

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799
numbers any integer divided by 3 into
 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.620
numbers any integer divided by 3 into
these 3 groups where the remainder 0

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630
these 3 groups where the remainder 0
 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.050
these 3 groups where the remainder 0
remainder 1 remainder 2 okay so we

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060
remainder 1 remainder 2 okay so we
 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.699
remainder 1 remainder 2 okay so we
picked and we picked a card that was the

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709
picked and we picked a card that was the
 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.890
picked and we picked a card that was the
first thing we did yeah

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900
first thing we did yeah
 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.520
first thing we did yeah
whatever nice time so hate this time two

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530
whatever nice time so hate this time two
 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.100
whatever nice time so hate this time two
of clubs okay so everybody knows and

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110
of clubs okay so everybody knows and
 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.870
of clubs okay so everybody knows and
it's okay because eventually I already

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880
it's okay because eventually I already
 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.280
it's okay because eventually I already
was going to know that but okay two of

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290
was going to know that but okay two of
 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.760
was going to know that but okay two of
clubs

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770
clubs
 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.640
clubs
so we stick it back in and just for show

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650
so we stick it back in and just for show
 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.220
so we stick it back in and just for show
I missed them up this was this is a

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230
I missed them up this was this is a
 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.840
I missed them up this was this is a
little cute this was a roof shot yeah

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850
little cute this was a roof shot yeah
 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.670
little cute this was a roof shot yeah
this is for sure I'm not doing anything

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680
this is for sure I'm not doing anything
 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.490
this is for sure I'm not doing anything
special here just to to add to the

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500
special here just to to add to the
 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.180
special here just to to add to the
enjoyment of the randomness of it all

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190
enjoyment of the randomness of it all
 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.060
enjoyment of the randomness of it all
you certainly my my dog could have

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070
you certainly my my dog could have
 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.699
you certainly my my dog could have
shuffled in I guess so two of clubs

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709
shuffled in I guess so two of clubs
 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.590
shuffled in I guess so two of clubs
that's the one we were looking for the

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600
that's the one we were looking for the
 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.530
that's the one we were looking for the
second step was to divide them up into

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540
second step was to divide them up into
 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.910
second step was to divide them up into
these columns so the card can definitely

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920
these columns so the card can definitely
 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.170
these columns so the card can definitely
be anywhere but now I'm dividing them up

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180
be anywhere but now I'm dividing them up
 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.240
be anywhere but now I'm dividing them up
into three columns if you recall we

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250
into three columns if you recall we
 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.430
into three columns if you recall we
discussed modulo arithmetic so we're

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440
discussed modulo arithmetic so we're
 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.110
discussed modulo arithmetic so we're
thinking about dividing up twenty-one

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120
thinking about dividing up twenty-one
 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.290
thinking about dividing up twenty-one
cards by three so one of those cards has

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300
cards by three so one of those cards has
 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.970
cards by three so one of those cards has
to be in the column where there you

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980
to be in the column where there you
 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.290
to be in the column where there you
could think the remainder is one the

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300
could think the remainder is one the
 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.240
could think the remainder is one the
remainder is 2 or the remainder is zero

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250
remainder is 2 or the remainder is zero
 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.650
remainder is 2 or the remainder is zero
and so we see our card here okay so the

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660
and so we see our card here okay so the
 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.540
and so we see our card here okay so the
first thing we want to do is make sure

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550
first thing we want to do is make sure
 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.030
first thing we want to do is make sure
that this column has to be sandwiched

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040
that this column has to be sandwiched
 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.540
that this column has to be sandwiched
between the two other columns and the

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550
between the two other columns and the
 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.159
between the two other columns and the
reason I'm going to do this is because

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169
reason I'm going to do this is because
 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.590
reason I'm going to do this is because
this one has seven cards in it I don't

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600
this one has seven cards in it I don't
 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.050
this one has seven cards in it I don't
know which card you know supposedly I

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060
know which card you know supposedly I
 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.270
know which card you know supposedly I
don't know which card it is but I know

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280
don't know which card it is but I know
 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.940
don't know which card it is but I know
now it's somewhere in positions so

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950
now it's somewhere in positions so
 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.740
now it's somewhere in positions so
there's seven here once I put this one

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750
there's seven here once I put this one
 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.659
there's seven here once I put this one
on top of these cards it's got to be

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669
on top of these cards it's got to be
 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:19.630
on top of these cards it's got to be
positions 8 9 10 11 12 13 or 14 so in

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640
positions 8 9 10 11 12 13 or 14 so in
 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.390
positions 8 9 10 11 12 13 or 14 so in
positions 8 through 14 lies your card

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400
positions 8 through 14 lies your card
 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.790
positions 8 through 14 lies your card
and then I'm going to add the rest of

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800
and then I'm going to add the rest of
 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.520
and then I'm going to add the rest of
these cards here and so that helps me

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530
these cards here and so that helps me
 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.740
these cards here and so that helps me
know for sure it's right in this section

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750
know for sure it's right in this section
 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.550
know for sure it's right in this section
8 to 14 so when I separate them up again

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560
8 to 14 so when I separate them up again
 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.040
8 to 14 so when I separate them up again
or divide them up into these three

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050
or divide them up into these three
 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.620
or divide them up into these three
columns here are the first seven those

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630
columns here are the first seven those
 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.450
columns here are the first seven those
are the ones that I stacked on top of my

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460
are the ones that I stacked on top of my
 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.300
are the ones that I stacked on top of my
group know I'm going there right here

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310
group know I'm going there right here
 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.400
group know I'm going there right here
comes eight so maybe I'll kind of go

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410
comes eight so maybe I'll kind of go
 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.610
comes eight so maybe I'll kind of go
like this so we can see 8 9 10 11 12 13

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620
like this so we can see 8 9 10 11 12 13
 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.730
like this so we can see 8 9 10 11 12 13
and 14 so there's that collection of

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740
and 14 so there's that collection of
 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.680
and 14 so there's that collection of
cards where your card has to live and

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690
cards where your card has to live and
 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.140
cards where your card has to live and
then I just do the rest of them here

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150
then I just do the rest of them here
 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.570
then I just do the rest of them here
and what happened is I took 8 through 14

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580
and what happened is I took 8 through 14
 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.990
and what happened is I took 8 through 14
I divided it up by 3 and those numbers

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000
I divided it up by 3 and those numbers
 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.470
I divided it up by 3 and those numbers
have to have remainder 1 2 or 0 and so

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480
have to have remainder 1 2 or 0 and so
 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.620
have to have remainder 1 2 or 0 and so
it did spread them across my columns and

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630
it did spread them across my columns and
 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.450
it did spread them across my columns and
now the rows that they live in has

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460
now the rows that they live in has
 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.510
now the rows that they live in has
shrunk so you can see that whatever your

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520
shrunk so you can see that whatever your
 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.030
shrunk so you can see that whatever your
whichever card we know that we need to

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040
whichever card we know that we need to
 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.240
whichever card we know that we need to
find has to be in row so this one goes

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250
find has to be in row so this one goes
 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.950
find has to be in row so this one goes
in here and here just to make it clear

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960
in here and here just to make it clear
 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.990
in here and here just to make it clear
has to live in Row 3 4 or 5 another way

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000
has to live in Row 3 4 or 5 another way
 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.030
has to live in Row 3 4 or 5 another way
you can think about it is as soon as I

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040
you can think about it is as soon as I
 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.970
you can think about it is as soon as I
do this the same thing of sticking

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:34.980
do this the same thing of sticking
 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.190
do this the same thing of sticking
whichever column you say your card in

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200
whichever column you say your card in
 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.280
whichever column you say your card in
which is here after 7 cards that means

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.290
which is here after 7 cards that means
 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.000
which is here after 7 cards that means
it's in position 8 9 10 11 and possibly

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.010
it's in position 8 9 10 11 and possibly
 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.340
it's in position 8 9 10 11 and possibly
12 because this one had three rows

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350
12 because this one had three rows
 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.440
12 because this one had three rows
involved okay so now I'm looking at

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:48.450
involved okay so now I'm looking at
 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.140
involved okay so now I'm looking at
positions 10 11 and 12

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150
positions 10 11 and 12
 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.660
positions 10 11 and 12
that might contain your card so now I'm

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.670
that might contain your card so now I'm
 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.370
that might contain your card so now I'm
going to pick up this column where your

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380
going to pick up this column where your
 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.350
going to pick up this column where your
card lives I'm going to put it between

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360
card lives I'm going to put it between
 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.260
card lives I'm going to put it between
the two columns of seven cards and now

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270
the two columns of seven cards and now
 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.960
the two columns of seven cards and now
we were remembering positions 10 11 and

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970
we were remembering positions 10 11 and
 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:03.320
we were remembering positions 10 11 and
12

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330
12
 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.260
12
that's where your card should live okay

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270
that's where your card should live okay
 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.320
that's where your card should live okay
so here are the first 7 8 &amp; 9

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330
so here are the first 7 8 &amp; 9
 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.900
so here are the first 7 8 &amp; 9
here comes 10 11 and 12 and then the

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:14.910
here comes 10 11 and 12 and then the
 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.470
here comes 10 11 and 12 and then the
rest of the cards so I knew your card

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:18.480
rest of the cards so I knew your card
 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.350
rest of the cards so I knew your card
should be somewhere in positions 10 11

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360
should be somewhere in positions 10 11
 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.890
should be somewhere in positions 10 11
12

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900
12
 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.440
12
and once I've divided those cards up

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:24.450
and once I've divided those cards up
 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.900
and once I've divided those cards up
I've spread them across the columns and

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:26.910
I've spread them across the columns and
 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.570
I've spread them across the columns and
so now when you point to the column I

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580
so now when you point to the column I
 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.550
so now when you point to the column I
know exactly which card it is it's this

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560
know exactly which card it is it's this
 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.700
know exactly which card it is it's this
one and now to make it more exciting

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:34.710
one and now to make it more exciting
 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.500
one and now to make it more exciting
instead of just saying oh here's your

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:36.510
instead of just saying oh here's your
 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.410
instead of just saying oh here's your
card what I'm going to do is again take

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:39.420
card what I'm going to do is again take
 

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.500
card what I'm going to do is again take
a pile of seven I'm going to stick it in

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:42.510
a pile of seven I'm going to stick it in
 

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.750
a pile of seven I'm going to stick it in
front of the pile that contains your

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:44.760
front of the pile that contains your
 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.990
front of the pile that contains your
card and then the other seven afterwards

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000
card and then the other seven afterwards
 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.440
card and then the other seven afterwards
that means 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 here's

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:54.450
that means 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 here's
 

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.270
that means 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 here's
your card it will always be in position

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280
your card it will always be in position
 

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.230
your card it will always be in position
11 so all I need to do in this second

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240
11 so all I need to do in this second
 

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.440
11 so all I need to do in this second
the last part of the trick is to count

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:02.450
the last part of the trick is to count
 

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:08.890
the last part of the trick is to count
so there's 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:08.900
so there's 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
 

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.420
so there's 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
there's your card so as long as I've

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:11.430
there's your card so as long as I've
 

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.610
there's your card so as long as I've
counted and I remember where the

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:13.620
counted and I remember where the
 

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.430
counted and I remember where the
card goes now I can finish out my trick

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440
card goes now I can finish out my trick
 

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.490
card goes now I can finish out my trick
and make sure that I remove all the

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.500
and make sure that I remove all the
 

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.620
and make sure that I remove all the
groups remove all the cards that are not

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:21.630
groups remove all the cards that are not
 

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.080
groups remove all the cards that are not
the 11th card and at the very end you'll

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:24.090
the 11th card and at the very end you'll
 

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.330
the 11th card and at the very end you'll
be amazed you told me to pick groups

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:26.340
be amazed you told me to pick groups
 

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.400
be amazed you told me to pick groups
that's right what were you doing I was
