you can continually charge it during
 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.619
you can continually charge it during
off-peak hours and then when demand is

off-peak hours and then when demand is
 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.270
off-peak hours and then when demand is
highest at that point you can pull from

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280
highest at that point you can pull from
 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.559
highest at that point you can pull from
the battery instead of the grid line

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569
the battery instead of the grid line
 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.030
the battery instead of the grid line
which means you don't have to build a

which means you don't have to build a
 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.920
which means you don't have to build a
bigger line you can use some other asset

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930

the long view what if I what is this
last 20 years right what is the overall

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360
last 20 years right what is the overall
 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.660
last 20 years right what is the overall
value I get on a daily basis if this

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.670
value I get on a daily basis if this
 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.430
value I get on a daily basis if this
operates for 20 years how do I make that

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440
operates for 20 years how do I make that
 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.830

work and so this was the approach that I

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410
work and so this was the approach that I
 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.930
work and so this was the approach that I
took started CMU and there's been a

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940
took started CMU and there's been a
 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.770
took started CMU and there's been a
spin-off company

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780

second you have a menu of viable
 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.280
second you have a menu of viable
materials and these are these sort of

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.290
materials and these are these sort of
 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.470
materials and these are these sort of
combinations of extremely common

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480
combinations of extremely common
 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.140
combinations of extremely common
low-cost things and then you have to go

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150
low-cost things and then you have to go
 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.610
low-cost things and then you have to go
through a series of steps with these

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620
through a series of steps with these
 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.659
through a series of steps with these
materials if you're going to work with

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:57.669
materials if you're going to work with
 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:06:59.340
materials if you're going to work with
these and this is what really you have

00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.350
these and this is what really you have
 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.510
these and this is what really you have
to pick from if you're going to do this

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520
to pick from if you're going to do this
 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.640
to pick from if you're going to do this
because it's a vast questions or huge

kinds of things of objects and the only

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750
kinds of things of objects and the only
 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.909
kinds of things of objects and the only
way you can make this work is if you

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919
way you can make this work is if you
 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.920
way you can make this work is if you
have this kind of stuff that it has to

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930
have this kind of stuff that it has to
 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.870
have this kind of stuff that it has to
be not that pure because any of these if

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880

they're too Peter also cost a lot of

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380
they're too Peter also cost a lot of
 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.650
they're too Peter also cost a lot of
money so it's a cost gate on that and

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:13.660
money so it's a cost gate on that and
 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.390
money so it's a cost gate on that and
then you assess what you would do and

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400
then you assess what you would do and
 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.950
then you assess what you would do and
how you manufacture with the materials

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960
how you manufacture with the materials
 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.510
how you manufacture with the materials
and you have to do a cost gate on that

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520
and you have to do a cost gate on that
 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.740
and you have to do a cost gate on that
so if you think about how would I use

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:19.750
so if you think about how would I use
 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.570
so if you think about how would I use
these and then you assess the

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580
these and then you assess the
 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.920
these and then you assess the
performance of how these might function

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930
performance of how these might function
 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.659
performance of how these might function
in a battery and the performance is

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:24.669
in a battery and the performance is
 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:26.370
in a battery and the performance is
assessed against key things the

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:26.380
assessed against key things the
 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.140
