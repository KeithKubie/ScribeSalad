00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So here's the code that we need to finish.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We need a test condition for the while, and in this case

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we really want to keep on going forever until we're done.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So, we're going to use while True and then use break to stop the loop.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The test condition is true, and the way we know when we're done is when

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the value returned as the URL was none.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That means we got to the else, so to finish,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we need to finish the else block by using break.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now let's test our code.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We'll call print_all_links with our test string

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that has test 1, test 2,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and test 3 as the 3 links.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And when we run this, what we see is it prints out the 3 links,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
test 1, test 2, and test 3.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We'll try a more interesting test.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
For a more interesting example, let's go back to the web page

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
we looked at earlier.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This was the page with the flying Python comic.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And it has many links in it,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we saw when we did view source we can see

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
what those links look like,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
so the first link that we see on the page.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So if we use Command-F [or Ctrl-F], we can search for the first link on the page.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We see that we have these links.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The first one is the link to Archive,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and that corresponds to what we see here at the top of the page.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Here's the link to Archive, the link to Blag,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the link to the Store and About and Forums.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And so there's a lot of links on this page.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If we go back to our print_all_links code, we can try to print them all.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
First, let's look at what we actually see when we do get_page

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
passing in the URL of xkcd.com/353,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which is the page we were looking at.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And when we run this, we see a lot of text printed out,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and that's exactly what we saw from view source,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
but now that's what we're getting as the result from get_page.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
That's the text of the web page.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Not very easy to look at.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Instead of using get_page, we'll print all the links on the page

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
instead of just printing the whole page out.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Now we're using our print_all_links procedure

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
to print all the links in the xkcd page.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And when we run this, we indeed see all the links on the page.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
At least we see most of them.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
There are a few that we missed, and we'll talk about that in a later unit,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
but we're seeing many of the links on the page, including the first ones that we saw

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
with the Archive and the Blag and the Store link,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and we're seeing lots of other links.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And you can see that we go all the way to the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Buttercup Festival link and the license link.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Those are the 2 at the bottom of the page.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
This is the link to license,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
which was the last one that we printed out.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So, congratulations are in order.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
You've made it to the end of Unit 2, and I hope

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
you understand the main concepts that we've seen so far.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
In Unit 1 we saw variables.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
We learned about programs.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We saw how to do arithmetic.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
In Unit 2 we learned about making procedures,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and we learned how to use if to make decisions,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and we saw that those by themselves were enough to do

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
every possible computer program as Alan Turing showed in the 1930s.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
We also learned about while loops,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
a way to make it more convenient to do things over again.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And now we've actually got a really good start on our search engine.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We can print all the links on the page.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We still don't have our web crawler.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
We need to actually collect those links and do something with them.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
That's what we're going to do in Unit 3, and then in Unit 4, 5, and 6,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
we'll see how to use the corpus that we've built

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to do useful web searches, but we've come a long way,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and I hope we'll see you back soon for Unit 3.
