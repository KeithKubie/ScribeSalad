00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.538
- WELL, THAT'S INTOLERANT.

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:07.374
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF THEY
SAID BAD THINGS ABOUT YOU?

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:10.143
- THAT'S ALL THEY DO!
I KNOW BECAUSE...

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:12.346
I USED TO BE A MEMBER.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.648
IT WAS 15 YEARS AGO.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.918
I WAS YOUR AVERAGE,
EVERYDAY LITTLE GIRL.

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.319
[grunts]

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:22.022
I WANTED TO PLEASE
MY MOTHER SO MUCH.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.057
[rip]

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:25.859
[girls giggling]

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:29.062
SHE JUST IGNORED ME
AND MY HANKERING FOR HOO HAA-ING

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:30.230
TILL SHE COULDN'T ANYMORE.

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:31.865
MY FATHER
AND THE CHURCH MEMBERS

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.534
MADE A "GAY CURING" MACHINE.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:36.103
THEY CALLED IT
"THE HOMO ERADICATOR."

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.105
- YOU LIKE THAT, SINNER?
DO YOU?

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:40.174
I'LL BET SLATER
FROM <i>SAVED BY THE BELL</i>

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:41.675
WOULD MAKE YOU SCREECH.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:42.876
- MMM...

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.112
- DOESN'T PAT SAJAK
HOLD YOUR GAY BACK?

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.280
- MMM...

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:48.248
- AND TRY ROMANCIN'
TED DANSON.

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:49.449
- MMM.

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:51.818
[slow beeping]

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:55.756
[rapid beeping]

00:00:57.758 --> 00:00:59.793
[electrical buzzing]

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:00.928
- YOU HAD ENOUGH?
- NO.

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:04.097
I WANNA SEE HOW IT ENDS.

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:06.633
WHEN IT DIDN'T WORK,
MY PARENTS DISOWNED ME.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:09.570
THEY BOUGHT A ST. BERNARD,
NAMED IT CONNIE,

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:12.239
AND PHOTOSHOPPED ME
OUT OF ALL THE FAMILY PICTURES.

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.374
I NEVER SPOKE
TO THEM AGAIN.

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:15.943
- MAN, THAT'S MESSED UP!

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:17.444
IF THEY WANTED
A DOG NAMED CONNIE,

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:18.745
THEY COULD'VE JUST KEPT YOU.

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:20.180
- SHUT UP, IDIOT.

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:21.949
CONNIE, I NEVER KNEW
YOU'D BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH.

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:24.284
WOODY, YOU CAN'T HAVE
THAT HATE-FILLED CHURCH HERE.

00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:26.086
- YEAH, YEAH.
MAYBE I SHOULD RECONSIDER

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.255
HAVING THESE HATE-MONGERS
AT OUR PARK.

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:29.923
- THEY PAID CASH.
- CHA-CHING!

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:31.625
WELCOME, HATE MONGERS!

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:33.727
WE NEED TO MAKE
THESE PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.329
TIME TO DE-GAY THE PARK!

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:36.830
CONNIE, PUT ON THIS DRESS.

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:39.132
YOW. THAT'S A TOUGH SELL.
HERE.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.502
FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS,
YOU'RE GONNA BE A STRAIGHT GUY

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:44.838
NAMED
CHESTER...BEEFBOTTOM.

00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:47.107
