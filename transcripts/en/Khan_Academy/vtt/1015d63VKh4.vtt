00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.810
So now we're going
to attempt to take

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.720
the derivative of the sine of
the natural log of x squared.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.320
So now we have a function that's
the composite of a function,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.005
that's a composite
of another function.

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:13.380
So one way you
could think of it,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:22.780
if you set f of x as being equal
to sine of x, and g of x being

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:32.500
the natural log of x, and
h of x equaling x squared.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.580
Then this thing right over
here is the exact same thing

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.340
as trying to take the
derivative with respect

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:48.070
to x of f of g of h of x.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.410
And what I want to
do is kind of think

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.030
about how I would
do it in my head,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.031
without having to write all
the chain rule notation.

00:00:58.031 --> 00:00:59.530
So the way I would
think about this,

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.613
if I were doing this in
my head, is the derivative

00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:03.780
of this outer function
of f, with respect

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.390
to the level of composition
directly below it.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.630
So the derivative of
sine of x is cosine of x.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.590
But instead of it
being a cosine of x,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.420
it's going to be cosine of
whatever was inside of here.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.530
So it's going to be
cosine of natural log--

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.070
let me write that
in that same color--

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.715
cosine of natural
log of x squared.

00:01:29.492 --> 00:01:31.200
I'm going to do x that
same yellow color.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.600
And so you could really view
this, this part what I just

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.990
read over here, as f prime,
this is f prime of g of h of x.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.380
This is f prime of g of h of x.

00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:54.870
If you want to keep
track of things.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.161
So I just took the derivative
of the outer with respect

00:01:57.161 --> 00:01:58.459
to whatever was inside of it.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:00.000
And now I have to
take the derivative

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.510
of the inside with respect to x.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.410
But now we have another
composite function.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.290
So we're going to
multiply this times, we're

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.060
going to do the
chain rule again.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.130
We're going to take the
derivative of ln with respect

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.600
to x squared.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.220
So the derivative
of ln of x is 1/x.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.720
But now we're going
to have 1 over not x,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.930
but 1 over x squared.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.345
So to be clear, this part right
over here is g prime of not x.

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:34.660
If it was g prime of x,
this would be 1 over x.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.460
But instead of an x, we
have our h of x there.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.810
We have our x squared.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.750
So it's g prime of x squared.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.190
And then finally, we
can take the derivative

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.280
of our inner function.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.630
Let me write it.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.790
So we could write this
is g prime of h of x.

00:02:52.126 --> 00:02:53.500
And finally, we
just have to take

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.740
the derivative of our innermost
function with respect to x.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.390
So the derivative of
2x with respect to--

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.910
or the derivative of x squared
with respect to x is 2x.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.010
So times h prime of x.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.800
Let me make everything clear.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.205
So what we have right
over here in purple,

00:03:13.205 --> 00:03:19.620
this, this, and this
are the same things.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.450
One expressed concretely,
one expressed abstractly.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.100
This, this, and this
are the same thing,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.720
expressed concretely
and abstractly.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.050
And then finally, this and
this are the same thing,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.237
expressed concretely
and abstractly.

00:03:39.237 --> 00:03:40.070
But then we're done.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.420
All we have to do to be done
is to just simplify this.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.100
So if we just change the order
in which we're multiplying,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.850
we have 2x over x squared.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.230
So I can cancel some out.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.820
So this x over x,
2x over x squared

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.610
is the same thing as 2 over x.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.160
And we're multiplying it
times all of this business.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.000
So we're left with 2 over x.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.420
And this goes away.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.870
2 over x times the cosine of
the natural log of x squared.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.950
So it seemed like a very
daunting derivative.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.630
But we just say, OK, what's the
derivative of sine of something

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.970
with respect to that something?

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.040
Well, that's cosine
of that something.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.680
And then we go in
one layer, what's

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.294
the derivative of
that something?

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:23.460
Well, in that something we
have another composition.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.466
So the derivative of ln of x,
or ln of something with respect

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:28.840
to another something,
well that's

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.320
going to be 1 over
the something.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.330
So we had gotten a 1
over x squared here,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.660
that squared got canceled out.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.192
And then finally, the derivative
of this innermost function,

00:04:37.192 --> 00:04:38.650
it's kind of like
peeling an onion.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.440
The derivative of
this inner function

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.482
with respect to x,
which was just 2x.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:43.690
Which we got right over here.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:44.870
This was 1 over x squared.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.160
This was 2x before we
did any canceling out.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.100
So hopefully that helps
clear things up a little bit.
