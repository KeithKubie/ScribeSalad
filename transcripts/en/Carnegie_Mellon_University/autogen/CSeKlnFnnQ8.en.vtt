if you look at waking hours then you

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520
if you look at waking hours then you
 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.370
if you look at waking hours then you
look in orange that's the percentage of

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380
look in orange that's the percentage of
 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.180
look in orange that's the percentage of
time spent in formal schooling and then

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190
time spent in formal schooling and then
 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.190
time spent in formal schooling and then
in blue is the rest and so the

there's a lot in there to be thinking
 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.170
there's a lot in there to be thinking
about and I think there's even a

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180
about and I think there's even a
 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.090
about and I think there's even a
reciprocal question which is as we

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100
reciprocal question which is as we
 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.190
reciprocal question which is as we
understand more about learning gains and

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200
understand more about learning gains and
 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.870

does that feedback into our thinking

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010
does that feedback into our thinking
 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.950
does that feedback into our thinking
within the learning sciences always

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:00.909
professional workforce preparation a
 

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:04.350
professional workforce preparation a
major a major issue of course for the

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.360
major a major issue of course for the
 

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.989
major a major issue of course for the
for the country and also a major

00:08:06.989 --> 00:08:06.999
for the country and also a major
 

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:09.869
for the country and also a major
research issue because we have large

00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:09.879
research issue because we have large
 

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:11.309
research issue because we have large
investment in the preparation of the

00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:11.319
investment in the preparation of the
 

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:12.389
investment in the preparation of the
workforce and so to do that

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:12.399
workforce and so to do that
 

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:14.159
workforce and so to do that
strategically and do it well we want to

00:08:14.159 --> 00:08:14.169
strategically and do it well we want to
 

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:15.809
strategically and do it well we want to
be sure that we're learning all that we

00:08:15.809 --> 00:08:15.819
be sure that we're learning all that we
 

00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:17.850
be sure that we're learning all that we
can about how to do it well and then

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:17.860
can about how to do it well and then
 

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.579
can about how to do it well and then
finally broadening participation in stem

00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:20.589
finally broadening participation in stem
 

00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:23.369
finally broadening participation in stem
bringing into the stem pathways and

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:23.379
bringing into the stem pathways and
 

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:25.379
bringing into the stem pathways and
pipelines people from groups that have

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:25.389
pipelines people from groups that have
 

00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:27.689
pipelines people from groups that have
not been well represented in stem people

00:08:27.689 --> 00:08:27.699
not been well represented in stem people
 

00:08:27.699 --> 00:08:30.049
not been well represented in stem people
from underrepresented minority groups

00:08:30.049 --> 00:08:30.059
from underrepresented minority groups
 

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:32.610
from underrepresented minority groups
people who are women people with

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:32.620
people who are women people with
 

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.490
people who are women people with
disabilities people of low socioeconomic

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:35.500
disabilities people of low socioeconomic
 

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.369

status people who've been isolated

00:08:38.369 --> 00:08:38.379
status people who've been isolated
 

00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:39.990
status people who've been isolated
geographically we are very concerned

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000
geographically we are very concerned
 

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.089
geographically we are very concerned
with making sure that our investments

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:42.099
with making sure that our investments
 

00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:43.369
with making sure that our investments
have a broadening participation

00:08:43.369 --> 00:08:43.379
have a broadening participation
 

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:47.129
have a broadening participation
commitment as a part of what we do so I

00:08:47.129 --> 00:08:47.139
commitment as a part of what we do so I
 

00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:48.629
commitment as a part of what we do so I
think now what I'd like to do is say

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:48.639
think now what I'd like to do is say
 

00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:50.850
think now what I'd like to do is say
just a little bit about about my take on

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:50.860
just a little bit about about my take on
 

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.740
just a little bit about about my take on
the learning sciences community the the

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:54.750
the learning sciences community the the
 

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.329
the learning sciences community the the
technology enabled learning work that

00:08:57.329 --> 00:08:57.339
technology enabled learning work that
 

00:08:57.339 --> 00:08:59.759
technology enabled learning work that
has been evolving over over a long time

00:08:59.759 --> 00:08:59.769
has been evolving over over a long time
 

00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:01.499
has been evolving over over a long time
and with so much of this work centered

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:01.509
and with so much of this work centered
 

00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:03.900
and with so much of this work centered
in Pittsburgh actually to point out what

how that development can feed back into
 

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.120
how that development can feed back into
the research and we probably need to

the research and we probably need to
 

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.610

have some explanation of how that

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:41.620
have some explanation of how that
 

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.470

a grand challenge kind of orientation
 

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.670
a grand challenge kind of orientation
which hasn't been very much used in

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:43.680
which hasn't been very much used in
 

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.370
which hasn't been very much used in
education at NSF how might something

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380
education at NSF how might something
 

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.470
education at NSF how might something
along those lines be more effective I'm

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480
along those lines be more effective I'm
 

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.140
along those lines be more effective I'm
very intrigued by lots of Tom's ideas

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:51.150
very intrigued by lots of Tom's ideas
 

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:52.460
very intrigued by lots of Tom's ideas
from this morning and we'll be exploring

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:52.470
from this morning and we'll be exploring
 

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:56.450
from this morning and we'll be exploring
some of those we also have I think not

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.460
some of those we also have I think not
 

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.710
some of those we also have I think not
been as

in the framing of research questions and
 

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.830
in the framing of research questions and
we would like to push on that I think a

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840
we would like to push on that I think a
 

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.840
we would like to push on that I think a
bit more and then finally all the

kinds of make progress in those sorts of
 

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.010
kinds of make progress in those sorts of
areas we have lots of programs that you

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.020
areas we have lots of programs that you
 

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.450
areas we have lots of programs that you
all know because you're all funded by

going to give it all to you right now I
 

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.899
going to give it all to you right now I
want to ask one quick question I know

00:24:28.899 --> 00:24:28.909
want to ask one quick question I know

people who've worked for large internet

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:30.740
people who've worked for large internet
 

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.310
people who've worked for large internet
companies which have really thought to

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320
companies which have really thought to
 

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.440
companies which have really thought to
use data to make consumers life better

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:35.450
use data to make consumers life better
 

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.210
use data to make consumers life better
they're about to do it they get

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:37.220
they're about to do it they get
 

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.470
they're about to do it they get
everything in shape and then they have

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480
everything in shape and then they have
 

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.669
everything in shape and then they have
to pull it at the last minute because

00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679
to pull it at the last minute because
 

00:24:39.679 --> 00:24:41.860
to pull it at the last minute because
the consumers are terrified of the

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:41.870
the consumers are terrified of the
 

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.680
the consumers are terrified of the
sinister aspects of it and I'm actually

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:44.690
sinister aspects of it and I'm actually
 

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.019
sinister aspects of it and I'm actually
very concerned about the possibility

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:47.029
very concerned about the possibility
 

00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:48.669
very concerned about the possibility
that we could put a national program in

00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679
that we could put a national program in
 

00:24:48.679 --> 00:24:51.279
that we could put a national program in
place to really improve outcomes but

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:51.289
place to really improve outcomes but
 

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:53.860
place to really improve outcomes but
then discover that society isn't ready

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:53.870
then discover that society isn't ready
 

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.659
then discover that society isn't ready
for it and you mentioned that in one of

00:24:55.659 --> 00:24:55.669
for it and you mentioned that in one of
 

00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:57.220
for it and you mentioned that in one of
the challenges but I'm interested in

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:57.230
the challenges but I'm interested in
 

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.740
the challenges but I'm interested in
whether you guys have focused on that

00:24:59.740 --> 00:24:59.750
whether you guys have focused on that
 

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:05.649
whether you guys have focused on that
question it's a fascinating question

00:25:05.649 --> 00:25:05.659
question it's a fascinating question
 

00:25:05.659 --> 00:25:08.950
question it's a fascinating question
actually I think the only way i can

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960
actually I think the only way i can
 

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.740
actually I think the only way i can
imagine real progress on that is through

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:11.750
imagine real progress on that is through
 

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.240
imagine real progress on that is through
sort of networked interconnected

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:15.250
sort of networked interconnected
 

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.919
sort of networked interconnected
examples so when that happens locally

00:25:17.919 --> 00:25:17.929
examples so when that happens locally
 

00:25:17.929 --> 00:25:20.799
examples so when that happens locally
when teachers and kids and parents and a

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:20.809
when teachers and kids and parents and a
 

00:25:20.809 --> 00:25:22.450
when teachers and kids and parents and a
school district figure out a way to make

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:22.460
school district figure out a way to make
 

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.899
school district figure out a way to make
something improve their there's a great

00:25:24.899 --> 00:25:24.909
something improve their there's a great
 

00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:27.549
something improve their there's a great
community support and level of interest

00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:27.559
community support and level of interest
 

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:30.220
community support and level of interest
and so if one could imagine some system

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:30.230
and so if one could imagine some system
 

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.470
and so if one could imagine some system
of that happening widely you might be

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480
of that happening widely you might be
 

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.000
of that happening widely you might be
able to build it from the ground up I

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.010
able to build it from the ground up I
 

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.010
able to build it from the ground up I
can't imagine that some sort of top-down

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:36.020
can't imagine that some sort of top-down
 

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.110
can't imagine that some sort of top-down
government government-funded people have

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120
government government-funded people have
 

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.580
government government-funded people have
figured out that this is what's best for

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:39.590
figured out that this is what's best for
 

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:44.320
figured out that this is what's best for
you working you know so I just wanted to

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:44.330
you working you know so I just wanted to
 

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:46.539
you working you know so I just wanted to
add something to that which is some

00:25:46.539 --> 00:25:46.549
add something to that which is some
 

00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:48.700
add something to that which is some
political scientists have come up with a

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:48.710
political scientists have come up with a
 

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.610
political scientists have come up with a
notion of deliberative polling and the

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:51.620
notion of deliberative polling and the
 

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.799
notion of deliberative polling and the
premise is that if you just take a

00:25:53.799 --> 00:25:53.809
premise is that if you just take a
 

00:25:53.809 --> 00:25:55.899
premise is that if you just take a
really complicated subject and and ask

00:25:55.899 --> 00:25:55.909
really complicated subject and and ask
 

00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:57.940
really complicated subject and and ask
someone a bunch of survey questions

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:57.950
someone a bunch of survey questions
 

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.340
someone a bunch of survey questions
you're not you're not likely to get very

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:00.350
you're not you're not likely to get very
 

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:03.039
you're not you're not likely to get very
informative answers so what they've done

00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:03.049
informative answers so what they've done
 

00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:05.620
informative answers so what they've done
is to say well we're going to take you

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:05.630
is to say well we're going to take you
 

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.450
is to say well we're going to take you
know a weekend or a couple days and

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:07.460
know a weekend or a couple days and
 

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:13.060
know a weekend or a couple days and
we're going to expose people to experts

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:13.070
we're going to expose people to experts
 

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.130
we're going to expose people to experts
who have multiple points of views on

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:15.140
who have multiple points of views on
 

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.669
who have multiple points of views on
this subject and give them some

00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:18.679
this subject and give them some
 

00:26:18.679 --> 00:26:20.230
this subject and give them some
background reading and give them an

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240
background reading and give them an
 

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.390
background reading and give them an
opportunity to grill the experts

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400
opportunity to grill the experts
 

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.360
opportunity to grill the experts
