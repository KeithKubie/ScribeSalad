00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.130
so today I'm going to tell you about

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:01.140
so today I'm going to tell you about
 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.679
so today I'm going to tell you about
what's called Catalans conjecture so

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689
what's called Catalans conjecture so
 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:04.700
what's called Catalans conjecture so
even though it's called the conjecture

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710
even though it's called the conjecture
 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.470
even though it's called the conjecture
it's actually known so this was proved

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480
it's actually known so this was proved
 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.259
it's actually known so this was proved
by a mathematician about 15 years ago

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269
by a mathematician about 15 years ago
 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.390
by a mathematician about 15 years ago
and it's a question about or a statement

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
and it's a question about or a statement
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.350
and it's a question about or a statement
about perfect powers okay so what do I

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
about perfect powers okay so what do I
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.849
about perfect powers okay so what do I
mean by perfect powers first of all I

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859
mean by perfect powers first of all I
 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.980
mean by perfect powers first of all I
mean take some whole number 1 2 3 so on

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990
mean take some whole number 1 2 3 so on
 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.870
mean take some whole number 1 2 3 so on
and raise it to a power which is larger

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
and raise it to a power which is larger
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.660
and raise it to a power which is larger
than 1 okay so squares cubes and so on

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670
than 1 okay so squares cubes and so on
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.790
than 1 okay so squares cubes and so on
so if you start to write these things

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800
so if you start to write these things
 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.040
so if you start to write these things
down one is a perfect power in fact a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050
down one is a perfect power in fact a
 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.310
down one is a perfect power in fact a
power of itself to any exponent 2 is not

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320
power of itself to any exponent 2 is not
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.560
power of itself to any exponent 2 is not
3 is not but then we get 4 which is 2

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
3 is not but then we get 4 which is 2
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.900
3 is not but then we get 4 which is 2
squared then we have to go up to I guess

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
squared then we have to go up to I guess
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.410
squared then we have to go up to I guess
8 which is 2 cubed and 9 is 3 squared +

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420
8 which is 2 cubed and 9 is 3 squared +
 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.830
8 which is 2 cubed and 9 is 3 squared +
16 25 am I gonna run into any cube soon

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
16 25 am I gonna run into any cube soon
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.549
16 25 am I gonna run into any cube soon
let's see Oh 27 and 36 and 49 and so on

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
let's see Oh 27 and 36 and 49 and so on
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.470
let's see Oh 27 and 36 and 49 and so on
so these are numbers that can be built

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
so these are numbers that can be built
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.750
so these are numbers that can be built
by taking two integers and raising one

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760
by taking two integers and raising one
 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.029
by taking two integers and raising one
to the power that's exactly right yeah

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039
to the power that's exactly right yeah
 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.560
to the power that's exactly right yeah
so of course all we've seen so far

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570
so of course all we've seen so far
 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.060
so of course all we've seen so far
mostly squares and cubes

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070
mostly squares and cubes
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.490
mostly squares and cubes
I guess 16 is also a fourth power but

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
I guess 16 is also a fourth power but
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.260
I guess 16 is also a fourth power but
you can take the exponent to be as large

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270
you can take the exponent to be as large
 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.940
you can take the exponent to be as large
as you want raise it as high of a power

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
as you want raise it as high of a power
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.350
as you want raise it as high of a power
as you want and you can take the number

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
as you want and you can take the number
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.789
as you want and you can take the number
to be as large as you want to I'm just

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799
to be as large as you want to I'm just
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.230
to be as large as you want to I'm just
trying to put them in order so do these

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
trying to put them in order so do these
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.660
trying to put them in order so do these
numbers become more common or less

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670
numbers become more common or less
 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.850
numbers become more common or less
common as we go down the number line so

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
common as we go down the number line so
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.070
common as we go down the number line so
they become less common and generally

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
they become less common and generally
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.690
they become less common and generally
you think they're spread out right like

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
you think they're spread out right like
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550
you think they're spread out right like
just think about squares for example if

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
just think about squares for example if
 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.380
just think about squares for example if
you hand me a big number like a million

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390
you hand me a big number like a million
 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.060
you hand me a big number like a million
and you want to know about how many

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
and you want to know about how many
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.920
and you want to know about how many
squares are less than a million well

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
squares are less than a million well
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.330
squares are less than a million well
it's about square root of a million

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
it's about square root of a million
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.399
it's about square root of a million
right because that's how small the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
right because that's how small the
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.109
right because that's how small the
number has to be to be less than a

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
number has to be to be less than a
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.219
number has to be to be less than a
million after you square it

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229
million after you square it
 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.450
million after you square it
they're cool numbers they're kind of

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
they're cool numbers they're kind of
 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.830
they're cool numbers they're kind of
spread out as you go along and get

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
spread out as you go along and get
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.200
spread out as you go along and get
bigger and bigger but notice that in the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210
bigger and bigger but notice that in the
 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.999
bigger and bigger but notice that in the
beginning here some of them are close

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
beginning here some of them are close
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.950
beginning here some of them are close
together so we've got actually a pair of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
together so we've got actually a pair of
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.100
together so we've got actually a pair of
consecutive powers so separated only by

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
consecutive powers so separated only by
 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.170
consecutive powers so separated only by
one I guess here we have separated by

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
one I guess here we have separated by
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.859
one I guess here we have separated by
two and three and four and so on so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
two and three and four and so on so
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.810
two and three and four and so on so
there's some separation here but what

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
there's some separation here but what
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.670
there's some separation here but what
kadhalan conjectured and this is a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
kadhalan conjectured and this is a
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.170
kadhalan conjectured and this is a
question people have been interested in

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
question people have been interested in
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.780
question people have been interested in
for hundreds of years actually is this

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
for hundreds of years actually is this
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.060
for hundreds of years actually is this
particular pair of eight and nine so the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070
particular pair of eight and nine so the
 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.550
particular pair of eight and nine so the
fact that three squared minus two cubed

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
fact that three squared minus two cubed
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.709
fact that three squared minus two cubed
is equal to one or it really that you

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719
is equal to one or it really that you
 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.839
is equal to one or it really that you
have any two powers which differ by one

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
have any two powers which differ by one
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.900
have any two powers which differ by one
no other example of that was known and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910
no other example of that was known and
 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.590
no other example of that was known and
so what kadhalan conjectured is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600
so what kadhalan conjectured is
 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.380
so what kadhalan conjectured is
this is the only time that this happens

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390
this is the only time that this happens
 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.510
this is the only time that this happens
that you have two powers whose

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520
that you have two powers whose
 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.640
that you have two powers whose
difference is exactly one but it was

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650
difference is exactly one but it was
 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.900
difference is exactly one but it was
unknown if like a gajillion and four

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910
unknown if like a gajillion and four
 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.460
unknown if like a gajillion and four
yeah that's exactly right that's oh we

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470
yeah that's exactly right that's oh we
 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.780
yeah that's exactly right that's oh we
didn't know for a long time

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790
didn't know for a long time
 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.490
didn't know for a long time
whether or not this conjecture was true

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500
whether or not this conjecture was true
 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.000
whether or not this conjecture was true
so back a few decades ago we did know

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010
so back a few decades ago we did know
 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.300
so back a few decades ago we did know
that if it wasn't true there would be

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310
that if it wasn't true there would be
 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.090
that if it wasn't true there would be
only finitely many exceptions so this

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100
only finitely many exceptions so this
 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.890
only finitely many exceptions so this
tends to be easier to show in general

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900
tends to be easier to show in general
 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.620
tends to be easier to show in general
right that okay I know that there's a

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630
right that okay I know that there's a
 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.270
right that okay I know that there's a
really large number of things happening

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280
really large number of things happening
 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.220
really large number of things happening
or only finitely many times it happens

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230
or only finitely many times it happens
 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.320
or only finitely many times it happens
but to show that there's only one is

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330
but to show that there's only one is
 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.300
but to show that there's only one is
what we didn't know until recently so

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310
what we didn't know until recently so
 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.950
what we didn't know until recently so
it's known yes so this is what was

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960
it's known yes so this is what was
 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.510
it's known yes so this is what was
proved by this mathematician me he'll

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520
proved by this mathematician me he'll
 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.970
proved by this mathematician me he'll
ask you in fact these are the only

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980
ask you in fact these are the only
 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.700
ask you in fact these are the only
consecutive perfect powers okay so this

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710
consecutive perfect powers okay so this
 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.680
consecutive perfect powers okay so this
notion that okay they probably kind of

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690
notion that okay they probably kind of
 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.080
notion that okay they probably kind of
spread out as time goes on is it least

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090
spread out as time goes on is it least
 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.090
spread out as time goes on is it least
true if spreading out means bigger than

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100
true if spreading out means bigger than
 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.710
true if spreading out means bigger than
one I mean the proof of this is really

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720
one I mean the proof of this is really
 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.900
one I mean the proof of this is really
advanced and so okay we don't have time

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910
advanced and so okay we don't have time
 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.910
advanced and so okay we don't have time
for I don't know the next couple of

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920
for I don't know the next couple of
 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.520
for I don't know the next couple of
years to go through it but I want to

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530
years to go through it but I want to
 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.750
years to go through it but I want to
tell you at least about sort of a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760
tell you at least about sort of a
 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.970
tell you at least about sort of a
special case of this and something

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980
special case of this and something
 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.200
special case of this and something
that's been known for a while but it

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210
that's been known for a while but it
 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.790
that's been known for a while but it
gives you an idea of kind of the type of

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800
gives you an idea of kind of the type of
 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.220
gives you an idea of kind of the type of
manipulation you can do to understand

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230
manipulation you can do to understand
 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.970
manipulation you can do to understand
this kind of problem

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980
this kind of problem
 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.980
this kind of problem
all right so solving this equation

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990
all right so solving this equation
 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.480
all right so solving this equation
showing that there's only one solution

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490
showing that there's only one solution
 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.030
showing that there's only one solution
and that's it it's pretty hard but let

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040
and that's it it's pretty hard but let
 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.890
and that's it it's pretty hard but let
me show you a special case let's look at

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900
me show you a special case let's look at
 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.310
me show you a special case let's look at
the case of x squared minus y cubed

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320
the case of x squared minus y cubed
 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.340
the case of x squared minus y cubed
equals one so for example that has some

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350
equals one so for example that has some
 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.960
equals one so for example that has some
solution we know because we have these

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970
solution we know because we have these
 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.910
solution we know because we have these
consecutive powers so we're really just

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920
consecutive powers so we're really just
 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.800
consecutive powers so we're really just
asking about a squared differing from a

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810
asking about a squared differing from a
 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.630
asking about a squared differing from a
cube by one okay so why doesn't this

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640
cube by one okay so why doesn't this
 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.090
cube by one okay so why doesn't this
have any other solutions well here's

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100
have any other solutions well here's
 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.400
have any other solutions well here's
what you want to do general rule adding

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410
what you want to do general rule adding
 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.560
what you want to do general rule adding
and understanding factors at the same

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570
and understanding factors at the same
 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.360
and understanding factors at the same
time is hard that's why for modulus

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370
time is hard that's why for modulus
 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.830
time is hard that's why for modulus
theorem is hard that's why this kind of

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840
theorem is hard that's why this kind of
 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.600
theorem is hard that's why this kind of
question is hard so let's change it to a

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610
question is hard so let's change it to a
 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.850
question is hard so let's change it to a
question about multiplication all right

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860
question about multiplication all right
 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.580
question about multiplication all right
so how do we do that let's move things

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590
so how do we do that let's move things
 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.920
so how do we do that let's move things
to the other side so let's say instead

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930
to the other side so let's say instead
 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.650
to the other side so let's say instead
we're gonna solve this equation now why

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660
we're gonna solve this equation now why
 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.330
we're gonna solve this equation now why
have I just made my life better the

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340
have I just made my life better the
 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.950
have I just made my life better the
reason why is because this thing breaks

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960
reason why is because this thing breaks
 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.590
reason why is because this thing breaks
up into two factors anytime you see a

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600
up into two factors anytime you see a
 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.990
up into two factors anytime you see a
difference of squares like this you can

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000
difference of squares like this you can
 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.950
difference of squares like this you can
factorize it in this way and so this

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960
factorize it in this way and so this
 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.570
factorize it in this way and so this
just changes from a very hard problem

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580
just changes from a very hard problem
 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.060
just changes from a very hard problem
about addition and multiplication

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070
about addition and multiplication
 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.590
about addition and multiplication
interacting together to just

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600
interacting together to just
 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.760
interacting together to just
multiplication okay

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770
multiplication okay
 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.559
multiplication okay
so now why is this better why do I find

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569
so now why is this better why do I find
 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:29.850
so now why is this better why do I find
out whether or not this has solutions

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860
out whether or not this has solutions
 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.460
out whether or not this has solutions
here's the idea the factors of why any

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470
here's the idea the factors of why any
 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.010
here's the idea the factors of why any
number that divides why has gotta divide

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020
number that divides why has gotta divide
 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.499
number that divides why has gotta divide
one of these two things and so let's

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509
one of these two things and so let's
 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.450
one of these two things and so let's
ignore two for the moment let's pretend

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460
ignore two for the moment let's pretend
 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.969
ignore two for the moment let's pretend
that Y is odd so two doesn't divide Y so

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979
that Y is odd so two doesn't divide Y so
 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.610
that Y is odd so two doesn't divide Y so
if Y is odd that means then that any

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620
if Y is odd that means then that any
 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.159
if Y is odd that means then that any
factor of y has to divide one of these

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169
factor of y has to divide one of these
 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.529
factor of y has to divide one of these
two things but it can't divide both of

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539
two things but it can't divide both of
 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.600
two things but it can't divide both of
them at once and the reason why is that

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610
them at once and the reason why is that
 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.400
them at once and the reason why is that
whatever these two numbers are they

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410
whatever these two numbers are they
 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.350
whatever these two numbers are they
differ only by two so for the same

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360
differ only by two so for the same
 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.999
differ only by two so for the same
reason they can't have a common factor

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009
reason they can't have a common factor
 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.120
reason they can't have a common factor
other than possibly two so if Y is odd

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130
other than possibly two so if Y is odd
 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.029
other than possibly two so if Y is odd
all the factors of Y either divide X

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039
all the factors of Y either divide X
 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.610
all the factors of Y either divide X
minus one or a factor of Y divides X

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620
minus one or a factor of Y divides X
 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.529
minus one or a factor of Y divides X
plus one but not both at the same time

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539
plus one but not both at the same time
 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.029
plus one but not both at the same time
which means that both of these numbers

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039
which means that both of these numbers
 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.240
which means that both of these numbers
have to be cubes so these are both cubes

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250
have to be cubes so these are both cubes
 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.300
have to be cubes so these are both cubes
because any number which divides Y we

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310
because any number which divides Y we
 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.439
because any number which divides Y we
know there's at least three copies of

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449
know there's at least three copies of
 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.600
know there's at least three copies of
but all of those copies have to go to

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610
but all of those copies have to go to
 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.270
but all of those copies have to go to
the same one of these two numbers and so

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280
the same one of these two numbers and so
 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.570
the same one of these two numbers and so
we've got two cubes which are only two

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580
we've got two cubes which are only two
 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.379
we've got two cubes which are only two
apart

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389
apart
 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.390
apart
right so the difference between these

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400
right so the difference between these
 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.850
right so the difference between these
two cubes is only two but that never

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860
two cubes is only two but that never
 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.589
two cubes is only two but that never
happens with cubes right because we know

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599
happens with cubes right because we know
 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:39.270
happens with cubes right because we know
what the cubes are 1 8 27 and so on and

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280
what the cubes are 1 8 27 and so on and
 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.490
what the cubes are 1 8 27 and so on and
that for sure spreads out as you go

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500
that for sure spreads out as you go
 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.620
that for sure spreads out as you go
along and so you can't have any cubes

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630
along and so you can't have any cubes
 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.600
along and so you can't have any cubes
which are separated by two and so you

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610
which are separated by two and so you
 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.980
which are separated by two and so you
can't have any solution to this equation

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990
can't have any solution to this equation
 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.480
can't have any solution to this equation
at least if Y is odd well then it's a

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490
at least if Y is odd well then it's a
 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.709
at least if Y is odd well then it's a
little bit harder but not that much no

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:55.719
little bit harder but not that much no
 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:58.379
little bit harder but not that much no
so in general of course the proof is not

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389
so in general of course the proof is not
 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.659
so in general of course the proof is not
via this plan although changing from

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669
via this plan although changing from
 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.219
via this plan although changing from
addition to multiplication is the

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229
addition to multiplication is the
 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.439
addition to multiplication is the
important part of the proof actually and

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449
important part of the proof actually and
 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:06.990
important part of the proof actually and
important part of the proof but this is

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000
important part of the proof but this is
 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.059
important part of the proof but this is
just sort of the smallest tiniest piece

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:09.069
just sort of the smallest tiniest piece
 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.159
just sort of the smallest tiniest piece

thanks for watching this video I'm just

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:15.969
thanks for watching this video I'm just
 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:19.320
thanks for watching this video I'm just
working on brilliants problem of the

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330
working on brilliants problem of the
 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.110
working on brilliants problem of the
week which triangle has the greatest

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120
week which triangle has the greatest
 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.629
week which triangle has the greatest
area I can't decide if this is a trick

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639
area I can't decide if this is a trick
 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.189
area I can't decide if this is a trick
question or

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199
question or
 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:28.860
question or
do they have the same area let me get 4c

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870
do they have the same area let me get 4c
 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.709
do they have the same area let me get 4c
ah it says it's okay I got it wrong but

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719
ah it says it's okay I got it wrong but
 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:33.809
ah it says it's okay I got it wrong but
it says here and this is true getting

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:33.819
it says here and this is true getting
 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.420
it says here and this is true getting
stumped is part of learning and now we

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430
stumped is part of learning and now we
 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.980
stumped is part of learning and now we
get to continue and discuss the

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990
get to continue and discuss the
 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.959
get to continue and discuss the
solutions yeah see I probably should

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:39.969
solutions yeah see I probably should
 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:41.219
solutions yeah see I probably should
have done better working out like that

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229
have done better working out like that
 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:43.559
have done better working out like that
person did but you know we're recording
