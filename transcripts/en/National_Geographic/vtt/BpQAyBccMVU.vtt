00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.701
- [Arthur] I hate plastic.

00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:05.271 align:start size:97% position:3%
That's why we've engulfed
on a 15 year mission to turn

00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:08.308 align:start size:84% position:16%
that into something
that we actually want.

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:11.745 align:start size:88% position:13%
We have collected
around 750 new materials

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.313 align:start size:94% position:6%
that's coming from our
daily post-consumer waste.

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:16.783
It can go into any
consumer product

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:19.619 align:start size:84% position:16%
at lower cost,
higher performance.

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:23.189
First of all, let
me show of hand

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.492 align:start size:84% position:16%
who actually recycled
something today?

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:27.426
Wow.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:28.894
Okay, this is a weird audience.

00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:32.297 line:0%
But guess what, guess what?

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.934 line:0%
There's actually, in
the United States,

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.835 line:0%
we have the lowest
recycling rate

00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:39.305
of all the developed nations.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:43.008
It's plateauing at
34% recycling rate.

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:44.944
You look at the waste
here, it has tires,

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:48.714 align:start size:97% position:3%
apparel waste, on top of
plastic bags and PET bottles.

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:51.050 align:start size:84% position:16%
I think this is one
of a big problem here,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.419 align:start size:84% position:16%
no one actually wants
to be responsible

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:55.321
for all that waste
that we're creating.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.423 align:start size:84% position:16%
We are responsible,
all of us here,

00:00:57.423 --> 00:00:59.558
are responsible for this mess.

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.894 align:start size:88% position:13%
Our solution is, we
have to make trash sexy.

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:04.463 align:start size:97% position:3%
And this what National
Geographic is so good about.

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:08.968
For us engineers, that
is engineering porn.

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:12.672
Okay, so, why is that?

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:17.877 align:start position:0%
Because this is the highest
performance animal in the ocean.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:20.079
It's the fastest,
it has the scale

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.449
that's optimized for
speed, and it's just

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:26.018
the pure physical
form is no waste.

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:27.487
Zero waste.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.522
Everything is considered,
everything is designed.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:32.992 align:start size:88% position:13%
But this is what we get,
every grain of rice,

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:36.629
every wheat, every bread
that you eat has 20% waste.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:37.897
Fiber waste.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.967
Every PET bottle, all
of these are perfectly

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:43.536 align:start position:0%
nontoxic material that can
constantly be recycled, reused.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.272
And then we have
a growing e-waste.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.539
Electronic waste.

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.241
Huge amount of it, it
has precious metals,

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:51.210
it has a lot of toxic elements.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.813 align:start size:84% position:16%
Let me get nerdy a
little bit here, okay?

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:57.883
Why we are not turning
that into product, today,

00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:01.554 align:start size:88% position:13%
if you touch your
clothes there's no
recycled content in it.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.255
There's the seat
you're sitting on,

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:04.656
the environment that we're in,

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:06.559
has no recycled content in it.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:07.727
This is a problem.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:08.794
Why?

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:09.996
Why not?

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:11.363 align:start size:84% position:16%
The reason is because
the polymer chain

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:13.666
got broken in the
recycling process.

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.568
Then how do you make
then strong again?

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:18.437
If you're a weak animal, a
weak animal cannot be sexy.

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:22.275 align:start size:97% position:3%
Maybe they are but, you
know they're not very sexy.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:26.445 align:start size:88% position:13%
So we are actually
drawn to pretty things.

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:28.747
So how do you make
that sexy again?

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:31.284
We have to use fiber
to bridge in-between.

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:33.085
And this is a, we
go back to history,

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:36.456
the Romans built
cement aqueducts,

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:37.957
Chinese built walls,

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:41.294
all with agricultural
waste grinded down

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:44.696
into these powder forms
they mix into the cement.

00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:47.567
What it does is, it has
silicon dioxide in it,

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.335
amorphous silicon dioxide.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.803
It's a natural glue.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:54.006 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's actually forming
these broken polymer chains

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:57.009 align:start position:0%
if you mix into it, it actually
starts to come together,

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.546
conglomerates, into much
much stronger materials.

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:04.083
The ancient does it, why
aren't we doing that today?

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.052 align:start size:84% position:16%
So that's one of
the solutions how we

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:09.522
reinforce material
using organic waste.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.324
So why aren't we doing this?

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:12.258
Toxicity.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:13.492
This is a piece of leather,

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:16.529
and that's a piece of recycled
PET fabric on the side.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.599
Just look at how many steps
that's required to produce

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.501
and process a piece
of leather fabric

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:23.535
versus a piece of
recycled PET waste.

00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:27.540
Every step requires a carbon
footprint, energy, chemicals.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.143 align:start size:94% position:6%
On the recycled PET
side, you only use water,

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:33.245
heat, and knife to
cut the pieces down.

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:34.847
Why aren't we doing this more?

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.150
We invent seven new
materials a month,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.420 align:start size:88% position:13%
we have collected
around 750 new materials

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.055 align:start size:94% position:6%
that's coming from our
daily post-consumer waste.

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:45.658
But the problem is no one
wants to buy them, okay?

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:48.627 align:start size:97% position:3%
So we have to pioneer
making up new applications.

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:51.230
So I'll show you very
quickly what we did.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.931
This is what we call
molecular cooking.

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:54.467
Molecular cooking at all levels.

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:57.102
Molecular gastronomy
at the marketing front,

00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:58.670
new pioneering, engineering,

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.606
and designing, and
marketing fronts.

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:02.408
It can go into any
consumer product

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:04.877 align:start size:84% position:16%
at lower cost,
higher performance.

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:06.712 align:start size:88% position:13%
We have built 40
story tower with trash,

00:04:06.712 --> 00:04:09.782
campuses, nine story
tall building, museum,

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:11.584 align:start size:97% position:3%
we just finished the biggest
e-waste recycling plant

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.419
where we turn the
waste of a waste

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.021 align:start size:81% position:19%
into all the
building's structure.

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:17.923
We've worked on a food waste
recycling plant in Taiwan,

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:19.291
and we are also
doing a car waste

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:21.694
recycling plant that's
finishing this year.

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:23.262
This looks like a
piece of marble.

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:24.797
It's not.

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:27.734
It's right here. It's a piece
of recycled PET non-woven,

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:32.070 align:start size:97% position:3%
no chemical added, heat
pressed, structural material,

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.207
and it's also an air purifier.

00:04:35.207 --> 00:04:39.379
Okay, made from cigarette
waste, which is tobacco,

00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:43.315
which I smoked for many years.

00:04:43.315 --> 00:04:47.186
Okay, it can be formed, shaped,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.720
into a lot of different formats,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.790 align:start size:84% position:16%
we turned it into this
in Milan this year.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.626 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is a pavilion,
it's actually inspired

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:57.030
by the natural lung molecule.

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:01.200 align:start size:84% position:16%
And that's actually
capturing formaldehyde

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.070 align:start size:97% position:3%
in the air and it's
integrated with electronics.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.373 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's all interlocked,
single material, no glue,

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:11.310
and I want you to focus
on the waste of the waste

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.113 align:start size:84% position:16%
of that cigarette butt
production process,

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:15.314
which are those chairs.

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:17.583 align:start size:88% position:13%
We actually turned that
into this furniture

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.518
product using the
cigarette butts.

00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:23.923
So the product's called
"Anything Butt," okay?

00:05:23.923 --> 00:05:27.393
And this process allows
other designers globally

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:30.429 align:start size:97% position:3%
to do even more different
types of furniture products.

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:33.098
Please, this has to
look sexy to you now,

00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:34.533
because this is the leftover

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:37.370 align:start size:84% position:16%
of a typical German
beer festival.

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:41.206 align:start size:94% position:6%
Look at all that material
that's out there.

00:05:41.206 --> 00:05:42.574
This is a possibility here.

00:05:42.574 --> 00:05:46.279
And we turn that, all
that crap, e-waste,

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:51.784 align:start position:0%
food waste, recycled Nike
shoes, into recycled Nike store.

00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:52.885
In New York, you can go see,

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:54.920 align:start size:84% position:16%
in Paris, Le Marais,
you can go see,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.022 align:start size:84% position:16%
in Milan, in London,
you can see all

00:05:57.022 --> 00:05:59.058
these stores that are
made from apparel waste

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:01.893
and e-waste, and
any type of waste.

00:06:01.893 --> 00:06:04.396
We scale across 23 countries,

00:06:04.396 --> 00:06:06.498 align:start size:88% position:13%
taking portable
manufacturing machinery

00:06:06.498 --> 00:06:08.667
into developed world,

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:10.636
because we want
to keep the trash

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:13.672
in the developed world,
not to ship to India,

00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:16.609
China, Taiwan, anywhere else.

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:17.443
Thank you.
