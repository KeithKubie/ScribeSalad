00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.350
How far would you go for love?

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:08.470
If you’re a Western Grey Whale you might
go a whooping 14,000 miles!

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.250
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.120
Many animals migrate.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.750
Birds, fish, reptiles, mammals, all do it.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.250
Lots of animals travel to greener pastures
to mate or feed.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.800
By far and away the most common reasons is
to get the hell away from winter.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.780
Most migrations are to areas of warmer climates
for the winter and back North again for the

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.780
summer.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.590
Not unlike your snow bird grandparents, animals
are willing to go pretty far for fairer weather.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.300
A recent study published in the journal of
Biology Letters made quite a splash.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.989
A team of researchers from the US and Russia
tracked a Western Grey Whale for a while.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:43.989
I mean.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:44.989
A WHILE.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.140
This whale, Varvara started from Russia's
Sakhalin Island, where their feeding grounds

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.070
are and journeyed across the Pacific Ocean,
down the West Coast of the United States all

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.440
the way to their breeding grounds off the
coast of Baja, Mexico.The total milage she

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.440
racked up?

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.800
She swam right into the record books at almost
14,000 miles round trip.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.579
Making it the longest mammal migration ever
recorded!

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:07.180
But she’s not the only one willing to go
the distance.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.399
Caribou, also called reindeer, are found across
the northern regions of North America, Europe

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:12.399
and Asia.

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.299
Some herds are really really big.

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.770
The Porcupine caribou herd is 169,000 animals
large!

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.960
In the spring as the cold arctic tundras thaw,
the caribou journey far northward to feed

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.939
on newly exposed grasses and plants.

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.060
And as the cold sets back in, they head back
south to chow on lichens.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.189
The journey can take as many as 1,600 miles
each way, making it the longest land migration

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.189
for mammals.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.419
No talk about migrations is complete without
mentioning the monarch butterfly.

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:43.020
The Eastern population can fly over 3,000
miles to spend the winter in warmer weather

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.119
in Mexico.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.090
Some can fly up to 50 miles a day!

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.209
Yet their population is in decline, mostly
due to habitat destruction and changes in

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:51.209
climate.

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.759
They use a process called time compensated
sun navigation to find their way.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.429
Basically they use the position of the sun
and the time of day as tools to keep them

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.539
going in the right direction throughout their
long trip.

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.829
It may come as no surprise but birds fly the
furthest.

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.770
The award for the longest bird migration ever
goes to the tiny arctic tern.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.939
It took a little while for scientists to figure
this out.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.730
Previously, the award went to a bigger bird,
the sooty shearwater, who topped out at a

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.739
40,000 mile trip.

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.209
But as technology allowed for smaller tracking
devices, researchers turned to ever smaller

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.209
birds.

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.950
The Arctic terns long journey starts in Greenland
and every year, after a little zig-zagging

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.010
around, the bird winds up 44,000 miles away
in Antarctica.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.310
Another recent study published in the journal
Biology Letters found one of the longest non-stop

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.489
flights for any bird.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.930
The blackpoll warbler flies over 1,500 miles
in one fell swoop.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.180
Over two or three days, the songbird flies
from the forests of New England and Canada

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.299
and heads to the Caribbean for the winter.

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.030
To prep for the long trip, a bird might pack
on an extra 5 or 6 grams fat.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.109
While bigger birds like the northern wheatear
fly a little further, a researcher from York

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.860
University not involved in the study told
Newsweek that “it’s more impressive”

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.470
that so small a bird like the blackpoll warbler
can make it so far.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.260
The longest non-stop flight of all however
goes to the Alaskan bar-tailed godwit.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.510
Over eight days, the bird will travel from
Alaska to New Zealand.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.560
An almost 7,000 mile trip with no breaks.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.280
So how do birds travel so far?

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.489
How do they know where they’re going?

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.319
Well they are some how able to sense the Earth’s
magnetic field.

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.959
Some researchers from the University of Oxford
think that a magnetically sensitive protein

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.019
called cryptochrome that regulates circadian
rhythms might be responsible.

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.260
As blue or green lights hit atoms it makes
electrons spin in response to magnetic fields.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:44.440
Weird right?
