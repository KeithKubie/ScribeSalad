00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.974
- Welcome back to another
installment of

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:08.976
"Mike and Van: The Ascension."

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:17.284
We're here to give you
insider information

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:19.853
about Hollywood
and its workings,

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.689
as well as us chronicling
the time that we have spent

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.958
as writers on "Key &amp; Peele."

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.293
We're just gonna
take you deeper

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:28.061
and delve you deeper
into the creative process

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.963
of how we're making
this show better,

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.832
because, you know,
frankly, it was okay.

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:32.866
It was a good show.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.301
We're trying to make it
a better show.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.403
We're trying to help
Key and Peele with it.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:39.373
- You got animals,
pigs, horses, mice.

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.041
Then you got the eagle.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.777
And what the eagle does is,
they fly over top.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:46.013
They get to see
everything below them.

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:47.381
- They looking
at the entire picture.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:48.382
They're looking
at the whole farm.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:49.449
- That's where we are.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.517
- That's what we doing.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.186
We straight up talking
about some E-I-E-I-O.

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:53.220
- Dick eagles.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.221
- We are dick eagles.

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:55.756
We're "deagles,"
if you will.

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:57.224
What we trying to do
is run down there

00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:58.258
and just like pick up dicks

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:00.794
and eat them out the water,
like salmon.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:03.430
- [screeching]

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.232
- So we gonna show you
a clip really soon

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.134
where Mike is having
a conversation.

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:08.368
- I don't know
if I can set this up.

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:09.837
I had had some thoughts

00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:12.573
about some of the prosthesis

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:15.309
for the--that's makeup effects.

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:17.544
- Mustaches and beards
and whatnot.

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:19.780
- So I wanted
to share them.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.215
See what you think.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.156
- Hey.
- What's up, Keegan?

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:30.424
- What's it, again?
Tell me your name.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:31.458
- Mike.
- Mike, that's right.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:32.492
- Sorry about that.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:33.493
What can I do you for?

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:36.463
- I got a couple notes.

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:40.267
- Okay, yeah, yeah, come in.

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:41.835
- You should do
a pube beard.

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:42.870
- A what?

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.872
- Yo, you, you.

00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:46.173
- Are you talking to me
or to Scott?

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:47.975
- No, I'm talking to him, Scott.

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:51.545
You should do
a pubes beard.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:54.414
Just pubes.
That's...

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:55.549
- Just keep doing
what you're doing.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:56.984
Just keep doing it.

00:01:56.984 --> 00:01:59.019
- I was looking at the script,
though, with Vandaveon.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:00.053
- Yep.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:01.922
- It's good.
- Mm-hmm.

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:03.056
- Like, it's funny,

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:06.326
but it could be
a little bit better, though.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:10.063
- Mike, I really--
buddy, we're not--I...

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:12.566
A pube beard would
probably be very funny

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:14.568
in a lot of instances,
but I'm playing...

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:17.504
- [snickering]

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:19.907
Yeah, no, go on, go on.

00:02:19.907 --> 00:02:22.543
- I'm just saying,
if I had a pube beard,

00:02:22.543 --> 00:02:25.279
I wouldn't wear it
necessarily for this character.

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.514
It's just a surgeon.
He's just a surgeon.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.583
- Just like--can I finish?

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:35.322
Like, some way that y'all could
just make it funnier, though.

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:36.557
- Here's something
that I'm impressed

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:38.458
about this video
in particular,

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.794
Mike, is your persistence,

00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:42.496
and how you continue to go,

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:44.531
"Hey, I'm--you know,
I have an agenda.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.500
"I want to talk
about these pube beards.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.002
"People should be shaving hair
off their balls

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.138
"and putting them
on niggas' faces.

00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:52.539
It's important."

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.107
- Just being clear
of our vision.

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.108
- Mm-hmm, that's important.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.743
And then I think
Key was getting that,

00:02:56.743 --> 00:03:00.080
and he was accepting and hearing
the vision that he had in mind.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.050
So you gonna see right now,
in this sketch,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.519
that it is sans pube beard,

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.288
a staple of definitely
our style of comedy.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:12.826
So, by all means, please,
watch this...selection.

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:14.962
- You must be Liam.

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:18.098
- Hey, there, buddy,
how are you feeling?

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:23.871
- I'm feeling...fine,
Dr. Gupta, just fine.

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:25.706
- So now, straight up,
like, as an exercise,

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:28.775
something I would encourage
people to do is, now, like,

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:31.078
in your mind, re-watch
that scene for yourself,

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:33.480
and imagine them
having pube beards on,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.682
especially that
creepy-ass little boy.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:36.917
Here we're gonna show you
a picture right now

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:38.218
of what that
would look like.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.453
You see?

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:42.389
[laughter]

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:45.192
That's my shit!

00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:46.193
- I told these niggas.

00:03:46.193 --> 00:03:47.694
- [laughing]

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:49.229
- Told you that was funny.
Told you that.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.597
- He was right
all along, man.

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.099
But listen.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.135
We appreciate you
doing the exercise

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:58.138
so that you can understand more
about the nuances

00:03:58.138 --> 00:04:01.208
and the subtleties of what
Mike and I will be bringing

00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:04.077
to any particular
"Key &amp; Peele" scene.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.045
- Check it out.

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:10.584
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.186
You still haven't really
given me a clear answer

00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:14.454
as to what the camera is for.
