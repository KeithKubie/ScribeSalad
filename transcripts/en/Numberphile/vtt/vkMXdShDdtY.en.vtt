00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.450
ED COPELAND: Hello.

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.205
BRADY HARAN: I was going to ask
you to describe this in

00:00:03.205 --> 00:00:06.290
terms that you would describe
it to, say, your daughter.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.500
And then I remembered
your daughter does

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.460
economics at Cambridge.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.101
ED COPELAND: Yeah.

00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:11.410
BRADY HARAN: So let's
not do that.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.660
Let's describe this as you
should describe to me, maybe.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.600
TONY PADILLA: OK, so there's
been a very exciting

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.820
breakthrough in the field
of number theory.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.800
It caused an awful lot of
excitement amongst the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.770
mathematicians, as excited as
mathematicians can get.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.690
And the crazy thing about it
is that it's come from

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.250
somebody who's pretty
much unknown.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.270
It's a guy called Yitang
Zhang, which is

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.794
a pretty cool name.

00:00:34.794 --> 00:00:39.080
And he does work at the
University of New Hampshire.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.940
ED COPELAND: It's about prime
numbers, the things that

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.730
certainly got me into maths.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.800
TONY PADILLA: In fact, he really
struggled to get an

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.980
academic job.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.240
He worked for a time
in Subway.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.290
ED COPELAND: There are some
amazing properties of primes.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.210
And they've led to lots of
conjectures that haven't yet

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.290
been proven.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.290
TONY PADILLA: There's nothing
wrong with working in Subway.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.130
But normally, these
breakthroughs are achieved by

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.370
those that are working at
Princeton, Harvard, these

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.620
kinds of really elite places.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.920
And now we've got somebody who's
literally come out of

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.490
nowhere, that no one expected to
produce this kind of result

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.140
and has done something really
impressive that many great

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.850
minds were unable to do.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.280
ED COPELAND: But one in
particular doesn't involve

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.290
multiplication of primes.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.110
It involves additions
of primes.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.020
And it's the fact that there
seem to be an endless series

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.340
of primes which differ by 2.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.240
So the obvious ones are the low
number primes, so 3 and 5,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.160
and 5 and 7, 11 and 13.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.980
TONY PADILLA: So these two prime
numbers are called twin

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.190
primes and are called twins
because they differ

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.530
by this number 2.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.160
ED COPELAND: And then there's
a conjecture that goes back

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.720
hundreds of years, which says,
actually, there's an infinite

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.630
number of these.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.880
So the highest known pair
is a remarkable, right?

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:20.460
3,756,801,695,685 times 2 to the
power of 666,689 plus 1 is

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.680
the higher of the
pairs of primes.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.450
And if I take away 1, it
gives me the lower of

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.830
the pairs of primes.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.536
BRADY HARAN: That's epic.

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:31.130
ED COPELAND: It's an epic.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.430
Just to remind you, the lower
ones that we were describing

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.380
were 3 and 5, and 5
and 7, et cetera.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.370
So to be able to do that and
show that that's a pair of

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.880
primes that differ by
2 is remarkable.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.500
TONY PADILLA: So these ones that
differ by 2 are called

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.660
twin primes.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.920
You also get, of course,
ones that differ by 4.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.690
These are called
cousin primes.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.620
And there's even those
that differ by 6.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.970
And these are called sexy
primes, which I think you've

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.580
done as well.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.790
Why can't you have prime number
that differ by 7?

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.760
BRADY HARAN: You can't have
prime numbers that differ by 7

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.870
because one of them will
be an even number.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.510
TONY PADILLA: Exactly, Brady.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.500
Well done.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.180
So we know that there definitely
are an infinite

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.080
number of prime numbers.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.745
And I can prove that for
you if you want.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:24.210
BRADY HARAN: We've done that.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.820
TONY PADILLA: You've
done that.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.550
I thought you had.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.620
OK, so you know that
there's an infinite

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.430
number of prime numbers.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.060
What people aren't sure about is
that there are an infinite

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.810
number of prime numbers
that differ by 2.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.650
But it's believed to be true.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.260
ED COPELAND: And so the goal
is to try and show this.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.450
And it's never been shown.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.190
But what has been shown, for
the first time, is that you

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.860
can bound the difference
between two primes.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.940
And somebody has shown-- in
fact, Yitang Zhang, from the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.720
University of New Hampshire,
has shown that there is a

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.480
bound between two primes, let's
say one prime a and

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.310
another prime b.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.700
And that bound is that it can be
some number N. And so if N

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.460
would be 2, for the case that
we're interested in here-- and

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.940
that's the ultimate case that
people are interested in.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.320
But what he's managed to show is
there is some number N for

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.600
which for an infinite number
of primes, a and b, this is

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.255
going to be less than or
equal to 70 million.

00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:35.370
BRADY HARAN: So just to be
clear, two primes can be

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.140
separated by more
than 70 million?

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.525
ED COPELAND: Oh yes,
yes, yes, they can.

00:04:39.525 --> 00:04:44.030
But what he's shown is that--
and in fact, the conjecture is

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.020
that every single even number,
there is an infinite number of

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.790
primes that can be separated
by that amount.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.100
So here, the even number
is 2, right?

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.520
So the conjecture is there's an
infinite number of pairs of

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.840
primes which are
separated by 2.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.810
But there's also a conjecture
that there's an infinite

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.680
number of pairs of primes
separated by 4, and an

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.220
infinite number separated
by 6, and 8, and

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.340
in fact, up to infinity.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.160
So that all the even numbers,
the conjectures are there are

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.870
an infinite number of primes
separated by that amount.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.170
But no one has been able to
show that's true of any

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.640
number up to now.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.580
And what he has demonstrated
is there are an infinite

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.860
number of primes which will be
separated by a number N which

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.710
he hasn't yet calculated, but
he knows that it's less than

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.240
70 million.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.920
TONY PADILLA: There're an
infinity of these guys.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.070
[PHONE RINGING]

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.775
TONY PADILLA: Oh, god.

00:05:37.775 --> 00:05:38.054
BRADY HARAN: What?

00:05:38.054 --> 00:05:39.370
Take two.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.690
TONY PADILLA: Hello.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.006
Hi, babe.

00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:43.256
I'm in the middle of
doing a video.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.980
Well, I've got to answer
it so it stops ringing.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.330
All right, call you back
when we're done.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.230
All right, see you in a bit.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.670
BRADY HARAN: Was that Ed?

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.440
TONY PADILLA: No, it was--

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.990
ED COPELAND: The mathematicians
who work on

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.250
prime numbers will now, no
doubt, be scouring over what

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.300
he has done and trying to
knock this number down.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.880
I mean, I was already hearing
about one of the key people

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.600
involved, a guy called Goldston,
who's talked about

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.870
it might be immediately
possible to knock this

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.220
down to about 16.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.280
And that's a lot closer
to 2 than 70 million.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.500
But of course, he has
a very nice way of

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.510
describing this value.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.150
Maybe 70 million means the
primes are not twins, but

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.590
they're certainly siblings.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.160
TONY PADILLA: But why
is it amazing, I

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.300
think, is more the point.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.580
Why is it really incredible?

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.550
Well, there's a sort of nice
way to illustrate this.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.830
One thing we know is that
obviously, there are an

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.150
infinite number of
prime numbers.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.430
But the gaps between the prime
numbers, generically, get

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.400
bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.720
In fact, you know that
for the first N--

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.140
for prime numbers between 0 and
N, the average gap is of

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:58.000
order log of N. It's a function,
but this is a big

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.130
number, is the point.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.660
It's not as big as N, but
it's a big number.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.940
OK, so let me illustrate what
that means in practice.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.280
So imagine you had a scenario
where you've got a world with

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.220
all the numbers.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.440
And there's some rule--

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.620
and I'm just going to impose
this rule because I'm king of

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.850
this world--

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.530
that says that prime numbers
can only fall in love with

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.030
other prime numbers.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.070
OK, so the idea is that
you go on dates with

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.300
your nearest neighbors.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.760
And do you fall in
love or not?

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.560
So for the prime numbers at the
lower end of the number

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.530
spectrum, they've got it made.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.800
3 gets it down with 5.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.730
7's getting it on with 11.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.240
They don't have to go
very far before they

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.310
find their true love.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:49.510
But when you get up to, say,
googolplex, in principle, on

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.640
average, you expect to go on of
order a googol dates before

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.090
you're likely to find
your true love.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.650
Because the prime numbers
are so far apart at that

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.620
large end of things.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.860
So it's a pretty loveless place
at that end of things.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.140
So you get to bigger and bigger
numbers, you might

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.710
think there's just no
way you're going to

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.660
find your true love.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.272
And you probably won't even
bother going out of the

00:08:11.272 --> 00:08:12.200
house.You'd just stay
in and watch

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.990
Jeremy Kyle or something.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.305
But what is actually true,
though, what Zhang has shown

00:08:17.305 --> 00:08:21.410
us, is that for some lucky prime
numbers at that very

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.490
high end of things,
they actually--

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.260
and it's always the case-- there
are some that actually

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.940
will only have to go on about
70 million dates before they

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.790
find their true love.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.030
So there are always some prime
numbers which are relatively

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.280
close together.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:39.420
BRADY HARAN: 70 million seems
such an arbitrary number.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:39.740
ED COPELAND: Yeah.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.370
BRADY HARAN: And it's like, if
it's possible to explain, how

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.460
has that fallen out
of this proof?

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.280
ED COPELAND: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.720
TONY PADILLA: OK, so when people
do number theory, how

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.520
do they actually go about
doing these proofs?

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.530
They tend to use sieve theory.
