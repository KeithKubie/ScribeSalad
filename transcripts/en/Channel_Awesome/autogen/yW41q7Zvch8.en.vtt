let's actually talk about the film
itself I really liked it I thought this

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390
itself I really liked it I thought this
 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.370
itself I really liked it I thought this
was I had to admit the reason I probably

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380
was I had to admit the reason I probably
 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.230
was I had to admit the reason I probably
liked it as much as I did even though

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
liked it as much as I did even though
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.679

it's good I think I like to even more

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689
it's good I think I like to even more
 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.950
it's good I think I like to even more
for the fact that it was it's a young

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
for the fact that it was it's a young
 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.950
for the fact that it was it's a young
adult book and so therefore it's

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
adult book and so therefore it's
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.929
adult book and so therefore it's
marketed mostly to teenagers and stuff

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
marketed mostly to teenagers and stuff
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:36.560

but again I digress a fault with the

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:03.080
but again I digress a fault with the
 

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.680
but again I digress a fault with the
movie it's I think they're pretty minor

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:05.690
movie it's I think they're pretty minor
 

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.140
movie it's I think they're pretty minor
in my opinion but it can give to some

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:08.150
in my opinion but it can give to some
 

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.470
in my opinion but it can give to some
people I mean one is that it is constant

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:11.480
people I mean one is that it is constant
 

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.820
people I mean one is that it is constant
shaky-cam throughout the whole thing

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:12.830
shaky-cam throughout the whole thing
 

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.430
shaky-cam throughout the whole thing
there's very few shots that are just

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440
there's very few shots that are just
 

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.010
there's very few shots that are just
still or very slowly panning or anything

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:18.020
still or very slowly panning or anything
 

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.010
still or very slowly panning or anything
like that I mean it's all shaky cam but

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:21.020
like that I mean it's all shaky cam but
 

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.480
like that I mean it's all shaky cam but
now the interesting thing about that is

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:22.490
now the interesting thing about that is
 

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.100
now the interesting thing about that is
well fakey can for the most prized not

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:24.110

into that and I think it's because a lot

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:40.729
into that and I think it's because a lot
 

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.130
into that and I think it's because a lot
