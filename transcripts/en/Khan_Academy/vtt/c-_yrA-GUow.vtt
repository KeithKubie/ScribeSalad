00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.300
When we were first exposed to
multiplication and division,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.602
we saw that they had an
inverse relationship.

00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:07.060
Or another way of
thinking about it

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.160
is that they can
undo each other.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.450
So for example, if I had 2 times
4, one interpretation of this

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.030
is I could have
four groups of 2.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.320
So that is one group of 2, two
groups of 2, three groups of 2,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.110
and four groups of 2.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.540
And we learned many, many
videos ago that this, of course,

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.410
is going to be equal to 8.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.960
Well, we could express a very
similar idea with division.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.370
We could start with 8 things.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.650
So let's start with one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.320
eight things.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.430
So now we're going
to start with the 8.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.800
And we could say, well,
let's try to divide that

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.730
into four groups,
four equal groups.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.420
Well, that's one equal
group, two equal groups,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.790
three equal groups,
and four equal groups.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.930
And we see when we
start with 8 divide it

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.860
into four equal
groups, each group

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.530
is going to have
2 objects in it.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.150
So you probably see
the relationship.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.565
2 times 4 is 8.

00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:11.980
8 divided by 4 is 2.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.770
And actually, if we did 8
divided by 2, we would get 4.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.540
And this is generally true.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.270
If I have something
times something else is

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.240
equal to whatever their product
is, if you take the product

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.010
and divide by one of
those two numbers,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.760
you'll get the other one.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.460
And that idea
applies to fractions.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.790
It actually makes a lot
of sense with fractions.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.840
So for example, let's say
that we started off with 1/3

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.990
and we wanted to
multiply that times 3.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.110
Well, there's a couple of
ways we could visualize it.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.120
Actually, let me just
draw a diagram here.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.240
So let's say that this
block represents a whole,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.360
and let me shade in a 1/3 of it.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.230
So that's 1/3.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.330
We're going to multiply by 3.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.030
So we're going to
have 3 of these 1/3's.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.530
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.230
it's going to be 1/3 plus
another 1/3 plus another 1/3.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.180
That's our first 1/3, our
second 1/3, and our third 1/3.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.590
And we get the whole.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.100
This is 3/3, or 1.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.840
So this is going
to be equal to 1.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.600
So you use the exact same idea.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.470
If 1/3 times 3 is
equal to 1, then that

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:35.060
means that 1 divided by
3 must be equal to 1/3.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.620
And this comes straight
out of how we first even

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.060
thought about fractions.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.530
The first way that we ever
thought about fractions

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.540
was, well, let's
start with a whole.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.710
And that whole would be our 1.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.520
And let's divide it into 3
equal sections, the same way

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.790
that we divided this
8 into 4 equal groups.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.520
So if you divide this
into 3 equal sections,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.930
the size of each
of those sections

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.755
is going to be exactly 1/3.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.480
Now, this leads to an
interesting question

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.540
that might be popping
in your brain.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.380
Notice, we have 1
is the numerator,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.120
3 is the denominator,
and we just

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.780
said that this is equal
to the numerator divided

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.680
by the denominator.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.870
1 over 3 is the same
thing as 1 divided by 3.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.900
Is this always true
for a fraction?

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.900
Well, let's just do the
same thought experiment,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.650
but let's do it with
a different fraction.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.150
Let's take 3/4 and
multiply it by 4.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.730
So multiply it by 4.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.260
So once again, let's see
if I could draw 1/4 here.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.100
Let me do this in a new color.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.070
So let's say that this block
right over here is a whole.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.250
We'll divide it into
four equal sections.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.820
So now I've divided
it into fourths.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.370
And let me copy and paste it
so I can use it multiple times.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.640
So copy.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.690
All right.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.064
Now, 3/4, that's
going to be-- we

00:04:03.064 --> 00:04:04.730
can assume-- I didn't
draw it perfectly.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.021
Actually, I could draw it a
little bit better than that

00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:10.340
just to make the four equal
sections actually look equal.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.040
So that looks like a
little bit better of a job.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.330
I'm trying to make them
four equal sections.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.589
Let me copy that one.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.200
So let me use it for later.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.450
Now, 3/4.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.260
This is four equal sections, and
3/4 represents three of them--

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.120
one, two, three.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.170
But now we're going
to multiply it by 4.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.300
So we're going to
have 3/4 four times.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.180
So we're going to need
some more wholes here.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.513
So let's throw in another whole.

00:04:38.513 --> 00:04:40.270
So this is one 3/4.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.680
Now let me do the next
3/4 in another color.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.830
So that's a 1/4, that's a
second 1/4, that's a third 1/4.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.910
That's another 3/4.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.940
And now let's do-- so we've
done two 3/4 just now.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.310
Let me make it clear.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.380
This is the first 3/4,
and then this plus this

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.540
is the second 3/4.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.070
Now let's do a third 3/4.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.080
And we're going to have to use
another whole right over here.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.250
And I will do that
in this color.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.090
So my third 3/4,
so here's a 1/4,

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.680
here's my second 1/4,
here's a third 1/4.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.020
So in green, I have another 3/4.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.860
And now we need four 3/4.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.340
So let's do that in a color I
have not used yet, maybe white.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.490
So that's a 1/4, that's two
1/4, and that is three 1/4.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:44.460
So notice, now I have now I have
one 3/4, two 3/4, three 3/4,

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.900
and four 3/4.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.220
And what did I do when
I got those four 3/4?

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.220
Well, it's pretty clear.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.310
This is turned into 3 wholes.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.850
So this is equal to 3 wholes.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.480
Well, if 3/4 times
4 is equal to 3,

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:09.603
that means that 3 divided
by 4 is equal to 3/4.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.410
So the same idea again.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.070
3 over 4 is the same
thing as 3 divided by 4.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.850
And in general, this is true.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.560
The fraction symbol here can
be interpreted as division.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.380
And looking at this
diagram right here,

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.420
it made complete sense.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.880
If you started with
3 wholes, and you

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.150
want to divide it into 4 equal
groups, one group, two groups,

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.880
three groups, four
groups, each group

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.150
is going to have 3/4 in it.
