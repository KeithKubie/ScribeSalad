00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.016
So, the C739T allele is referred to as a loss of function allele for the OPN1LW

00:00:07.016 --> 00:00:09.790
gene. Because the red cone cells lose the

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.100
ability to detect long wavelengths, or red light. As

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.950
a result, the combination of colors an individual

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.680
can see is altered. Take this rainbow of colors

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.010
for example, if you have normal color vision,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.470
then you should be able to distinguish these six

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.850
individual panels from each other as red,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.120
orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple or violet.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.120
But in the case of this C739T allele of the OPN1LW gene, an individual has

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.080
something called protanopia. And this is what

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.890
they would see, instead of the six colored

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.503
rainbow here. Protanopia is a severe type of

00:00:46.503 --> 00:00:50.532
color division deficiency, caused by the complete absence

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:54.670
of the red photoreceptors. Like OPN1LW. Pure

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.190
reds can not be seen, they instead appear

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.060
sort of dark and black. Purple colors

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.770
can't really be distinguished from blues and more

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.550
orange tinted reds kind of appear as very

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.230
dim yellows. And pretty much all orange, yellow,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.780
green shades, of too long a wave

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.690
length to stimulate the other colors, like blue,

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.640
appear just as a yellow color. So based on the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.120
comparison we just did, I want you to tell me which

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.295
of the following you would expect a person with protanopia, or

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:28.860
red/green color blindness, to have trouble with. But I want you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.490
to do this based on the colors alone that you

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.290
see in the examples. Just the colors. I want you to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.540
look at each answer individually. And then check any and all

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.070
that you think apply. And remember, if you have trouble distinguishing

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.070
the colors that you see here. You might want to

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.970
visit your doctor and get checked out for color blindness.
