00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.040
There are lots of legitimate reasons to worry
about getting older, like getting sick and

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.580
running out of money, ending up alone.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.370
Those fears are legitimate and real.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.600
But the thing is, we need to think about how
the culture in which we age shapes those experiences.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.260
I'm not a Pollyanna about aging.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.859
I'm sort of in the 'both sides of the story'
business.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.050
We hear only the downside.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.349
And we hear very little about all the positive
aspects of aging, which are that we grow more

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.230
confident, we grow happier.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.589
When I started thinking about all this, my
view of old age was unrelievedly grim.

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:49.650
And one of the things I stumbled upon really
early was the U-curve of happiness.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.210
And when I first encountered it, seriously
I thought they must have cornered two 80 year

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.549
olds, and given them a cookie, and said 'How
are you doing?'

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:01.949
The U-curve shows that people are happiest
at the beginnings and the ends of our lives,

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.270
that midlife, the famous midlife crisis, is
indeed the trough of our satisfaction.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.510
And this is true for a couple of reasons.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.860
Midlife is the time of life when typically
we have maximum family responsibilities.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.190
We're supposed to be crushing it in our careers.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.920
We may have responsibility for people both
older and younger than us.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.990
And it's also the time of life where we realize,
gee, I may not become a ballerina, I may not

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.180
hike Mt. Everest.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.530
And those are sobering reflections, that maybe
now, you're at a turning point, and there's

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.350
more road behind you than ahead.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.250
But something happens as we get older, especially
up into our 80s.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.470
And it is the exact opposite of an ageist
thought that I started out with.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.900
I thought, well, obviously, everything about
getting older is going to suck.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.650
And one of the things that clearly sucks about
it is the proximity to death.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.970
I envisioned, I literally envisioned the shadow
of the grim reaper stretching over this sad

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.730
iron bedstead.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.560
The awareness that time is short does not
fill people with dread.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.200
It doesn't work that way neurologically.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.850
That was another assumption of mine.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.430
The knowledge that time is short helps people
live in the moment, because they are more

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.660
conscious about what they want to do with
their time and who they want to spend it with.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.510
Kids live in the moment because they aren't
neurologically equipped to do anything else.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.700
And olders do it because precisely they are
aware that time is short and they want to

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.050
make the most of the remaining time.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.260
It's why the older people are, the less they
worry about dying.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.490
They don't want to die.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.440
And they especially don't want to die in pain.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.709
But they don't worry about it.

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.920
And they think younger people worry too much
about both the dying and the getting there.
