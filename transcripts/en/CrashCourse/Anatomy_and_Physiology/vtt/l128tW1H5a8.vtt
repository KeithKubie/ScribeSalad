00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
We’ve been spending a lot of time lately talking
about eating, and digesting, and metabolizing food.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.189
And those are some of my favorite things in
the world! It’s been a really great time.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.740
But, as with all good parties, or brunch buffets,
in the end, we’re left with a mess.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.970
And I’m not talking about spilled beer and
Dorito crumbs, I’m talking about toxic levels

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.270
of garbage that need to be cleaned up before
they kill you.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.450
In your body, a lot of the cleanup that comes
after metabolism is handled by the liver, which

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.480
plays a tremendous role in directing dead cells and
leftover chemicals to the digestive and urinary systems.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.940
But your liver can’t actually escort waste
out of your person.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.969
Your lungs can lend a hand, exhaling carbon
dioxide, and of course your colon will eventually

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.140
poop out unusable stuff and old cell-parts.
But much of your chemical waste still needs

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.120
to be sorted and disposed of, so one system
steps in to bat clean-up.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.300
And that, is your urinary system.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.519
This system -- and specifically your kidneys
-- does all sorts of important homeostatic

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.659
stuff, like regulating your water volume,
ion salt concentrations, and pH levels, and

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.359
influencing your red blood cell production
and blood pressure.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.269
But its main purpose -- what we’re going
to be focusing on for the next two lessons

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.610
-- is how it filters toxic leftovers from
your blood -- like the nitrogenous waste made

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.470
by metabolizing protein -- and ferries it
out of the body.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.730
And — spoiler alert! — this all involves the
how, and the why, and the what of your pee.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.780
Now you probably know that kidneys are filters,
and you may imagine them as sieves that strain

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.290
out the bad stuff, leaving it sitting like
a hairball at the bottom of the bathtub.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.070
But that is, in fact, kind of the opposite
of what you should be thinking.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.810
Most of what’s in your blood is totally
removed by the kidneys. Then your body pulls

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.240
back what it wants to hold onto, before the
rest is sent on a one-way trip to the bladder.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.960
It’s kinda like this: you don’t clean out your fridge
by just taking out the rotten fruit and fuzzy leftovers.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.570
Instead, you’ve got to take everything out,
and put it on the counter, and then sort through

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.430
what goes back in the fridge and what goes
in the trash.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.030
That’s how your urinary system cleans you
up. And it is really good at its job.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.280
So this morning I decided to go the healthy
route and instead of eating my normal breakfast

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.080
of nothing, I had a big 32-ounce protein smoothie.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.670
My digestive system did its thing, and all
the protein was hydrolyzed into amino acids,

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.719
which were absorbed by my blood, and sent
all over my body to build and repair cells.

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.620
It’s a beautiful thing, but not without
consequence.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.040
Because metabolizing nutrients -- especially
protein -- makes a mess.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.860
You may remember that amino acids are unique,
in that they have nitrogen in their amine groups.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.840
And because we can’t store amino acids,
extra ones get processed into storable carbs or fats.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.819
But the amine group isn’t used in those
storage molecules, so it’s converted to

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.579
NH3, or ammonia, which happens to be toxic. So the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.140
liver converts the ammonia into a less-toxic compound,
urea, which our kidneys filter out into our pee.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.170
Once out of the body, urea can degrade back
into ammonia, which is why dirty, pee-soaked

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.519
toilets and cat litter boxes smell like ammonia.

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.079
Now this business of taking out the nitrogenous
trash is one of the urinary system’s biggest jobs.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.240
Its other major duty is to regulate the balance
of salt and water in your blood, and both

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:02.579
of these tasks are processed in the whole
system of tubes that is your urinary system.

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.659
So let’s take a look at some basic pee-making
anatomy.

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.620
Your kidneys are a pair of dark red, fist-sized,
bean-shaped organs that sit on each side of

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.200
your spine against the posterior body wall.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.190
Kidneys are retroperitoneal, which means they
lie between the dorsal wall and the peritoneum

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.920
-- the membrane that surrounds the abdominal
cavity -- rather than inside the cavity itself,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.529
like your intestines and stomach do.

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:28.639
Each kidney has three distinct layers, beginning
with the outermost cortex.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.419
Beneath that is the medulla,
a set of cone-shaped masses

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.479
of tissue that secrete urine into tiny sac-like tubules.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.680
And finally, the innermost layer is the renal
pelvis, a funnel-shaped tube surrounded by

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:45.529
smooth muscle that uses peristalsis to move urine
out of the kidney, into the ureter, and into the bladder.

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:49.700
Because the kidneys’ main job is to filter
blood continuously, they end up seeing a lot of it.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.769
In fact, at any given moment they hold over
20 percent of your total blood volume.

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.749
Oxygenated blood enters the kidneys through
the large renal arteries, which deliver nearly

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:02.590
a quarter of all blood pumped through the
heart every minute. That means your kidneys

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.169
filter about 120 to 140 liters of blood EVERY
DAY.

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:11.499
As they enter the kidneys, renal arteries branch many,
many times, ending in tons of little capillary groups.

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:15.639
So a kidney isn’t just one big filter; instead,
each one is made up of about a million twisty

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.459
microscopic filtering units called nephrons.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.210
Structurally and functionally, nephrons are
where the real business of blood-processing

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.750
-- which, like, “pee-making” -- begins, in three steps:
filtration, reabsorption, and secretion.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.260
Each nephron consists of a round renal corpuscle
that resides up in the cortex, followed by

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.240
a long and winding renal tubule that loops
around between the cortex and the medulla.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.150
The outer part of the corpuscle is a cup-shaped
feature called the glomerular capsule, because

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.430
inside it there’s a whole tangle of capillaries
called the glomerulus -- that’s from the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.560
Latin word for “ball of yarn,” which is
pretty much what it looks like.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.500
And the endothelium of these capillaries is
very porous. So they allow lots of fluid,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.389
waste products, ions, glucose, and amino acids
to pass from the blood into the capsule -- but

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.530
they block out bigger molecules like blood
cells and proteins, so they stay in the blood

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.259
and exit through the peritubular capillaries,
also known as the vasa recta.

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.889
Now, all the stuff that get squeezed out of
the blood into the glomerulus is called filtrate,

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.530
which is then sent along to the elaborately
twisting three-centimeter-long renal tubule.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.150
Even though it looks like it’s just a tube,
it has three major parts, some of which are

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.400
permeable to certain substances, but not others.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.509
First along is the proximal convoluted tubule,
or PCT, which is about as convoluted-looking

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:30.409
at its name suggests; then the tube drops
into a dramatic hairpin turn called the nephron

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.190
loop, or the loop of Henle -- I term I kinda
like better, personally -- and finally it

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.509
ends in the distal convoluted tubule or DCT,
which empties into a collecting duct.

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.180
All this twisting might make the tubule look,
like, super inefficient, but it actually serves

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.500
an important purpose, as you might expect.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.169
Just like with your small intestines, the
long, curly shape of the nephron provides

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.940
more time and space for it to re-absorb whatever
useable stuff it can.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.110
And this meandering path also allows the parts
of the tubule that are toward the end, to

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.340
have an affect on processes that take place
closer to the beginning, as they pass each other.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.300
Because a lot of the stuff that winds up in
the tube are valuable commodities -- like

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.509
ions and glucose and water -- and we don’t
want to just pee all of them out if we can help it.

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:14.740
So, let’s trace the whole process, starting at the
top, with the proximal convoluted tubule or PCT.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.980
The walls here are made of cuboidal epithelial
cells, with big ol’ mitochondria that make

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.669
ATP, to power pumps that pull lots of sodium
ions from the filtrate, using active transport.

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.300
These cells also are covered in microvilli
that increase their surface area and help

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.379
re-absorb much of the good stuff from the
filtrate and back into the blood.

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:35.530
The remaining filtrate passes from the PCT
into the loop of Henle, which starts in the

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.199
cortex, then dips into the medulla before
coming back into the cortex.

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:44.090
And the form of this loop is key to its function,
because its primary task is to drive the re-absorption

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.099
of water, by creating a salt concentration
gradient in the tissue of the medulla.

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:52.159
It does this mainly by actively pumping out
salts in the ascending limb. This creates

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:56.379
some very salty interstitial fluid in the
medulla, so when new filtrate comes down the

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:01.699
descending loop in front of it, water passively
flows out, and into the super salty interstitial space.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.860
Since most of this water is picked up by the
blood pretty quickly, the saltiness of the

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.900
interstitial space doesn’t get diluted.
So it can keep drawing water out of the next

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.659
batch of filtrate in the descending limb.

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:14.229
Needless to say, this is super important,
because if we peed out all the water that

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.530
went into our kidneys, we would die of dehydration
really quick.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.110
But even after all that, we are still only
two thirds of the way through the process.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.830
As we move out of the loop of Henle, into
the distal convoluted tubule, and on to the

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.719
collecting duct, the remaining filtrate is
now officially urine. But there’s one more

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:32.879
component that we have to squeeze the most
out of before we excrete the stuff. Urea.

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:37.330
Even though we think of urea as a waste product
-- just one more part of that protein shake

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.810
that has to be dumped -- the kidneys actually
need it.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.960
They use it to ramp up the concentration gradient
earlier in the process, making the medulla

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.499
even saltier for the filtrate that’s back
there going through the ascending limb.

00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:51.879
So in the final steps, after the filtrate
leaves the DCT, it enters the collecting duct,

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:56.599
which runs back into the medulla. And while
the salt passively draws even more water out

00:07:56.599 --> 00:08:00.349
of the collecting duct, some urea passively
leaves the urine as well.

00:08:00.349 --> 00:08:05.129
Making the medulla even more salty -- and,
in turn, more effective at drawing out water

00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:07.090
from the ascending limb a few steps back.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.979
So there’s essentially a traveling pool
of urea that escapes the urine, finds its

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:14.699
way back into the loop of Henle, and then
runs the whole course again back to the collecting

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:17.789
duct -- an ammonia-scented cycle called urea
recycling.

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:22.259
Now all that’s left is a kind of last call
to selectively sneak out any extra waste -- like

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:26.530
hydrogen, potassium, and certain organic acids
and bases -- using active transport.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.889
This is called tubular secretion, and it transports
only select kinds of waste that have already

00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:34.740
made their way into the blood that’s in the
peritubular capillaries, ready to leave the kidneys.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.070
This step is kind of like emptying your pockets
of any last wads of tissue or crumpled receipts

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.010
as you’re walking a bag of trash to the
curb.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.540
And that’s how your kidneys clean up the
mess left over from the giant party that is

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.040
you metabolizing food. So if you thought that
your kidneys were just a kinda fine mesh that

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.660
filtered out bad stuff? Now you know that’s
not true.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.089
If you thought your urinary system was basically
a matter of: Water goes in, pee goes out?

00:08:56.089 --> 00:08:57.620
That’s DEFINITELY not true.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.230
And if you thought we were done talking about
your urine, that is also not true, either,

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.639
because next time, we’re going to learn
how your body regulates what’s absorbed

00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:08.939
and what’s excreted, and we’ll find out 
can happen when that regulation goes awry.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.700
But for now, you learned the anatomy of your
urinary system, and how your kidneys filter

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.940
metabolic waste and balance salt and water
concentrations in the blood. Specifically

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:23.000
you learned how nephrons use glomerular filtration,
tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.209
to reabsorb water and nutrients back into
the blood, and make urine with the leftovers.
