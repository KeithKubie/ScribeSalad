00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This technique of using the most obvious fix, so beautiful--I'd really like to show this to you.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So here we have a complete program again. I managed to restore each from previous backup.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And again, if we run this, you'll see that the HTML markup is not removed.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So the technique of using the most obvious fix is very simple.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We simply check for the input that's wrong and return the correct output.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Lo and behold, this technique beautifully works and returns the correct output.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Rumor has it that some programmers use this very technique to make their unit test work.
