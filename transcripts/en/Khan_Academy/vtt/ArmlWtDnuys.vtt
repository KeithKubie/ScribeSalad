00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:01.723
- [Voiceover] So let's give ourselves

00:00:01.723 --> 00:00:03.568
an overview of glycolysis.

00:00:03.568 --> 00:00:04.962
and glycolysis is an incredibly

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:07.585
important biochemical pathway.

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:10.441
It occures in practically
all life as we know it

00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:14.249
and it's all about taking
glucose as a fuel and,

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.060
in the process of breaking it up,

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.544
lycing the glucose, glycolysis,

00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:22.979
breaking it up into
two pyruvate molecules.

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:25.846
Glucose is a six carbon molecule.

00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:29.306
Each of the pyruvates are
three carbon molecules.

00:00:29.306 --> 00:00:30.908
In the process of doing that,

00:00:30.908 --> 00:00:33.508
you produce two ATPs net.

00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:36.387
It actually turns out that
you need to use two ATPs

00:00:36.387 --> 00:00:38.339
and then you produce four.

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:42.235
So you use two ATPs.

00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:43.930
That's often called the investment phase

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.289
and we'll talk about that in a second.

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:51.258
And then you produce four ATPs

00:00:51.258 --> 00:00:54.717
for a net of

00:00:54.717 --> 00:00:57.411
plus two ATPs

00:00:57.411 --> 00:00:59.152
and that's what we see right over here.

00:00:59.152 --> 00:01:03.656
You see a net of two ATPs
being produced directly

00:01:03.656 --> 00:01:08.149
by glycolysis, and then you also have

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.736
the reduction of NAD to NADH.

00:01:11.736 --> 00:01:15.509
Remember, reduction is all
about gaining electrons,

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.528
and over here, NAD, that's nicotinamide

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:21.390
adinine dinucleotide, we
have other videos on that,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.747
it's an interesting
molecule, it's actually a

00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:26.974
fairly decent-sized molecule, we see this

00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:29.493
positive charge, but
then we see that not only

00:01:29.493 --> 00:01:32.036
does it gain a hydrogen, but
it loses its positive charge.

00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:34.915
It gains a hydrogen and an electron.

00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:37.051
You can think on a net basis it's gaining

00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:38.606
a hydride.

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:44.412
Now a hydride anion's
not going to typically be

00:01:44.412 --> 00:01:47.036
all by itself, but on a net
basis, you can think about

00:01:47.036 --> 00:01:48.952
that's what's happening.

00:01:48.952 --> 00:01:52.968
And so it's gaining a
hydrogen and an extra electron

00:01:52.968 --> 00:01:57.488
and so this, the NAD+, this
is going to get reduced.

00:01:57.488 --> 00:02:00.831
That is going to get reduced to NADH.

00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:03.443
So this is getting reduced to NADH.

00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:06.763
And that NADH, it can then

00:02:06.763 --> 00:02:09.747
be oxidized in the
electron transport chain.

00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:11.581
We'll study that later
on when we think about

00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:14.240
oxidative phosphorylation, to produce

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.900
even more ATPs.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.988
But on a very high-level, simple basis.

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:21.101
Glucose being broken down in pyruvate,

00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:23.968
six carbons, three carbons each of these

00:02:23.968 --> 00:02:25.605
pyruvates, now there's
other things attached

00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:27.602
to the carbons, and we'll
see that in a little bit.

00:02:27.602 --> 00:02:31.885
Two ATPs net generated,
and you have the reduction

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:36.506
of two NADs to two NADHs,
and those can be used

00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:39.706
later on to produce more ATPs.

00:02:39.706 --> 00:02:42.724
Now, glycolysis is
typically just the beginning

00:02:42.724 --> 00:02:44.140
of cellular respiration.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.207
If oxygen is around, then
you have these products,

00:02:48.207 --> 00:02:51.968
some of these moving into the mitochondria

00:02:51.968 --> 00:02:53.872
where you can have the citric acid cycle,

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:58.226
Krebs cycle, and the oxidative
phosphorylation occur.

00:02:58.226 --> 00:03:00.629
If you don't have oxygen
around, then you're

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.229
going to do anaerobic
respiration, or you're

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.191
going to go into fermentation.

00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:07.014
We'll talk about that in
a future video, and that's

00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:09.428
really about figuring
out what to do with these

00:03:09.428 --> 00:03:13.863
products, and especially
replenishing your NAD+.

00:03:13.863 --> 00:03:15.871
Now that we have a very
high-level overview

00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:18.553
of glycolysis, let's get
a better appreciation

00:03:18.553 --> 00:03:20.968
for exactly what's going on.

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:23.914
And whenever I look at these more detailed

00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:27.576
processes, the one
thing to just appreciate

00:03:27.576 --> 00:03:30.617
is how much complexity is occurring

00:03:30.617 --> 00:03:32.417
in all of your cells right now.

00:03:32.417 --> 00:03:35.145
This is fairly abstract,

00:03:35.145 --> 00:03:37.699
to even imagine these things, but this

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:39.800
is happening throughout your body

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.064
gazillions of times, right now.

00:03:42.064 --> 00:03:43.260
This isn't something that is somehow

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.479
distant from you.

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.498
And it's also fun to appreciate, well how

00:03:46.498 --> 00:03:48.356
all of this was discovered by scientists.

00:03:48.356 --> 00:03:51.119
That's a whole other
fascinating discussion.

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:52.756
But the whole point of
this video is just to

00:03:52.756 --> 00:03:55.855
give us an appreciation
for the actual mechanism

00:03:55.855 --> 00:03:57.724
or the reaction by which it occurs.

00:03:57.724 --> 00:03:58.978
I'm not gonna go into the detailed

00:03:58.978 --> 00:04:01.381
organic chemistry mechanism.

00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:04.353
So over here, this is a
glucose molecule over here,

00:04:04.353 --> 00:04:07.894
you see one, two, three,
four, five, six carbons.

00:04:07.894 --> 00:04:11.295
And then the first step
is, it gets phosphorylated

00:04:11.295 --> 00:04:13.234
and we have a whole video
on the phosphorylation

00:04:13.234 --> 00:04:16.183
of glucose, and all of
these steps are facilitated

00:04:16.183 --> 00:04:17.216
with enzymes.

00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:20.374
The phosphorylation is
facilitated with the hexokinase.

00:04:20.374 --> 00:04:23.035
Kinase is a general term for an enzyme

00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:25.705
that either facilitates phosphorylation or

00:04:25.705 --> 00:04:29.211
dephosphorylates, it's dealing with

00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:31.150
phosphorylation, I guess you could say.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.007
And enzymes are all about lowering

00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:34.505
the activation energy.

00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:36.745
And the way that
hexokinases do, or part of

00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:39.369
how they do it, is they
involve the cofactor,

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:40.843
a magnesium ion.

00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:43.003
And we've talked about
that in other videos,

00:04:43.003 --> 00:04:46.207
how cofactors can help an enzyme lower the

00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:47.553
activation energy.

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:51.210
And to do the phosphorylation,
we use an ATP.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.670
So this is minus one ATP.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.205
So we are in the investment phase.

00:04:58.205 --> 00:05:01.147
But this reaction strongly goes from

00:05:01.147 --> 00:05:05.164
left to right, it's a
coupled reaction that,

00:05:05.164 --> 00:05:08.228
phosphorylating the glucose, that

00:05:08.228 --> 00:05:11.746
requires free energy, but
the ATP releases free energy

00:05:11.746 --> 00:05:13.905
you couple these reactions,
it strongly goes from

00:05:13.905 --> 00:05:15.298
left to right.

00:05:15.298 --> 00:05:17.899
Now, and just to be clear what happened,

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:21.242
this over here got replaced, or maybe

00:05:21.242 --> 00:05:25.387
I should say this over here got replaced

00:05:25.387 --> 00:05:27.882
with that over there.

00:05:27.882 --> 00:05:29.690
Just to keep track of what's happening.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.430
Now, another enzyme-catalyzed reaction,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.171
this one is actually
an equilibrium, it can

00:05:34.171 --> 00:05:36.992
go both ways, but as we'll see, the right

00:05:36.992 --> 00:05:39.639
side or the things that
are further into the

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.810
glycolysis process, these are constantly

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.190
being turned into further
products, so their

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.792
concentrations are
going to go down, and so

00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:48.439
the reaction will tend to go that way.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:51.608
Although this particular
reaction, going from

00:05:51.608 --> 00:05:54.255
glucose 6-phosphate to
fructose 6-phosphate,

00:05:54.255 --> 00:05:56.275
this could be an equilibrium.

00:05:56.275 --> 00:05:58.457
But the enzyme that facilitates this,

00:05:58.457 --> 00:06:02.915
phosphoglucose isomerase, these are

00:06:02.915 --> 00:06:06.080
enzymes that help go from one isomer of

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.775
a molecule to another isomer.

00:06:07.775 --> 00:06:09.040
And that's what's happening here.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.360
Instead of this oxygen
being bound to this carbon,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.659
this bond forms with this carbon.

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:16.899
So you have fructose,
you have the five-carbon

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:19.453
ring over here, or you
have the five-element

00:06:19.453 --> 00:06:21.102
ring, you have four carbons in it,

00:06:21.102 --> 00:06:23.268
versus a six-element ring
where right over here

00:06:23.268 --> 00:06:24.905
you have five carbons.

00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:27.146
So this bond goes to this
carbon right over here

00:06:27.146 --> 00:06:28.887
and that's the main difference.

00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:31.209
And then you have another, very strong

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:33.508
forward reaction, once again facilitated

00:06:33.508 --> 00:06:37.931
by ATP, and this is done
by phosphofructokinase.

00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:39.684
It has the word kinase in it.

00:06:39.684 --> 00:06:41.947
And it's using up the ATP, you can guess

00:06:41.947 --> 00:06:42.911
what's going to happen.

00:06:42.911 --> 00:06:44.884
We're going to attach another phosphate

00:06:44.884 --> 00:06:48.878
group to the fructose 6-phosphate, and now

00:06:48.878 --> 00:06:50.712
you have two of these phosphate groups.

00:06:50.712 --> 00:06:54.497
So this hydrogen right over here is now

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:58.978
replaced with another phosphate group.

00:06:58.978 --> 00:07:00.499
And once again it's facilitated by the

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:03.575
magnesium cofactor, it helps stabilize

00:07:03.575 --> 00:07:05.432
some of the negative
charge associated with

00:07:05.432 --> 00:07:08.149
the phosphate groups, we talk
about that in other videos.

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:10.773
But the important thing
is, it uses another ATP.

00:07:10.773 --> 00:07:13.545
We're still in the investment phase,

00:07:13.545 --> 00:07:16.389
negative one ATP.

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:17.805
And every time I look at
this it's just fascinating

00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:20.290
that all of this stuff is
happening in your cells

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.671
as we speak.

00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:24.213
In fact, in order for me to
speak this has to happen,

00:07:24.213 --> 00:07:26.454
because my body needs to
take glucose and come up

00:07:26.454 --> 00:07:30.064
with some energy to turn
into ATPs so that my muscles

00:07:30.064 --> 00:07:32.769
can actually move and I can
actually inhale and exhale

00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:34.267
and all the things that
I need to do for speech.

00:07:34.267 --> 00:07:37.065
So appreciate what's going on over here.

00:07:37.065 --> 00:07:38.806
Now the next step we talk about, the whole

00:07:38.806 --> 00:07:43.008
process of glycolysis is lysing glucose.

00:07:43.008 --> 00:07:45.493
And over here this is derived from

00:07:45.493 --> 00:07:47.269
glucose and some phosphates, and the

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:49.707
next step, we're actually
going to break it up.

00:07:49.707 --> 00:07:52.029
And we're going to break
it up using the enzyme

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:54.269
fructose biphosphate aldolase.

00:07:54.269 --> 00:07:57.787
Aldolase enzymes facilitate
the aldol reaction.

00:07:57.787 --> 00:08:00.909
And this one, the aldol reaction could be

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:05.449
to merge two molecules or in this case,

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:07.503
we're going to break them up.

00:08:07.503 --> 00:08:10.963
And we break them up into
two three-carbon chains.

00:08:10.963 --> 00:08:12.507
Now these two three-carbon chains,

00:08:12.507 --> 00:08:14.782
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,
and this character

00:08:14.782 --> 00:08:17.104
right over here, they
can be converted between

00:08:17.104 --> 00:08:19.461
the two with another isomerase, this

00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:22.479
triosephosphate isomerase right over here.

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:25.602
So at this point in glycloysis,
we can think of ourselves

00:08:25.602 --> 00:08:27.424
as really having two of these.

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:30.988
So let's say two times
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:32.521
So as we go further on, just imagining

00:08:32.521 --> 00:08:36.886
this happening twice for
every glucose molecule.

00:08:36.886 --> 00:08:38.441
And any time you get
confused, I encourage you

00:08:38.441 --> 00:08:39.683
to pause the video.

00:08:39.683 --> 00:08:42.319
See how these pieces and these pieces

00:08:42.319 --> 00:08:45.140
put together, can form that over there.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.661
So now we have another reaction,

00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:49.667
it's facilitated by a dehydrogenase.

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:52.906
Dehydrogenases usually are involved in

00:08:52.906 --> 00:08:56.342
this case, this is the reduction of NAD.

00:08:56.342 --> 00:08:58.444
We saw that in the overview video.

00:08:58.444 --> 00:09:02.286
So NAD is being reduced.

00:09:02.286 --> 00:09:04.736
And this can be used, this NADH later on

00:09:04.736 --> 00:09:06.698
can be used in the
electron transport chain

00:09:06.698 --> 00:09:09.577
to potentially produce some more ATP,

00:09:09.577 --> 00:09:12.699
but in that process we also add

00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:14.278
another phosphate group to the

00:09:14.278 --> 00:09:16.205
glyceraladehyde 3-phosphate.

00:09:16.205 --> 00:09:19.456
So you see this phosphate group

00:09:19.456 --> 00:09:23.710
right over here that wasn't there before.

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:29.984
And actually this right over here is

00:09:29.984 --> 00:09:33.641
I should have arrows on both sides,

00:09:33.641 --> 00:09:35.278
this right over here, that reaction

00:09:35.278 --> 00:09:36.926
could actually go both directions.

00:09:36.926 --> 00:09:39.063
Actually, that reaction can as well.

00:09:39.063 --> 00:09:43.265
And then, we are now

00:09:43.265 --> 00:09:45.900
going to be in the payoff phase.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.303
So this right over here, we're starting

00:09:48.303 --> 00:09:50.033
with this molecule that has these

00:09:50.033 --> 00:09:52.448
two phosphate groups, and then

00:09:52.448 --> 00:09:55.350
using the phosphoglycerate kinase, we're

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.323
able to pop one of those
phosphate groups off

00:09:57.323 --> 00:10:01.131
and in the process, produce ATP.

00:10:01.131 --> 00:10:02.942
Now we might want to say plus one ATP,

00:10:02.942 --> 00:10:03.906
but we have to remember, this is now

00:10:03.906 --> 00:10:05.171
happening twice.

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:07.946
Cuz we had two of those
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates,

00:10:07.946 --> 00:10:09.606
so now we could say,
if we're talking about

00:10:09.606 --> 00:10:13.866
this happening twice, plus two ATPs.

00:10:13.866 --> 00:10:16.142
We are now in the payoff phase.

00:10:16.142 --> 00:10:18.138
Then you have, facilitated by the

00:10:18.138 --> 00:10:21.691
phosphoglycerate mutase, a mutase is a

00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:23.235
class of isomerases.

00:10:23.235 --> 00:10:24.396
I have trouble saying that.

00:10:24.396 --> 00:10:26.021
That'll take a functional
group from one place

00:10:26.021 --> 00:10:28.157
to another, or take one part of a molecule

00:10:28.157 --> 00:10:31.162
to another part, and you
see this phosphate group

00:10:33.315 --> 00:10:37.192
moving on from this carbon
to the middle carbon.

00:10:37.192 --> 00:10:38.725
And so that's what that's doing.

00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:41.731
Then we use an enloase to get over here

00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:46.469
and then the pyruvate kinase, and here

00:10:46.469 --> 00:10:47.888
the kinase is going to be used to

00:10:47.888 --> 00:10:50.802
dephosphorylate this
molecule right over here,

00:10:50.802 --> 00:10:52.601
and it gets us to the way I've drawn it is

00:10:52.601 --> 00:10:55.829
pyruvic acid, since I've
drawn the hydrogen here,

00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:57.837
and if the hydrogen is
let go and this oxygen

00:10:57.837 --> 00:11:01.203
hogs the electron, we
would call this pyruvate.

00:11:01.203 --> 00:11:04.419
And this is considered to be the end of,

00:11:04.419 --> 00:11:06.996
I guess you could say,
mainstream glycolysis.

00:11:06.996 --> 00:11:09.179
But what happened, and I don't want to

00:11:09.179 --> 00:11:11.327
glaze over what happened over here,

00:11:11.327 --> 00:11:14.287
this ADP got converted
to another ATP, but it's

00:11:14.287 --> 00:11:15.796
going to happen twice.

00:11:15.796 --> 00:11:19.418
So this is another plus two ATPs.

00:11:19.418 --> 00:11:22.436
So hopefully you see the investment phase,

00:11:22.436 --> 00:11:25.032
we use an ATP right over
here to phosphorylate

00:11:25.032 --> 00:11:28.418
the glucose, we use
another ATP right over here

00:11:28.418 --> 00:11:30.461
to throw that second phosphate group

00:11:30.461 --> 00:11:34.002
on what was the fructose 6-phosphate,

00:11:34.002 --> 00:11:36.045
but then we get the payoff phase.

00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:38.239
So we're able to produce this NADH, and

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.899
this is actually going to be two NADHs,

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.478
because everything here's going to happen

00:11:41.478 --> 00:11:43.928
twice now, we can assume
that this character

00:11:43.928 --> 00:11:45.959
over here also gets converted to a

00:11:45.959 --> 00:11:49.326
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and now

00:11:49.326 --> 00:11:51.787
we've produced two ATPs,
cuz this is happening twice,

00:11:51.787 --> 00:11:54.445
and we've produced two
ATPs right over there.

00:11:54.445 --> 00:11:57.965
So hopefully everything we
talked about in the beginning

00:11:57.965 --> 00:12:00.237
actually makes sense.
