Let me tell you how miserable my mornings
are without breakfast. I hate everyone, yes

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:12.210
everyone. Even that old lady who took the
last seat on the train. I hate you.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.160
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.430
Do we need breakfast? Your mom always tells
you to eat your breakfast, but do you really

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.220
need to?

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.650
A recent study published in Journal of Public
Economics says yes. The researchers found

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.320
that schools that provided free breakfast
for their students had better test scores

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.640
than those that didn’t. The kids performed
25% better in math, and had similar gains

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.390
in other areas like reading.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.230
But this news isn’t entirely new. Breakfast
is heralded as the most important meal of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.660
the day. And science backs this up. There
are loads of studies that show just how important

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.550
it is for learning and memory, but it might
not have the weight loss benefits you think.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.649
Anyways, is it breakfast that helps give the
brain a boost? Or is it the type of food you

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.800
eat?

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.350
I mean, the brain consumes a lot of energy.
Almost 20% of the energy we consume goes to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.790
the brain. Some researchers say that the brain
functions best when there’s 25 grams of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.610
glucose circulating through the bloodstream.
So really, you should keep that as level as

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.350
possible- any spike or dip can leave you feeling
off. So maybe eating more frequent smaller

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.170
meals throughout the day can help you avoid
a “post lunch crash”.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.210
But is there a way to hack your brain with
food? Is there such a thing as “brain food?”

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.950
I was always told to eat a banana before a
test.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.520
Curcumin[CUR-Q-MIN] and Omega 3s seem to be
buzzing around the blogsphere of late. And

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.110
there may be some truth to that. According
to a paper published in the National Review

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.939
of Neuroscience, these nutrients lessen cognitive
decline in the elderly and improve cognition

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.390
in people with brain injuries. You’re typical
sources of this stuff are fish, like salmon,

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.650
Flax seeds and walnuts.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.990
Curcumin can be found mostly in tumeric, a
type of spice. Iron and b vitamins help memory

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.530
and brain function in women. While diets high
in saturated fats, tend to do the opposite.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.580
Omega threes and other micronutrients seem
to be the heavy hitters of brain food. One

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.850
study published in the American Journal of
Clinical Nutrition found that a cocktail of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.229
omega-3s, iron, zinc, folate and vitamins
A, B6, B12 and C, helped kids in Australia

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.220
and Indonesia do better on learning and memory
tests.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.060
Another study published in the journal Appetite
by some of the same researchers found that

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.840
foods low on the glycemic index are better
for breakfast. The glycemic index rates food

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.370
based on how it affects your glucose levels,
or levels of sugar. The study found that yes,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.569
kids memory and cognitive function decline
throughout the morning, but a low GI breakfast

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.730
reduced that decline more than a high GI did.
Low GI foods are like fruits and vegetables

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.900
or oatmeal. So a good breakfast might be a
bowl of oatmeal with a banana rather than

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.780
a bowl of cereal.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.700
So yes, a balanced diet, with fish and fruits
and veggies seems to be good for the brain.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.250
Eating breakfast might keep you perkier in
the morning so you’re more alert to learn

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.270
more. And some studies even show that that
old wives tale of chewing gum for a test is

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.489
true. Chewing gum increases blood flow to
the brain, which more does all sorts of good

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:49.750
things.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.349
So before a big test, eat a good breakfast,
no not sugary cereals and maybe have a piece

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:01.349
of gum.
