00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.870
In this class we'll build a Pitch
Perfect App which let's you record

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.450
your voice and
play it back with changes to the pitch.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.860
This lesson is an introduction
to where we explore and

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.000
get comfortable with Xcode,
Apple's development environment.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.600
You can use Xcode to create apps for
any of Apple's platforms.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.630
From the watch to AppleTV To iOS and
even the Mac.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.610
This lesson is all about
getting comfortable with Xcode.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.870
In Lesson 2 we'll set up
the basic structure of the app,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.120
learning how to connect UI elements,
such as buttons, to our code.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.930
In Lesson 3 we're going to step it
up a notch, add multiple views to

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.920
the Pitch Perfect app, as well as
adding the code to record audio.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.730
Towards the end, in lessons 4 and
5 you'll learn how to play back your

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.510
own voice with the pitch perfect app
with various alterations to the pitch.

00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:53.380
You'll also learn how to deploy
pitch perfect on your iOS device.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.320
As you progress this course,
we'll be introducing the Swift And

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.590
iOS concepts you need to know
in order to build pitch perfect.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.121
After that in UIkit fundamentals will go
into much further depth in both swift,

00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:07.786
and iOS.

00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:10.191

to download Xcode and

00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:12.540
begin your adventure in iOS development.
