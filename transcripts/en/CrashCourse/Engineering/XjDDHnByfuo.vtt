00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.280
If there’s anything we’ve seen so far
in this series, it’s that you need the right
materials to solve your problems.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.540
Metals and ceramics will go a long way in
this world, but they’re not always the best choice.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.820
Every time you bounce a ball or drive your
car on a set of tires, you’re seeing a different
kind of material in action –

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.400
one that’s able to do things metals and
ceramics just can’t.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.980
They’re called polymers, and the world as
we know it depends on them.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:35.180
[Theme Music]

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.000
Imagine there’s a 12 story building, and
up on the top floor is a fire.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.060
Naturally, your first response would be to
call the fire department.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.700
They’d come in their big trucks, hook up
their hoses, and put out the fire. Right?

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.579
Well, unfortunately, it’s not always that
simple.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.580
Many fire hoses, especially older ones, only
have enough capacity and water pressure to
reach about 30 meters straight up.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.020
And in practice, firefighters on the ground
rarely attempt to reach even half that distance
with a hose – only around the 4th floor.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.300
Even with a ladder truck, firefighters can
only reach up to about the 10th floor until
it becomes difficult and unsafe.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.060
But that’s still 2 stories short of where
our fire is.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.040
If we assume that we can’t just use a different
water source or another hose, then we’re going to
need to send the water up higher than it already is.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.280
How could we do that?

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.280
Well, one answer is by using polymers!

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.720
They’re already everywhere in this situation,
like in the trucks the firefighters drive and the
gear they wear.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.160
And they can cause a special phenomenon that
might help with the water height problem, too.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.059
Polymers are materials made up of long, repeating
chains of tiny molecules known as monomers

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:40.429
– a class of molecules that can react with
others to form much larger molecules.

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:47.860
In a polymer, monomers are repeated over and
over again until there are hundreds, thousands,
or even millions of them in a long line.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.000
Typically, polymers have lower densities
compared to metals and ceramics, and they
aren’t usually as stiff or strong.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.979
So you probably shouldn’t try to build a
house out of them.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.040
Many polymers are also extremely ductile
and pliable, so they’re easily formed into more
complex shapes.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.540
They also don’t generally react easily with other
chemicals, making them a good material for volatile
environments like a chemistry lab.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.980
But since polymers depend on the monomers that
they’re made from, you can get a better sense of a
polymer’s characteristics by looking at its composition.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.700
Ones that have longer chains tend to show
more elastic properties.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.480
These are often called elastomers, and are
mainly found in rubber materials.

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.299
Take a rubber band, for example.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.640
The molecules in the polymer can be all
clumped together, or stretched out, like when
you pull on the rubber band.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.920
On the other hand, polymers with larger and
more complex monomers tend to be stiffer.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.160
You can also stiffen polymers through a process
called cross-linking.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.400
That’s when polymers are bonded with
each other to form a 3D, net-like shape
called a polymer network.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.800
Have you ever heard of vulcanized rubber?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.200
It’s the stuff used to make things like tires,
like the ones you might find on a fire truck.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.060
Well, vulcanization is the process of using
sulfur to cross-link and strengthen rubber polymers!

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.900
Tires probably aren’t the only polymers
that you’re familiar with.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.520
Chances are good that you use plenty of
them every day, like the ones you’ll find in
plastic bags and seat covers.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.880
And while it’s easy to take polymers for
granted, they’ve only been widely used since
about the 1940s.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.860
But that doesn’t mean they don’t have
a special place in history.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.900
Research suggests that the first time people really
used polymers was back in pre-Columbian Mexico and
Central America, around 3,000 years ago.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.080
Back then, they took latex, a milky, sap-like
fluid found in some plants, and mixed it with
juice from the morning glory plant.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.280
This juice had sulfur in it, which effectively
vulcanized the latex and made it less brittle.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.140
And from there, they were able to make
rubber goods like sandals, rubber bands,
and even bouncing balls.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.040
You can actually do a pretty similar and simple
experiment if you want.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:48.140
All you have to do is mix some common glue
you’d find at a school supply store, which contains
a polymer chain known as polyvinyl acetate,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.000
with a borax solution, which will act as the
cross-linker for our mixture.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.700
And then you just combine that with some cornstarch.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.860
Stir them together, roll it around in your
hand, and poof!

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.500
You got yourself a rubber ball!

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.400
You can also do similar experiments to make
a cool slime if you change up the ingredients
and measurements a bit.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.840
Now, even though we have evidence that polymers
were used thousands of years ago, it still took a while
for the modern world to find the right applications.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.160
That’s because we don’t always get things
right the first time.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.200
For example, if you’ve ever played a game
of pool or billiards, you know that the balls
don’t usually explode.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.960
But that wasn’t always the case.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.180
Go back to the 1870s and celluloid, a hardened
material made from the natural polymer cellulose,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.480
was used to make billiard balls instead of
ivory, which was what they were made from
before that.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:39.040
Problem was, celluloid was highly flammable, and when
the billiard balls hit each other just right, they would
explode on the pool table, which happened quite often.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.820
Today billiard balls are still made of polymers,
just ones that are far less explosive!

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.340
We also tried using cheaper, more flammable,
substitutes for silk back in the day.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.980
Of course, having more flammable fabrics,
especially for clothing, is obviously a bad thing.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.360
This all happened because it wasn’t until
about the early 20th century that we had a decent
understanding of what a polymer was.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.720
That’s when Hermann Staudinger, a German
chemist, entered the picture.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.300
At the time, most chemists thought polymers
were made up of small molecules bundled together
by unknown forces.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:17.480
But in 1922, Staudinger suggested that these materials were made up of larger molecules arranged in the long molecular chains that we know them to be, all bonded in a line.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:24.380
His work earned him the Nobel Prize for
Chemistry and laid the foundation for the explosion
of the plastics industry in the 20th century.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.120
Scientists then began using polymers as synthetic
substitutes, like synthetic rubber and nylon.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.520
World War II also had a big impact on the
polymer world.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:40.100
Wartime restrictions on natural materials
helped drive the polymer industry into existence,
especially the creation of synthetic polymers.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:49.100
During the war, the Allies used polymer to create large
inflatable tanks that served as decoys on the battlefield,
part of what was known as the “Ghost Army.”

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.700
These fake tanks tricked enemies into
thinking Allied forces had far more strength
than they actually did,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.040
or that there was a giant army in an area
where there weren’t really any soldiers at all.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.900
The Ghost Army reportedly saved thousands
of lives – I’d call that a win for polymers!

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.320
And a win for us engineers, because they set
us up for the world of polymers that we have today.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.980
It’s this world that’s helped us keep
firefighters safe, using polymers to design better
gas masks and other parts of their gear.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.800
Just like with other materials, some kinds
of polymers get used more than others.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:28.420
The ones that you’ll most likely come across
are polyethylene, or PE, polyvinyl chloride, or
PVC, and polyethylene terephthalate, or PET.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.360
Polyethylene is the most common plastic in
use today.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.400
It’s primarily found in packaging materials,
like plastic bags and bottles.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.040
Polyvinyl chloride comes in two main forms:
rigid and flexible.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:46.240
Rigid forms of PVC are often used in buildings
and construction for things like plastic pipes
and the frames for windows and doors.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.700
They need to be strong, not just for daily
use, but to hold up for as long as possible
in a disastrous event like a fire.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:07:01.260
PVC can also be made softer and more bendable
by adding in a plasticizer, which can help it be more
flexible or make it less thick and viscous.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.560
You’ll find flexible PVC in imitation leather,
flooring, and inflatable products.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.560
Polyethylene terephthalate is a bit different.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.720
It’s spun into fibers and used for clothing,
as well as other things like photographic
film and magnetic recording tape.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.160
These are some of the more common ones, but
there are a bunch of other unique polymers too!

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.820
There’s nylon, which is a tough, lightweight,
and elastic polymer, and kevlar, a strong
fiber with bullet-stopping power.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.800
We also have teflon, which is highly water
resistant and one of the slipperiest solids.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:40.800
And interestingly enough, if you add a very small
concentration of a polymer to a moving fluid, the
friction within the fluid can decrease by up to 80%.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.260
That’s called polymeric drag reduction.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.610
The end result is a fluid that can flow even
faster with the same pressure behind it.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:53.060
Which is really important if your fire hose
can only safely reach the 10th floor and you
have a fire on the 12th.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.080
So now we have a way to solve our problem!

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:01.640
Add in a small concentration of polymeric
material and voila, the water can now reach
the 12th floor and put out the fire!

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.140
Now, in reality, this probably wouldn’t
be the way to go.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.720
It can be dangerous for firefighters to try
and reach tall fires from the outside.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:15.700
And with one as high up as this, they’d likely
try to find a different solution, like trying to
attach a hose to an adjacent building.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:21.500
But as a thought exercise, it’s a great
way to see some of the more innovative uses
of polymers and what they can do.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.640
Today we learned all about the third main
type of material that you’ll encounter as an
engineer: polymers.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.780
We found out that they’re made of long,
repeating chains of smaller molecules known
as monomers.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:36.360
Then we saw the strange history of polymers
and what led to how we use them today.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:43.180
Finally, we went over some of the more common
polymers and how the special properties of
polymers could help us in a dangerous situation.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:47.140
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll talk
about electrical engineering materials.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.860
