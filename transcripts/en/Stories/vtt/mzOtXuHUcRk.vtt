00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.580
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.170
NARRATOR: You've read a million
articles about this by now.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.970
A tiny minority of Americans
own a shockingly huge chunk

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.530
of the country's wealth.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.250
Bernie Sanders,
progressive campaigner

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.330
and presidential
hopeful, proposes

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.390
something that often gets
a pretty polarizing label,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.990
redistribution, taking from
the rich and giving the poor.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.770
The media loves to compare
Sanders and his tax plan

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.960
to Robin Hood.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.050
Actually, so do his supporters.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.580
And the Robin Hood
comparison really

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.500
captures the two views
on income redistribution.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.772
Either it's populist and
heroic, or it's thievery.

00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:36.855
ROBIN HOOD: Tyranny makes
men do desperate things.

00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:41.310
NARRATOR: However you
feel about Bernie or Robin

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.810
Hood, the idea of
redistribution,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.880
it's about a lot
more than taxation.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.910
It's really about waste.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.120
Let's look at prescription
drugs for a minute.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.780
Americans spend about
$270 billion each year

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.210
on prescription meds.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.360
And to overuse an expression,
that's billion with a B. Health

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.820
care costs in general have
been on the rise for some time,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.280
and that's made access to
medicine trickier and trickier.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.000
A New York Times poll last year
found that 1 in 4 Americans

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.120
didn't fill a
prescription they needed,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.310
because it was too expensive.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.350
But there's another stat
worth mentioning here.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.440
About 3% of all that
medicine is wasted.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.040
Extra meds are stockpiled
by manufacturers,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.100
and then discarded
once they've expired.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.100
Or commonly, patients
change medications and toss

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.300
out there remaining
stock of the old meds.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.230
3% may not sound like
a lot, but that adds up

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.320
to $8.1 billion dollars wasted.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.950
And given that 1 in 4
Americans aren't always

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.070
getting the meds they
need, that's a big deal.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.500
And that is where
redistribution comes in.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.420
More and more
programs are popping

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.090
that collect unused medication
before it expires, and provides

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.980
the meds to those in need.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.620
One state-run
program in Oklahoma

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.570
has been at it since 2004,
recycling millions of dollars

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.340
in medication, and his
cost taxpayers just $6,000

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.360
to do it all.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.250
There's even a nonprofit website
called Sirum that matches meds

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.840
with safety net clinics, who
then dispense them to patients.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.740
Experts call this
medicine recycling.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.490
But the media loves to talk
about in terms of-- well,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.510
you guessed it.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.400
ROBIN HOOD: We're sort
of a collection agent.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.710
NARRATOR: And this idea
isn't limited to medicine.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.280
One of the founders of Trader
Joe's made headlines this year

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.260
by opening Daily Table, a
nonprofit grocery store.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.130
Daily Table collects foods that
wholesalers would otherwise

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.990
throw out because they're
surplus or expiring soon,

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.920
and then sells them to low
income communities for cheap--

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.930
which sounds an awful lot
like medicine recycling.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.570
They're matching surplus
goods with those who don't

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.870
have a secure access to them.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.010
The larger point here
is that medicine, food,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.130
and other markets
aren't 100% efficient.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.690
We're better at
creating resources

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.050
than we are at getting
them to the people, which

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.770
is a problem that
redistribution can help fix.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.310
That's Bernie Sanders' point,
when it comes to wealth.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.097
It's not reaching the
people who need it.

00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:01.680
This starts to feel
more Robin Hood-y,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.790
and again, you might
not agree with it.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.390
But whatever you think
about income redistribution,

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.190
it's worth thinking about
the idea of redistribution

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.560
in general, because
we'll probably still

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.810
be talking about it after this
election is long since past.

check out this episode on
how a chicken, of all things,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.650
caused a huge conflict between
the federal government,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.862
environmentalists, and Big Oil.

00:03:29.862 --> 00:03:31.320
SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
But it's worth

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.910
mentioning here that the
habitat we're talking about,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.300
the fabled American prairie,
is full of a lot more than just

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.600
prairie chickens.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.720
There are prairie dogs, sand
dune lizards, swift foxes,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.560
burrowing owls, and the
rest of a very carefully

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.984
balanced ecosystem.

00:03:46.984 --> 00:03:48.650
