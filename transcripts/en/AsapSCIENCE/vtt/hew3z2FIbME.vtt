00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.819
Whether you're waiting for an exam, about
to start an important presentation or at the

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.350
start of a race, we've all experienced nervousness.
But why do we get nervous, and could looking

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.510
at professional athletes help us understand
how to effectively cope with it?

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.109
In stressful situations, your brain sends
a signal from the pituitary gland all the

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.980
way to the kidneys where your adrenal gland
resides. And this is where adrenaline is released.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.940
You've felt it before -- the rapid heart rate,
dilating pupils and increased circulation

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.039
in your muscles. It's all part of the "fight
or flight" response which developed in our

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.480
evolutionary history to help us survive. But
this response isn't all or nothing -- there

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.470
are degrees of reaction, according to the
perceived threat or importance you attach

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.040
to the outcome. So something like an interview,
which presents a challenge, stimulates the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.890
same biological reaction that a threat to
your life does -- just to a smaller degree.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.710
Feel those nervous butterflies in your stomach?
This is because adrenaline helps redirect

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.739
blood and energy to the most important parts
of your body during stress, like the heart

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.809
and muscles, and away from your digestive
system causing the blood vessels to close

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.549
around your stomach leading to that tingling
sensation.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.009
So, how do professional athletes handle the
stress and nerves?

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.959
The concept of 'mental imagery' is a widely
used method in popular sport. With 'Cognitive

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:18.289
Specific' imagery, an athlete simply imagines
themselves practicing a technique or skill

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.689
before competing or training. And while it
may sound crazy, this actually stimulates

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.729
the relevant neurons in the brain, and has
been shown to enhance the specific skill.

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.380
'Motivational Specific' imagery on the other
hand encourages athletes to recall the feeling

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.549
of winning an event or beating a competitor
as a motivational tool. Finally, "Motivational

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.209
General-Mastery" is commonly used by athletes
to feel more confident. Again, by simply imagining

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:47.039
themselves as focused, tough and having positive
thoughts prior to competition, athletes are

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.200
able to improve performance and overcome nerves.
Confidence, in particular, is a consistent

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.869
factor that distinguishes successful athletes
from others, and a major focus for professional

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:57.380
coaches.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.300
So, next time you feel those nerves kick in,
try preparing like an Olympian would! What

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.100
are 
you waiting for? On your mark, get set, GO!

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.100
Don't forget: we have a new video out every day during the Olympics. 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.100
Can't wait? Our amazing partners at the CBC already have five of the videos up now for you to binge on. 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.100
Just head to cbc.ca/olympics/ScienceSays to watch them before anyone else. Link in the description.
