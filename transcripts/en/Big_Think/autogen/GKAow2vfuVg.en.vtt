moment what was it like to have your

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540
moment what was it like to have your
 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.320
moment what was it like to have your
whole genome sequenced I honestly not

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330
whole genome sequenced I honestly not
 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.519

that exciting d it was frustrating first

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529

of all it took a long time for them to

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789
of all it took a long time for them to
 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.400
of all it took a long time for them to
get around to doing it they took some

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
get around to doing it they took some
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.080
get around to doing it they took some
blood then I waited a long long time and

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090
blood then I waited a long long time and
 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.179
blood then I waited a long long time and
then they told me gee you know there's

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189
then they told me gee you know there's
 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.730
then they told me gee you know there's
not anything really exciting and as dr.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
not anything really exciting and as dr.

in offering dated back into the pool so
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.229

and I'm not dead yet so it's pretty

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
and I'm not dead yet so it's pretty
 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.030
and I'm not dead yet so it's pretty
clear there's nothing drastically wrong

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.530
won't get Parkinson's it's not in the
family neither as Alzheimer's so as you

said knowing the family history is is
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.170
said knowing the family history is is
often it's pretty indicative but in the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180
often it's pretty indicative but in the
 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.219
often it's pretty indicative but in the
future the data that 23andme is

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
future the data that 23andme is
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.740
future the data that 23andme is
collecting and in the meantime it shows

that's their right is going to be very
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.719
that's their right is going to be very
very useful over time will collect more

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
very useful over time will collect more
 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.600
very useful over time will collect more
data will collect a lot of phenotype as

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
data will collect a lot of phenotype as
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.870
data will collect a lot of phenotype as
well as genotype data and our pitch to

well as genotype data and our pitch to
 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.899
well as genotype data and our pitch to
our consumers is we try very carefully

not to present it as a medical service
and it's not with a wink it's because it

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439
and it's not with a wink it's because it
 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.920
and it's not with a wink it's because it
really isn't it's because it's

really isn't it's because it's
 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.960
really isn't it's because it's
interesting it's fascinating you can

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970

interested in their ancestry some people

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
interested in their ancestry some people

are adopted or for whatever reason don't

know who their parents are and for them

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
know who their parents are and for them
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.020

I think it's a lot more fascinating than

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030
I think it's a lot more fascinating than
 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.719
I think it's a lot more fascinating than
for most of us but the real the real

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729
for most of us but the real the real
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.200
for most of us but the real the real
goal here is that

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210
goal here is that
 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.030
goal here is that
the scenario you described at the end

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040
the scenario you described at the end
 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.000
the scenario you described at the end
the 61 year old man to help make that

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010
the 61 year old man to help make that
 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.030
the 61 year old man to help make that
happen because it's going to require

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040
happen because it's going to require
 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.920
happen because it's going to require
hundreds of thousands of genomes and the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930
hundreds of thousands of genomes and the
 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.770
hundreds of thousands of genomes and the
phenotypes to give us that kind of

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780
phenotypes to give us that kind of
 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.090
phenotypes to give us that kind of
information and we think getting

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100
information and we think getting
 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.250
information and we think getting
consumers excited about it is the best

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260
consumers excited about it is the best
 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.320
consumers excited about it is the best
way to do that have you found stuff

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330
way to do that have you found stuff
 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.610
way to do that have you found stuff
about your own ancestry of and

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620
about your own ancestry of and
 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.050
about your own ancestry of and
understand you've had relatives do this

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060
understand you've had relatives do this
 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.420
understand you've had relatives do this
well I've had 30 relatives do it and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430
well I've had 30 relatives do it and
 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.010
well I've had 30 relatives do it and
third it's it's fascinating but medical

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020
third it's it's fascinating but medical
 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.800
third it's it's fascinating but medical
useful no I there's a chance it could be

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810
useful no I there's a chance it could be
 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.410
useful no I there's a chance it could be
but honestly knowing that you're I think

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420
but honestly knowing that you're I think
 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.210
but honestly knowing that you're I think
the advantage of knowing you have a

it's psychological but every doctor

it's psychological but every doctor
 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.980
it's psychological but every doctor
