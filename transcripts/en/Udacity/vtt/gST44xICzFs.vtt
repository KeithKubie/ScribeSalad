00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.210
Up until now, you've seen a number
of methods, puts, reverse, upcase.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.700
Each one let's you perform some
sort of really useful action.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.800
There seems to be something for
everything.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.300
Well, there's not.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.210
Sadly, Ruby doesn't have methods like
translate to Pirate, Kiddify, or

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.690
replace all letters with apostrophes It
does however give us an opportunity to

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.280
define these methods ourself, so
we can use them in our own code.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.300
This is extremely useful for
reducing code duplication, and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.250
it helps us make your code
considerably more readable.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.780
Let's take a look at how you can use
methods to clean up your own code.
