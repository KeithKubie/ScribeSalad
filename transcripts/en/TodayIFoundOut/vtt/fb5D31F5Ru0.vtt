00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.290
The Story Behind MONOPOLY Pieces

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.960
What do a thimble, a sack of money, a battleship,
and a top hat have in common?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.290
Not much, other than that they are among the
playing tokens you receive in a standard Monopoly

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.290
set.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.190
And don’t forget the wheelbarrow, which
you’ll need to carry all that cash you are

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.081
going to appropriate from your hapless opponents.

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:23.070
The history of Monopoly is fraught with controversy
and contention, for it seems that its inventor,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.499
Charles Darrow, at the very least borrowed
liberally from two already existing games

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.919
when he first marketed Monopoly in the early
1930s.

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.950
After Darrow self-published the game to great
success, Parker Brothers bought the rights

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.280
to Monopoly in 1934.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.450
While the early history is contentious, on
one thing all Monopoly historians can agree-

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.720
when Parker Brothers introduced the game in
1935, Monopoly had no player pieces and the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.000
rules instructed the players to use such items
as buttons or pennies as player markers.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.700
Soon thereafter, in the 1935-36 sets, Parker
Brothers included wooden player pieces shaped

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.530
like chess pawns… boring.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.979
The first significant development in customizing
the playing pieces came in 1937, when Parker

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.450
Brothers introduced these die-cast metal tokens:
a car, flatiron, lantern, thimble, shoe, top

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.890
hat, and rocking horse.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.219
Later that same year, a battleship and cannon
were added to raise the number of tokens to

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.219
ten.

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:27.869
All was quiet on the token front until 1942
when metal shortages during World War II resulted

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.479
in a comeback of wooden tokens.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.179
But the same mix of tokens remained until
the early 1950s when the lantern, purse, and

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.439
rocking horse were kicked out in favor of
the dog, the horse &amp; rider, and the wheelbarrow.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.829
Parker Brothers conducted a poll to determine
what Monopoly fans would prefer for the eleventh

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.670
token; true to the spirit of the game, the
winner was a sack of money.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.659
Parker Brothers themselves are not able to
tell us why, within a couple of years, Monopoly

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.079
went from having no tokens, to boring ones,
to idiosyncratic metal ones.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.689
However, Ken Koury, a lawyer in L.A. who has
been a Monopoly champion and coach of the

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.259
official U.S. Team (yes, there is one) in
worldwide competition, says:

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.790
“Monopoly’s game pieces are certainly
unique and a charming part of the play.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.500
I have heard the story that the original pieces
were actually struck from the models used

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.160
for Cracker Jack prizes.”

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.739
Not a definite answer and certainly doesn’t
instill a lot of confidence as to the accuracy.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.290
But, it turns out, the theory is a very good
one with significant evidence to back it,

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.790
if we dig a little deeper.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.120
Author and game expert John Chaneski, who
used to work at Game Show (a terrific game

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.860
and toy emporium in Greenwich Village), had
this to say on the subject:

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.640
“When Monopoly was first created in the
early 1930s, there were no pieces like we

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.480
know them, so they went to Cracker Jack, which
at the time was offering tiny metal tchotchkes,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.480
like cars.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.400
They used the same molds to make the Monopoly
pieces.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.640
Game Show sells some antique Cracker Jack
prizes and, sure enough, the toy car is exactly

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.459
the same as the Monopoly car.

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.579
In fact, there’s also a candlestick, which
seems to be the model for the one in Clue.”

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.849
John even has a theory why the specific player
tokens were chosen:

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.209
“I think they chose Cracker Jack prizes
that symbolize wealth and poverty.

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.459
The car, top hat, and dog (especially a little
terrier like Asta, then famous from “The

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.860
Thin Man” movie series) were all possessions
of the wealthy.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:34.799
The thimble, wheelbarrow, old shoe, and iron
were possessions or tools of the poor.”
