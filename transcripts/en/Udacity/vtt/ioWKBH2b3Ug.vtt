00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.010
Now our family rainbow, or family tree down here, does

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.730
a pretty good job at showing us, well, family relatedness,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.440
right? We can see all of our connections. And we

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.310
also get some idea of our genetic relatedness, because we know

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.410
as we step out each tier, how much we're related

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.340
to that individual. But what we're missing, is trait relatedness.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.850
We've talked a great deal up to this point that

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.330
having different alleles of different genes may not result in the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.140
same traits that other family members in

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.700
your family have. And this diagram doesn't

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.740
really tell us for any given trait, do you have the same trait your

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.462
mother has? Or your great-grandfather? Or your

00:00:36.462 --> 00:00:39.130
grand-aunt on your father's side? We're going to

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.790
need a better way of organizing information

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.100
to include family, egnetic and trait relatedness.
