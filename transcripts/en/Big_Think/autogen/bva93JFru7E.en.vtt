dying very often you know we all did it

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640
dying very often you know we all did it
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.549

and it's only because our expensive we

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559

that so if we look at this Saturday we

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
that so if we look at this Saturday we
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.880
that so if we look at this Saturday we
see the same sort of thing we seen

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890
see the same sort of thing we seen
 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.010

all of the relic world and even the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
all of the relic world and even the
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.840
all of the relic world and even the
wider world like China's below

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850

replacement level already India is

plummeting and they haven't had a once

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640
plummeting and they haven't had a once
 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.490

our policy or anything they're nearly

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500
our policy or anything they're nearly
 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.490
our policy or anything they're nearly
down to a replacement level um more than

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
down to a replacement level um more than
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.190
down to a replacement level um more than
that even women who are having children

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
that even women who are having children
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.620
that even women who are having children
they're having them later as if that

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
they're having them later as if that
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.149
they're having them later as if that
delaying until they have to have

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
delaying until they have to have
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.039
delaying until they have to have
children because menopause and you know

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
children because menopause and you know
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.630
children because menopause and you know
problems with Down syndrome and so on

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640
problems with Down syndrome and so on
 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.700
problems with Down syndrome and so on
are coming along so I think that's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
are coming along so I think that's
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.620
are coming along so I think that's
really good news it means that actually

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630
really good news it means that actually
 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.160
really good news it means that actually
are um you know our presumption that

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
are um you know our presumption that
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.200
are um you know our presumption that
there is this innate drive to have kids

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
there is this innate drive to have kids
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.800
there is this innate drive to have kids
quite often may not be so strong as we

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
quite often may not be so strong as we
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.810
quite often may not be so strong as we
may have been brought up to believe and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
may have been brought up to believe and
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.490
may have been brought up to believe and
that actually if we were to eliminate

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500
that actually if we were to eliminate
 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.880
that actually if we were to eliminate
menopause and the you know the decline

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
menopause and the you know the decline
 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.940
menopause and the you know the decline
of quality of the egg cells and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950
of quality of the egg cells and
 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.090
of quality of the egg cells and
therefore the decline of the safety of

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100
therefore the decline of the safety of
 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.910
therefore the decline of the safety of
having kids then women were actually

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
having kids then women were actually
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.590
having kids then women were actually
pressing them in any way would continue

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
pressing them in any way would continue
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.069
pressing them in any way would continue
to lay there procreation even further so

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079
to lay there procreation even further so
 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.889
to lay there procreation even further so
it might actually not be correct in

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
it might actually not be correct in
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.060
it might actually not be correct in
thinking that would be a serious

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070
thinking that would be a serious
 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.100
thinking that would be a serious
overpopulation problem if we eliminated

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
overpopulation problem if we eliminated
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:04.230
overpopulation problem if we eliminated
ating

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240
 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240
