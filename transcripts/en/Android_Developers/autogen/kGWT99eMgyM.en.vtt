I'm here again to talk to you about

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570
I'm here again to talk to you about
 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.590
I'm here again to talk to you about
about power it's an ongoing ongoing

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600
about power it's an ongoing ongoing
 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.230
about power it's an ongoing ongoing
project and as you probably saw from the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
project and as you probably saw from the
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.259
project and as you probably saw from the
keynote Dave talked about Maslow's or

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269

his own version of the pyramid and I

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119
his own version of the pyramid and I
 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.210
his own version of the pyramid and I
think it's actually a lot is is in this

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220
think it's actually a lot is is in this
 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.920

image battery is is foundational to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
image battery is is foundational to
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.910
image battery is is foundational to
everything you're doing on your phone

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
everything you're doing on your phone
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.310
everything you're doing on your phone
right if you don't have power you don't

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320
right if you don't have power you don't
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.690
right if you don't have power you don't
really have any of the cool features you

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
really have any of the cool features you
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.770
really have any of the cool features you
know the camera you don't have the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780
know the camera you don't have the
 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.729

assistant battery exists to power all

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739
assistant battery exists to power all
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.770
assistant battery exists to power all
the other things and it's a it's a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780
the other things and it's a it's a
 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.180
the other things and it's a it's a
struggle for us and it's a struggle I

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
struggle for us and it's a struggle I
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.130
struggle for us and it's a struggle I
think for all of you as well is you want

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140
think for all of you as well is you want
 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.950
think for all of you as well is you want
to do awesome things for users and you

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
to do awesome things for users and you
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.170
to do awesome things for users and you
also want to save power so they can do

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
also want to save power so they can do
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.229
also want to save power so they can do
those things for longer and battery is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239
those things for longer and battery is
 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.610
those things for longer and battery is
actually a really easy problem to solve

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
actually a really easy problem to solve
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.029
actually a really easy problem to solve
you just take just kill everything fixed

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
you just take just kill everything fixed
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.179
you just take just kill everything fixed
I'll take my promotion it's great the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189
I'll take my promotion it's great the
 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.530
I'll take my promotion it's great the
problem is it's obviously much more

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540
problem is it's obviously much more
 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.359
problem is it's obviously much more
nuanced than that and that is a struggle

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
nuanced than that and that is a struggle
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.460
nuanced than that and that is a struggle
that we have internally every day

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
that we have internally every day
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.230
that we have internally every day
talking about power and what are the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
talking about power and what are the
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.929
talking about power and what are the
right trade-offs for users and that's

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
right trade-offs for users and that's
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.490
right trade-offs for users and that's
always a really hard question and we're

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
always a really hard question and we're
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.780
always a really hard question and we're
gonna talk a little bit about that and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790
gonna talk a little bit about that and
 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.789
gonna talk a little bit about that and
some of the things that we're building

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799
some of the things that we're building
 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.340
some of the things that we're building
into Android P to make it a lot easier

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
into Android P to make it a lot easier
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.530
into Android P to make it a lot easier
and so the the first thing I want to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
and so the the first thing I want to
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.899
and so the the first thing I want to
talk about is where where is it where is

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
talk about is where where is it where is
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.940
talk about is where where is it where is
it going and this is like a horrific ly

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
it going and this is like a horrific ly
 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.020
it going and this is like a horrific ly
simplified I'm sure some of the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
simplified I'm sure some of the
 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.280
simplified I'm sure some of the
engineers that they are like oh my god

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
engineers that they are like oh my god
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.950
engineers that they are like oh my god

play into that effect you have the OS

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610
play into that effect you have the OS
 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.819
play into that effect you have the OS
itself is the kernel being really

those things all affect then your

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460
those things all affect then your
 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.100
those things all affect then your
overall power profile that happening

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110
overall power profile that happening
 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.410

under the hood the next thing is apps

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420
under the hood the next thing is apps
 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.700
under the hood the next thing is apps
and services and this is where we're

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
and services and this is where we're
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.900
and services and this is where we're
going to spend the budget a bit of time

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
going to spend the budget a bit of time
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.150
going to spend the budget a bit of time
talking today obviously what apps you

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160
talking today obviously what apps you
 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.500
talking today obviously what apps you
have on your phone and the service is

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
have on your phone and the service is
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.430
have on your phone and the service is
running on that phone

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
running on that phone
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.650

drive power substantially largely

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660
drive power substantially largely
 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.060
drive power substantially largely
through the CPU and through network

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070
through the CPU and through network
 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.100
through the CPU and through network
connectivity and then the last one is

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110
connectivity and then the last one is
 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.630
connectivity and then the last one is
the users interaction with the device

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
the users interaction with the device
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.810

they use how quickly they respond to
 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.120
they use how quickly they respond to
notifications or don't all impact the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130
notifications or don't all impact the
 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.960

really complicated topic we're gonna

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100
really complicated topic we're gonna
 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.680
really complicated topic we're gonna
talk them largely about the bottom

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690
talk them largely about the bottom
 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.470
talk them largely about the bottom
bottom-left corner today but the the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480
bottom-left corner today but the the
 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.610
bottom-left corner today but the the
thing I wanted us to give is before we

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620
thing I wanted us to give is before we
 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.890
thing I wanted us to give is before we
get into that is what are the things

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900
get into that is what are the things
 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.090
get into that is what are the things
have we done and how does the stuff

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100
have we done and how does the stuff
 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.920
have we done and how does the stuff
we're going to talk about and P affect

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930
we're going to talk about and P affect
 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.050
we're going to talk about and P affect
the overall strategy so we started out

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060
the overall strategy so we started out
 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.840
the overall strategy so we started out
with lollipop with job scheduler and job

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850
with lollipop with job scheduler and job
 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.160
with lollipop with job scheduler and job
scheduler was a very powerful tool to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170
scheduler was a very powerful tool to
 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.650
scheduler was a very powerful tool to
avoid apps just having to hang out on

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660
avoid apps just having to hang out on
 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.420
avoid apps just having to hang out on
services all the time processing in the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430
services all the time processing in the
 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.470
services all the time processing in the
background but you could schedule a

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480
background but you could schedule a
 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.580
background but you could schedule a
piece of work and have that piece of

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590
piece of work and have that piece of
 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.530
piece of work and have that piece of
work done in a finite amount of time and

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540
work done in a finite amount of time and
 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.210
work done in a finite amount of time and
the OS could then have some variability

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220
the OS could then have some variability
 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.600
the OS could then have some variability
on when to schedule it next we did doze

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610
on when to schedule it next we did doze
 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.450
on when to schedule it next we did doze
and doze was largely targeted at cases

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460
and doze was largely targeted at cases
 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.100
and doze was largely targeted at cases
where you have your your tablet or a

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110
where you have your your tablet or a
 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.290
where you have your your tablet or a
phone you put it down you're not using

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300
phone you put it down you're not using
 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.180
phone you put it down you're not using
it you put it in a drawer and you forget

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190
it you put it in a drawer and you forget
 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.580
it you put it in a drawer and you forget
about it and hopefully when you pull it

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590
about it and hopefully when you pull it
 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.630
about it and hopefully when you pull it
back out and use it again a few days

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640
back out and use it again a few days
 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.910

later it still has a battery and those

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920
later it still has a battery and those

was really trying to target that problem

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780
was really trying to target that problem
 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.360
was really trying to target that problem
and was largely successful at dealing

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370
and was largely successful at dealing
 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.310
and was largely successful at dealing
with that we didn't we had to go further

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320
with that we didn't we had to go further
 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.080
with that we didn't we had to go further
though and that was with doze on the go

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090

that was targeted at phones and like I

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380
that was targeted at phones and like I
 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.290
that was targeted at phones and like I
have my phone hanging out my pocket I'm

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300
have my phone hanging out my pocket I'm
 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.790
have my phone hanging out my pocket I'm
not using it right now but I'm moving

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800
not using it right now but I'm moving
 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.010
not using it right now but I'm moving
around so I'm not in a drawer that is

around so I'm not in a drawer that is
 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.229
around so I'm not in a drawer that is
then the next like step was how do we

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239
then the next like step was how do we
 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.940
then the next like step was how do we
get that to be a good scenario and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950
get that to be a good scenario and
 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.080
get that to be a good scenario and

you're maybe moving around so you're

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440
you're maybe moving around so you're
 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.750
you're maybe moving around so you're
probably not wetting all your apps to be

and go deeper the next thing was looking

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950
and go deeper the next thing was looking
 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.440
and go deeper the next thing was looking
at background limits and this was

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450
at background limits and this was
 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.540
at background limits and this was

as a whole now we've had jobs around for
quite a while we also were looking at

quite a while we also were looking at
 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.449
quite a while we also were looking at
background limits for location and

fast file system work this was looking
 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.290
fast file system work this was looking
at how do we choose between whether a

over the years this is a set that we

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210
over the years this is a set that we
 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.659
over the years this is a set that we
just did it on on P and there's probably

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669
just did it on on P and there's probably
 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.390
just did it on on P and there's probably
more that we're trying to get done and

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400
more that we're trying to get done and
 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.189
more that we're trying to get done and
then the thing is there's still some

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199
then the thing is there's still some
 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.840
then the thing is there's still some
some of those big big challenges that

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850
some of those big big challenges that
 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.310

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320
that of remaining and this is what we're
 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.140
that of remaining and this is what we're
gonna talk about today is what we

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150
gonna talk about today is what we
 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.710
gonna talk about today is what we
noticed was battery drain was roughly

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720
noticed was battery drain was roughly
 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.029
noticed was battery drain was roughly
proportional to the number of apps you

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039
proportional to the number of apps you
 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.640
proportional to the number of apps you
had on the phone not the number of apps

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650
had on the phone not the number of apps
 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.219
had on the phone not the number of apps
you were using but how many you had

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229
you were using but how many you had
 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.950
you were using but how many you had
installed and I obviously that's not

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960
installed and I obviously that's not
 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.540
installed and I obviously that's not
ideal and so we wanted to try and remedy

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550
ideal and so we wanted to try and remedy
 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.670
ideal and so we wanted to try and remedy
that we also saw a lot of scenarios

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680
that we also saw a lot of scenarios
 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.189
that we also saw a lot of scenarios
where apps are accidentally making

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199
where apps are accidentally making
 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.719
where apps are accidentally making
mistakes like if you're working with

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729
mistakes like if you're working with
 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.370
mistakes like if you're working with

wakelocks you're kind of playing with
 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.260
wakelocks you're kind of playing with
fire and what happens when a mistake

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270
fire and what happens when a mistake
 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.120
fire and what happens when a mistake
happens and usually it's battery would

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130
happens and usually it's battery would
 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.580
happens and usually it's battery would
suffer also some developers would be

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590
suffer also some developers would be
 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.110
suffer also some developers would be

moment's notice and sometimes that might
take a lot of battery to achieve that

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889
take a lot of battery to achieve that
 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.560
take a lot of battery to achieve that
and is that really in the interest of

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570
and is that really in the interest of
 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.540
and is that really in the interest of
the user and how can we help help

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550
the user and how can we help help
 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.000

have also made some changes in the UI so

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:43.870
have also made some changes in the UI so
 

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.200
have also made some changes in the UI so
that you can live on this mode for

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:46.210
that you can live on this mode for
 

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.110
that you can live on this mode for
longer now you have a slider that you

restrictions so we have some principles
 

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.700
restrictions so we have some principles
upon which we have built this particular

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:50.710
upon which we have built this particular
 

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:54.899

feature user asks for controls they want

00:18:54.899 --> 00:18:54.909
feature user asks for controls they want
 

00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:57.029
feature user asks for controls they want
to know like which app is doing what so

00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039
to know like which app is doing what so
 

00:18:57.039 --> 00:18:58.680
to know like which app is doing what so
that they can take a quick action on

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:58.690
that they can take a quick action on
 

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:02.279
that they can take a quick action on
them we also want to make sure that apps

00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:02.289
them we also want to make sure that apps
 

00:19:02.289 --> 00:19:04.980
them we also want to make sure that apps
that don't necessarily target Oreo or

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:04.990
that don't necessarily target Oreo or
 

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.810

also be well managed by the user and
 

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.340
also be well managed by the user and
lastly our goal is to make sure that

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:11.350
lastly our goal is to make sure that
 

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.039
lastly our goal is to make sure that

apps don't get restricted in the first
 

00:19:14.049 --> 00:19:17.039
apps don't get restricted in the first
place so that way apps fundamentally are

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.669
will actually launch this feature with
two specific criteria the first one is

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679
two specific criteria the first one is
 

00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:32.519
two specific criteria the first one is
if your app is still not targeting Oreo

00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:32.529
if your app is still not targeting Oreo
 

00:19:32.529 --> 00:19:36.299

and has a background service the second
 

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:39.629
and has a background service the second
one is if an app holds wakelocks or what

00:19:39.629 --> 00:19:39.639
one is if an app holds wakelocks or what
 

00:19:39.639 --> 00:19:41.270
one is if an app holds wakelocks or what
we call a stuck wakelocks for more

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280
we call a stuck wakelocks for more
 

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.120

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460
background restrictions so what does it
 

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.300
background restrictions so what does it
mean for your app in case if the user

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:17.310

the apps will not be able to do any of
 

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.270
the apps will not be able to do any of
those in the background there are some

applications so you're trying to

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:39.800
applications so you're trying to
 

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.700
applications so you're trying to
minimize the reasons why an app should

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:43.710
minimize the reasons why an app should
 

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.430
minimize the reasons why an app should
be able to use device resources when it

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440
be able to use device resources when it
 

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.970
be able to use device resources when it
is in the background and lastly if an

app is in the background and restricted
 

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.920
app is in the background and restricted
it won't be able to use foreground

important and must happen now of course

00:24:05.039 --> 00:24:05.049
important and must happen now of course

you have

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:05.650
you have
 

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.640
you have
the ability to use foreground services

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:07.650
the ability to use foreground services
 

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:10.200
the ability to use foreground services
but note that if you use foreground

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:10.210
but note that if you use foreground
 

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:13.140
but note that if you use foreground
services you have to tell the user why

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:13.150
services you have to tell the user why
 

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:15.450

you are using it for because there will

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:15.460
you are using it for because there will
 

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.730
you are using it for because there will
be a notification and you'll have to

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:17.740
be a notification and you'll have to
 

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.740
be a notification and you'll have to
justify yourself as to why you think it

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:19.750
justify yourself as to why you think it
 

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.650

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:32.260
manager so if none of this work think
 

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.340
manager so if none of this work think
about actually doing the work when the

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:35.350
about actually doing the work when the
 

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.930
about actually doing the work when the
app actually is launched and being

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:36.940
app actually is launched and being
 

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.270
app actually is launched and being
actively used by the user so the choices

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:39.280
actively used by the user so the choices
 

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.440
actively used by the user so the choices
are hopefully very simplified all of

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:43.450
are hopefully very simplified all of
 

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.750
