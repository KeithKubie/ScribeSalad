(electronic music)

00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:32.540
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.690
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.970
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.910
Our guest today is Steven Chu,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.160
who is a Nobel Laureate in physics

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.270
and Geballe Professor
of Physics at Stanford.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.200
He is the 2004 Hitchcock
Lecturer on the Berkeley Campus.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.330
Steven, welcome to Conversations.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.163
- Thank you.

00:00:51.163 --> 00:00:52.420
- Where were you born and raised?

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.530
- I was born in St.
Louis, not raised there.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.380
I only spent a few years there.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.490
My parents then moved to Long Island.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.050
So I was raised in a
suburb of New York City,

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.953
Garden City.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.570
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.070
shaped your thinking about
the world and about science?

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.760
- Oh, that's a tough call.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.593
(Harry laughs)

00:01:14.593 --> 00:01:18.770
Because most of how all
parents shape people

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.750
is very under-the-table.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.450
You're not really aware of it.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.680
I was aware of many things, though.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.030
My parents came from China.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.900
They came here as graduate
students to go to MIT,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.900
and, like many Chinese
in higher education,

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.550
there was sort of a
reverence for education

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.180
and that they communicated
very clearly to me

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.260
and my two other brothers,
that one of the highest things

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.620
you could aspire to is to be a scholar,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.730
and to be a scholar just
for the scholarship's sake,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.410
not so much as a stepping
stone into some other job,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.357
and that was communicated very well.

00:02:00.357 --> 00:02:04.760
And while we were young,
they would always say read.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.460
They didn't care that much what we read

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.523
as long as we read,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.389
and there again was something that I felt.

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:14.530
- And you didn't
necessarily take to school

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.970
like a fish to water.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.970
I read a short biography
that is at the Nobel website.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.033
I mean, you got interested
and were a good student

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:28.290
when you got interested, I guess
is the way to summarize it.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.010
- Well, you have normalize
this to what was happening.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.040
I had an older brother who
was an excellent student.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.230
He was two years older than me.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.370
We were in a school, Garden City,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.690
and it was a very good public school,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.650
excellent public school,

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.620
and he went through this public school

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.640
setting the highest cumulative average

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.040
in the record of the school.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.303
- I see.

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:51.136
- And so I follow along two years later,

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:53.560
and the teachers would say,
oh, you're Gilbert's brother.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.862
We expect you to do just as well.

00:02:55.862 --> 00:02:56.852
(Harry laughs)

00:02:56.852 --> 00:03:01.220
And so that was hard to really live up to.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.480
So while he was setting records,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.460
I was kinda coming from behind.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.480
I was an A minus student.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.018
By my family's standards,
this was appalling.

00:03:12.018 --> 00:03:14.101
(laughs)

00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:18.565
He was very good.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:20.960
He was very structured and
he would study the things

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.820
he was supposed to study,

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.840
and he was fundamentally
a very good student,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.560
and I would get very
interested in one thing

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.077
and let something else lay,
and something like that,

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:32.100
and it wasn't really
until I went to college

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.631
where they didn't hear my older brother.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.644
(both laugh)

00:03:37.644 --> 00:03:40.673
- But in high school, you
were turned on to science.

00:03:40.673 --> 00:03:42.290
How did that come about?

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.900
- Well, there were two things.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.900
One is I had a fantastic
physics teacher as a junior.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.813
- [Harry] In high school?

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:50.943
- In high school.

00:03:50.943 --> 00:03:54.420
And then the same teacher
as a senior in high school,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.810
and this is someone who
is nationally recognized.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.350
He was winning prizes

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.076
for being an outstanding science teacher.

00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:01.909
- [Harry] And his name was?

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.480
- Thomas Miner.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.640
I had two excellent mathematics teachers,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.070
one in ninth grade in geometry

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.730
and then a calculus
teacher in the 12th grade,

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.590
and there the mathematics was different

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.430
than the other math.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.590
In the other type of mathematics,

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.250
you learn how to do
algebra and trigonometry

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.920
and things like that.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.340
In those two subjects,

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.550
it was mostly about logic and thinking

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.870
and putting together logical arguments,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.800
and it was very different.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.730
And the physics and the logic
slash mathematics courses

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.183
I got very excited about.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.260
- And you also early on
were something of a person

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.040
who liked to build
things and do experiments

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.740
and litter your mother's
living room with projects.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.770
Tell us a little about that,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.070
and then how that ultimately contributes

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.320
to what you become.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.830
- Well, I don't know what it was,

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.700
but since I was very young,
I loved building things.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.763
I loved building things with my hands.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.113
I would be given a
model set for Christmas,

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.670
model airplanes or boats and things.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.313
I loved to put them together.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.410
I would ask my parents for
things like erector sets.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.140
These are little pieces
of metal and screws

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.870
and unlike Lego blocks,

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.880
you actually have to
screw something together

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.890
and it wasn't all pre-designed

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.660
to make a boat or something like that.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.453
And I loved doing those things.

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:29.610
In that respect, it was somewhat different

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.480
than my two brothers.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.120
In many respects, my brothers
and I are very similar,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.270
but in that respect, I seemed
to love mechanical things

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.270
in a way that was certainly
nurtured by my parents

00:05:42.373 --> 00:05:44.770
in that they said, okay, he
wants to do these things.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.010
We'll buy toys like that for him.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.640
But my other two brothers
didn't seem to like that.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.530
Now it turns out that
working with your hands

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.810
and building things gives you
some sort of spatial intuition

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.050
and things like that that
turned out being valuable

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.973
once I became a scientist.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.180
I could see things in my head very clearly

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.248
and could rotate them around

00:06:10.248 --> 00:06:12.760
and this idea of picturing
things geometrically

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.760
has always been a part of my thinking

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.920
even though one doesn't think of that,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.560
at least the lay person
doesn't think of that

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.050
in terms of physicists.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.940
They think in terms of
mathematical equations.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.883
And I only discovered later
that most physicists do that.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.920
- Now then you went on to collge

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.525
and you were freed of your
brother (laughs) so to speak,

00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:36.400
as a model to emulate.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.333
Where did you do your undergraduate work?

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:39.720
- I went to the University of Rochester.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.683
I applied to the Ivys.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.823
They didn't accept me.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.910
And University of Rochester was wonderful

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.480
because it's an excellent school.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.480
It was then, and as I said,
my brother was an unknown.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.683
I could be my own person.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.980
And I guess I started working very hard

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.503
in a regular way still,
but in a very directed way.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.510
But what's wonderful about college

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.490
is beyond a few required courses,

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.523
you can take what you are interested in.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.410
And then there was another
thing that happened in college

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.210
that I wasn't really
thinking of, and that is,

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.343
as I studied more mathematics,

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.530
it actually affected my writing.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.780
My writing became more
linear in its thinking

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.680
and you could definitely see
some logic in the writing

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.493
that I didn't have when I was
in high school, grade school.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.510
So my humanist courses, the
professors there were being,

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:52.510
hey, this is a coherent paragraph,

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.670
and I wasn't really thinking about that,

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.410
but it was almost as a magical transition

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.643
from the mathematics I was studying.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.370
- Drawing on that right now,

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.700
why is it that the public understanding

00:08:09.209 --> 00:08:13.760
of science doesn't
proceed at a higher pace?

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.520
Is it because not enough scientists

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.370
are doing the writing?

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.140
- That's a difficult question.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.530
As I give more public talks,

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:26.530
as I get exposed to these
issues more and more,

00:08:26.981 --> 00:08:29.770
I think that there are two things.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:34.770
One is unfortunately there
is a public fear of science.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.460
They think, especially physics,
they think, oh my gosh,

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.450
physics is hard.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.543
It has math in it.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.300
It's gonna be very difficult
for me to understand

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:44.463
what's really going on.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.390
That, I think, is something
that might've happened

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.884
in grade school or high school.

00:08:51.884 --> 00:08:53.447
(both laugh)

00:08:53.447 --> 00:08:54.280
- [Harry] They didn't have
the right teacher, right?

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.750
- Yes, and the trouble with
learning physical science

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.350
and mathematics is once you
slip behind a little bit,

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.880
and you just didn't get this concept,

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.240
or it's not quite firm in your mind

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.490
about this mathematical
thing that you have to know,

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.370
well, then next week you're
on to something else,

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.620
but they really expect you

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.873
to know something about last week.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.520
So that's one of the issues.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.520
The other issue is that
the ideas are complex.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:30.350
But if you step back and if
you spend some serious time

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.810
thinking about it, the kernel of the ideas

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.683
are quite often not complex.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:40.877
And so the essence of an idea,
which we try to work with--

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.140
As a professor with my graduate students,

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.490
we would read a paper, and
look at the paper and say,

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.364
well, what's the essence of the idea?

00:09:49.364 --> 00:09:50.790
What's something new?

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.990
Forget about the equations.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.540
Forget about the complicated arguments

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.180
and try to identify the kernel of the idea

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.670
and I think that can be communicated,

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.313
but it takes effort.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.130
- Now you did your graduate
work here at Berkeley,

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.800
so in a way, you're coming back to deliver

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.950
the Hitchcock Lectures.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:13.950
What contribution did your
Berkeley education make overall?

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.110
I'm sure you could go through a long list,

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.440
and who was your mentor here?

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.270
- Well, my mentor was Eugene Commins.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.563
He was a wonderful professor.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.363
He has a history of having
many graduate students

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:32.250
that have gone on and
done wonderful things,

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.823
and he's revered as a
classroom teacher as well.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.767
And also in the way he does things,

00:10:40.767 --> 00:10:42.480
the way he goes about life.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.020
So in every respect that I can think of,

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.060
he was a mentor, not only
in terms of the science,

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.150
but how you handle yourself
in terms of situations

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.593
and how you handle yourself in the world.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:11:00.430
Now he had one remarkable
quality that I wish I could copy

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.383
and that is he made all of
his students feel special,

00:11:06.661 --> 00:11:08.850
and they felt that they were special.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:13.290
They could do something
and he really got all of us

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:17.366
to live up to the highest we could do

00:11:17.366 --> 00:11:20.310
without saying you must do this

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.170
or without making us
feel pressured or guilty

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.310
or something like that,

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.920
and he would work side by side with us,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.030
often late into the night,

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.380
as a colleague more than as a professor.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.630
So that was a remarkable experience,

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.180
to grow up in that environment.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.460
The other thing I learned here

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.570
is to try to think of things to do

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.970
that would be important in science.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.690
There are many things
you can study in science,

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.960
but focus on some big questions.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.530
Try to identify the correct questions

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.010
and there it was not only my advisor,

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:02.010
but the Berkeley professors
around here at that time,

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.970
there were six or seven Nobel Laureates

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.390
in the physics department active,

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.150
and you can watch the way
they approach problems.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.030
And this would come out

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.860
not in a formal lecture or something,

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.300
but in casual conversation,

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.250
when they're maybe giving a colloquium,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.440
how they approached it,
how they thought about it,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.050
and this also enters in
a very subconscious way.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.460
That is probably why there are

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.723
so many distinguished
graduates of Berkeley as well.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:34.640
- Now help us understand
what the prerequisites are

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.160
for doing science well.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.390
If a student or students
were to watch this,

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:45.390
what should they know
about this way of life

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.400
and what they need to bring
to it in training and so on?

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.178
- Well, I think the first thing is

00:12:52.178 --> 00:12:54.000
they have to be interested in it.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.840
They have to be genuinely interested.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.760
They have to have some curiosity.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.010
Science is really about describing the way

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.520
the universe works in
one aspect or another,

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.223
all branches of science.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.850
How a life form works, how
this works, how that works.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.800
And so you're really trying to
understand what's around you

00:13:13.935 --> 00:13:16.370
and you have to have a
natural curiosity for that.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.820
In certain types of science,

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.470
there might be some prerequisites.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.580
In physics, you should have
some mathematical ability.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.090
Otherwise, I think it would be very hard.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:30.010
But beyond those prerequisites
that a lot of people do have,

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.880
you need to have first this curiosity,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.780
but a really driven curiosity.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.630
You want to know the answer.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:43.290
And with that curiosity comes
with it a certain doggedness

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.710
because there are gonna be setbacks.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.780
You're gonna discouraged.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.970
Things aren't gonna work.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.005
You're gonna have trouble
understand things.

00:13:50.005 --> 00:13:51.130
Things are gonna be hard to understand,

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.443
especially the first time.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.983
Science doesn't come naturally to people.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.716
I had the hardest time
in my first few years

00:13:59.716 --> 00:14:03.010
as a freshman and sophomore
understanding physics

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.860
in a really deep sense,
and also in high school,

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.540
in the sense of, I could
do well on the exams,

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.410
but to really get it inside your stomach

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.980
and to really say, okay,
I have a real feel for it

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.103
took awhile to develop that intuition.

00:14:18.103 --> 00:14:20.160
But there were other drivers for that.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.023
It seemed like a beautiful way
of understanding the world.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.720
But I'll go back to the
other thing, this doggedness,

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.110
this real saying I'm not gonna quit.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.280
I really wanna find out.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.230
It enters in other walks of life.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.390
If you think of an athlete

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.920
who wants to become a good athlete,

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.590
well, there's gonna be a
lot of training involved

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.490
and sometimes you don't
feel like getting up

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.740
early in the morning or
staying late in the afternoon

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.460
and spending hours training.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.560
And so that turns out to be one
of the most important things

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.383
that separate in graduate school.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.570
At graduate school at Stanford,

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.040
you have some of the best
students in the world,

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.510
and the ones who you
can see are gonna go on

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.870
and become world-class scientists,

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:11.403
and the ones who are very
smart and are gonna be good,

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.860
but the thing that really differentiates

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.770
is this passion to find
out what the answer is

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.683
and I'm not gonna quit.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.130
And so after those prerequisites,

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.730
the thing that separates the people

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:25.570
who are really gonna excel

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.000
from people who are good and not is that,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.393
this internal drive.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.370
- In a joking aside
yesterday in your lecture,

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.470
you said that in science,
once you announce something,

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.230
that first everybody
tells you you're wrong.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.950
Then they tell you it's trivial,

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:44.673
and that you were not
the first to discover it.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.930
Well, it really emphasized
what you just said,

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.220
that there has to be an inner drive,

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.390
but also it suggests
an element of courage,

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.050
that basically you're
gonna stand up to people

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.690
and say, no, this is what I think,

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.290
and then keep on going
even if you're proven wrong

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.950
and then try to adjust what
your experiment has shown.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:07.783
- Yeah, that's right.

00:16:07.783 --> 00:16:09.690
And when you make
something that's unexpected

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:13.290
and it's a little bit out
of people's expectations,

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.200
they're first gonna reject it.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.600
And actually, that's one of
the strengths of science.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.780
You really have to say, no,
it's not because I said it is,

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.402
but you're gonna have to convince them,

00:16:23.402 --> 00:16:26.140
and by convincing them, it's
really through discussion

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.273
and additional experiments,

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.590
because in the end, the
experiment is gonna be

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:32.670
the final arbitrator.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.420
There's no high priest
or priestess of science

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.020
that says, no, you're right, you're wrong.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.083
You go back and you do
some more experiments.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.770
So the reaction, if you're
a little bit off center,

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.160
or a lot off center, is
no, that's preposterous.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.670
You've gotta be wrong.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.980
And the more outlandish you are,

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:55.070
the more unexpected the finding,

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.560
the more you're gonna get that reaction.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.950
Now in the end,

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.930
after one really
understands what's going on,

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.930
and it goes back to really
understanding the science,

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:08.040
then you say no, no, no, it's all right.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.100
Yes, we could've foreseen that,

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.750
and that's where it becomes trivial

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.613
is the, well, sure.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.920
But it wasn't trivial at the beginning,

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.134
but after you see it,
then it becomes easy.

00:17:20.134 --> 00:17:20.967
(Harry laughs)

00:17:20.967 --> 00:17:22.715
But that's actually a mark

00:17:22.715 --> 00:17:24.463
of really understanding something.

00:17:24.463 --> 00:17:25.663
Then they say of course.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.240
And then the final one

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.480
is you're not the first to discover this.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.370
That is also true. (laughs)

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.597
There are always precursors.

00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:37.043
(both laugh)

00:17:37.043 --> 00:17:37.940
And there's always someone before you,

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.900
had a glimmer of this
and a glimmer of that,

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.300
and science is based upon
a lot of rediscovery.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.833
But going back to your point,

00:17:47.808 --> 00:17:51.880
namely you're gonna be rebuffed,
and oftentimes rejected,

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.930
and it's not a personal issue,

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:57.200
and you just gotta stand
up to it and go back.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.000
Now you could be wrong,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.833
but you're gonna go back

00:17:59.833 --> 00:18:01.990
and convince yourself you were right.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.140
The rule I tell myself and my students

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.150
is once we convince ourselves,

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.163
we have to be our worst critics.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.320
And once we convince
ourselves that we're right,

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.420
then we should have no problem

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.800
convincing everybody else we're right.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.370
And so a good scientist
is their worst critic.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.330
They're always trying to
prove themselves wrong,

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.470
which is hard, because
sometimes you've got and idea

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:24.530
and you think you're really right,

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.795
and you have to force yourself.

00:18:26.795 --> 00:18:29.110
Well, where are the weak
points of this argument

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.560
or the weak points in my experiment?

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.560
- One of the points that came
out in your lecture for me,

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:42.450
a non-scientist, was really the
importance of collaboration,

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.950
not only with your own students,

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.920
but with other scientists,
and even other scientists

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.920
who are in subgroups within physics,

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.917
but even beyond that to scientists

00:18:56.917 --> 00:18:59.133
in other fields of science,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.810
that those sets of
communications working together

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.400
are really important to
push this process along.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.700
- Yes, that's another misconception

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.080
that many people will
have about scientists,

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.420
or doing science and learning science.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.960
This misconception is you go to school,

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.100
you take classes, you study.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.330
Years and years of study.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.810
You learn everything there is
to know in a certain subfield,

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:24.270
a very narrow certain subfield,

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:26.560
and then you do work in that area.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.910
And that is a form, but it's rarely taken,

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.583
and it's especially not
true for the way I do it.

00:19:34.923 --> 00:19:37.320
Maybe it goes back to my high school days

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.660
when I was not such a good student,

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:43.339
but in actual fact, if one
wants to go into a new area

00:19:43.339 --> 00:19:47.700
beyond your school days,
you can do the same.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.310
You can pick up a classic
textbook or something like that

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:54.710
and begin to read the literature,
but it's not as much fun.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:58.900
And when I was going into
biology maybe a dozen years ago,

00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.830
I did try that.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.770
I picked up this big fat
tome called Biochemistry,

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.550
a classic textbook, and
I started reading it.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.830
It was, I don't know, 1,500 pages.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.280
I got to page 150 and I was deciding,

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.830
well, it's beginning
to slip out of my head

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.620
as fast as it's going in now. (laughs)

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.103
I reached some steady state,

00:20:17.322 --> 00:20:20.060
and so I said, well,
this isn't gonna work.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.657
So I would look around,

00:20:21.657 --> 00:20:26.560
and I had something for
reading newspaper science,

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.090
Science Times in the New York Times

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:31.950
or Scientific American,
things of that nature.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.020
So I had some interest in
these biological problems

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.620
and I would pick something
that I was interested in.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.680
But, of course, since I
wasn't an expert in biology,

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.450
I didn't know, is this a stupid question?

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.090
Is this a deep question?

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.250
So I'd say, well, I think
I can do something here.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.470
I have some interest.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.500
So I'd go over and trot over
to the biology department

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.690
or the medical school, say is
this something worth studying?

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.320
I think I wanna do this.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.240
And they would tell me,
sometimes no, no, it's silly

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.790
or it's been done before,

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:06.560
or sometimes they'd say no,
no, this is the central problem

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.658
in biology.

00:21:07.658 --> 00:21:09.610
(both laugh)

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:10.833
That rarely happens.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.110
But what happens is then I
would start to collaborate

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:18.873
with these people who spent
their career in this specialty,

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.670
and their students also, and
they grew up in this culture,

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.060
and they would say, you
should read this article

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.860
and that article and that article,

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.860
and we would talk, and it was
wonderful to learn that way.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:37.200
So you can leap frog
over the years of school.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.340
Now, to be sure, I'm not pretending I have

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:43.360
as broad or as deep knowledge of that,

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.930
but then you start with
a little thin sliver

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.690
of a particular problem
and you start to build

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:50.723
knowledge around that thin sliver,

00:21:52.091 --> 00:21:55.410
and by the time you've done the experiment

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:56.890
and you're starting to write the paper,

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.030
you better have some
knowledge of what's around

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.276
because you won't even get
to publishing the paper

00:22:03.276 --> 00:22:05.442
because you wouldn't have
referenced the right people

00:22:05.442 --> 00:22:07.409
of the precursors before you.

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:09.970
But it's learning in that way,

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.440
and then you go back to the books,

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.640
but now you use the index,

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.970
and you say, I wanna learn about this.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.710
So now I've begun to teach my students.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.610
Many of my students are
physicists wanting to go

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.750
into biology, and I say,
okay, we'll use the index.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.160
This is the kind of problem.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.320
Why don't you look here?

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.490
Read these five pages in this book

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.690
and these 10 pages here
and these 15 pages here.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.500
By that time, you read
this review article,

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.880
and within a month, you're
reading the primary literature.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.713
- In biology?

00:22:36.713 --> 00:22:41.160
- In biology, right, without
the three years of courses.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.280
And then within a few
months to a few years,

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.910
then you're beginning
to get a feel for it.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.510
It's very important that you get this feel

00:22:49.814 --> 00:22:51.670
because you have to ask
the right questions.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.370
One of the most important
things that a scientist does

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.850
is ask a question that's important

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.120
and that has a chance of being solved.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.190
You can ask important questions,

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.418
like how does the brain work?

00:23:04.418 --> 00:23:06.710
But that's not sufficient.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:10.011
You have to pick a part of that question

00:23:10.011 --> 00:23:12.720
to where you can make a contribution,

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.559
but a serious contribution,

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.470
and something that others
would be interested in.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:19.390
- Before we talk about
some of your research

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:23.103
in a way that I can understand,
and maybe the public, too,

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:29.990
in your career, there was
a period when you went

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:34.420
to the Bell Labs, and I
wanna understand how that

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:39.030
contributes to your research,

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:42.310
and understand exactly
what the difference is

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.220
between being in a place like Bell Labs

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.940
versus being in the physics department

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.090
at Berkeley or Stanford.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:50.510
- Right, well, the reason
I went to Bell Labs,

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:54.107
I was actually here as a
graduate student at Berkeley

00:23:54.107 --> 00:23:55.950
and I was a postdoctoral fellow here,

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.910
and after two years of that,

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.500
they actually made me a faculty member

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.200
in the physics department,

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.870
but this was a bit unusual

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.370
because I had spent
eight years at Berkeley,

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:10.427
and I was essentially toilet trained here,

00:24:10.427 --> 00:24:13.550
and I had a very narrow vision of science,

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.070
and what a department
really wants is to bring in

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:20.290
people from different sorts of cultures.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:24.150
But they decided they
wanted me as a professor.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.360
It was a beautiful place, so I accepted.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.830
But then they did something very unusual.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.880
They said, well, you can start your group

00:24:31.874 --> 00:24:32.790
and go about your business,

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.730
or, because you've
spent so much time here,

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.060
and this was your only real experience,

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.370
you also have an opportunity
to go somewhere else

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.160
for a year or two.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.080
And so I thought, well, that's wonderful.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.680
I have a job at the
best physics department

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.240
in the world here,

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.910
and so I'll go off and spend some time

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:53.760
and broaden myself.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.060
And so I decided to go to
Bell Telephone Laboratories,

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.340
which, at the time,

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.233
was one of the premier
research industrial labs.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.870
When most people think of industrial labs,

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.270
they think of, oh, you're
making some better widget.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.870
You're making something
that's gonna be good

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.100
for the phone system.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.140
Now ultimately that's true,

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:16.590
but at Bell Labs in that
time, and this is 1978,

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:20.930
they allowed a small
fraction of us, 50, 60, 80,

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:26.550
to do whatever we wanted,
really to do whatever we wanted,

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:29.250
and so I joined Bell Laboratories,

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.890
and my department head said, well, Steve,

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.640
you can do whatever you want.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.680
It doesn't even have to be physics.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.280
All we ask is that you don't go

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.480
to a high energy accelerator
and do high energy physics

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.619
because that would be
hard on the stockholders.

00:25:43.619 --> 00:25:46.036
(both laugh)

00:25:47.626 --> 00:25:49.610
And because my thesis project

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.380
and what I worked on as a
postdoc did have something

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.580
to do with high energy physics,

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:54.770
Not something to do,

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.170
it was addressing a high
energy physics problem,

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:03.050
and he said, and by the way,
don't do anything immediately.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:08.430
Spend six months, talk to
the people around the labs,

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:09.780
and just keep an open mind.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:13.357
This was a devastating experience for me

00:26:13.357 --> 00:26:15.178
(both laugh)

00:26:15.178 --> 00:26:17.360
because the freedom to
do whatever you want

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.417
and being told don't do what
you think you want to do now,

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.300
but explore.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.070
And so I'd spend some time exploring,

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.900
and there I really felt pressure

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.060
because he would say, we
expect great things out of you.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.900
And I don't wanna hear that. (laughs)

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.540
It's much nicer to have a little problem

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.373
and you're working on it.

00:26:37.373 --> 00:26:38.206
It's very cozy.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.530
But it did have a real influence on me

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.460
because it got me in that mode

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.570
of going and talking to
people outside of my field

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.850
and when I finally started doing things

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:53.920
at Bell Laboratories, I
started first in some area

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.740
that was in condensed matter physics

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.170
that I knew nothing about,

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:00.780
but using techniques in my
own field, atomic physics

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.173
and laser physics.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.920
But it got me into the mode
of, I've got this crazy idea,

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.850
and going to some colleague
at Bell Laboratories

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.320
and saying, well, how does this sound?

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.200
And they would tell me, no,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.830
this is the stupidest thing I've heard,

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.100
or yeah, maybe you have something there.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.470
And it really set the tone

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:22.690
for what I've done for
the rest of my life,

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.840
and collaborating with people,

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.290
especially outside my local expertise.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:29.910
And so it was a wonderful experience.

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:34.460
I also should say in the
years I was there, '78 to '87,

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.350
there was an economic
slump in the mid-'70s.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:40.160
Bell Labs just started hiring people

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:44.960
and there were a group
of us, maybe a few dozen,

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.310
two or three dozen, and we
all were young, energetic,

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:49.550
bright-eyed, bushy-tailed.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:51.763
We were all being put in this position.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.900
Do something important.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.180
Here are the resources

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.240
of American Telephone
and Telegraph System.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.323
We expect you to do something wonderful.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:03.580
We were there at night.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.000
We were there in the weekends.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.510
We knew each other, what
our cars looked like.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.040
We knew who was in there, let's say,

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.543
on a Saturday or Sunday.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.840
We would party together and
it was usually the salad days,

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.540
and I think something on the
order of five or six of us

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.633
got Nobel Prizes.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:27.233
Over a dozen are in the
National Academy of Sciences.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.740
It's like we all were growing up together

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.070
and then we had these really
wonderful senior scientists

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:40.070
there as well, and it was a
remarkable period of time,

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:44.090
when everything was exciting
and something would come along

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.960
that was not in my field,

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.820
and I would say, wow, this
is really interesting.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.010
We'd go and we'd discuss it,

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:56.010
and then people would
jump fields or jump areas,

00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:58.860
and there was this
feeling of the excitement

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.000
of the science

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.320
and even though we were doing this,

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.660
it was all right to move and do that,

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.950
and you wouldn't be considered a failure

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:11.330
because you gave up this
because something else

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.557
even more exiciting came along,

00:29:13.557 --> 00:29:16.456
either from your own laboratory
or from a colleague's lab

00:29:16.456 --> 00:29:17.850
or from the outside world.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:19.320
- So freedom in the best sense,

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.770
but in an environment where
it could lead to new levels

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:25.187
of understanding.

00:29:25.187 --> 00:29:26.510
- Yeah, it was a positively
electric atmosphere.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.640
You'd go in the lunchrooms and over lunch,

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.320
everybody went there around noontime.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.370
You'd sit there in these big round tables

00:29:33.319 --> 00:29:35.170
and, okay, what's new?

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.370
And people would leave,
other people would come,

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.420
but you'd be sitting there
chatting, socializing,

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.877
but talking a lot about science

00:29:43.877 --> 00:29:48.363
and a lot of ideas were invented
on those lunchroom tables.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.410
So there again, it was something

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.210
where there was this real community.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.572
It was pretty magical
and I think the world,

00:29:58.572 --> 00:30:00.350
people who are close to science,

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:03.560
especially in the areas
that Bell Labs was touching,

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.950
knew that there was
something magical going on

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:07.163
in that time.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.310
- And how can we
distinguish that experience

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.170
from, say, being at Berkeley
in the physics department

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.500
or being at Stanford?

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.910
Was it just a question of
there were enough resources

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.630
to bring all these people together

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.560
to create this magical moment?

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.210
- No, there was some other things.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:29.408
For example, in a university
like Berkeley or Stanford,

00:30:29.408 --> 00:30:32.020
you're a professor, you have students.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.890
And because you have graduate students,

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:36.970
first you have students
as undergraduate students,

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.210
and part of your job is
to teach undergraduates,

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:42.420
part of your job is to
teach graduate students,

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.540
you teach graduate students by giving them

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.210
and developing with
them their own projects.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:52.560
And so a lot of energy and time
is spent nurturing students

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.973
and because of that,

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.903
your first duty is to
look towards your group.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.780
Well, at Bell Laboratories,
we didn't have groups.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.760
The biggest you could
have would be a technician

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.150
and a postdoc, and usually not both.

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.650
And so if you wanted to
something that required

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.390
more than one or two people,

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.150
you would have to work with other people.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.993
And so that builds into the system

00:31:19.993 --> 00:31:22.130
let's collaborate,

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:25.270
and because no one had an
empire, or even a mini-empire,

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.550
that in the basic science areas at Bell,

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:28.950
you're one and two or three,

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.570
you have a lot of time.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.500
You're not taking care of people.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.833
You have a technician or a postdoc.

00:31:39.474 --> 00:31:41.224
So it's a very different structure.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:46.340
We are trying to do something
like that at Stanford,

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:50.670
in which we, in a multidisciplinary
way, are bringing people

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:54.700
interested in biology,
physics, and chemistry,

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.360
computer science, center
around biological problems,

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.090
but where people from very
many disciplines will come

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.473
and have their own agendas of what to do.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.210
One of the things is to
limit the size of the groups.

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:10.280
You could have, in a university,

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.830
let's say you're doing synthetic chemists,

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:16.830
you could have groups of 40,
and with a group of 40 people,

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.810
you're not gonna have much time
to interact with colleagues

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.590
and you're not gonna have much
time to explore elsewhere.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:26.760
And so it's limited the
size of the group to 15,

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.750
which is still very large.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.320
You couldn't limit it to three,

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.700
because there are very few professors

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.620
who have two or three graduate students

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.730
in something related to
the biological sciences.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:38.320
They're typically more.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.110
And so the structure's slightly different

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:44.180
and so it's not clear how much
you can create the structure

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.890
we had at the laboratories

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.200
because you have these other
responsibilities and duties.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.250
- Before we talk about this new link

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:55.970
that you're working on
between physics and biology,

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.270
let's talk a little about your research

00:33:00.285 --> 00:33:03.040
that led to the Nobel Prize,

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:07.080
and if you could briefly give us a sense

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:12.080
of how you came upon that problem set

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.320
and what you in fact did.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.573
It's clearly related to atoms,
lasers, cooling, and so on.

00:33:22.212 --> 00:33:23.962
- Well, I was at Bell Laboratories.

00:33:27.728 --> 00:33:28.840
There are two main branches
at Bell Laboratories.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.290
The main research branch was
in Murray Hill, New Jersey,

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:37.253
and I think it was in 1983,

00:33:38.334 --> 00:33:40.370
a director in Holmdel

00:33:41.301 --> 00:33:44.000
asked if I would become a department head

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.950
in his division in Holmdel.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.280
The director, by the
way, is Charles Shank,

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.910
who's the director of LBL,

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:53.930
and he said, well, Steve,
why don't you consider

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.470
coming down and starting a department

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:59.670
that would be really a basic
science department here.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:03.790
Holmdel had excellent
science and laser engineering

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.330
and a lot of the great
things that have come out

00:34:09.854 --> 00:34:13.680
of optical communication
were spawned at Bell Labs,

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.340
in large part in Holmdel and Murray Hill.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.960
So I said, that sounds like a great job.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:25.340
I went down and started this department

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.776
and started hiring some people,

00:34:27.776 --> 00:34:29.730
and also inherited some
very talented people.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:32.113
Actually, two of them are here also,

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.870
Daniel Chemla, for a brief
moment, was in my department.

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:39.030
He's now a division leader at LBL,

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.400
and Geoff Voelker, who's a professor

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.963
in electrical engineering,
was also in this department.

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:48.970
And there was another really
wonderful scientist there

00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:51.270
named Arthur Ashkin, an
older department head,

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:55.000
and I started talking to him casually,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.350
kind of in the hallways,
and he had this dream,

00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:59.203
wouldn't it be nice

00:34:59.203 --> 00:35:01.413
if you could hold onto an atom with light?

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.100
And he had tried to pursue this dream

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.670
in the early '70s and mid-'70s,

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:10.220
but it wasn't really working.

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.890
They did some very key
experiments demonstrating

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:14.090
the fundamental forces,

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:16.560
but it wasn't looking like
they were getting closer

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.300
to really holding onto atoms with light.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:24.270
And so finally, the manager
said, well, it doesn't look like

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.200
it's gonna come and you
gotta move onto other things,

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.840
and he said all right.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.550
But then I came on board and
I was this new young person

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.872
who he could corrupt

00:35:33.872 --> 00:35:36.289
(both laugh)

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.133
with his dream.

00:35:38.133 --> 00:35:39.820
- You go do this, yeah.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.430
- And I started thinking,

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.077
okay, this sounds pretty interesting,

00:35:44.077 --> 00:35:45.160
and started having a look at it,

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.260
and I started doing a lot of calculations.

00:35:49.108 --> 00:35:50.340
It was getting to be bad.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.703
I was thinking, I can see why you quit.

00:35:52.703 --> 00:35:53.536
(both laugh)

00:35:53.536 --> 00:35:54.369
I was thinking it.

00:35:54.369 --> 00:35:55.730
I didn't tell him that, but
I was thinking to myself,

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:57.272
no, it's not looking good.

00:35:57.272 --> 00:35:59.689
(both laugh)

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.440
There's a few eureka moments
you can have in science.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.250
Mostly they're gradual eurekas,

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:08.810
which I can come back to later,

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:11.950
but there was this time and it
was not looking good at all.

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.580
I would try it this way, that way.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:16.230
It's all on paper, not looking good,

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:20.233
and finally, there was a
big snowstorm in New Jersey.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:26.270
They said over the PA system,
the forecast looks very bad.

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:28.520
There's going to be nine
inches or something.

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:31.290
The lab is going to be closed.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:33.020
You should all go home.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.540
Now I live very, very close to the lab

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.636
so I said oh heck, and everybody left,

00:36:37.636 --> 00:36:38.469
and it was very quiet,

00:36:38.469 --> 00:36:39.640
and it's one of those beautiful things

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.420
where you could see the snow falling down

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.130
and everything's turning fluffy white.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.790
And maybe it's appropriate
because it's snowing,

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:52.140
and then I found you can do an end run.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.540
The thing there was first
you hold onto an atom,

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:55.530
then you get it cold,

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.590
and then you can really
do what you want with it.

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.840
And then I said, well,
what if you reversed it?

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.350
What if you cooled down the atom first?

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:06.170
Don't hold onto it, but
maybe in the process

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:09.870
of cooling it down, it's gonna
hang around for enough time

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:13.240
that you could have a
chance of grabbing onto it.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.381
And so a little calculation,
and he says, holy smokes,

00:37:16.381 --> 00:37:18.563
this looks like it's gonna work.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:23.208
And then I said, well, I
wanna refine the calculations.

00:37:23.208 --> 00:37:25.475
So then this was gradual eureka.

00:37:25.475 --> 00:37:27.518
I wanted to refine the calculation.

00:37:27.518 --> 00:37:30.000
So you're surrounding this atom with light

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.810
and it looks like it's getting very cold,

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:35.210
to the point where your feeble little trap

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.700
that was gonna hold the atom could work,

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.513
but it needed to hang around for awhile.

00:37:41.474 --> 00:37:43.260
So I said, tomorrow I'll come in

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.450
and I'll start to write a program

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:47.180
to predict how long it would hang around.

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.450
I start to write the program.

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:50.880
Luckily, I'm not that
good at writing programs

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.198
and get through about three lines.

00:37:52.198 --> 00:37:53.031
(Harry laughs)

00:37:53.031 --> 00:37:54.330
Because if I was really
good at writing programs,

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:55.800
I wouldn't have thought about it at all

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.130
and just written a program.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:38:00.330
So I get the three lines of code and said,

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:02.450
I've seen this problem before.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:03.873
Einstein solved it

00:38:03.873 --> 00:38:05.394
(both laugh)

00:38:05.394 --> 00:38:06.227
in 1905.

00:38:06.227 --> 00:38:07.540
- Good old Albert.

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:11.570
- And what he did is he looked
at a dust particle in fluid

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:13.880
and he was studying Brownian motion,

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.790
and here's this dust particle

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:17.260
and it's being battered from both sides

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.930
by atoms and molecules, and he said, okay,

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:23.490
if I take this particle and I move it,

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:25.970
there's a viscous drag in the fluid,

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.380
and that slows it down.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.320
And the reason it's being battered around

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:33.870
is because of this random imbalances

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.700
between pressure from the
left, pressure from the right.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.650
And what I wanted to calculate
was how this particle

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:41.540
would wander around.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.230
Because the previous day I'd shown,

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.280
it has this viscous drag on it

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.990
and that you still have
these fluctuations.

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:48.820
I was gonna write this
computer program to say,

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.240
okay, stepping to the
right, stepping to the left,

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.240
and balance all the forces.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.450
And I said, no, I can use his solution.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:55.283
I know where it is.

00:38:55.283 --> 00:38:57.840
It's in an elementary textbook,
an undergraduate textbook.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:02.840
It's the random walk in a Brownian medium,

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.130
and you just plug in those numbers,

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:08.620
and voila, you get, wow, it's
hanging around for a long time

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.720
because it's a random walk.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.990
And so I got very excited and
went to my boss Chuck Chang

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:16.690
and said, look, Chuck, I
know you're not keen on this

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:20.240
after years of research,

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.801
but this is so simple,
it has a shot at working.

00:39:22.801 --> 00:39:25.031
(both laugh)

00:39:25.031 --> 00:39:28.310
And then you can get it
cold, you can hold onto it,

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:30.330
and we can go from there.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.850
And then I remember he thought about that

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:35.310
and said, well, okay, you earned the right

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:36.890
to do something crazy.

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:39.984
But don't try to recruit someone else.

00:39:39.984 --> 00:39:42.950
(both laugh)

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:44.900
So I said, okay, okay, just my postdoc

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:46.150
and my technician and me.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.970
Again, because if you're
onto something really big,

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:52.480
you wanna bring in your friends

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.670
and say, okay, we wanna go
fast and we wanna do this.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:59.680
So we puttered along for a few months,

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.850
going like the blazes,

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:03.630
and then I talked to Art about it.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:05.703
He went hmm, hmm, okay.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.120
It's not the way I envisioned it, okay.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.680
Sounds promising.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.170
Then after a few months,
it began to look like

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:15.887
it was gonna work, really gonna work,

00:40:15.887 --> 00:40:19.520
and I said, come on, join in. (laughs)

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.440
And it's gonna be a lot of fun.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.800
And, again, as I indicated in my lecture,

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.920
it worked much better
than anybody expected.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.928
- And what are the implications
of what you discovered

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:34.304
in a layman's way of understanding?

00:40:34.304 --> 00:40:36.820
- Well, what you can do once
you get an atom very cold,

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:40.083
and cold is really the average
speed that an atom moves.

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:44.280
The atoms in this room
are moving at speeds

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.830
of supersonic jet planes.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.250
In fact, that's why the
speed of sound is what it is.

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.743
It's determined by the
speed of the molecules.

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.320
Okay, once you get an atom really cold

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.453
so it's moving as fast as an ant walks,

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:04.190
that a fraction of an inch per second,

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:08.120
then very, very weak forces
can push them around,

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.190
and you essentially can do
what you want with them,

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:14.870
for example, using electric
or magnetic fields or light,

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:15.810
and you can hold them.

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:16.680
You can push them around.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.257
You can do things that
you simply could not do

00:41:19.257 --> 00:41:22.207
when they're whizzing around
like supersonic jet airplanes.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.610
And the ability to hold onto and control

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:28.660
and manipulate these
atoms means, for example,

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.000
you can toss them up.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.550
They can turn around due
to gravity in a vacuum can

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:34.480
where there are no other atoms around,

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.700
and you can make better atomic clocks.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.150
You can make what are
called atom interferometer.

00:41:40.343 --> 00:41:42.000
You quantum mechanically
split the atom apart

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.290
so one part is the quantum wave

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:46.620
going in one region of space.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.770
The other part of the
atom is the quantum wave

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:49.853
going in the other region of space.

00:41:50.816 --> 00:41:52.920
That atom interferometer
can be used to measure

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.150
the acceleration due
to gravity or rotations

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.860
with very high accuracy.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:01.610
In fact, in terms of
acceleration due to gravity,

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:03.650
better than any other way of doing it,

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.940
and in terms of rotations,

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.230
certainly better than any commercial

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:12.643
or even laboratory grade laser gyroscope.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:18.500
So all of a sudden, you can
measure changes in gravity

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:22.044
so accurately that it's
gonna become competitive

00:42:22.044 --> 00:42:24.810
with the current ways of
measuring changes in gravity,

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:26.683
which is used for oil exploration.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:31.960
You can probably put it on
an airplane or helicopter

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:35.240
and with global positioning
satellite to tell you

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.120
the height and changes in distance,

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.500
and inertial sensing systems,

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:45.080
and something that measures
change of gravity over distances

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.233
on a scale of a meter,

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:52.420
it opens up the opportunity
to map gravity gradients

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:56.040
and pockets of oil, diamonds,
things of that nature,

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.460
minerals, on a very fast moving platform

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.683
like a slow moving plane or a helicopter.

00:43:03.378 --> 00:43:06.700
So they have some real
practical implications.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.610
Already the world is on
the atomic clock standard

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:13.403
defined by so-called
atomic fountains of atoms.

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:17.713
The atom interferometer
was totally unexpected.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:22.393
It just popped out after
we begun to realize,

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:27.510
let me say that, people, even
the researchers in the field,

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:30.683
it's hard for them to think
about what you can do with it,

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:35.490
even if you force yourself,
until you have it in hand,

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:37.950
and you can then begin
to see the abilities

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:39.653
of this new method or technique,

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.330
and then it's only after we had it,

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:45.440
and not only me, my group,
but the world in general,

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.580
no one was talking about
many of the applications

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.290
that came out until we actually had it

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:50.800
and we saw how powerful it was,

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.570
and then began to appreciate it.

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:54.660
And you can try to force yourself to think

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.206
of what might come of it,

00:43:56.206 --> 00:43:57.600
and you can write down a few things,

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.660
but you're gonna get a
small fraction of them,

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.730
and that's the wonderful
thing about science.

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:05.700
- And actually it hearkens back for me

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.980
to what you had said about
your high school experience

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.070
in a funny kind of way,
that sort of learning

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:14.740
to look at something and
think logically about it,

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.400
and, wow, you're sort of taking it to,

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.960
not that you were doing Nobel
Laureate work in high school,

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.810
but some of the elements
are there in this work.

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:25.983
- Yes, I think that's true.

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:32.240
But it's always also just
letting something happen.

00:44:34.221 --> 00:44:36.658
This is one of the things
I did learn at Berkeley,

00:44:36.658 --> 00:44:38.270
and I watched great scientists here,

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:40.580
and many of them were doing something

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.300
that in hindsight looked very natural.

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.993
They would say, here's
an emerging technology.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.700
With this emerging technology,
can I ride piggyback on it?

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.610
And can I use this technology
to turn it backwards

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:57.150
and do some new science?

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:00.050
Normally you think, oh,
basic new science discovery.

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:01.690
It turns into a technology.

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:02.940
You make a better widget.

00:45:05.588 --> 00:45:08.010
But what I appreciated when
I was a graduate student here

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.580
was that's all true,

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:12.050
but you can also take that
technology, turn it around,

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:16.230
and you can use it, and
a good example is radar.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:19.680
During World War II, the US
and Great Britain especially

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.400
developed microwave engineering methods

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:26.060
to have microwave transmitters
that allowed radar

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:29.530
so we could measure and
see things far away.

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:33.540
And the scientists who
helped develop that radar

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:36.230
and other scientists
who could see the power

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:38.940
of that technology really seized on that

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.010
shortly after World War II,

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:43.830
and a string of Nobel Prizes came out

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:48.070
of people who use this new
technology to do great science.

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:51.620
Charlie Townes here is
a prime example of that.

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:54.570
His knowledge of microwave science,

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:57.993
he was, during the war,
working on microwaves.

00:45:57.993 --> 00:45:58.826
- [Harry] At Bell Labs, too, I've heard.

00:45:58.826 --> 00:46:00.880
- At Bell Labs, that's right.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.890
After the war, he said, I want
to do microwave spectroscopy

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:06.390
because here's a new tool.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:09.370
We now have control of
shortwave radiation,

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:12.380
and he became one of the real leaders

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.750
in microwave spectroscopy,

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:18.750
wrote a classic book with his
brother-in-law Arthur Schawlow

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:20.980
and then invented an idea

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:25.320
of stimulated emission of
microwaves called a maser

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:30.320
that then led to the
extrapolation of those ideas

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.120
from microwaves to optical
wavelengths led to the laser.

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:39.070
And so that's one example of
first building on technology

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:42.270
during the war, saying
this is a wonderful way,

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:43.240
a new scientific tool.

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.000
Use it to do science.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.750
Then wanting to improve the tool

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:49.360
to get to shorter wavelengths

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.163
and, voila, you have the laser.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.580
And I saw this over and over again.

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.583
When Charlie came to Berkeley,

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:03.270
he wanted to use his knowledge
in lasers and microwaves

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:05.040
to do astronomy.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.060
So again he was gonna ride this technology

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:09.060
and I was looking around and saying yes.

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:12.540
Now, he's a brilliant scientist,

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.760
but the lesson I learned was

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.497
you don't even have to be brilliant

00:47:16.497 --> 00:47:17.850
(both laugh)

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.700
if you're the first to look
at something with a new tool.

00:47:23.745 --> 00:47:26.470
So I began to say, okay,
what are the new tools?

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:28.153
When I was a graduate student,
there was something called

00:47:28.153 --> 00:47:32.650
a tunable di-laser, and I told my advisor,

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:34.560
this is a wonderful thing.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.010
It's only a few years
old and it's sort of like

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:40.680
this is a tool that we should be using.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.230
Now let's go figure out
some science to do with it.

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:49.214
And luckily, it turned out fortuitously

00:47:49.214 --> 00:47:50.920
that there turned out to be

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.580
some very fundamental physics questions

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.000
you can address using this tool.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.430
And it's the fundamental
physics that drove him,

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:57.780
but from my side,

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.800
yes, I was drawn to the
fundamental physics,

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.653
but also let's use a new thing to do it.

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:07.190
If you use an old tool
to tackle a problem,

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:10.160
you've gotta be really smarter
than the rest of the folks.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.620
Because everybody has this tool.

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.350
If you're the first to
look at something new,

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:17.270
it's like discovering a new world.

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:18.753
You just look around

00:48:18.753 --> 00:48:19.983
and everything you see is going to be new.

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.360
- So bring this now to
where you're moving now,

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.410
because you, in a way,
are going into biology.

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:30.830
You already touched on that earlier,

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:35.830
but you are bringing physics
to the table of biology,

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:41.710
so to speak, and tell us a
little about what you're seeing,

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:47.010
and you quoted Yogi Berra
yesterday about that,

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:49.983
that it's amazing what you can see.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.160
- It's amazing (laughs).

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:58.370
Well, Yogi is one of my heroes.

00:48:58.370 --> 00:48:59.203
As I've mentioned,

00:48:59.203 --> 00:49:01.340
he's really the great American philosopher

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:02.702
for the 20th century.

00:49:02.702 --> 00:49:03.930
- (laughs) That's right.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:05.770
- And one of the things is he said

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:08.010
you could see a lot by watching.

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:10.157
He said other wonderful things like,

00:49:10.157 --> 00:49:13.080
"If you come to a fork
in the road, take it."

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.590
- That's right.

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:17.697
- Or, "We may be lost, but
we're making great time,"

00:49:17.697 --> 00:49:19.830
and many, many things he said.

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:22.247
(both laugh)

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:27.930
But anyway, so my entree into biology

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:29.870
was exactly what I was telling you about.

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.440
I was working on atoms, cooling atoms,

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.720
holding onto atoms with light.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.460
I said, well, the same technology

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:37.293
can be tweaked a little bit,

00:49:37.293 --> 00:49:40.370
and we can maybe hold onto
individual molecules with light

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:43.350
if you play some tricks.

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:46.050
And what could you do with
these individual molecules?

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.510
And then naturally I thought of biology.

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:49.450
So naturally I thought,
well, let's first try

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:51.160
to hold onto a piece of DNA.

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.063
So strictly a technological thing.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:59.350
And so that worked, and
then as I had some ideas

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:03.640
of looking at enzymes, proteins
walking up and down the DNA,

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.730
and seeing what can learn in biology.

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:08.530
But the first thing I
did is I got this thing

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:11.030
and we glued little
plastic spheres to the ends

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:13.410
of this big DNA molecule,

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:18.230
so big that its length was
something like 15, 20 microns,

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:21.800
which could easily be seen
in an optical microscope.

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.850
Now you can't really see a piece of DNA

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:27.660
because sideways, it's only 20 angstroms.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.910
It's not resolved by
an optical microscope.

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:31.743
But you do a trick.

00:50:31.743 --> 00:50:34.520
You put little dye molecules,
fluorescent molecules.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.490
So think of it as a string
of Christmas tree lights.

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:39.860
You can't really see the string.

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:43.570
It's too thin, but you see
the light coming from that,

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:47.550
and so it shines very nicely
in an optical microscope

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:48.720
and you can move it around.

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.930
So the first thing we did is,
okay, let's stretch it out.

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:52.060
Wow, it stretched out.

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.810
Well, let's see if we can break it.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:56.006
So we stretched it, stretched
it, harder and harder,

00:50:56.006 --> 00:50:56.839
and we couldn't break it.

00:50:56.839 --> 00:50:59.250
It's very strong along that dimension,

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:01.350
which is good because it
holds your family jewels.

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:04.390
You don't really wanna break it that way.

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:05.930
And so in the end, what happened,

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:07.850
it pulled out of the optical tweezers,

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:09.863
these things we were using

00:51:09.863 --> 00:51:10.970
to hold onto these plastic handles

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:12.823
we glued onto the ends of the DNA,

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:16.778
and it sprang back like a rubber band.

00:51:16.778 --> 00:51:18.710
It just went boink and
it just crumpled back up

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:21.990
and I said, holy smokes, it
looks like a rubber band.

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:24.280
Why does it look like a rubber band?

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.990
And the reason it looks like a rubber band

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:29.300
is because when a molecule's straight,

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.380
it's in very unlikely state.

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:32.680
If left to its own devices,

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:35.130
it's being battered
around by water molecules.

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:38.470
It wants to sort of do
some random coil geometry.

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:40.690
That's a much more likely state.

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:43.410
And so the reason it springs
back has nothing to do

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:47.340
with chemical bonds and
forces pulling it back.

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:50.700
It has to do with whether
it's more likely to be found

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.560
in some random coil or straight.

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.520
It's the same reason

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.150
if you push all the molecules of the air

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:58.960
into a corner of the
room and let go of them,

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.130
they don't even have to
bounce on each other.

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:03.030
They would say, where would I likely be?

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:05.570
Well, equally likely
anywhere in this room,

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:08.703
and so the pressure
evens out very quickly.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.977
And that's why it was springing
back like a rubber band,

00:52:11.977 --> 00:52:15.040
and I said, well, now I can
do this on a single molecule,

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:19.000
and what things can you do there?

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.660
Well, you can understand polymers.

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:22.270
Polymers are long, skinny molecules,

00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:24.143
but you can look at it one at a time.

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:29.770
And so it was a backdoor
entree into polymer physics,

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:32.463
and we did that for a half dozen years,

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.580
and finally I started
getting back into biology

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:38.450
because the things we were
finding out in polymers,

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:40.090
well, this is unexpected.

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:41.470
They all are behaving differently,

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:44.190
even though they're put
in identical situations.

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:46.673
They should do the identical
thing, but they don't.

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:50.630
Well, maybe biology's not
as simple as we thought.

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:52.470
And so I said, okay, let's
go back and look in biology.

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:53.350
But it's the same thing.

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:55.973
It was a little technical trick or two,

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.540
but usually when you're doing
a technical trick or two

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.990
in the past, you say, well,
I don't really know biology.

00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:05.840
There's a lot of fancy names
and it's a different culture,

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.460
and so I'll develop the technique

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.810
and hand it over to the biologists.

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:12.257
But at this time, I wanted none of that.

00:53:12.257 --> 00:53:13.570
(both laugh)

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:15.220
Why should they have all the fun?

00:53:16.561 --> 00:53:20.440
- And you're seeing even in
these early stages of your work

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:25.440
that you were seeing a kind
of, what did you call it?

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.830
A molecular individuation.

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:28.663
- Right.

00:53:28.663 --> 00:53:30.650
- As opposed to looking at these things

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:33.106
and reaching a conclusion on averages.

00:53:33.106 --> 00:53:34.610
- Right, right, and so, that's right.

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:35.980
While doing polymer experiments,

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:38.050
we found that molecules
act as individuals.

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:40.690
In fact, they acted as
individuals with moods,

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:43.190
meaning you think you
start with the molecules,

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:45.660
it is precisely the same situation.

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:46.980
You ask it to stretch.

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:49.550
It would stretch in one way
with a particular geometry.

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:52.340
You put the same molecule
back, same conditions,

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:53.280
ask it to stretch again,

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.120
and it would do something differently.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:59.190
And we realized finally with
doing computer simulations

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:00.380
that the reason it was doing that

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:02.740
is because it wasn't exactly the same

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.650
because it's bouncing around.

00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:06.970
It's in water, Brownian motion,

00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:09.700
and so when you ask it to do something,

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:12.200
it's sort of trapped in
its particular state,

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.490
and if you ask it to do
something fairly rapidly,

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:18.060
it doesn't have time to look
around and find the best path.

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.170
It just does what it has to do.

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:22.330
Imagine you're going down,

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:24.210
you're in the Newark or Japanese subway.

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:28.710
It's very crowded and there's
two subway trains, okay?

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:31.200
And one's the right way,
one's the wrong way,

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.633
but all you know is the doors
are gonna close very quickly.

00:54:32.633 --> 00:54:34.930
There's a mob pushing you from behind.

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:36.509
You're not gonna make the right decision.

00:54:36.509 --> 00:54:37.342
(both laugh)

00:54:37.342 --> 00:54:39.200
You're gonna go with the flow.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.580
The fork in the road comes,
you're gonna take it.

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.820
And depending on whether
you're a little to the left,

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:44.653
a little to the right of this,

00:54:44.653 --> 00:54:48.200
you're gonna be pushed
forward into one of the cars.

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.480
And so the same thing was
happening in molecules.

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.610
Depending on the initial
starting condition,

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:55.990
you're gonna take a certain
path that gets magnified.

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:57.830
You start with a slightly different random

00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:00.840
starting condition, you're
gonna take another path.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:04.430
And the profound thing that was
affecting me, it's not that.

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:07.359
That, once you think about it, is trivial,

00:55:07.359 --> 00:55:11.100
but that many things in biology,

00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:13.070
this is an out of equilibrium process,

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:15.410
and many things in biology
at the molecular level

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:17.323
might be out of equilibrium also.

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:22.080
And then the way to look at it
is to look with these methods

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:25.410
and then to think of the
non-equilibrium parts.

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:29.320
And because we were trained
to think of an equilibrium

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.220
because equilibrium things

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.690
are things we could measure easily

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:34.740
with the techniques that we had before.

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:37.540
But now if you can follow a
single molecule and say, okay,

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:40.370
non-equilibrium is a major part of this.

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:42.430
So now we get to look at it,

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:44.600
and we can look at how
molecules change their shape

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.533
in real time.

00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:49.210
Well, so again, it's going
back to what I learned

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:50.060
here at Berkeley.

00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:54.330
Use some new technology
and have a first peek.

00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:57.500
- One final question
requiring a brief answer,

00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:00.190
it's all been a random
walk for you, then, right?

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:01.460
- Oh, absolutely.

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:02.300
Right.

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:07.100
- And so what recommendation
would you give to students

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:09.270
looking on your life,
reflecting back on it,

00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:11.283
if they wanna prepare for science?

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.580
- You've gotta be very
interested in what you're doing.

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:18.150
You have to attack it with a passion.

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:19.143
You can't give up.

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.350
You have a plan,

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:24.580
but if during the execution
of whatever plan you had,

00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:26.773
something comes along, keep an open mind.

00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:29.970
- On that note, Steven, I
wanna thank you very much

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:33.010
for coming back to Berkeley
to be the Hitchcock Lecturer,

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:35.150
but also thank you for
coming to our program

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:38.110
and sharing your
intellectual journey with us.

00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:38.943
Thank you.

00:56:38.943 --> 00:56:39.776
- Thank you.

00:56:39.776 --> 00:56:40.800
- Thank you very much for joining us

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.583
for this Conversation with History.
