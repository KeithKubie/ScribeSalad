00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.000
Ibuprofen - it’s good for a headache, but
can it help with social rejection?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.900
A new study says yes, it can - but only if
you’re a woman.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.549
Sorry guys!

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:20.640
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and we’ve
all taken ibuprofen right?

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.690
It’s a pretty standard pain reliever, but
a new study from the University of Texas at

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.570
Austin - says it can also affect our emotional
status.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.750
And depending on your gender, that can be
a good thing - or a bad thing.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.540
This study involved 138 men and women, half
of whom took 400 mg of ibuprofen, while the

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.030
other half took a placebo.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.970
In the first part of the experiment, participants
were instructed to play a virtual ball-tossing

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.970
game on a computer.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.840
But at some point during the game, they were
intentionally socially excluded from the game.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.960
Afterwards, they were asked to rate how they
felt about being excluded.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.739
Then, during the second part of the experiment,
they were asked to write 2 detailed descriptions

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.500
- the first, being a situation where they
experienced betrayal in a close relationship,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.770
and the second, a situation where they experienced
physical pain.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.069
And once again, they were asked to rate their
emotions afterwards.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:13.719
As it turns out, women who took ibuprofen
- were less hurt by being excluded from the

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.950
game, and by reliving a painful experience,
than men.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.119
And in fact, the men who took ibuprofen - actually
experienced a harsher reaction to rejection,

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.429
than men who took only a placebo.

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:29.439
So in effect, ibuprofen makes women feel better
about being rejected - while for men, it seems

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:30.789
to do the opposite.

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.840
Their feelings actually get MORE hurt.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.209
But how could this possibly be?

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:38.240
I mean we’ve all been conditioned to believe
that emotional pain is totally separate from

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.240
physical pain.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.439
But it turns out - that may not be true.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.280
Recent studies have found that physical pain
and emotional pain, activate very similar

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.850
regions in the brain.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.779
And in a man’s brain, specifically, evidence
suggests that the part of their brain responsible

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:55.939
for regulating emotions, is also linked to
the part that processes physical and social

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:56.939
pain.

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.299
According to the author of the study, Dr.
Anita Vangelisti, if that is indeed true,

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.069
then "it's possible that taking physical pain
relievers provides men with more cognitive

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.579
resources to express the pain they feel.”

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:08.610
But what about women?

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.040
Is there something specific in our brains
that makes us feel differently?

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.569
It’s hard to say exactly what’s at work
here, but there have been other studies on

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.290
different kinds of pain meds, like acetaminophen,
showing that it can reduce anxiety in people

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.290
of both genders.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.600
In any case, Vangelisti hopes her study will
at least allow men and women to better help

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.430
each other deal with hurt feelings.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.590
And future studies, she says, could have interesting
implications for children as well.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.849
If the same findings hold true for kids, then
it could help them address differences in

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.680
the way they respond to things like bullying,
and other socially painful situations.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.190
What do you guys think?

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.970
Have you ever noticed a change in your emotional
state after taking ibuprofen?

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.959
Let us know in the comments below, and as
always - thank you guys for watching!
