00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.590
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Brasington Clark:
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.330
This is a very familiar place to
many of you, but we're so delighted

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.510
to see such a robust turnout for
this event, Mapping the Wilderness

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.990
of Knowledge, the Card Catalog
Past, Present and Future.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.200
This event is being recorded
for future webcasting,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.270
so please take a moment
if you haven't already

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.420
to silence your phone or tablet
or device of your choice.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.150
My name is Becky Brasington Clark.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.080
I'm the Director of the
General Publishing Office

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.790
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.010
Our office is charged with
promoting the library's collections

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.160
and scholarship through
the publication

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.190
of books and other products.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.070
Today's program was inspired by the
release of a new book, this one,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.300
The Card Catalog, Books, Cards
and Literary Treasures written

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.800
by my colleague, Pete Deveraux,
co-published by Chronicle Books

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.060
in association with the
Library of Congress.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.510
He will kick off this afternoon's
program with a broad history

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.460
of the card catalog featuring
highlights from the book.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.630
He will then turn the program
over to Beacher Wiggins,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.560
the library's Director
for Acquisitions

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.440
and Bibliographic Access
who will then introduce

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.050
and join our stellar
lineup of speakers.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.280
I hope you'll join us
immediately following the program

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.970
for the reception and book signing.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.870 position:56%
Books are for sale out in the foyer,

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.140
and we'll do the signing
out there as well.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.610
We do have coffee, tea and cake,

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.570
and if you haven't seen
it, it's not just any cake.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.790
It's a card catalog cake.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.630
So we're geeking out on that.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.610
Before we begin, I would like to
offer sincere thanks to Beacher

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.330
and his colleague, Susan Morris,
for developing this program

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.920
and supporting the participation
of our out of town speakers.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.470
I'd also like to thank our
co-publisher, Chronicle Books,

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.810
whose generous support
made this event possible.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.420
Thanks very much to Wanda
Cartwright and her colleagues

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.910
in the Special Events Office,
and extra special thanks

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.760
to publishing office
colleagues, Anna Freeze,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.770
who managed every detail of this
process with enthusiasm, efficiency

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.220
and good humor and Marietta
Sharperson who navigated us

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.270
through some last minute
administrative mazes.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.190
On the fly here, I want to
thank Dwight and Keith and Blane

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.780
and all the other chair herders
for stepping up to the plate

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.720
and just getting some
extra chairs on the floor.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.720
Thank you very much.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.080
Now, I'd like to introduce
Pete Deveraux, a writer,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.810
editor in the Publishing Office
and author of The Card Catalog.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.800
Pete's career was launched in
the scholarly publishing sector

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.670
where he worked for
Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.730
He left Lippincott
to become a librarian

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.280
at the Enich Pratt Free Library
where he had the privilege

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.780
of working alongside Carla Hayden.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.060
Upon joining the Library of
Congress Publishing Office in 2012,

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.450
Pete brought together his
publishing and library experience.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.530
He's contributed to or edited six
additional books for the library

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.040
and we are really fortunate
to call him our colleague.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.340
Thank you very much.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.140
Pete Deveraux.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:30.190
[ Applause ]

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.970
&gt;&gt; Pete Deveraux: Well,
thanks Becky.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.040
It's an honor to be here
with my esteemed colleagues

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.100
from the cataloging community.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.710
I'd also like to thank Hanny
from the Publishing Office

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.480 position:56%
for helping put this event together.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.090
This book was a great opportunity
to tell a story about an unherald

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.140
yet extremely important part of
the libraries, the card catalog,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.730
one of the most versatile and
durable technologies in history.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.400
The reality is most card
catalogs are long gone.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.210
We're not sure how many
people realize what a massive

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.010
and unprecedented undertaking
it was.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.500
So I hope people will pick the
book up and read about the history

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.670
and continued importance
of cataloging here

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.060
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.790
So what I'd like to do is
briefly run through a fairly brisk

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.490 position:56%
and general history of cataloging
in a progression towards the Library

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.860
of Congress' card catalog.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.880
When I started research for this
book, I struggled a little bit

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.970
with finding a starting
point that made sense.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.500
After reading about Somarian
historian, S.N. Kramer,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.890 position:56%
I understood the story really
started at the dawn of civilization.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.940
He clearly identified one
[inaudible] tablet found near the

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.220
ruins of [inaudible]
dated around 2000 B.C.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.650
as being used for cataloging
purposes.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.680
At just 2.5 by 1.5 inches,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.850
the tablet foreshadowed the
use of small index cards.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.870
It was divided into two
columns listing the titles

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.940
of 62 literary works including
the epic of [inaudible].

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.100
From Mesopotamia, the next stop is
the ancient library of Alexandria.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.140
The collection consisted
of papyra scrolls.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.510
Organizing the library
proved very difficult

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.330
as scrolls had no title page, table
of contents or even author listed.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.100
The Greek poet and scholar,
[inaudible] was chosen

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.560
to devise a way to provide access.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.600
This cataloging of the scrolls
called the [inaudible] made him one

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.050
of the most important
figures in library history.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.080
He completed around 250 B.C. It was
arguably the first time anyone made

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.220
a sophisticated list of
authors and their works.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.750
From the surviving fragments,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.010
scholars deduced the scrolls were
divided into separate classes

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.140
such as poetry, philosophy and
law and then further subdivided

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.910
into a narrow range of subjects.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.960
Moving ahead some 1700 years,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.400
once Gutenberg's printing
press was established,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.060
books spread quickly
across the continents.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.410
As publishing grew, there
emerged a uniformity

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.420
in the layout and design of books.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.360
Title pages, table of contents

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.080
and other conventional
elements started to appear.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.600
As it applied to cataloging,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.690 position:56%
this information was a game
changer though the staggering number

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.860
of books being printed
was unexpected

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:11.340
and ancient libraries during the
renaissance struggled to keep up.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.060
Rising to the challenge, Swiss
bibliographer, Conrad Gesner,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.550
brought cataloging into the modern
era with his ambitious attempt

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.990
at compiling a list of Latin,
Greek and Hebrew books in print.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.340
Gesner spent years traveling
around Europe visiting libraries,

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.310
collecting bookseller
and publisher's lists.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.750
In 1545, the first volume of
his Bibliotheca Universalis,

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.310
the universal library,
was published.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.860
It included an exhaustive
alphabetical listing

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.480
of over 2000 authors and titles.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.310
The work established Gesner
as the father of bibliography.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:54.450
So what many consider the first
national library card catalog

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.650
happened during the chaos
of the French Revolution.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.040
In 1791, the assembly issued
instructions to local officials

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.390
to be in cataloging libraries
that had been confiscated

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.160 position:56%
from exiled or executed aristocrats.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.870
The method relied on playing cards,
which were then blank on one side.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.600 position:56%
Playing cards were a perfect choice.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.690
They could be purchased
throughout France.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.470
They were sturdy and roughly the
same size no matter what brand,

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.990 position:56%
and they could easily be interfiled.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.540
Within three years, over
a million cards were sent

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.450 position:56%
to the overwhelmed offices in Paris.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.710 position:56%
The original books of the Library of
Congress did not survive for long.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.020
The collection went up
in flames just 14 years

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.680
after they were acquired whe
the British ransacked Washington

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.120
in 1814, torching the
White House and capitol.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.220
When news of the fire reached
former President Thomas Jefferson,

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.980
he wrote to a friend
in Congress and offered

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.420
to sell his personal library.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.390
Jefferson adapted his
cataloging scheme

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.340 position:56%
from Sir Francis Bacon's system that
started with three main categories,

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.890
memory, reason and imagination.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:05.310
Later modified by Jefferson through
history, philosophy and fine arts.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.320
These categories were broken down
further into 44 distinct chapters

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.580
that fully encompassed
the entire collection.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.950
By the mid 1800's, major
developments were happening

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.840
in the library community led
by Smithsonian librarian,

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.550 position:56%
Charles Duwet [assumed spelling] who
sought to "form a general catalog

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.290
of all the books in the country
with reference to libraries

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.340
where each might be found."

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.990
At Harvard, assistant librarian,
Esra Abbott, is actually credited

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.730
with creating the first
modern card catalog.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.630
His associate was Charles
Cutter, became librarian

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.820
of the Boston Anthenaum in 1868.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.840
There, Cutter created a new scheme

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.380
that would later help establish
the basis for the Library

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.940
of Congress classification system.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.970
Though Cutter's cataloging rules
were adopted by many libraries,

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.580
he is overshadowed by his
occasional rival, Melville Dewey,

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.240
whose approach to cataloging
was based

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.730
on a controlled vocabulary
represented by numerical values

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.140
that could be subdivided
by decimals.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.720
It immediately caught on and
expanded Dewey's influence

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.360
within the library community.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:16.180
Around this time, Anesworth Rand
Spotford became the sixth Library

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.820
of Congress.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.180
And his approach to cataloging

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.710
and managing the growing collection
was much more idiosyncratic

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.920
than the emerging transient
professional librarianship.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.490
In his view, "The organization
of a library is a subjective one.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.580
I think the best system in
classifying a library is

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.300
that which produces a
book in the shortest time,

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.500
and this is a great picture of
the old library in the capitol

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.160
of the chaotic scene that rumor
has it only Spotford could find

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.220
the books.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.770
This quote from Spotford stood
in direct contrast to librarians

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.550 position:56%
that signed on as charter members
of the American Library Association.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.560
The first issue of its official
publication made clear the most

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.570 position:56%
pressing issues facing libraries was
the lack of standardized catalog.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.110
For Dewey [inaudible], establishing
these standards was only half

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.410
the battle.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.870
The growing number of libraries
across the country, they advocated

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.960
for a cooperative cataloging agency

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.220
that would issue cards
from a central location.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.460
And the newly expanded Library

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.460
of Congress seemed the
natural fit to take the lead.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.580
Shortly after opening
the new library building,

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.660
Herbert Putnam became
librarian in 1899.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.800
And JCM Hansen and Charles
Martel were appointed

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.530 position:56%
to lead the new cataloging division.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.020
They confronted a collection
of more than 800,000 books,

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.110
hardly any of which had
been cataloged by subject.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:46.000
Hansen later wrote that when
faced with this incredible job,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.250
"There was no printed
or written rules,

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.160
no definitive verbal instructions.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.780
Apparently, it will be part
of the wisdom to cut loose

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.390
from the old catalog all together."

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.730
It was therefore decided to
begin an entirely new catalog

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:01.310
on standard sized cards
3 by 5 inches.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.600
With the larger staff, catalogers
created a new classification system

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.910
inspired by Cutty and Dewey as well

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.490
as integrating a new
system of subject headings.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:15.380
In 1901 with its own dedicated
branch of the printing office

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.380
in the basement and equipped with
new [inaudible] type machines,

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.630
the library began to crank out
cards at a rate of 225 titles a day

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.890
and nearly 70,000 a year.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:28.250
The titles were printed on the
best linen ledger stock 40 cards

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.550
to a sheet.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.750
They were then cut into
bindery to the index size

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.450
and a hole was punched in
the bottom for the guardrail.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.250
Upstairs the cataloging
division worked long,

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.770
hard hours doing the tedious work
of classifying, proofing, revising,

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.710
sorting and filing
the millions of cards.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:50.730
On October 28, 1901,
more than half a century

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.100
after Druett suggested the federal
government centralize the printing

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.270
and distribution of catalog
cards, Putnam sent a memo to more

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:01.390
than 400 libraries announcing a
sale of its printed catalog cards.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:08.490 position:56%
In 1976, former Library of Congress
cataloger and historian, Paul Edlin,

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:12.190
wrote, "Few libraries have
been untouched by the work done

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.510
by library staff members
over the years.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.990
It would be difficult to
walk into a library anywhere

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.380
in the United States,
be unable to find one

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.990
of these physical byproducts
of the intellectual efforts

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.480
of the cataloging staff of
the Library of Congress."

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.950
I think that's an appropriate quote
when introducing our next speaker.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.070
Beacher Wiggins is the
Director for Acquisitions

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.840
and Bibliographic Access
at the Library of Congress.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.230
He's been with the
library since 1972

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.450 position:56%
and his present position since 2004.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.320
He has been an active member of
the American Library Association

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.420
and the ALCTS Division of
ALA for more than 30 years.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.180
And he recently was the winner

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:53.500
of the 2013 Melville Dewey
Medal Award sponsored by OCLC.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.300
Beacher.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:05.170
[ Applause ]

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.470
&gt;&gt; BeacherWiggins: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:13.410 position:56%
It's great to see you, and I have to
say I was given thanks for helping

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.200
and being cooperative
with this program,

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.970
and that's really all it was
because all thanks go to Susan

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:25.210
who was arranging this while
I was on travel this year.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:29.060
And so I'm just doing
what I was told to do.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:34.570 position:56%
Even to the name of the very brief
remarks I'm going to make, the good,

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:39.040
the bad and the ugly, I'm not sure
I would have used any of those

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.870
for any number of reasons, but
hey, I try to stick to the plan,

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.580
which may be a reason
I've been around so long.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:55.060
Now, it is obvious that
while I'm snowcapped

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.140
and I think you probably
can do deductions

00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.810
that I've been around awhile.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.470
In fact, yesterday I received --

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.640
was observed the 45th
anniversary ceremony here.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.490
I'm not so old that I was
actually there and apart

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.230
of the market development.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:16.460
So, we want to get
that straight upfront.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.400
So now that we clarified that
point,my memories are going to be

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.640
and my remarks are going
to be vicarious in nature

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.630
and not because I was there.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.780
But I did have the
privilege of working

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.960
with Henriette Davis Avrom
[assumed spelling] for five years

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.410
as her special assistant.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:39.650
And as you might expect, I
gleaned a lot from that experience

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:44.290
in any number of ways that have
helped me in the following years.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.910
Now, so I heard a lot
directly from her

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:51.150
as she orchestrated
the developmental mark

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:57.340 position:56%
of automating the card catalog,
which we are here today celebrating.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:04.090
In 1989, Lucia J. Rather who was
then LC's Director for Cataloging,

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:08.210
and I who at that time was a
special assistant to Henriette

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.370
who was the assistant
librarian for Library

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.510
of Congress Processing Services.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:17.930
Lucia and I wrote an article for
American Libraries entitled MARK,

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.650
Mrs. Avrom's Remarkable
Contribution.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:32.370
In preparing that article allowed
Henriette then to have time

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:36.350
to reminisce with Lucia and me
about the development of MARK,

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:41.870
about her involvement and her
assessment of MARK's evolution

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.580
and the transformation of
libraries for technical services

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:50.630
and public services librarians
and for catalog users everywhere

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.630
and of every [inaudible].

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.740
Now, the good.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.830
When appointed to LC,
Henriette quickly recognized

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:02.630
that the most crucial aspect
of library automation was

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:07.880 position:56%
to devise a standard vehicle for the
communication of bibliographic data.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:14.130
The culmination of Henriette's
work was among several lasting

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:18.880
contributions was a format
structure that became the basis

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.490
for MARK'sformat worldwide and
the MARK distribution service,

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:30.690
a prototype that other national
bibliographic agencies emulated.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:36.560 position:56%
That same prototype, the MARK
distribution service, also gave rise

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.810
to the creation of
bibliographic utilities,

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.010
the foremost today being OCLC.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.180
In fact, OCLC might have been here
at LC had Henriette gotten her way.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:51.120
As forceful as she was, she wasn't
quite able to pull that one off,

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.080
but we'll talk about
that a bit in a minute.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.840
Another technical achievement was
a process of format recognition.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:04.330 position:56%
That is a technique to enable the
computer to assign tags, indicators,

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.560
subfield codes, fix field codes

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:12.070
to machine readable
records from catalog cards.

00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:16.720
Format recognition has been held as
one of the early examples in fact

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.250
of an expert or a thinking system.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.550
All due to Henriette's foresight.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.260
Now, the bad.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.740
Henrietta viewed the RECON,
that is retrospective conversion

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:34.900
of catalog cards to MARK
data component as one

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.870
of the great missed
opportunities for libraries

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.520
in the development of MARK.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.190
The library community did
not [inaudible] its resources

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:49.050
to convert all of LC's records
at that time dating from 1898

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:55.370
to machine readable form would have
advanced libraries immeasurably.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:58.480
Without doing so, libraries
converted the same records

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.550
with high costs and varying
levels of quality which would end

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.990
up being a disservice to
library users everywhere.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.570
In fact, libraries across
the country including LC

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.600
and we're working on some now
and I'm looking at a colleague

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.250
who have stewardship
of some that we need

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:19.640
to do are still converting card
catalogs and other manual files

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.880
that are in need of conversion.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.180
So just think about that.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.010
That was 50 years ago,
and we're still diddling

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:31.730
about with some hidden
connections to deep resources.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:36.620
The ugly. When asked what she would
do differently in creating MARK,

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:41.680
Henriette [inaudible] that for the
LC MARK system she would not have

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.440
designed a separate application
for each form of material.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.440
For those of us who were
around, I have to admit I was,

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.360
MARK rolled out with monographs,
serials of print materials.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.820
Then it went to various formats.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:59.480
In fact, I think it was into
early 1990's before we had all

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.580
of the formats ready and we were
no longer transcribing information

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.100
on sheets and cards, etc.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.550
That failure necessitated format
integration in later years

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:14.720
of MARK's implementation and use.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.300 position:56%
Now, so as not to close on the bad,
I'll share a tidbit on how Henriette

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:23.690
who was not educated as a
librarian which fooled many people,

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:28.820 position:56%
how she absorbed cataloging to such
a degree that she could develop MARK

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.910
and ultimately she could
be recognized as one

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.630
of the world's preimminent
librarians.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.570
She was taught cataloging
through reading

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:41.270
and studying cataloging
rules and also by two Library

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.500
of Congress staff at the time.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.360
One, a seasoned librarian.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.100
Is Kay Collins in the audience?

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.400
That is he.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.440 position:56%
And along with a reference librarian
so you had on the one hand someone

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.260
who knew how to create the data
that went into catalog cards

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.800
and then you had one on
the other hand who knew how

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.360
to use and research that.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.860
So she wanted to make sure
what she was doing was going

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.160
to be the full ticket.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.380
So in addition to her bedtime
reading of the cataloging rules

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:21.010 position:56%
which I understand she did on a
nightly basis from what she told me.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.810
She had these two colleagues
who were working with her daily.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.840
I'm told that one of
the learning tools

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.590
that she used was a large
facsimile catalog card.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:37.450 position:56%
She placed it on the floor and she
pressed top to bottom, left to right

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:41.430
and absorbing each element of
the card asking Kay questions

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.200
of what should be there,
what should not be there,

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.360
and when he couldn't answered,
he said, "Well, if we did it,

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.570
there must have been a reason for
having it so you ned to figure

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.190
out how to put it into the format."

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.340
So with that, I say long
live the card catalog

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.210
and its wanted legacy
even as we look forward

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.600
to its replacement bibframe, which
I won't go into because I've talked

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.590
about that to most of you, I think,

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:08.720 position:56%
and I think our colleague will cover
a bit of that in a special format.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.510
So thank you for your
attention to my remarks.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:18.510
[ Applause ]

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:24.450
Now I'm simply going to go down
the [inaudible] and introduce each

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:28.190
of the colleagues, everyone of them
I've worked with, but I'm not going

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:33.520
through much introductory remarks
except to let you know who they are

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.020
and what their current
positions are.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.340
The first will be Barbara
Natanson who works as head

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.770
of the reference -- head
of reference in Prints

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.270
and Photographs Division here
at the Library of Congress.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.020
And I worked with Barbara
on numerous occasions

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:53.520
as we come together with both
guidance on processing materials

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.770
as well as the contents
of prints and photographs.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:01.600
Then next to her is a colleague
from outside the library,

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.080
Christoper Cronin, who is
Director of Technical Services

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.170
at the University of Chicago, and
I worked with Chris on [inaudible].

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.520
He's a former PCC chair,and
I worked with him

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.270
on the so-called big
head's group at ALA.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.600
So we have a good long
working relationship.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.800
Next to him is Kathy Woodrell who
is here at the Library of Congress

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.000
and is a reference specialist in
decorative arts and architecture

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.310
in the main reading room.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.700
And I worked with her on
many occasions including some

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.660
of our mentoring programs
and other areas.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:40.370
And then last but certainly
not least is Jennifer Baxmeyer

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.530
who is a leader in serials
and electronic resources team

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:47.090
at Princeton University, and
I've had the privilege of working

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:51.320
with her both as we are
rolling out bibframe

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:59.210
and in the OCLC [inaudible],
OCLC Partners Group at ALA.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:03.970
So these are our wonderful
speakers this afternoon,

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:08.120
and we're simply going in order
and at the end of the presentation,

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.180
we'll have time for
questions, comments

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:14.460
and your thoughts on
today's sessions.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.510
So Barbara.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:23.140
[ Applause ]

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.290
&gt;&gt; Barbara OrbachNatanson:
See if we can pull this down.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:30.680
I feel like saying
can you see me now?

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.380
I also wanted to thank the
organizers for this program,

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:38.540
which gave me a chance to revisit
my life with the card catalog.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.860 position:56%
I see in the program that I'm listed
as talking about the card catalog

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.900
as early technology and
that probably should be

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.080
as my early technology.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.570
I handled a lot of catalog
cards in my early career

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.450
in the Princeton Photographs
Division.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.370
But as you'll see, I'm
think I'm going to argue

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:58.470
that the card catalog was really
advanced in technology with all

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.040
of its benefits and efficiencies.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.820
The catalog helps us to envision
multiple aspects of access

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.120
to a large picture collection.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.740
So see what we've got here.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.990
So the Princeton Photographs
Division has a proud traditionof

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.000
using card catalogs.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.950
We once counted 40
different card catalogs

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.380 position:56%
and indexes and use in the division.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.220
At this point, we've converted much
of that data into online records,

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.260
but there's still card catalogs in
regular use in our reading room.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.170
In the history of access,

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.310
the Princeton Photographs
Division Collections,

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.990
card catalogs represented a
flexible, cost effective form

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.160
of access when compared
with other access methods

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:45.460
that had their benefits but
also considerable drawbacks.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.730 position:56%
With picture research in particular,

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:51.070
users often don't know what
they want until they see it.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:54.050
The contents of a picture
and more indefinable aspects

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.340
of the composition
are especially crucial

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.470 position:56%
in the selection stage of searching.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.830
So one of the means of access
implemented in the early days

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.450
of the Princeton Photographs
Division was

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:07.530
to place the pictures
in files for browsing.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:11.060
Direct, effective, satisfying.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.290
But unless one could invest
the money and space needed

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:18.010
to file multiple copies of the
images under different headings,

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:21.110
it also meant deciding on
the one element of an image

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:24.860
that seemed most prominent,
most likely to be sought.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.030
If it's a picture of
calamity Jane for instance,

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.670
probably anyone wanting to
know what the frontier scout

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.390
and wild west show performer
looked like would be pleased

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:37.920
to find this picture under her
name once one figures out which

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:42.370
of her many names she went by
and what you should look under.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.850
But there are other elements of
the picture that could also be

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.670
of interest, the setting, which
turns out to be the grounds

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:53.760
of the Pan American Exposition
in Buffalo, New York in 1901,

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:59.450
the photographer and copyright
holder C.D. Arnold, even the horse.

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.150
Researchers studying the exposition
or the photographic techniques

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:06.890
of C.D. Arnold or horses used
in entertainment at the turn

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:10.470
of the 20th century would miss out.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:14.340
The handy 3 by 5 card bearing a
description of the image and filed

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:19.240
under multiple access points
opened new paths for research.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.260
This point may seem obvious,
but filing descriptions

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.990
in a card catalog also
promoted collocation.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:30.690
We had to deliberately include a
name heading or a subject heading

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.430
to file under and with
well established principles

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:37.100
of authority control, consistent
use of headings enabled the user

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.780
to count on all of the photographs

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.400
of Martha Canary to
be listed together.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.500
And cross references could
easily be built in to lead

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.290
from her better known
name Calamity Jane

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.700
to the authorized heading
at the time.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.670 position:56%
But a heading that has since changed
in the LC name authority file

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:58.950
where the authorized name
is now Calamity Jane.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.350
This demonstration that
in cataloging as in life,

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.330
change is ceaseless,
also illustrates

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:09.060
that with each new technology
comes new challenges.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:13.690
Cross references were easy to
build in, not so easy to maintain,

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.850
a point I'll return to in a minute.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:20.020
But back to my salute to the
flexibility of the card catalog.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.510
One feature that was exploited to
the fullest in our reading room is

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:27.390
that staff organized the
contents of each catalog devoted

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:31.480
to a particular pictorial format
in a way that made the most sense

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.190
for the items they led to.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.780
While author, title, subject
catalogs are the norm,

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:42.040 position:56%
with our fine prints, for instance,
the entries are organized by century

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.190
and within that by the
name of the artist.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:46.980
Talk about visualization.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.930
Just a glance at the
drawers gives a sense

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.010 position:56%
of the bulk dates of our collection.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:56.200
Since staff could record all kinds
of information on a 3 by 5 card,

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.000
in this catalog staff went
beyond mere cross references

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.720
to incorporate the
authority record itself

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.990
with all the research
it represented.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:09.200
And lest you think that
we traded the you know it

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.040
when you see it element of
access solely for word headings,

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.160
I'll point out that with our
historical print collection we

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.930
revived the notion that
seeing the picture as early

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:23.500
in the search process as possible
is a vast aid to research.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:28.700
Did the fabulous 3 by 5
card technology solve all

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.310
of our access problems?

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:33.900
What am I going to say?

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.520
No. Just imagine how
labor intensive it was

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.220
to paste those little
pictures on the cards.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:43.490
Combine that with the work involved
in producing multiple cards,

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:48.120
adding headings to them and filing
them and maintaining headings

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:53.070
and cross references with changing
cataloging rules was also a

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:57.010
challenge, and the results could
be pretty messy in the absence

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:59.400
of training in library hand.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.730
With the growing collection, it now
totals nearly 16 million items even

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:08.440
when we describe on a
single card an entire group

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.900
of images rather then
describing the items one by one,

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:15.760
the labor involved meant that
there were thousands of images

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.550
that didn't even get this
level of description not

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.840
to mention the physical
preparation that would be needed

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:25.260
to make it possible to serve
the materials being described.

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:29.400
Digitization and machine readable
cataloging enabled us to describe,

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.760
index and display images
in far greater quantity

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.620
with far greater speed and ease

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:40.920 position:56%
and enabled correspondingly greater
speed and ease in the searching end.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.120
Keyword access to all the words
in the records whether headings

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.920
or not took the pressure off of
the analysis and precision required

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.950
to assign authorized headings

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.590
and the maintenance
that comes with that.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:55.740
Although we are still big
believers in authority control

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.900 position:56%
and controlled vocabulary, we assess
collections to determine what level

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.690
of cataloging can practically be
applied in light of the likely use

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:07.460
of the images and other
characteristics of the material.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:11.100
Sometimes that means relying
on words found in various parts

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.900
of the description as in these
catalog records from images related

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.520
to the Pan American Exposition.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.660 position:56%
Catalog records for some materials
consist at least initially primarily

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.920
of information that came
on or with the items,

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.670
generally recorded as
a transcribed title.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:34.700
That's the case for instance
with our 35,000 glass negatives

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.390
from the National Photo
Company Collection.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:42.090 position:56%
The transcription provides
searchable words but we've lost some

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:46.590
of the benefits of collocation,
that one stop shopping satisfaction

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.050
of knowing you found
all the relevant entries

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.100
under the authorized
name or subject heading.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.260
Therefore, we must
remind searchers to think

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:59.320
of the different ways names
can be spelled and expressed.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.860
Similarly, it's important
to think of synonyms

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.900
that might have been used for a
topic and to think about the words

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.500
that might have been current
in the 1910's and 1920's

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.290
when the images were
made and captioned.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:16.060
For the researcher interested in
early auto travel, think roadsters,

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.810
not our standard subject
heading of automobiles.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:24.100
As you can see, sometimes
particularly with large collections

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.460
of negatives, very few
words come with an item

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.860
and sometimes not at all.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.310
To provide maximum access
as immediately as possible,

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:36.940
we take advantage of digital
visual access in a way

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:41.120
that the card catalog
couldn't have readily provided.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.340
Related images are
often physically next

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.210
to each other in the collection.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:49.220
Exposing that arrangement
offers an added form of access.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.350
Here, someone interested
in auto racing

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.420 position:56%
at the Baltimore Washington Speedway

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.890
in Laurel would probably
be delighted

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:01.050
to find this uncaptioned photo
beside one that had a basic caption

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.780 position:56%
that mentions the location and date.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:07.350
Do you suppose there's a
metaphor somewhere in the fact

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.030
that I've switched modes
from transportation

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:14.950 position:56%
to Calamity Jane's horse to speeding
cards of the early 20th century?

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.980
Electronic data and digital
technology have expanded

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.420
exponentially the universe
of what we can make available

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.400
from our vast and varied
collections.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.140
But in my final ode
to the card catalog,

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.070
I'll note that there
wasn't intangible

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:33.210
or maybe entirely tangible
quality that came with being able

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:36.930
to see the size and
scope of a card catalog.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:42.230 position:56%
You had a physical sense of the
universe of data you were searching.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:47.070
With many of our online systems,
it's now harder to get a sense

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:50.700
of the whole pool of
data when it's searching

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.410
so it becomes more
challenging to figure

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:56.240
out whether one search has
been truly comprehensive.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.300
Helping researchers to picture
the information universe we're

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.380
presenting and how to navigate

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.480
that universe is part
of our ongoing mission.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.280
Thank you.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:22.010
[ Applause ]

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:23.310
&gt;&gt; Christopher Cronin:

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:26.180
The microphones are going
to go like this all day.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.090
Well, thank you and
good afternoon everyone.

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:29.910
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:33.340
Susan asked me to talk
about how the University

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.600
of Chicago built its catalog,

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.220 position:56%
particularly around its
distinctive area studies collections

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:46.990
and in particular [inaudible]
languages or scripts rather.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:51.210
And I imagine I was asked
also because of my connection

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:54.830
to the cataloging community and
the PCC, but I have to confess.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:59.260
I did -- I never cataloged
in [inaudible] script myself.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.970
So my solution to this, how
do you develop a presentation

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:07.370
on something I have no personal
experience with was to talk

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.970
to my colleagues, many of whom
in technical services were

00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:15.940
around when we managed the card
catalog and also some members

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:19.540
of our collection development team.

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:24.030
And what they told me interestingly
even though I talked to all

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:29.320
of them independently and
separately came into several kind

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.930
of recurring themes, and some

00:34:31.930 --> 00:34:33.980
of them we've already
heard a little bit about.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.110
And the first was how
the card catalog

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:40.420
over time reflected
histories of our language.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:46.370
And our Slavic and eastern European
studies bibliographer gave me this

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:52.780
great example of how
pre 1917 publications

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.400
for Russian materials
had to be treated

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.490
and approached in very
different ways.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:04.690
It turns out that 100
years ago tomorrow

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:08.560
on May 11, that's tomorrow right?

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:17.030
May 11, 1917 the Soviets, of
course, wanted to remove as much

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:20.820
of the [inaudible] history as
possible,and they created a group

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:24.440
that I think I see some
coin people in the crowd,

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:29.230
some PCC [inaudible] people in the
crowd, a great group for the PCC.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:31.800
It sounds exactly like
what we would do now.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:36.060
The assembly for considering
simplification of the orthography.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:40.280
Doesn't that sound like a group,
the PCC would form reporting

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.670
to the standing committee on
standards or something like that?

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:47.660
So they wanted to modernize the
language after the czarist period.

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:53.410
So if a book was written
pre 1917 orthography for --

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:59.420
in Russian, the bibliographers,
the subject specialist,

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:05.320
the public services librarians
over time had to including now,

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:09.410
this metadata is still represented
in North American databases,

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:11.860
certainly in worldcat to the extent

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.970
that it has really
never been harmonized

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:15.430
and in our [inaudible] guide

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:19.160
for this collection there is
still a note that says if you want

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:24.880
to determine if we have a pre 1917
publication in our online catalog

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.330
or a database such as worldcat,

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:31.390
you will have to retransliterate
the Soviet title back

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.580 position:56%
into the old orthography to find it.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:39.340
And so whether you like it or not,
you have to be a linguist to get

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.790
to some of this data
and what surprised me

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.660
about this was we keep trying

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.930
to uncover hidden collections all
the time even ones we've cataloged,

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:52.830
but are not really usable or
findable and certainly this came

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:55.550
to the [inaudible] for me when
I was talking to my colleagues.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:37:02.510 position:56%
Certainly also for this part of the
world there were different histories

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:05.180
and practices governing
transliteration,

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.240
and I learned from my colleagues

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.600
that that scholarly transliteration
was actually quite different

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.350
from the transliteration developed
by the Library of Congress,

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:18.280
nd so even now as our
researchers look

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:24.560
at those early source materials,
we are transliterating a lot

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.280
of these things between
the various schemes.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:35.050
The words identity politics,
this is Washington so come

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:38.260
to the news media all the time.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:42.110
It's a catchy phrase,
but certainly reflected.

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:45.390
This is just one example
of one country in less

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:51.320
than a century how many time it
changed its identity and its name.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.910
And a colleague, I wrote her
quote from an email she sent me.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:59.450 position:56%
Said, "Corporate entries in the
card catalog told the entire history

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:04.060
of an institution," bethat
a government or a country

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.040
or any other corporate body.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.950
All of these nuances of the
deep impact of the evolutions

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:14.480
of our language, culture, politics,
geographies, the identities

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:18.570
of our people were not only
reflected in our card catalog

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:21.220
but required a much
deeper connection

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:25.820
between the cataloging operations
and the public services operations

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.700
of the library than we do now.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.200
And one of the things that
I meant to bring with me

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:35.790
but I didn't was a manual that was
created really by the catalogers

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:39.760
to help reference staff understand
how to navigate the catalog,

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.040
and now we think you
search and that's --

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.770 position:56%
use the word search, you think type.

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:48.850
But searching the catalog was an
intensely physical activity back

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.320
then and required knowing not
just how the catalog worked

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:57.320
but many other reference tools
like [inaudible] and so forth.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.950
Sorry, Susan also asked me to talk

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:03.860
about whether Chicago is ever
a customer of LC's cards,

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:09.800
and folklore has it we did get the
cards but not for the card catalog,

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:13.710
for selectors to make
purchase decisions.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:16.460
I don't know if they were the
same cards that we would have put

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:22.880 position:56%
in the card catalog, but it -- what
the problem was was that our ability

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:28.130
to use LC's cards really came down
to this tiny little square footage

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.160
on the card, the call number.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:37.970
We built our collections at times
while LCC classification was still

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:41.900
being developed and there
was decades of history

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:46.140
of catalogers building
local classification schemes

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.440
for our collections.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.950
That was very hard
to give up, and we --

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:52.500
someone used the word
intellectual contributions earlier,

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.520
and certainly there would have been
a deep connection to that work,

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:01.680
and I would imagine led
to us being so delayed

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.100
in becoming an OCLC member.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.180
We did not join OCLC until 1989.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:11.590 position:56%
So most of our copy cataloging if we
did it came through the tape loads

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:15.810 position:56%
from LC, but we also weren't
contributing our original cataloging

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:20.990
until quite late, and so
those deep traditions,

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:26.970 position:56%
the expertise in cataloging that
Chicago acquired over time then also

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:29.530
as soon as we went into
OCLC, I think that spirit

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:33.320
of cooperation and
sharing took hold.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.920
We joined the PCC,
and I did get a chance

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.170
to read the book a
couple of days ago.

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.800
One of the histories
I learned in there was

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:45.840
that Charles Cutter attempted to
do something that I think the PCC

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.080
and certainly all of its
participating libraries,

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:54.570
mine even this week itself trying
to get better metadata directly

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:58.930
from publishers as close to the
time of publishing as possible.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:02.680
And if I can quote you first,
[inaudible] I thought it was great.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:07.010
The quote the plan was to
goad publishers into working

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:10.460
with Charles Cutter on cataloging
their own books through insertion

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.910
of a paper slip containing
the bibliographic information

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:16.230
that could be used by libraries.

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:20.600
The response from libraries
was tepid.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:24.470
I was going to make you insert the
blank, but I'll give you a pass.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:27.190
They viewed the scheme
with skepticism

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:29.890
and doubted it would
provide the final answers

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:31.230
to their cataloging needs.

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:35.660
So I don't know when that happened
but certainly a long time ago

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:40.720
and more proof that the more things
change the more they stay the same.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:45.210
We still struggle with that one.

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:48.370
So we certainly, of
course, this book is mostly

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:51.550
about the public catalog, but
I'm a technical services person,

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.290
and I wanted to know what
was managing the card catalog

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:55.590
like on the back end?

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:58.160
Certainly we had gigantic
shelf lists.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:03.530
And one of my staff, our head
of serials, Renee Martin,

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:06.650
showed me this holdings
card from the University

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:08.290
of Chicago Serials Department.

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:14.060
It is an annual report, a check
in card for the annual report

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:17.660
from the town clerk presumably
from Sidney, Australia.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.300
Doesn't say Australia on it.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:24.760
And we see that it was regularly
being received through 1989

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:28.400
in unbound status and at
some point there's blanks.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:32.280
So by the absence of data you
can assume we stopped getting it.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:35.370
And then you can also
assume someone was curious,

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:37.960
where is all of this stuff
and tried to claim it.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.810
I don't know if they would have
called it claiming back then,

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:42.450
but that's what we
would call it now,

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:46.370
and you see there's a
handwritten note at the bottom

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:50.770
of the card dated 2/1/1941.

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:53.930
It's not an ISO format so
I can't tell you whether

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:57.060
that means February 1 or January 2.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.370
It's got a Roman numeral in it.

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:01.760
That's probably a convention
for something.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.930
I can't tell you what.

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:09.340
But the note says will
be forwarded end of war.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:14.550 position:56%
And I think what was so
fascinating about that was preserved

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:19.720
in these catalog cards even
just the management side

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:23.920
of things are these
realities of information flow

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.380
through our histories during
times of global conflict

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.830
and clearly how difficult
it was to relay information

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:35.910
and get publications during
a period of time of conflict,

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:39.370
but interestingly in a part of
the world you don't normally think

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:42.660
of as being the theater of
war at that particular time,

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:46.210
clearly a challenge nonetheless.

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:52.030 position:56%
I could go into a story about the
abbreviation for the word analytics,

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:56.420
but I will considering the
esteemed venue I will not,

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.910
but I will tell you that
last month I mandated

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:03.270
that all 250 something
thousand instances

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:07.540
of that abbreviation be spelled
out in full in our catalog

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:11.200
because we display the
entire MARK record now,

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.790
and I did not want that in there.

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:18.920
So we got rid of that.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.590
So this was another note shared
with me from the shelf list

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:27.170
that demonstrates that the future
is indeed longer than the past

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:30.770
and the struggles that our
colleagues faced back then were

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:33.790
at their core the same
that we struggle with now.

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:37.930
This is a note that said we really
want to do analytics for this,

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:40.860
and we will do this
if ever any time.

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:45.050
And I think what we have learned
is there will really never be

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:46.580
more time.

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:50.740
As a cataloging manager
who has inherited the sins

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:54.960
of many forefather's poor
judgment in treatment decisions,

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.690 position:56%
I can say we no longer kid ourselves
that there will be more time.

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:03.390
We either do it or we don't do it.

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:05.930
Lastly, I would love to
thank you all for listening.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:10.320
I want to thank you for inviting
me to speak at this event if only

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.040
because it provided me with an
important reminder of the history

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:17.780 position:56%
of my profession, the history of my
library for giving me another reason

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:22.080
to appreciate the precious
fewof my colleagues remaining

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:27.530 position:56%
in my organization who remember what
it was like and how that historical

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.800
and institutional knowledge
of how we essentially became

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.160
who and what we are today.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.490
One of them, I just want to put
her picture up is June Farris.

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:38.540
She is our Slavic and Eastern
European bibliographer.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:41.630
I got many stories from her,

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:45.950
some so scandalous I couldn't
even repeat them to you today,

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:51.060
partly because they involved
the Library of Congress.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.120
The juiciest ones really did.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.640
This historical knowledge,
this connection to our past is

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.140
at grave risk as our colleagues
retire and these histories retire

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:05.320
with them and this book
that LC has published will

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:09.530
in no short measure
ensure that those memories

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:12.460
of our cataloging humanity
perhaps even a few strands

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:16.710
of our cataloging DNA will be
captured in there forever more

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:19.540
and I want to thank the Library
of Congress for that as well.

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:20.840
Its been a great privilege.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.640
Thank you so much.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:30.500
[ Applause ]

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:39.180
&gt;&gt; Kathy Woodrell: Well, I'm
a little taller than that.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:44.810
I'm Kathy Woodrell,
and I'm here to talk

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:48.830
about using the main card
catalog in reference work.

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:54.270
So let's see, it's this.

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:57.600
Oh, it's this.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.900
Thank you.

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:04.470
So between 1802 and 1879,
the library had produced

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:07.250
at least 57 printed catalogs.

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:10.870
I won't be reading to you the
entire time let me assure you.

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:15.730
When the Jefferson Building opened
in 1897, there was no complete

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:19.610
or current catalog, and the
Librarian of Congress at the time,

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:23.930
John Russell Young, stated that,
"A library without a catalog is

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:26.590
like a ship without a rudder."

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:30.340
The main reading room staff did
have a small drawer compiled

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.510
with entries clipped from
these various catalogs

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:35.580
that was kept behind the desk.

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:38.520
Much reliance was placed
on the staff

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:41.990
to remember the books
in the collection.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:48.260
By 1900, a dictionary catalog
containing 90,000 cards was

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.650
on the floor in the
main reading room,

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:56.110
and by 1920, the catalog had grown.

00:47:56.110 --> 00:48:00.520
Between 1920 and 1950, the
card catalog occupied a quarter

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.040
of the main reading room,

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.870
and it grew to fill the current
reference assistance room

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:08.510
that you see pictured here
on the right, the machine

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:12.440
and electronics resources
center, what we call it currently,

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:16.100
and the hallway between the two.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:20.970 position:56%
When the catalog was closed in 1980,

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:28.480
it had 22,000 drawers
and 22 million cards.

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:34.040
In 1990 or '89, the catalog
was moved to two deck areas off

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:38.900
of the main reading room and
because the Carnegie steel shelving

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:42.660
in the Jefferson Building actually
provides structural support

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:48.380
for the building, the circular
card catalog cases that were

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:53.370
in the main reading room couldn't
be used and so we appealed --

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:56.560
the library appealed to
libraries around the country

00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:00.250
to send us their card
catalog cases cabinets

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:02.500
since they weren't
using them anymore

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:05.460
and we received many of those.

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:11.470
Now, the card catalog is
on decks 16 and 33 just off

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:12.940
of the main reading room.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:16.660
These images show one aisle
of the main catalog --

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:19.530
card catalog on deck 33 and part

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:24.500
of the shelves housing just
A through P on the right.

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:29.620
Because the cabinets were
received from a variety

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:36.520
of different libraries, the catalog
is not aesthetically pleasing,

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:40.220
but it is fully functional.

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:44.910
And here are some caveats
for fully functional.

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:49.040
With 22 million cards, a
misfiled card is a lost card

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:52.570
and a lost card can be a lost item.

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:56.080
Over the years, sometimes
researchers will just rip the card

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.330
out of the card catalog
to bring it to us

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:00.660
so we can retrieve it for them.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:05.390
Or they take the card to show their
uncle that his book actually is

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:09.040
in the Library of Congress.

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:12.790
In the movie J. Edgar which was
filmed at the Library of Congress,

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:16.640
Leonardo D'Caprio is
actually shown ripping a card

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.760
out of the card catalog.

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:22.700
Several years ago, we discovered
that all of the subject cards

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:27.780
for birds had disappeared
and had to be replaced.

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:33.580
When I began in the
main reading room,

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:37.940
I was assigned a terrific
mentor, Tom Mann.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:41.680
28 years later, he still
has lessons for me,

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:48.720
but one of my first lessons was
red tipped cards are subject cards.

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:54.410
For many years, we were
under the impression actually

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:58.530
until I started working on this
presentation that those numbers

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:00.120
in the card catalog that looked

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:04.050
like fractions were
actually Jefferson numbers,

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:07.910
and here's an example of a
card that with the call number

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:09.770
that looks like a fraction.

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:12.720
There were two people
who could convert them.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:16.580
I remember one of their names,
Jefferson numbers converted.

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.020
Who you going to call?

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:20.920
Sigrid Milner.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.560
I'm sure she's no longer
here, but you could call one

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.510
of these two people
from the reference desk

00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:30.210
and they would give you
the accurate call number

00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:32.110 position:56%
for the book that had that fraction.

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:36.570
So I'm hoping some of you who
are catalogers will be able

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:40.140
to explain this fractional system.

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:43.060
I don't recognize it.

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:50.210 position:56%
So -- but you can see in this card
that the number has been crossed out

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:56.110
and the new call number
has been replaced.

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:58.210
[ Inaudible ]

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:03.890
Yes, sir. I wanted to tell
you some stories about some

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:05.850
of the people who've
come to request help

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:09.210
and had to use the card catalog.

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:12.050
A few of my colleagues
worked with a researcher

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:15.360
who was a handwriting specialist,
and he came to the Library

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.280
of Congress to study the
library hand as found

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.860
in the main card catalog.

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:26.460 position:56%
In the 1880's, much was written
about handwriting by Melville Dewey,

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:30.260
the American Library Association
and by Charles Cutter now known

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:34.210
to us primariliy as part of the
call number after the period.

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:43.120 position:56%
So prior to 1887, Melville Dewey
began to promote library handwriting

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:46.110
or the library hand
as it was also called.

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:48.410
He preferred the vertical style.

00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:53.820
He was interested in speed,
efficiency and legibility.

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:56.200
Should you be interested
in library hand or for

00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:01.970
that matter telegraphic hand,
railway hand or telegram hand,

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:06.800
those actually exist, you can
see David Caminsky's website.

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:10.640
I've included it on
the slide so you can --

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.480
and I will say that the article

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:17.520
on library hand is
actually quite interesting.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:21.430
Another story involving my
colleague Abby Yokelson.

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:22.730
A few years ago.

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:24.160
She got a written letter
from a researcher

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:28.960
who was compiling a bibliography
on author Wilkie Collins.

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:32.900 position:56%
He had seen an entry in the National
Union Catalog for an edition

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:37.540
of Collins' Woman in White,
The Tale of an Amorphous Woman

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:40.230
Who Had Escaped from an Asylum.

00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:44.630
LC was listed as the
only owning library.

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:49.980
In March of 2006, Abby
first found the NUC entry

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:53.750
and then she searched
the card catalog.

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:57.230
On the card was a handwritten
note that I've circled

00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:01.020
on this and it says not found.

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:06.420
As Abby examined the card, a
chill wind blew through the deck

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:11.740
as she realized that the note
had been written 100 years ago

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:16.760
to the day.

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:20.160
We've been dealing with pre
MARK records for a long time,

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.230
and one of the ways that we deal
with pre MARK records is by going

00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:29.420
to the card catalog to see
where the mistake was made.

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:34.890
I always heard that pre MARK was
actually input by Scottish clerks

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:41.660
or Scottish housewives, but --
and I don't actually know that.

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:44.660
Much was actually lost
in translation.

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:49.090 position:56%
So I'm making a bit of a joke here,
but things were lost in translation.

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:54.470
The cards in the card catalog
often include content notes,

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:58.000
series records, holdings
records, cross references,

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.510
records for uniform titles,
automated records derived

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:04.880
from them were often created
using a limited profile

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.970
of transferable information

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:12.660
and the automated format often
dropped unique characteristics

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:16.440
and sometimes eliminated
file information.

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:20.890
Copy catalog protocols for machine
readable records often [inaudible]

00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:27.580
local information in looking
for other information.

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:30.640
So issues with pre MARK,and
I have an example here

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:34.960
of something called
porcupine's political sensor.

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:37.770
You'll notice on the
card that it says office.

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:40.920
That was an early designation
for rare book.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.230
And that is indeed where this is.

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:48.200
But I wanted to show you the
other cards behind this card

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:55.800
and all the information that
was kept on each of these cards.

00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:03.770
So the online catalog record for
the political sensor does indicate

00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:06.220
that there are four
rare book collections

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:10.000
where this title can be found
but much of the information

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.990
on these cards is now missing.

00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:18.350
To effectively respond to a
querie involving older materials,

00:56:18.350 --> 00:56:22.160
it's essential to consult
the main card catalog

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:26.400
and perhaps divisional catalogs,
the copyright card catalog,

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:30.240 position:56%
the shelf list, the [inaudible]
catalog, the National Union Catalog,

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:35.340
bibliographies, reference
sources and colleagues using these

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:40.670
and other sources in
concert is invaluable.

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:44.600
When assisting researchers
seeking historical information,

00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:48.140
the card catalog is
an essential element.

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:52.970
It is the authority for
anything published prior to 1968,

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:56.980
and many people don't realize
that the first two aisles

00:56:56.980 --> 00:57:00.860
of the catalog hold
just periodical titles.

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:05.690
And those records are duplicated
in the main card catalog.

00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:09.110
So these are just some
examples of things

00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:12.840
that are found in the catalog.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:18.980
So many items in the catalog aren't
reflected in the online catalog,

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:23.570
and many, many of the library's
foreign language materials

00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:29.070 position:56%
and periodicals in foreign languages
are only found in the card catalog.

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:32.710
The older things that have
been converted are primarily

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:34.220
English language.

00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:39.130
In addition, changed subject
headings is a very important topic.

00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:44.910
For example, aeroplanes was the --

00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:49.810
used to be the term,
we know use airplanes.

00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:53.490
Moving pictures is
now motion pictures.

00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:56.700
Negroes is now African Americans.

00:57:56.700 --> 00:58:01.700
There's so many examples of changed
subject terms, but in the area

00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:05.500
of the card catalog we keep
two copies of the ninth edition

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:07.860
of Library of Congress
subject headings.

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:12.490
That is the edition that was in
place when the catalog was closed.

00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:16.520
Since there is no global search
and replace in the card catalog,

00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:22.540
e are reliant on those older terms
for identifying older materials.

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:28.420
And the card here shows the
previous term for Auschwitz,

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:32.430
which I would never
have been able to spell.

00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:40.070
I want to tell you a story
about a card catalog success

00:58:40.070 --> 00:58:45.360 position:56%
in which I was assigned a question
froma woman in Texas named Gretchen.

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:49.850
She wanted to find
another woman named Eileen.

00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:53.160
They were pen pals when
they were young teenagers.

00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:56.170
And the only information
she had was this.

00:58:56.170 --> 00:59:00.840
Eileen had contracted polio and
Gretchen had read an article

00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:04.310
about Eileenin a magazine
published some time

00:59:04.310 --> 00:59:08.330
in the late 1940's or early 1950's.

00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:13.300
She remembered Eileen's
address but not her last name

00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:14.950
or any other information.

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:18.940
She didn't remember the name
of the journal or the date.

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:21.320
So step one, I had an address.

00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:24.340
I determined that the apartment
building in New York City

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:26.740
where Eileen had lived
had been razed.

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:28.450
It was now a parking lot.

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:32.820
So then I went to the reader's
guide for periodical literature

00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:35.710
and started looking for
articles about a young girl

00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:37.810
who was recovering from polio.

00:59:37.810 --> 00:59:40.020
I found no entries.

00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:43.610
I then used the reference book
that listed magazines produced

00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:46.380
for women's interests
to identify titles

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:49.090
that were available around 1950.

00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:53.790
Most of those titles were either
not indexed or partially indexed.

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:58.320
I then used the card catalog
to get call numbers for several

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.560
of those possible titles.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:04.920
Are you getting the fact that
I can be like a dog with a bone

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:08.320
with a reference question
because I can.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.160
So I started looking.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:14.350
I went to the stacks, and I
eliminated many journal titles

01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:19.270
and looked at more tables of
contents than I cared to admit.

01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:21.100
There was one bound volume

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:25.160
of the Ladies Home Companion
missing from the stacks.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.730
But the space was there.

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:31.320
So I kept watching and
returning and finally

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:35.740
after about two months the
volume was on the shelf again.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.080
I opened it up.

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:41.120
The table of contents said that
the article was in that journal.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.550
I was so excited.

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:48.470
When I turned to the page,
it had been razor bladed out.

01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:54.990
So I found another library that
had that article and I had --

01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:57.750
it was North Texas State
University Library.

01:00:57.750 --> 01:01:02.150
I had them send the
article to Gretchen.

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:04.590
Gretchen when she received
the article called

01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:09.350
to say what Eileen's
last name had been

01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:12.240
and fortunately it was
Dichek [assumed spelling],

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.860
somewhat unusual and not Jones.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:21.990
So I was able to find a
brother just using the internet,

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:29.010
and I reunited Eileen and
Gretchen after more than 50 years.

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:38.480
Thank you and thanks
to the card catalog.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.690
Although we no longer
have the beautiful cases

01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:42.910
that formerly resided in
the main reading room,

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:45.670
we have all the information
included in them.

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:50.720
So please, come to the main
reading room, use the card catalog

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.120
and here's a current picture of it.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.420
Although not an option for
the Library of Congress,

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.380
libraries that have gotten rid

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:03.680
of their card catalogs are
doing really creative things,

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.180
and so even though they're
no longer in use, this is --

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:11.250
images from the San
Francisco Public Library.

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:16.850
They hired an artist to get
people to draw on different cards

01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:19.650
that meant something to
them and the upper floor

01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:23.010
in the San Francisco Public
Library is wallpapered

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:25.650
with these artistic cards.

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:29.330
Here are other examples of
art and creativity workshops

01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:34.050
at libraries using catalog cards.

01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:41.180
Here's an organization called
the Library as Incubator Project.

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:49.930
With that card catalog
corset, who knew?

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:55.420
And here's one from Columbus
State University with all kinds

01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:59.830
of creativity made out
of card catalog cards.

01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:04.450
It looks like as well as
cards -- the checkout cards.

01:03:04.450 --> 01:03:09.990
So as the decorative arts
specialist, I would be remiss not

01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:15.020
to share exciting possibilities for
card catalog cabinets and cases,

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:18.110
and you might ask where
would I get such a thing?

01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:25.230
Well, there's always the magic of
eBay, Google, Craigslist, Etsy,

01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:30.920
flea markets, and that will allow
you to find organizational zeal.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:37.010
Look at all the things people
have put in their card catalogs.

01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:42.780
And you can keep track of
your items, and if you insist

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:46.750
on using your card
catalog alphabetically,

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:55.020
there's alsop always Asti
Spumante [inaudible].

01:03:57.150 --> 01:04:02.430 position:56%
So on behalf of the card catalog off
of the main reading room and myself,

01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:07.510
I would like to thank you.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:22.580
[ Applause ]

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.670
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Baxmeyer: Well,
I can't compete with wine

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:31.190
in a catalog card -- card catalog,
but I'm going to talk a little bit

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:35.940
about how we at Princeton are using
RDF vocabulary such as bibframe

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:42.170
which Beacher mentioned to explore
relationships in the inscribed

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:47.210 position:56%
and annotated material that we found
in the library of Jacque Derrida

01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:52.110
and what we're doing to help expose
those relationships in the form

01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:55.210
of link data on the semantic web.

01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:57.720
So little over two years ago,

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:01.050
Princeton University acquired
the personal working library

01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:06.230
of Jacque Derrida who was an
Algerian born French philosopher

01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:08.350
who is considered probably one

01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:11.370
of the foremost thinkers
of the 20th century.

01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:16.090
This acquisition was significant
for us because the library consists

01:05:16.090 --> 01:05:21.760
of about 16,000 items including
books and other material

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:26.020
and Derrida's library was pretty
much an immersive environment,

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:30.150
eaning that it represents his
sort of lifetime of reading.

01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:34.200
For Derrida, the active reading
was not really a passive process.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.000
He was actively engaged
in what he was reading,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.610
and he annotated much of it.

01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:43.060
These annotations included
everything from [inaudible]

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:48.690
to dog eared and paper clipped
pages and pages with post it notes

01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:51.270
and other inserted material.

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:53.480
In addition, many of the books

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:57.610
in Derrida's library are actually
presentation volumes bearing

01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:01.870
personal inscriptions from other
philosophers and theorists as well

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:04.120
as from a wide range of admirers.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.830
Today we've identified
about 6300 books

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:09.980
that have personal inscriptions.

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:14.120 position:56%
These inscriptions give us a
glimpse into Derrida's global social

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.140
and intellectual network.

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:18.860
Perhaps equally important
if not more so is the fact

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:22.800
that Derrida himself annotated
many of these inscribed volumes.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:26.580
He took note of where others
mentioned him in the books,

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:29.880
and he often annotated
those particular pages.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:32.930
As a result, we're able
to gain additional insight

01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:36.440
into his reactions about what
others were saying about him

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:40.120
because like most authors and
writers, Derrida cared a lot

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.720
about what other people
said about him.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:47.560
So as we've seen from the
previous presentations, we've --

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:51.130
libraries have a long history
of organizing information,

01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:54.650
both for the purpose of preserving
knowledge and also for making

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:58.090
that knowledge available
to anyone searching for it.

01:06:58.090 --> 01:07:01.990
We've made significant strides in
organizing information beginning

01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:07.160
with simple lists of books
engraved on clay tablets

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:11.140
to the rich descriptive data found
in our online discovery systems.

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:15.650
The next logical step then is to
share that rich data on the web

01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:19.780
so that it's value could be
appreciated beyond the library.

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:24.080
Unfortunately, one of the biggest
obstacles to exposing library data

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:28.790
on the web is in the way that the
web can actually understand it is a

01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:31.920
reliance on the MARK
format to encode our data.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:36.300
MARK has served us really
quite well for half a century,

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:40.540
but libraries are pretty much
the only industry using MARK

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:44.300
so our data doesn't play well with
everybody else's data on the web.

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:47.780
So we need to move away from MARK
to a framework that allows us

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:51.450
to create machine actionable
data that is persistent

01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:54.240
and easily understood
by web crawlers.

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.520
So currently, we present
data to library users

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.870
through our online
discovery systems.

01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:04.360
In addition for archival
collections, we create finding aids

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.140
that give more detail about
collections than we can include

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.980
in our bibliographic descriptions.

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:11.220
At Princeton, the finding aid

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:14.310
for Derrida's library presents
the material in the order

01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:16.530
that he left it as far as we know.

01:08:16.530 --> 01:08:21.150
Some of it arrived
in boxes out of order

01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:23.100
and anyway, it was kind of a mess.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.290
But anyway, which is
useful for researchers

01:08:25.290 --> 01:08:27.810
because again it emphasizes
the context

01:08:27.810 --> 01:08:31.900
and gives them an idea
of his social networks.

01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:34.770
But the problem with
finding aids just

01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:39.710
like with bibliographic records
encoded in MARK, much of the data

01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:43.670
and the finding aid which uses
encoded archival description is

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:45.390
mostly textual.

01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:47.670
For the Derrida library,
our rare books

01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:50.550
and special collections
staff created identifiers

01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:53.610
to reflect the original
shelf order of the material,

01:08:53.610 --> 01:09:02.300
meaning which wall the book was on,
which case on the wall, which shelf

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:04.510
and what position on the shelf.

01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:10.680
So this is really interesting to
researchers because they can see,

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:14.460
oh we've got Vampire
Diaries next to Death

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:19.680
and Transfiguration next
to Fifty Shades of Gray.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.950 position:56%
I'm making up stuff, but by being
able to see how things were shelved,

01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:30.260
the researchers can deduce maybe
or come up with assumptions

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:32.360
about what he was thinking or
what he might have been working

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:35.620
on at the time he received
a particular volume.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:38.830
But the problem with those
identifiers is that with EAD,

01:09:38.830 --> 01:09:41.250
the Encoded Archival Description,

01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:43.730
the identifiers are
basically just kind of stuck

01:09:43.730 --> 01:09:48.510
in what's basically a big ordered
list, and so the types of quering

01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:52.550
that needs to be done
isn't easily done.

01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:55.100
So this is where we are right now.

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:58.610
We have rich data about library
resources and collections,

01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:02.700 position:56%
but that data has mostly been
captured in text strings in a format

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.890
that most of the web
does not understand.

01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:07.160
So I'll talk a little bit more
about Derrida in a minute,

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.890
but let's go back to
the online catalog.

01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:12.330
So online catalogs
contain rich information

01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:16.580
about the resources we've
been curating for centuries.

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:18.360
What if, though, we were able

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.530
to create an enhanced
discovery environment for users

01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:25.180
from the wealth of nonlibrary
data sources on the web

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:28.670
that describe those same works,
people and other entities

01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:30.980
that we represent in our catalogs.

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:34.940
We can use linked data
to help us get there.

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.130
Some libraries are
already experimenting

01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:40.070
with enhancing their discovery
systems with information pulled

01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:43.670
in from resources outside
of the library.

01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:46.830
What if we could pull in
data from Wikipedia directly

01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:50.460
into our online catalog like
I have shown on this mockup

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:53.660
in the middle of the page?

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:58.610 position:56%
Or what if we could provide visual
representations of the relationships

01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:03.210
between authors when a user
does a search by author?

01:11:03.210 --> 01:11:07.960
Perhaps we could create API's that
could display interactive graphs

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.530
of relationships for
our users directly

01:11:10.530 --> 01:11:13.560
from within our online catalogs.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:19.050 position:56%
The possibilities for serendipitous
discovery suddenly become limitless.

01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:22.060
In order to reach the point

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:26.130
of creating enhanced discovery
environments for our users as well

01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:29.390
as reaching the point where our
carefully crafted and curated

01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:32.900
and nurtured library data
is exposed on the open web,

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:35.050
we need to free that data.

01:11:35.050 --> 01:11:37.610
We need to free it from
the confines of the library

01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:41.010
so that a user searching the web
will not only retrieve results

01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:45.190
from commercial enterprises such
as Amazon.com but will see links

01:11:45.190 --> 01:11:48.340
to resources held by institutions
like the Library of Congress

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:51.210
or University of Chicago
or Princeton.

01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:55.900
Once we do this, we will pave the
way for new knowledge creation.

01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:59.700 position:56%
The project we're working on at
Princeton with Derridas library aims

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:03.620
to create a set of data that can
be used by researchers and scholars

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.310
to learn more about
Derrida and his social

01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:08.370
and global intellectual network

01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:11.990
and to easily answer potential
research questions such as

01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:17.130
which inscriptions did Derrida make
comments on or Derrida is not known

01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:19.860
for his works on religion
so where did he get all

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:23.210
of these books on Judaism?

01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:27.030
Oncewe record the data using
persistent identifiers instead

01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:30.210
of strings of text and
model it using a standard

01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:34.030
such as the resource
description framework or RDF,

01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:37.880
which is the standard model used
for exchanging data on the web,

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:41.020
e will be able to publish
that data on the open web

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:44.590
so that it can be used by
others however they may wish.

01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:48.450
Perhaps a researcher is interested
in finding out what kinds

01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:50.850
of people were sending
books to Derrida?

01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:53.040
We might be able to
assist that research

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:58.470
by creating an interface driven
by linked data that will allow her

01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:03.310
to form complex queries about
the items in Derrida's library.

01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:07.680
Or perhaps another researcher is
interested in seeing visualizations

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:11.270
that show the geographic locations
of people who sent books to Derrida

01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:14.010
and how these changed over time.

01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:16.770
That researcher could take
the persistent identifier

01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:20.950
from names we've coded in our
bibliographic descriptions,

01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:24.550
pull in data for geographic
locations from something

01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:28.340
like geonames and then import
all this into a spreadsheet,

01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:31.520
upload the spreadsheet into an
online tool such as [inaudible]

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:36.380
which was created at Stanford, and
this would allow that researcher

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:40.210
to visualize and analyze
the relationships over time.

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:44.280
But back to our question
of how we might get there?

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:47.580
The approach we're using at
Princeton is two pronged.

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:51.240
For the inscriptions, we're using
the web annotation data model,

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:52.540
which is the official --

01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:56.020
which actually became an
official worldwide web consortium

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:58.180
recommendation earlier this year.

01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:01.060
For the bibliographic data
that described the books

01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:03.860
in Derrida's library,
we're using bibframe.

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:09.020
We found that the core purpose

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:13.200 position:56%
of the web annotation data model
fits well with the Derrida material.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.960 position:56%
The model states annotations are
typically used to convey information

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:22.020
about a resource or
associations between resources.

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:28.280
For our purposes, the
inscription itself is an annotation

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:30.950
so the inscription is a
body and then the public

01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:33.930
in which the inscription
is written is the target.

01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:36.650
So then we have a model that
we can work with and use

01:14:36.650 --> 01:14:39.060
that web annotation data model.

01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:42.380
So I mentioned earlier that Derrida
sometimes annotated the books he

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:43.920
received as gifts.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:47.180
Here's one of our favorite
inscriptions from the collection

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:51.400
that we came across when we were
digitizing the inscriptions.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:56.980
You can see that Derrida
has indicated his opinion

01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:00.800
of the [inaudible] by writing
hypocrite explanation point

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.050
to the left of the transcription.

01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:05.820
And this was actually an
interesting case in modeling

01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:10.740
because not only do we have the one
annotation being the inscription

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:16.190
of the book to Derrida but
then we have Derrida's shade

01:15:16.190 --> 01:15:20.550
on that particular person
as another annotation.

01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:23.760
By using the web annotation
data model and RDF,

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.400
we're able to capture the
relationships between the work

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.910
that was given to Derrida,
the person who sent the work

01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:33.530
and Derrida himself in such a way
that the data can be represented

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:37.230
as a collection of statements
about those relationships.

01:15:37.230 --> 01:15:40.610
Each with a subject, a
predicate and an object.

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:43.980
These are called triple statements
because they have three parts

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:46.630
and the premise of linked
data is that the subject

01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:49.620
of one triple can be the
object of another triple.

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:53.300 position:56%
So this is -- I don't know if
you've seen those linked data graphs

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:55.380
with just like all
these lines and circles.

01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:59.210
This is what is driving linked
data, these relationships.

01:15:59.210 --> 01:16:02.080
You have an object and a subject
connected with a predicate

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:05.230
and then there's another subject
that's the same as this object.

01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:08.150
And then we start to have
more complex relationships

01:16:08.150 --> 01:16:09.920
that we can easily see

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:12.700
in our bibliographic
data that we have today.

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:16.510
So and also because each triple
statement will have a unique

01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:20.390
identifier,a computer can derive
meaning from those statements

01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:24.800
in a way that's impossible
with text screens.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:27.760
Another thing that we --
and I thought about this --

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.460
this wasn't part of my
presentation so I'm digressing.

01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:37.260
When we were learning about sort
of the history of the card catalog,

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:41.160 position:56%
I remembered at Princeton we got rid
of our card catalog a few years ago

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:46.270
and a lot of professors were
really upset about it going away

01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:50.570
because for many of them that was
their first place for research.

01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:54.740
Snd their area of expertise --

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:57.260
you'd go to that section
of the card catalog

01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:02.640
and see just documents written
on the back of the cards,

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:03.940
in the margins and everything.

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:05.250
And we've lost that.

01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:08.030
We lost that when we went
to the online catalog.

01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:12.030
And what's nice about the web
annotation data model and the idea

01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:13.940 position:56%
of going forward with linked data is

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:18.070
that we could potentially
provide a way for researchers

01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:22.510
to start annotating the way
they did the card catalog

01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:25.550
because the web annotation
data model is set

01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:28.870
up where a person can make
an assertion about a thing

01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:34.010
and show the [inaudible]
of that statement so again,

01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:36.850
it brings it back to
having the researchers

01:17:36.850 --> 01:17:42.010
and scholars more intimately
associated with the catalog record

01:17:42.010 --> 01:17:44.220
so that's another exciting
thing that I thought

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:45.520
of while I was sitting there

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.990
that doesn't have anything
to do with what's there.

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:55.390
So using bibframe which is -- it's
in the second version right now --

01:17:55.390 --> 01:18:00.000
will allow us to describe the gift
books in Derrida's library using --

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.980
again using triples with persistent
identifiers which are critical

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:08.470
in order for linked
data to actually work.

01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:11.940
We are actually able to put
persistent identifiers in MARK,

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:14.990
and a lot of libraries
including Princeton are beginning

01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:18.750
to add these persistent
identifiers called URI's

01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:21.690
to their bibliographic records
in preparation for linked data.

01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:24.970
But the key difference
between bibframe and MARK is

01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:30.070 position:56%
that bibframe uses RDF, the resource
description framework conventions

01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:31.370
and MARK does not.

01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:34.920
So bibframe is able to
communicate, if you will,

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:39.230
with the rest of the
web where MARK is not.

01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:43.100
New data models expressed in RDF
are necessary in order to shift

01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:46.730 position:56%
to the linked data environment we're
counting on to help us free our data

01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:49.560
so that it can be used in
new and interesting ways

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:53.220
and provide enhanced discovery
environments for library users.

01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.370
Bibframe is the model
that Princeton,

01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:58.670
other experimenters are
using to realize the future

01:18:58.670 --> 01:19:01.250
for library data on
the semantic web.

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:03.050

&gt;&gt; I'm just thankful that I deleted
the last line of my presentation,

01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:46.370
which was a picture of a card
catalog from our collection

01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:49.520
that is now used to store
wine at a friend's house.

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:54.540

your toes with that.

[ Inaudible ]

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.990
&gt;&gt; There seems to be a
[inaudible] of articles

01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:11.870
in [inaudible] online publications
such as Atlas Obscure [inaudible]

01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:17.120
who seem to have just
discovered now card catalogs.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.640
Atlas Obscure wrote a long one.

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:22.000
You'll appreciate this,
about how the card catalog,

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.840
the Library of Congress is
gathering dust in the basement.

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:30.760
And actually I kind of use that
every day in [inaudible] materials

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:33.170
to verify holding, and
if it's gathering dust,

01:20:33.170 --> 01:20:36.030
it's because someone
doesn't clean it.

01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:38.000
The [inaudible] articles
again seemed

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
to have discovered catalog cards
in general and just [inaudible]

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.040
about the amount of
detail found on said cards.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:50.830
And while part of me thinks
well, it's great that cataloging

01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:54.090
in general and metadata creation
is getting sort of wider attention,

01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:57.590
on the other hand, I have
concerns that the manner

01:20:57.590 --> 01:21:01.360
in which this is treated makes it
sound as though A, we don't include

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:05.510
that kind of detail anymore,
which we do, and not annotations

01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:10.440
but the actual cataloging and
B, that what we do is some kind

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:15.060
of [inaudible] lost art that is
no longer practiced and again

01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:16.990
in my opinion anything
that makes us sound

01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:20.500 position:56%
like we're practicing an [inaudible]
lost art leads to things like oh,

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:21.810
we don't need libraries anymore.

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.480
They just do those
lovely historic things

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:26.030
like write card catalogs
and nifty hand.

01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:28.630
And I was wondering how
you felt about what seems

01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:32.330
to be the even prior to the
book the sort of re-emergence

01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:38.260
of the card catalog and catalog
cards in sort of popular culture?

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:45.770
&gt;&gt; I would just like to
say I spoke with Tom Mann

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:49.370
at length writing this book, and
I think the quote's in the book,

01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:53.250
and he wanted to make clear
the cards were not kept

01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:56.230
as he said I think for
the texture of the wood

01:21:56.230 --> 01:21:57.850
and the sort of nostalgia.

01:21:57.850 --> 01:22:03.030
He wanted to emphasize their
continued utility for cataloging

01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:04.780
and reference staff
here at the library.

01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:09.890
So I hope that does come
through in the book.

01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:11.190
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Jennifer.

01:22:11.190 --> 01:22:14.070
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Baxmeyer: Of course, I
have to respond to my friend, Deb.

01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:17.930
But I think one of the problems --

01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:20.360
I mean, one of the reasons
that there's this perception

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:24.470
that we're doing -- that we're not
doing the same thing anymore is

01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:27.550
because we hide so much of
it in our online catalogs

01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:30.180
because we've assumed that the
users don't want to see that.

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:33.020
They want the Google
experience with the blank screen.

01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:35.940
When they get the search
result, they just want the title

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.380
and the call number so
they can go to the stacks.

01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:40.580
So we've hidden so much information

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:45.070
that I think there might even
be a whole generation of people

01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:47.420
who don't realize the work
that actually still goes

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:51.680
into creating a bibliographic
description and since they're able

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.470
to go to Google and find things,

01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:56.090
they don't realize the
intellectual work that goes

01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:58.190
into creating descriptions
because --

01:22:58.190 --> 01:23:01.850
and I think that's one way we've
kind of shot ourselves in the foot,

01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:04.000
and we're having to
make ourselves --

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.610
trying to make ourselves
relevant now

01:23:05.610 --> 01:23:16.460
because we've hidden
so much of that work.

01:23:17.670 --> 01:23:19.270
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Yes.

01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:22.550
&gt;&gt; So I also work in the
main reading room with Kathy,

01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:27.000
and somebody up there
mentioned institutional memory.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.340
And Kathy had mentioned David
Caminsky coming in and looking

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:32.890
at our catalog in terms
of library hand.

01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:36.650
It was fascinating because he
was pretty sure he could identify

01:23:36.650 --> 01:23:40.570
which library school various
catalogers had gone to based

01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:42.390
on the style of handwriting.

01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:44.600
It was amazing to me.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:49.020
But predays of cell phone cameras,
we used to occasionally have

01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:52.040
to give people permission
to take out the rod

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:55.460
from the catalog and
photocopy a catalog.

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:58.950
And he had very good reason for
needing to do that so we started

01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:01.670
to carefully take these apart.

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:06.280
Kathy had mentioned it's a hodge
podge of catalog cases and drawers

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.220
and kinds of things, and I
think we came up with five

01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:13.850 position:56%
or six different methods to get the
rods out, and one was really simple.

01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:16.110
You just unscrewed it,
and another one had

01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:19.780
like a hidden button,
but there are also keys.

01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:24.410
There are a couple of different
kinds of ways of loosening the rod

01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:27.860
and Cheryl Adams inherited
some of these keys

01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:33.140
when Sheridan Harvey retired, and
we had to be around to get the keys

01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:35.420
or open the catalog, and
I can't even remember how

01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:36.720
to do most of them.

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:39.170
So we decided in terms
of succession planning

01:24:39.170 --> 01:24:42.700
and institutional memory
have a staff meeting.

01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:45.270
We needed to train some
of our younger colleagues.

01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:49.440 position:56%
So we brought in all the drawers and
all the keys and taught everyone how

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:52.440
to use them because it just
doesn't come up very often,

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:55.250
but when it does, you need to
know how to open those drawers.

01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:57.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if I could add to that.

01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:01.390
Kay Giles and Tom Yee, I
spoke with both of them

01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:02.690
when I was writing this book.

01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:06.850 position:56%
And I forget which one but they told
a story of there used to be back

01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:10.340
in the day staff members who
would stand by the card catalogs

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:12.570
when somebody pulled a rod out
and knocked the whole drawer over

01:25:12.570 --> 01:25:14.030
and the cards would go everywhere.

01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:16.580
They were masters of
quickly refiling the cards

01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:19.810
in the correct order and
getting the rod back in there.

01:25:24.730 --> 01:25:32.360
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: There is
a question there and here.

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.580
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm just curious
about the workflow.

01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:40.550
Once MARK was being pushed in 1969
or 1970, not everybody was going

01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:44.850
to be doing the actual
cataloging [inaudible] information.

01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:46.890
The catalog was still
being typed up.

01:25:46.890 --> 01:25:50.030 position:56%
What was the workflow -- that
information was going to be inputted

01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:53.910
into a machine readable
system and then --

01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:58.220
in other words, what
was the workflow?

01:25:58.220 --> 01:25:59.520
You had a book.

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.770
Because [inaudible] was still
being -- still being created,

01:26:02.770 --> 01:26:04.670
but you had MARK, which
was machine readable.

01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:06.800
What was that kind of connection?

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.180
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Well, I'm
going to speak from memory now

01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:13.430
because when I came in, I was
cataloging, we were using cards.

01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:18.460
They weren't 3 by 5, but they were
twice that so probably like 4 by 6.

01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:23.030
And so we catalogers
typed information on that,

01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:25.620
and we had a separate division.

01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:29.170
MARK Editorial Division,
I believe was its name

01:26:29.170 --> 01:26:30.510
at least in one [inaudible].

01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:37.290
All of those cards, if you
will, flowed to that division

01:26:37.290 --> 01:26:41.790
and there was staff who then
did the keying into the system.

01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:46.470
That system generated information
that produced the card --

01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:49.850
the cards themselves
that were done by at

01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:54.350 position:56%
that time I think it was called the
card distribution division I believe

01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:58.610
it was, and so everything
flowed from catalogers starting

01:26:58.610 --> 01:27:02.540
with the input process, going
through the creation process,

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:05.330
the intellectual process
then the input process

01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:09.260
and the MARK Editorial Division
and format and structure,

01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:13.700
then that flowing on to the
card distribution service

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:15.000
and the card division.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.850
That was one iteration.

01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:20.480
Then it moved onto, we
had [inaudible] terminals

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:26.180
and we finally could actually
input the data into something

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:29.380
that had no intellectual
understanding what was happening,

01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:32.550
was just sucking it in, going
some place else and then

01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:35.390
that would spew out
the end products.

01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:37.320
Then I think maybe by the 80's

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:43.280
or 90's we each had
intellectual desktops

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:45.950
that actually took the things
that we could then manipulate

01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:47.580
and do searching and
all that kind of thing.

01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:48.880
So it was never [inaudible].

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:54.340
Sort of evolved at the same rate of
the MARK format itself from print

01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:58.780
through probably the first decade
of 15 years to the special format,

01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:02.500
ound recordings,cardiographic
materials and what not.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:05.800
So that's a very high
level way it flowed

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.840
at that time here at the library.

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:14.310
One more question so people can

01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:19.430
at least gather a little
bit for the reception.

01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:23.300
&gt;&gt; Hi. Long before
the MARK 2 project,

01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:26.570
there was a MARK pilot project,

01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:29.380
which was a completely
different format.

01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:32.490
The tag was right next
to the field itself.

01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:35.040
There was no director.

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:40.690
Before even that, Henriette had
contracted with Larry Bucklin

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:43.970
at [inaudible] to do
a study of this area

01:28:43.970 --> 01:28:49.320
and what the details were
I cannot say at this point.

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:50.620
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Right.

01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:53.520
I had some of all that detail but I
didn't want to go into it for this.

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:55.910
I just wanted to keep it
at a high level, but yes.

01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:59.340
Believe me, she told me
about every one of those.

01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:01.860
And if I got it wrong, if
I was trying to describe

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:05.680
or write some article for her
I knew it by the next day.

01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:09.280
So yes. There were lots of
intricacies and they went

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:13.980 position:56%
to various pilot stages and recon
projects and some of them got funded

01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:19.560
and evolved into something
permanent and some went by the way.

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:23.460
The ony thing that was constant
was the constant evolution

01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:25.000
of the format itself.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.340 position:56%
And more and more becoming engrained

01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:31.850
in the library world
like what we're doing.

01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:34.560
On that then, we will
end and in the --

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:42.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I want to thank a moment
to thank all of our speakers.

01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:48.700
It was just a fabulous program.

01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:52.360
&gt;&gt; This has ben a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
