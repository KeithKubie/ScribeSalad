hello my name is archivist Luella and

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.180
hello my name is archivist Luella and
 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.180
hello my name is archivist Luella and
I'm asking a question from second life

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190
 
 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.150
 
so my question is at the LHC why collide

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160
so my question is at the LHC why collide
 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.580
so my question is at the LHC why collide
lead ions and programs instead of some

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590
lead ions and programs instead of some
 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.120

other element hi archivist Llewellyn I

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130
other element hi archivist Llewellyn I
 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.120
other element hi archivist Llewellyn I
have a question for you where did you

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130
have a question for you where did you
 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.880
have a question for you where did you
get that hat you know those are the hat

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890
get that hat you know those are the hat
 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.310
get that hat you know those are the hat
you're wearing is the Hat my daughter

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320
you're wearing is the Hat my daughter
 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.689

the strong force and I didn't know there

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590
the strong force and I didn't know there
 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.400
the strong force and I didn't know there
were copies available out there and on

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410
were copies available out there and on
 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.370

ebay or somewhere so where did you get

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380
ebay or somewhere so where did you get
 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.620
ebay or somewhere so where did you get
that about your question why why do they

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630
that about your question why why do they
 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.010
that about your question why why do they
use lead ions at the LHC they haven't

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020
use lead ions at the LHC they haven't
 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.200

choose both gold and lead since they're

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300
choose both gold and lead since they're
 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.440

probably are other practical reasons why

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039
probably are other practical reasons why
 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.010
probably are other practical reasons why
lead is the iron of chores choice at the
