00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
JAMES CLEWETT: I want to
talk about number 41.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.800
41 is a number which crops up
in "Garden of Rama." Which,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.060
when I was a teenage boy, was
just about my favorite book.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.160
I loved Arthur C
Clarke's stuff.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.460
He really enjoyed educating
in a really subtle way.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.530
And so in this book--

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.320
page 53, I checked--

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.510
rather randomly, we suddenly
find that we're doing some

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.580
sort of quadratic mathematics.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.450
So as a teenage boy, I didn't
understand this at all.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.150
I looked at it.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.210
I thought, yeah, that's nice.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.150
And part of me wished
I could do that.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.380
But then I moved on.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.640
So what I want to do today is
actually take you through this

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.920
and explain to you what Arthur
C Clarke was talking about,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.220
and why it is kind of cute.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.410
It's the heroine's
41st birthday.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.320
And her husband is a
mathematics geek.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.750
And he takes it upon himself
to explain to her why 41 is

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.340
such a magical number.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.780
Real people don't
talk like this.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.800
I work in a maths and
physics department.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.310
And even the geekiest
mathematicians that I know

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.769
don't actually talk like this.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.770
So I just want to reassure you
that this is a fictional work.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.320
- Give us an excerpt.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.790
JAMES CLEWETT: OK.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.060
Well, "Therefore, the entire
series can generate a simple

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.940
quadratic expression.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.360
Take f equals n squared minus
m plus 41," he continued,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.940
"where n is an integer
between 0 and 40.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.850
That function will generate
your entire sequence.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.170
Better still," he laughed,
"consider f equals n squared

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.140
minus 81 m plus 1681, where n
is an integer from 1 to 80.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.880
This quadratic formula starts
at the tail end of the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.575
original series, with f equals
1,601, and proceeds through

00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:44.110
the sequence, decreasing order
first, then reversing itself

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.000
to f equals 41, and generates
the entire array in increasing

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.350
order."

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.490
No Nobody talks like that.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.866
- Sorry, I fell asleep.

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:54.862
Are you still going?

00:01:54.862 --> 00:01:56.356
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:56.356 --> 00:01:56.860
Go on.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.500
JAMES CLEWETT: As a teenager,
I wanted to be like this.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.310
I thought that that
was really cool.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.490
And so I guess this speaks to
me and was a part of, again,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.650
why I became a physicist
in the first place.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.200
- Well James, I'm going to make
your dreams come true.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.570
JAMES CLEWETT: Thank you.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.740
- Because this is your chance to
talk like that and explain

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.310
that to us.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.730
[INAUDIBLE].

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.130
JAMES CLEWETT: OK.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.790
Let's try and make this
make some sense.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.080
And we are going to have
to do some math.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.490
But bear with me, OK?

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.560
Because I'm going to try and
make that math make sense.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.160
OK, so let's start by writing
down the equation that they're

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.190
talking about.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.870
And that is a simple quadratic
formula f equals n squared

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.057
minus n plus 41.

00:02:39.057 --> 00:02:40.360
Now don't be intimidated.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.300
Because all we're going to do is
we're going to say for any

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.100
given value of n, what
is the value of f?

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.000
Let's make a table, shall we?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.860
So if I put in, n equals 0,
then I have 0 squared

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.110
minus 0, plus 41.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.050
Which is simply 41.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.590
OK?

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.730
I put in a value of 1 I have
1 squared, which is 1,

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.960
minus 1 plus 41.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.670
So that's simply 1.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.880
If I put in a value of
2, I get 2 squared.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.830
That's 2 times 2 is 4,
minus 2 plus 41.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.870
That's 43.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.350
And so on.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.580
I put in 3.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.360
And so I get 9 minus 3, that's
6, plus 41 is 47.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.250
And exactly as Richard Wakefield
was saying in the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.670
book, what we're generating
here is a

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.820
sequence of prime numbers.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.910
Every number that we get for
plugging in a value of n from

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.590
naught to 40 is a
prime number.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.110
Now if I plug-in the value of
n of 41, what I get is the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.140
value which is 41 times by 41.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.590
Which is also a rather
cute little

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.910
symmetry to this problem.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.750
- So you've got this big
sequence of prime numbers.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.170
JAMES CLEWETT: Uh-huh.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.230
Which goes up to-- for a value
of 40, that goes up to 1,601.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.340
So we've skipped a few there.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.676
But they're all prime numbers,
all the way to 1,601.

00:04:06.676 --> 00:04:09.220
- You're going to show me
something cool now, yeah?

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.940
JAMES CLEWETT: Yeah,
I think so.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.100
What I'm going to show you is
a little something that was

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.680
first done by Ulam--

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.050
Stanislaw Ulam--

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.390
in 1963 while he was bored,
sitting in a presentation.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.770
And so he began just
to scribble away.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.750
I'm going to start with
the number 41 in the

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.540
middle of the page.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.500
And I'm going to scribble
a spiral of numbers.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.710
So the next number is 42.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.720
54, 57--

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.370
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.950
JAMES CLEWETT: I'm just making
a spiral of numbers.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.650
And at the end of that, I'm just
going to get to just a

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.290
couple more her.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.450
60, 61--

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.530
so what I want to show is how
these numbers relate to our

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.670
original series of numbers
generated from the

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.850
mathematics.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.940
OK so our first number
in the series, for n

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.750
equals 1, we get 41.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.180
And I've put that
in the middle.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.110
Nice big circle.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.560
There you go.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.685
Then our second number is 43.

00:05:04.685 --> 00:05:07.640
And I've put that one up here.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.510
47, it's down here.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.330
The next number, if I put in n
equals 4, the next number I

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.030
would find would be 53.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.100
That's up here.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.270
And then we continue
and we find 61.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.820
61 is down here.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.700
And so on.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.550
And so what we're discovering
is that all of the prime

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.400
numbers generated by the
quadratic series are found on

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.060
this diagonal, the lead
diagonal, of what we're

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.345
calling an Ulam spiral.

00:05:42.985 --> 00:05:47.190
- And every number in that
series as you go down is going

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.990
to sit along this line here.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.260
Is that--

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.500
JAMES CLEWETT: Every number in
the series is going to be on

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.210
that diagonal line
in this spiral.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.990
Now, this is neat because we
don't need to start with 41.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.100
We could start with
any number.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.040
And I invite you to try
and do this at home.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.240
Start with any number.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.390
1, for example.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:13.860
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13--

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.730
keep going.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.810
Keep going as long as
you feel inclined.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.830
And then go back with a red
pen and just draw a circle

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.410
around the prime numbers.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.890
3, 5, 7, 13--

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.410
I missed one at 11.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.840
So you develop diagonal lines
through the system.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.530
And I can draw in other
diagonal lines

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.140
which would be found--

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.390
and if you keep doing this.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.890
- But 9 is not a prime.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.780
JAMES CLEWETT: 9
is not a prime.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.040
No.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.190
There will be gaps.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.600
OK?

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.820
But the fact is that there's
this amazing pattern that just

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.580
emerges out of nature.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.990
Where you see these diagonal
lines in clusters.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.850
So if you keep doing this for
enough numbers, then you end

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.290
up with huge arrays
of diagonal lines.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.680
Which I'd like to show you.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.030
Not only on a Cartesian
coordinate system where we're

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.590
building a square spiral.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.170
But we can plot them
on, for example,

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.950
an Archimedes' spiral.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.900
And then you get a fabulous
pattern which will

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.440
look a bit like this.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.090
But 41's really sweet because 41
is the biggest number which

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.600
we can put into our original
formula, which generates a

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.630
series of primes.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.980
We could have used 11, or
17, or 5, or 3, or 2.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.850
And that would generate short
series of prime numbers.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.110
41 is the biggest one which
generates a series of all

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.400
prime numbers.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.530
So this is why our hero in the
book likes this series.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.180
He likes it because it generates
40 prime numbers.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.970
And then he can make it mirror
itself and generate them all

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.570
backwards if he wants
to as well.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.710
Because he's a clever
chap like that.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.740
- But you couldn't
do this with 43?

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.070
JAMES CLEWETT: No.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.850
Absolutely not.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.650
This is quite a unique set of
numbers that will actually

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.520
generate these.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.610
So it was Euler that he first
did this in 1772.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.495
So Arthur C Clarke is being a
little bit disingenuous when

00:08:03.495 --> 00:08:05.300
he claims that Richard
Wakefield is

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.040
doing it over dinner.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.310
But nonetheless, it's still
very, very nice thing.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.610
Euler is a famous mathematician,
and geometrist

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:15.750
going back two centuries.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.280
Ulam is the guy who was sitting
bored in a seminar one

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.470
day and decided to write
numbers in a spiral.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.710
As you do, obviously.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.400
But Ulam was an interesting
chap in his own right.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.640
He was part of the Manhattan
Project.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.820
He holds the patent for
the atomic bomb--

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.970
or the thermonuclear bomb.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:36.620
Which is an odd one.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.929
Because if somebody steals your
patent, then you don't

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:41.035
need a patent lawyer.

00:08:41.035 --> 00:08:44.090
You need a weapons system.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.620
That always amused me.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.700
He also, he was responsible for
Project Orion, which was a

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.200
project to launch spaceships
the size of small frigates

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.830
into space using a small series
of nuclear explosions.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.470
This was all before
they understood

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.730
about nuclear fall-out.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.500
He wanted to launch spacecrafts
with crews of 200

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.165
people on board.

00:09:06.165 --> 00:09:10.680
And actually, Orion is still
seen as probably the only way

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.010
that we have to do interstellar

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.780
travel on human lifetimes.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.700
So he was quite a clever guy.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.030
And in his spare time,
he drew spirals.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.450
BRADY HARAN: If you haven't
seen our other video about

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.050
these spirals and prime numbers
that was uploaded

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.640
around the same time
as this one--

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.100
and you probably already
have seen it.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.310
Because you probably came
here from that video.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.390
Well if you haven't seen
it, there's a link.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.940
You can go and check it out.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.990
And if you'd like to find out
more about James Clewett, how

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.030
he became a physicist, why, even
footage from his Ph.D.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.570
viva, which is something you
don't see every day--

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.710
there's also links for that.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:47.960
Go and have a look.
