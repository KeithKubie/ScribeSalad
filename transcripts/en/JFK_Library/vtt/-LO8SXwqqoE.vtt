00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
- And it was a frightening
time, which helps account

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.040
for the Alien and Sedition
Acts, which, of course,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.530
have discredited the Federalists.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.900
I actually think this was
the most frightening moment

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.520
in our history with the
second most frightening

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.520
may have been in early 1942 when we feared

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.260
a Japanese invasion.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.090
And you know what we did
interning hundred of thousands

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.860
of Japanese, many of them
citizens of the United States,

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.400
not just aliens but citizens.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.790
We were frightened of an invasion.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.290
Now, the invasion didn't occur,

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.120
and therefore we feel terribly guilty

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.410
and embarrassed by that.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.190
The same thing happened.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.280
The French did not actually invade,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.350
and therefore, it makes
the Federalists' fears

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.490
seem wrongheaded, but they
didn't know the future.
