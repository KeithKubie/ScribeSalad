The School of Life has branches all around
the world but till now, it hasn’t been directly

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.410
involved in the US.
But now we’re coming, with a big 3 day conference

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.400
that we’re going to be running in San Francisco,
starting on the 23rd of March, 2018.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.890
Taking place in the beautiful Yerba Buena
center right in the heart of San Francisco,

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.699
this is a three day event about everything
we care about at the School of Life: emotional

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.920
intelligence, wisdom, self-understanding,
love, friendship and meaning.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.710
The conference will mirror what happened in
our first conference in Lisbon Portugal in

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.269
October 2017. That means we’ll have lectures
in the day, great meals together, the best

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:53.100
kinds of interactions, and chats about everything
that matters late into the night. It’ll

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.279
be a true chance to experience a globally-minded
community dedicated to learning, kindness,

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:05.239
self-exploration and wisdom.
The conference lasts three days and is led

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.990
by our founder and creative lead, Alain de
Botton - and will feature our best teachers,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.770
and our very best, and most transformative
ideas.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.100
