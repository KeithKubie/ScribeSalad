00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.760
So here's a proposal.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.250
I'm going to give a point every time the
learner answers a question correctly.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.160
&gt;&gt; That makes a lot of sense.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.910
&gt;&gt; That means a lot of sense, so you
basically get credit for being right.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.683
&gt;&gt; The learner gets credit.

00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:12.340
&gt;&gt; The learner gets credit for
being right.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:12.910
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.160
&gt;&gt; I'm also going to give + 1 to the
teacher, and for the teacher, I'm also

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.070
going to give them credit plus one every
time the learner answers correctly.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.630
&gt;&gt; Good, so
their incentives are aligned.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.170
&gt;&gt; Yes, their incentives are aligned.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.866
The learner gets credit for
demonstrating they've learned, and

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.384
the teacher gets credit for

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:35.029
demonstrating they
the least know something.

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:36.980
So, what do you think is
going to happen here?

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.270
&gt;&gt; That learner's happy
getting answers right, and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.890
the teacher is happy when
the learner gets answers right.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.192
So they should work
together to maximize,

00:00:45.192 --> 00:00:49.880
I guess not necessarily learning,
but ask easy questions.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.500
If you ask easy questions, then
the learner wins and the teacher wins.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.030
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, I think.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.230
So hopefully it makes sense.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.840
So if let's say this question or
questions way down here are so

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.570
easy that anybody can get them right.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.349
Then if I ask questions down here,
the learner will get them right.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:06.680
So it's good for the learner, but

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.690
also because the learner will get them
right that's good for the teacher.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.620
&gt;&gt; Right, but that doesn't seem to
really make sense for this problem,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.130
in that we really want to
be asking questions

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.470
roughly at the level
where the learner is.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.564
&gt;&gt; Well, that makes sense.

00:01:20.564 --> 00:01:22.160
But let me ask you one other quick,
before we get there,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.840
let me ask you one other possibility.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.240
Since this doesn't give us what we want,
right,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.110
basically this says always
stick to easy questions.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.520
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And we'll both do well.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.860
What happens if I say okay well
the problem here is I've incentivized

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.620
the learner in a way that
kind of makes sense, right,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.360
learner wants to get a correct
answer to good questions, right.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.850
But I've incentivized the teacher
to go easy on the student.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.850
So why don't I make it so

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.900
that the teacher loses a point every
time the student gets something right.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.180
&gt;&gt; So now,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.590
the teacher is not incentivized
just to give easy questions.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.500
What's going to happen here?

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.920
&gt;&gt; Well, part of me feels like that now,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.730
it just seems like that the right
thing for the teacher to do then,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.870
from the teacher's perspective,
is give hard questions.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.300
The learner should try to answer them,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.610
but learner's not going to
be able to answer.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.630
&gt;&gt; Right, so what I should do is just
immediately go to all the really,

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.910
really hard questions about dinosaurs.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.510
You can answer them.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.420
You don't have the background and
the sort of fundamental math and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.510
calculus to answer
the questions about dinosaurs.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.410
And so you're going to keep
getting them wrong, but

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.690
the teacher is going to do just fine.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.710
And in fact, not only will the teacher
lose a point every time the learner

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.630
answers something correctly.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.930
Let's say actually,
the teacher gets a point every time

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.360
the learner answers incorrectly,
which is sort of the same thing.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But allows me to say

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.930
the teacher racks up points-
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.820
&gt;&gt; By making you do
things that are wrong.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.570
Okay?

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.520
So this is just kind of broken, right?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.930
The kind of obvious thing to do here
where I'm going to give the student

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.440
credit for demonstrating thing,
demonstrating they've learned things,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.760
they have knowledge.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.430
And give the teacher credit for
either demonstrating that

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.330
the student has knowledge or doesn't
have knowledge, gives me bad answers,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.840
and in particular, doesn't help
me with the goal of learning.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.710
It doesn't help the student and
it doesn't help the teacher.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.650
It just gives them whatever credit
they're supposed to get when they can

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.610
bother to get it.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.470
&gt;&gt; So ok, if the teacher getting + 1 for

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.100
the learner getting something correctly
ended up making things too easy, and

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.770
a minus 1 made things too hard,
then right in the middle is a zero.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.460
So what about the teacher get zero for
learner answering correctly.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.286
&gt;&gt; Well, the teacher get zero for
the learner answering correctly,

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.980
then it doesn't matter
what the teacher does.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.630
&gt;&gt; So, maybe the teacher
can do the right thing now.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.460
&gt;&gt; But why?

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.600
It's just like the coco example you've
given before, what reason do I have.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.500
And we certainly don't want this
to be the teachers high payment.

00:03:36.505 --> 00:03:37.005
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Although.

00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:38.300
&gt;&gt; Would that work in this case?

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.970
No, because now that the learner would
want to get to maximize the side

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.410
payments, then we're back to
the original problem that you said.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.570
Which is, if the teachers paid off for
the learner giving correct answers,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.690
then the questions are just going to
end up being too easy to be meaningful.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.490
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.330
And there's really no side payment for
the teacher to give the student.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.400
But you said something
earlier that I really like.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.830
You said, what did you say,
you said something,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.910
before he went down this path of the
minus one and getting hard questions,

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.300
you said something about what
the teacher ought to be doing.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.110
&gt;&gt; The teacher ought to be asking
questions, I don't know, so

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.860
that the learners kind of
getting half of them right.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.020
&gt;&gt; So I like that, so
let's sort of take a step back and

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.220
kind of see what that
would sort of mean.
