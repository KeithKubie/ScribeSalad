00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:02.969
- When I'm lugging all my
makeup across the country

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.072
or I'm having to spend an
extra 30 minutes to get

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:08.241
ready for something and
my friend Andrew's just

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:09.442
sitting on the couch

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.977 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Right.
- Just twiddling his thumbs,

00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:13.546
while I'm having to put on
eyeliner in my water line,

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:16.016
which means you're
poking in your eye.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.317
And yeah, I don't have to do it,

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.919 align:start size:84% position:16%
but it makes my eye
look that much better.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:20.754
- Yeah.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.122
- It's exhausting, Gaby.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.423 align:start size:94% position:6%
- To be fair, my
girlfriend doesn't do it.

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:24.657
- Your girlfriend doesn't do?

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:25.959
- No makeup, nothing.

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.660
- Well, she's also gay.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.329
- Yeah, well, so am I!

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.731
(rock music)

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:34.868 line:0%
- Gaby Dunn is our
guest right now.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:39.773 align:start position:0% line:0%
Gaby Dunn is a author, comedian,
do you still do stand-up?

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:41.875 align:start size:97% position:3%
- No, I mean, I did
storytelling on our book tour.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.443 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Okay, so yeah.
- But yeah.

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:46.713
- But just a funny, cool chick.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.916
Gaby Dunn, her book "Bad With
Money: the imperfect art of

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.985 align:start size:84% position:16%
getting your financial
shit together"

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.187
is available online now.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:56.089
You have a book,
you wrote a book.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.292 align:start size:97% position:3%
- This is like a
nonfiction that is based on

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:02.195
the podcast "Bad With
Money" that is about,

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.365 align:start position:0%
I don't know the genre
financial memoir is a thing now,

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.734
but it's like a
financial memoir.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.270 align:start size:84% position:16%
But also like a
help, helpful book.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.438
- Okay, what.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.706 align:start size:88% position:13%
You have a podcast
called "Bad With Money"?

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.075
- Yes.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:18.378 align:start position:0%
- In which you talk to
comedians and funny, cool people

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:19.212
about
- Well,

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:20.146
- Being bad with money.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.614
Tell me about the podcast.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.149
- For season one, so I didn't
know anything about money.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.117 align:start size:88% position:13%
I would cry about it all
the time, I was like.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:26.219
- I find I'm avoiding the issue.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.687 align:start size:88% position:13%
I don't even want to
talk to you about money.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:28.588 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's why you're
here to talk about it.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.023
- No, I know.

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:30.557 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's how much people
don't wanna talk about money.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:31.758
- Yes.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:32.559 align:start size:84% position:16%
I think I've had
some people be like,

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:33.793
"I love you so much,

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:35.929
"I can't listen because
it gives me anxiety."

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:36.729
- Yeah.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:37.564
- So I get it.

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:39.065
- Yes.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:41.401
- But I started not knowing
anything and I would cry.

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:43.303 align:start size:97% position:3%
That was like, my big thing
that I would cry about.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:45.872
And I just was always
in the hole somehow

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.107
and like, always had debt

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.175
and never talked
to anyone about it.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:52.879
And never, like it was
like my secret shame.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.748 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then, I had the
opportunity to do a podcast

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:57.183
and they were like,

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.818 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Well, do you wanna do
something about LBGTQ issues?

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:01.321 align:start size:94% position:6%
"Do you wanna do something
about sex positivity?"

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.856
And I was like,

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.625
"Actually, the thing that I
cry about everyday is money.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.528
"Maybe we should
just expose that."

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:09.362
- So the first,

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:10.196
- Run towards it.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.030
- I know.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.265
- Yeah.

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.199
- So the first season,
which is super healthy.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.701
- I think so.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:15.935
- The first season.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.137
- The thing you're most
scared to talk about,

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.038 align:start size:84% position:16%
why don't they start
a show about it.

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:19.873
- Yes.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:20.707
- I mean, that's nuts.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:21.641
Well, good for you.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.143
Okay, so the first season.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.612
- Was me mostly talking to
comedians and other artists

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:28.181 align:start size:97% position:3%
and just sort of being like,
"How do you make money?

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:30.316 align:start size:94% position:6%
"Like, how do you do this,
like what's going on?"

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.251
- Yeah.

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.652
- "What's your situation?"

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:35.321
And I, you know, moving
to LA from New York,

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.524
I didn't realize, oh everyone,

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.058 align:start size:84% position:16%
some people have
their parents' money,

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:42.562 align:start size:97% position:3%
or some people have side
jobs that I don't know about

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.063
or whatever.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:47.100
So I would compare myself
so much to other people

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.302
without knowing that they,

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:51.137
their situations were
so different from mine.

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:52.705
- Yeah, yep.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:55.041
- So I would, like, you know,
we would have the same income.

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:57.977
But I take care of
some family members

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:00.213
and I had student
loans and whatever.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:02.115
And then I would compare
myself to people who would,

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.516
who didn't have
any student loans

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:06.085
or were getting money
from their parents.

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.320
- Yes.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.388
- And I was like, "But
we have the same income!

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:10.557
"So how am I struggling?"

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:11.958
And then I was like,

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.360 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Oh, other people have
totally different situations."

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.032 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And was that the
first step in kind of,

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:21.334 align:start size:94% position:6%
is that the first step in
- Transparency.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.804 align:start size:97% position:3%
- But that's so hard, 'cause
no one talks about money.

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:26.005
- I know.

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:27.473 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I grew up in a house
where it was like,

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.676 align:start position:0%
"Nikki, you don't tell your
friends how much your dad makes.

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.177
"You're not even."

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:33.079
I wasn't even allowed to know
how much money my dad made.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.581
- Right.

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:35.815
- And it wasn't like a ton
of money or it wasn't even.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:37.016
Or when it wasn't
a ton of money,

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.418
I wasn't allowed
to know either way.

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:39.919
Why?

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.621
- But in the book I talk
about I got such whiplash,

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.457 align:start position:0%
because my parents would go
through phases where they would

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:46.059
have some money and then
they would have nothing.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.560
- Yes, me too!

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.128
- And so, there would be
days where they'd be like,

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:51.431 align:start position:0%
"Oh, yeah, you could
definitely go with your friends

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.799
"to this whatever.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.134
"You could go to the
dance with your friends

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:56.402
"and get a new dress."

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.104
And then like, two days
later, they'd be like,

00:03:58.104 --> 00:03:59.572
"No, you can't."

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.908 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I learned the word
destitute really early on.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.142
- Yeah.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.344
- My dad would always
say, "We're destitute."

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:05.845 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I was like, "I
don't know what that."

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:08.481 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I had to look it up and
I'm like, "Oh no, we're poor."

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:11.217 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like, I felt the same
back and forth of

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:12.685 align:start size:81% position:19%
do we have all
the money or none?

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.187
- None of the money.

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:16.689
And then I would get stressed
out, which is parentalizing,

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:20.560
where I would be be 12 and
my parents would spend money

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.428
and I'd go, "Should
we be doing this?"

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:23.363
- Yes!

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:25.865 line:0%
Oh my god, I remember the day.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:28.434 line:0%
I remember the day
I, we were driving.

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:31.304 align:start size:97% position:3%
We were moving from Cincinnati
to St. Louis, I was six.

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.872
And I remember being in the car

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:34.207
and seeing the St. Louise Arch

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:35.608
and just having a realization,

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:36.776
I don't know what conversation

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.044 align:start size:84% position:16%
was happening
between my parents,

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:39.912
but I remember being
like, "We're poor."

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:40.747
- [Gaby] Yes.

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:41.981
- Like, we're poor

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.483
and I am the only one
that's gonna make it

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:46.185
so that my sister doesn't
spend my parents money.

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:47.387
- [Gaby] Yes!

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:48.054
- 'Cause they're
not gonna tell her.

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:48.688
So I started,

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:49.856
- Yes!

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:50.523 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Being like, "Lauren,
you can't get."

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:51.324
I would like,

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:52.558
- Exactly the same.

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:53.793 align:start size:84% position:16%
- take her inside
at 7/11 and be like,

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:54.594
"You can only get
one candy, Lauren."

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:56.129
- Exactly the same.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.796
- 'Cause I was protecting
her from my parents having

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:57.330
to tell her.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.798
- Yes.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.300 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And just protecting my
parents from not being broke

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.434 align:start size:84% position:16%
and fighting about it
- Yes.

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:02.602
- And being scared.

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:03.536
- Almost exactly the same.

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:04.504
I have a little sister too.

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:06.005
- [Nikki] Yes.

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:06.806
- And she, I interview her
in the book and she's like,

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.141
"I had no concept.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.575
"I thought we were fine.

00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:13.279
She was like, "If I ask
Mom and Dad for something

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.882
"and they said yes, I would
go great, we have the money."

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:18.418 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I started being
like, telling her same.

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:20.720
I started telling her, "You
can't ask, you have to stop."

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.188
- Yes!

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:24.390 align:start position:0%
- And then she got a lot of
stuff that I didn't get because

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.325
- Same.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.759
- I was like, "Well, if she's."

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.595 align:start size:97% position:3%
In my mind, because my
older brother also was like,

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:31.197 align:start size:84% position:16%
having trouble finding
a job at the time,

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:32.365
so they were helping him.

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:34.033
And so I became like, okay,

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:36.035
I should be successful on my own

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:38.371 align:start size:94% position:6%
because they're already
helping two of their kids.

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.440
So I need to be the one
that they don't help.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.674
- Yes.

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:43.409
- Which is so stressful
to put on a teenager.

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:44.243
- Yep.

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:47.513 align:start size:84% position:16%
I would always be
the one to take cuts.

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:48.481
- Yes!

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:50.183
- Because I wanted,

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:53.019 align:start size:88% position:13%
I didn't want them to
know that I knew either.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.487
- [Gaby] Yes!

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.688
- Like, I was trying to protect
them from being embarrassed.

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:56.622 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I would go, "It's
fine, I don't need it."

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:57.223
- Exactly, I don't need it.

00:05:57.223 --> 00:05:58.491
- Ugh!

00:05:58.491 --> 00:05:59.058
- And then, but I
really wanted it.

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:00.593
- Yes.

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:02.061
- And I wanted all the things
that my friends were getting.

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:03.730
And you're right,
the transparency.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.165 align:start size:88% position:13%
I didn't understand, how
does my friend afford

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:09.769
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch when her
dad has a similar job to my.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:11.571 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like, I just didn't
understand it.

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:16.409
The transparency thing
is so huge in comedy

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.378
because I think that,
especially for women,

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:22.382
we get paid less than
men a lot of times.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.583
And, as comedians,

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.318 align:start size:88% position:13%
we're all so private
about what we're making,

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:26.953
and I'm like, "No, it
shouldn't be private.

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:28.388
"We should all talk about it

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.890 align:start position:0%
"because we should all be
getting paid the same and more."

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.392
- Yeah.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:34.227
- And I think that when you do
find out what someone makes,

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.462
you realize, "Oh, I need
to be asking for more.

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:37.830
"I deserve more."

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:41.601
- I had an interesting
experience where I was,

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:44.504
me and this girl were both
speaking at a conference.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:49.108 align:start size:97% position:3%
She dm'ed me to be like, "Hey,
what are they paying you?"

00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:50.476 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I was like, "Oh,
that's a great question."

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:51.677
So I told her and she was like,

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:53.546 align:start size:88% position:13%
"Okay, wow, they're
paying me half of that."

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:56.416
So I said, "Oh, go to then
right now, drop my name."

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.850
- [Nikki] Yep.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.519 align:start position:0%
- "Say 'Gaby told me she's
getting this and I want this'."

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.787
- Yeah.

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:01.654
- And then they did,
they upped her fee.

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:02.855
- That's great.

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:05.024 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And I was like,
absolutely, for sure.

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:06.426 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like, everyone
should be doing that.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:10.830 align:start size:97% position:3%
- But people get so
uncomfortable when, you know,

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.466
when they're asked about
how much money they make,

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:14.967
both when they're
not making enough

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:16.436
and when they're
making too much.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
When you're making a lot of
money, I wanna know every cent.

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.041 align:start size:97% position:3%
That's why I always loved
being friends with Amy Schumer

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:24.510
because I realized, 'cause
she was transparent about it.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.179
She wasn't bragging,
she was just like,

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:28.147
"Can you believe
the amount of money

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:29.882
"I'm about to get
for this thing?"

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:32.785
And she would tell me, and
so now I know I have these,

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:35.721 align:start size:97% position:3%
I know what I should be
making at different levels,

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:37.223
- Yes.

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:38.691
- Because I saw her rise
right where I kind of am,

00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:40.293
and so I know what to expect.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.995
And I was appreciative
of her telling me that.

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:46.199
I never took it as brag, even
though some people could have.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.135 align:start size:88% position:13%
But I felt like it was,
it made me excited.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:51.003
- It let you know
your self-worth.

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like, it let you know
what you should ask for.

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:54.941
- Yes, it really did.

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:56.309 line:0%
But I still struggle.

00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:00.513 line:0%
I'm at a point now
where I feel rich.

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:03.382
I feel like I don't want
for anything and I'm great.

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:05.251 align:start size:81% position:19%
But there are days
when I'm like,

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:08.754
I stress about money.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.490
I'll still find ways
to stress about money.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.825
I think it's something I
go to much like my weight,

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:15.061
or my hair, or my skin.

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.829 align:start size:97% position:3%
Where you're just stressing
about something else,

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.464
and you need to find
a place to put it.

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:19.932
And so you put it in your money.

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:22.668 align:start size:97% position:3%
- There's a huge difference
between broke and poor.

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:25.905 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I think I'm
still pretty broke.

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:27.373
- Yeah.

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:30.409 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Like, I think I have
problems with overspending

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:31.644
or I immediately.

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:33.379
My sister had a thing
where she was like,

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:36.315 align:start size:84% position:16%
"I went to the
dentist and my tooth."

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:37.383
Her tooth fell out.

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:38.451
And she's unemployed.

00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:39.685
And so it was gonna cost her,

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:41.854 align:start size:88% position:13%
like a thousand dollars
to get a new tooth.

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:43.322
And I was like,

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:44.590
"Well, you can't be walking
around without a tooth."

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.359
So I was like, she was
upset and I was like,

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.260
"I'll cover it."

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.494
- Yeah.

00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:49.996
- Just stuff like that
where I still do it.

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:51.797
And I have a friend who's
an actress who was like,

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:53.833
"You gotta stop that right now."

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:57.436
'Cause now she knows that she
can just ask you for money.

00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:59.939 align:start size:97% position:3%
But I'm not gonna let her
walk around without a tooth.

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:01.407
- I feel the same way.

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:04.443
I only wanna make more
money because I wanna pay

00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:06.245
for people to get teeth.

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:07.179
- Yeah, exactly!

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:07.914
- That can't afford teeth.

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:09.148
I really do.

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:11.817
I hate the idea
of these expenses

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:13.185
that come up in people's lives.

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:14.487
Like, I've lent.

00:09:14.487 --> 00:09:17.757
Last year I got, my
money guy called me,

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:19.325
and every year I dread the call

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:22.094 align:start size:84% position:16%
of what my spending
was the year.

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.262
- Yeah.

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:24.463 align:start size:84% position:16%
- 'Cause I don't
look at my budgeting,

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:25.698 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't look at what
I spent on what,

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:26.499
and I kind of just
know that he sees it

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:28.200
and is gonna judge me.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.702
And he's like,

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:32.672
"The biggest things you spend
money on are lending people,

00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:33.573
"giving away money."

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:34.774
- Yep.

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:36.042
- And I'm glad, I was
glad to hear that,

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:38.244
'cause I never lent
money and regret.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:40.413
I haven't lent money
yet and regretting it.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.281 align:start size:84% position:16%
I've chosen good
people to do it for.

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:45.318
But, it does feel like.

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:49.889
I get something more
out of it sometimes

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:51.524
than I think the person does.

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.960 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well, what sucks too is
that there's so many medical

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.629
Go-Fund-Mes, and you just
get them all the time.

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:58.030
- Yeah, that's another thing.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.265
- And then.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:09:59.932
- Go-Fund-Mes, I throw
so much money at those.

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.500
- I do too.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.735
And then they're not,

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:03.836 align:start size:81% position:19%
they're considered
personal gifts,

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:05.004 align:start size:84% position:16%
they're not
considered donations,

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:05.938 align:start size:88% position:13%
so you can't write
them off on your taxes.

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:07.039
- What?

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:07.873
Really?

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:08.708
- Yes, it's horrible.

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:09.642
- That's ridiculous.

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:10.910
- Yes.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:11.844
So you can't write
them off on your.

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:13.279
There was an article I just read

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.748 align:start position:0%
that was this girl go some
money for her cancer treatments

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:19.318
and then her taxes ended
up being $19000 on it.

00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:20.319
- Oh my god.

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:21.687
- Right, right.

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:22.455 align:start size:94% position:6%
- So she needs a
Go-Fund-Me for her taxes.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.990
- For her taxes!

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.191
I mean, it's not set up.

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:26.626
Our country's not set up well.

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.995 align:start size:81% position:19%
I don't know if
anyone knows that.

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:30.429
- The like, real like it.
