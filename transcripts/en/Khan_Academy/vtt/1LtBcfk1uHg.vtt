00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.950
Let's do a couple of warm up
problems converting fractions

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.540
to percentages and
then converting

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.240
percentages to fractions.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.960
And then we can do some
actual word problems.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.860
So on our first warm up, let's
convert 5/24 to a percentage.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.710
And the way I like to do it,
I like to convert it to a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.250
decimal first. And once you have
it in the decimal form,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.530
it's pretty straight forward to
convert it to a percentage.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.050
So the way you convert to a
decimal is you divide the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.710
denominator into
the numerator.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.840
This can, literally, be read
as 5 divided by 24.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.430
So let's do a little
bit of division.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.325
24 goes into 5.

00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:42.530
And we're going to have to add
some extra spaces to the 5

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.700
because, obviously, this is
going to be less than 1.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.595
24 is a larger number then 5.

00:00:47.595 --> 00:00:50.260
So let's put our decimal
right there.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.290
And we can now do
some division.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.470
24 goes in to 5 zero times.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.960
0 times 24 is 0.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.690
5 minus 0 is 5.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.690
Bring down this 0 right here.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.430
24 goes into 50.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.400
Well it goes into
that two times.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.460
2 times 24 is-- 2
times 4 is 8.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.220
2 times 2 is 4.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.570
Now we subtract.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.200
50 minus 48 is 2.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.260
Bring down another 0.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.210
We're going to keep
bringing down 0's

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.800
until we have no remainder.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.080
So bring down another 0.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.570
24 goes into 20 zero times.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.840
0 times 24 is 0.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.590
20 minus 0 is 20.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.470
Let's bring down another 0.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.200
Let's bring down another 0.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:58.050
24 goes into 200-- let's
see, eight times?

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.170
It'd be nine times?

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.200
It's 180.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.480
No it'd be eight times,
I believe.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.320
Let's see if eight
times works.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.850
There's always a little
bit of an art to this.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.900
If this is too little, we might
have to increase it.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.860
8 times 4 is 32.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.280
8 times 2 is 16 plus 3 is 19.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.320
No, that was right.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.520
Eight times.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.890
200 minus 192, that's 8.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.370
That is 8.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.620
Bring down another 0.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.690
24 goes into 80 three times.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.850
Can't be four times.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.890
3 times 4 is 12.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:39.600
Carry the 1.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.510
3 times 2 is 6.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.060
Add 170 and then you
have another 80.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.400
You bring down another 0.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.780
We have infinite supply of
0's here as we need them.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.100
And we're going to
have another 80.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.670
Well once again, 24 is going to
go into that three times.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.020
And we're going to start
repeating these 3's over and

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.240
over and over again.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.380
So 5 over 24-- let me
write this down.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.260
5 over 24-- I want
you to understand

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.030
why it keeps repeating.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.250
Every time we do this now,
we're going to get a 3.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.110
And come down, get a 72.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.320
80 from 72, we're going to get
another 80, and we're just

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.430
going to have a big string
of 3's there.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:22.330
So 5 divided by 24 is
0.2083 repeating.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.490
Now, if we want to write this
as a percentage, the word

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.030
percentage-- the word percent.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.910
Let me split it up.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.990
Per cent.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.850
Cent comes from the
word for 100.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.720
This is per 100.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.530
So what is this?

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.750
This is 0.20.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.210
What is this per 100, where
100 is a whole?

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.060
And that might confuse
you or it might not.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.450
But one way you can do this is
this is the same thing as--

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.490
you could do it this way.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.600
This is the same thing.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:01.500
This decimal 0.2083 repeating
is the same thing as 20.83

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.460
repeating over 100.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.010
This is how many we
have per 100%.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:17.579
Or you could say that this is
equal to 20.83% per 100.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.630
These are equivalent.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.110
A very quick way to think about
how to go from decimals

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.060
to percent is you can multiply
by 100, and then put the

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.800
percentage sign.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.100
Or, if you go backwards, you
divide by 100 and get rid of

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.600
the percentage sign.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.500
That was a good warm up.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.330
Let's do one more.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.182
Let's convert a percentage
into a fraction.

00:04:38.182 --> 00:04:39.800
I'll do it in blue.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.620
So let's say we have 16%.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.396
Remember this means
16 per 100.

00:04:46.396 --> 00:04:49.390
So this is the same thing
as 16 per 100.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.830
That's what per cent--
century is 100 years.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.160
There are 100 cents
in a dollar.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.730
So 16 over 100.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.290
Put that in the lowest-- let's
see, you can divide the

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.500
numerator and the denominator
by 4.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.950
We get 4 over 25.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.070
So that's our warm up.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.220
Let's do some actual
problems now.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.770
All right.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.240
They tell us a TV is
advertised on sale.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.800
It is 35% off, and has
a new price of $195.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.630
What was the pre-sale price?

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:31.790
So if x is the pre-sale price,
when you take 35% off of that,

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.850
it has a new price of $195.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:43.260
So x minus 35% of x-- 0.35
is the same thing as 35%.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:49.150
So if I take x and I subtract
35% of x from x, I'm

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.320
going to get $195.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.110
That's what that
is telling me.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.090
So now we just solve for x.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.750
So you can view this
as 1x minus 0.35x.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.250
That will be 0.65x.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.380
So this is 0.65x, right?

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.770
If you add 0.65 and
0.35, you get 1.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.870
1 minus 0.35 is 0.65x
is equal to 195.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.080
And now you can divide both
sides of this equation.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.380
Actually, I like to do it more
as a fraction, so let me write

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.050
it that way.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:35.050
So if you have 65 over 100x is
equal to 195, now we can

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.080
multiply both sides of this
equation by the inverse.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.210
Actually, even before
I do that, let me

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.810
simplify this fraction.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.400
I can divide the numerator
and denominator by 5.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.130
This becomes 13 over 20.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:53.520
So we get 13 over 20x
is equal to 195.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.430
And now we can multiply both
sides by the inverse of this.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:03.990
So 20 over 13 times that is
equal to 195 times 20 over 13.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:12.140
These cancel out, and we get x
is equal to 195 times 20 over

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.600
13, which we could figure out,
but I'll take the calculator

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.520
out for this one.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.850
So let's see.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:26.910
You get 195 times 20 divided
by 13 is equal to $300.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.910
I should have done that-- so
this is equal to-- that right

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.940
there is equal to $300.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.340
So $195 is actually
divisible by 13.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.240
I should be able to do that
without a calculator.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.990
Anyway, so the original
price was $300.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:47.960
You take 35% of $300, which
is $105, and you will

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.080
be left with $195.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.190
So that was our original
price.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.280
Let's do another one.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:02.240
An employee at a store is
currently paid $9.50 per hour.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.090
If she works a full year, she
gets a 12% pay raise.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.510
What will be her new hourly
rate after the raise?

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.050
So today, she makes 9.50.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:18.050
If she works for 12 years,
she'll make 9.50 plus 12%.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:23.170
Let me write this way;
plus 12% times 9.50.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.460
That's how much her
raise will be.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.320
So her new hourly rate will
be this entire thing.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.580
Well, we could view
it this way.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:40.049
This is the same thing as 9.50
plus 0.12 times 9.50.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:42.580
This is the same thing
as 1 times 9.50

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.580
times 0.12 times 9.50.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.140
So this is the same
thing as 1.12.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.430
I'm just adding that.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.630
Let me do this in a
different color.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:59.630
I'm just adding that and that
to get that, times 9.50.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.570
We are growing 9.50 by 12%.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.370
You already have the 9.50
plus another 12%.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:10.470
It's 1.12 times 9.50 is going to
be equal to our new number.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.580
Let me multiply this just to
make up for me using the

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.640
calculator the last time.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:20.550
So 9.50 times 1.12.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.350
2 times 0 is 0.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.430
2 times 5 is 10.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:30.520
2 times 9 is 18 plus 1 is 19.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.540
And I'll put a 0 here.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.740
1 times 0 is 0.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.320
1 times 5 is 5.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.340
1 times 9 is 9.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.020
Let's put two 0's here.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.200
1 times 0 is 0.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.220
1 times 5 is 5.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.260
1 times 9 is 9.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.510
And now we can add.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.990
The 0's add up to 0.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.420
9 plus 5 is 14.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:06.360
2 plus 9 is 11 plus 5 is 16.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.890
1 plus 9 is 10.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.970
And then we count the
number of decimals.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:15.120
We have one, two, three, four
numbers behind the decimals.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.000
So in our answer, we have to
have one, two, three, four

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.640
numbers behind the decimal.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:27.110
So her new salary will
be $10.64 per hour.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.530
$10.64.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.770
You don't have to write those
trailing 0's right there.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:36.970
So this is her new hourly
rate after the raise.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:37.360
All right.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.610
Let's do one more.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.630
Store A and store B
both sell bikes.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.090
And both buy bikes
from the same

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.950
supplier at the same price.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:51.440
Store A has a 40% mark-up.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.820
That means whatever they buy the
bike for, they sell it for

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.200
40% above that.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:03.070
While store B has
a 250% markup.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.940
Store B has a permanent sale,
and always will sell at 60%

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.400
off those prices.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.880
Which store has a better deal?

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.470
So let's say that they're both
buying the bikes, so x is

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.443
equal to the price
from supplier.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.850
So that's the price that
both bike stores buy

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.070
their bicycles at.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.980
They both buy bikes from the
supplier at the same price.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.420
That's this x that I'm going
to start off with.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.120
Now lets do the scenario
of store A.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.700
What does store A sell
their bike for?

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:43.930
They sell the bike for x plus
40% of x, which is equal to

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.690
1.4 times x.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.720
That's how much store A
sells their bike for.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.810
Now store B is a little
bit more interesting.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:58.320
Store B-- so they have
a 250% markup.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.070
Well, they claim to sell their
bike for x plus 250%.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:08.020
That's the same thing
as 2.5 times x.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.450
A 100% markup would literally
mean another x.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.785
This is 250%.

00:12:12.785 --> 00:12:16.280
And as we said, you can
just divide by 100.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.400
You get 2.5.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.930
Get rid of the percentage
sign.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:24.780
So they sell it x plus 2.5x,
which is equal to 3.5x.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.620
That's kind of their
ticket price.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.380
But then, they sell at
60% off those prices.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.290
So then they take 60% off of
this price right here.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:40.200
So the real selling price is
going to be 3.5 times the

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.560
price from the supplier
minus 0.6.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.250
Minus 0.6.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.450
Minus 60% of this price.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.700
Of 3.5x.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:56.860
And we could view this
as 1 times 3.5x

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.480
minus 0.6 times 3.5X.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:09.300
And that's the same thing as
1 minus 0.6 times 3.5x.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.590
This is going to be 0.4.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.185
This is 0.4.

00:13:14.185 --> 00:13:17.390
So if you're taking 60% off,
it's the equivalent of selling

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.780
it at 40% of the ticket price.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:20.790
That's what we're doing
right there.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.660
You might, eventually, do this
in your head-- immediately

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.500
say, oh, 60% off is the same
thing as selling at 40%, or

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.300
selling at 0.4 of the price.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.250
3.5x.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:33.320
And let's multiply that out.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:41.390
So if we take 3.5x times
0.4, 4 times 5 is 20.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.882
4 times 3 is 12 plus 2 is 14.

00:13:44.882 --> 00:13:50.230
And we have one, two numbers
behind the decimal spot.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.940
Two numbers.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.070
One, two.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.890
1.4.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.555
So they're going to
sell it at 1.4x.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.620
So in either store, you
actually going to

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.000
pay the same price.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.450
Let's say they buy the bikes
from the supplier at $100.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.180
Then at store A, you're going to
pay $140 for that bike, and

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.980
in store B, you're going to
spend $140 for that bike.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.360
But in store B, you think
you're getting 60% off.
