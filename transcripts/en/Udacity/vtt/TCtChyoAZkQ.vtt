00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.918
We definitely don't want to conduct that many t-tests but we can use the same

00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:09.291
ideas underlying t-tests to compare three or more samples. Remember with

00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:13.507
t-tests, the decision of whether or not two samples are significantly different

00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:18.986
is a function of the distance that they are apart from each other. And the

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:23.896
variability of each sample, which we call the standard error. Remember that we

00:00:23.896 --> 00:00:28.717
found this with the pooled variance. When we compare three or more samples, we

00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:33.546
can do almost the same thing. We have some kind of distance or variability

00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:38.943
between means in the numerator, and some kind of error in the denominator.

00:00:38.943 --> 00:00:43.194
Let's focus on the numerator for a sec. How can we compare three or more

00:00:43.194 --> 00:00:48.319
samples? Read each of these options carefully, and as a hint, think back to how

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:54.271
you learned to calculate the standard deviation in lesson four. And the

00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:58.957
rationale for using the standard deviation as the measure of variability for a

00:00:58.957 --> 00:01:04.282
sample. Also, in this case, total mean is the mean of all values in all the

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:05.915
samples.
