00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Instructor] In the
first years of interaction

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.510
between Native Americans and Europeans,

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.480
there were a lot of aspects
of each other's cultures

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.020
that each group found,
well, just plain weird.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.960
Europeans and Native
Americans looked, dressed,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.000
and thought differently
in fundamental ways

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.240
that lead to misunderstandings

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.550
and even violence between them.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.550
So let's take some time
to compare some ways

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.730
in which Native American
cultural ideas differed

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.940
from European cultural ideas.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.000
So how is it possible to
make a direct comparison

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.830
between Native American
cultures and European cultures?

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.310
One way is to choose a few categories

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.650
of social interaction and belief

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.340
and identify how each
group conceived of them.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.340
Here, I've chosen ideas about
land and property ownership,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.210
gender roles, and religion
as areas to compare.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.080
Now before we start, I wanna
put a big asterisk here

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.000
and say that these are generalizations,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.360
just as the English,
French, Spanish, Dutch

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.730
didn't have all exactly the same religion

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.660
or a concept of proper gender roles.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.100
The Algonquians, Iroquois, Pueblos,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.370
and Mississippians
weren't identical either,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.520
but there were some similarities
among European groups

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.800
and among Native American
groups that allow us

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.610
to compare and contrast them more broadly.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.670
So let's start identifying
these differences

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.910
and exploring what
effect they may have had

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.160
on how the two groups
perceived and interacted

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.250
with each other.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.680
One major difference between
Europeans and Native Americans

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.700
was in their ideas about land ownership.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.040
To Europeans, land was
owned by individuals

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.120
and passed down through families.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.010
They had the right to
fence off a plot of land

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.530
and prevent trespassing.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.070
For Native Americans, land
ownership was less defined

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.860
and more temporary.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.800
One tribe might claim
control of a hunting range

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.410
or one family might farm a
plot of land for a season

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.410
but they didn't own it forever.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.220
Most land was free for everyone to use

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.260
but not to own.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.080
So when Europeans arrived,
Native Americans might agree

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.920
to let them farm and
hunt in their territories

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.360
but they didn't expect that
Europeans would then fence off

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.050
that land and prevent
others from using it.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.640
Likewise, Europeans were
confused when Native Americans

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.620
continued to use land that they thought

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.150
they had purchased to own forever.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.500
Native Americans also tended to have

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.370
a more communal approach
to property and trade.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.220
To them, trading
relationship were important

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.150
and they require a lot of
feasting and gift giving

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.870
to cement ties between tribes.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.900
Europeans were frequently
frustrated by the amount

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.140
of pomp and circumstance
Native Americans demanded

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.740
to complete what they saw as
a simple business transaction.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.820
Partly, this had to do
with how Native Americans

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.350
viewed property in general.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.600
While Europeans gained
high status in society

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.780
by owning a lot of things
and therefore being rich,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.880
Native Americans achieved
high status by giving

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.810
a lot of things away, being a
source of riches for others.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.300
So unlike in Europe where
there were huge gaps

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.170
between the rich and the poor,
Native American societies

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.431
were comparatively egalitarian.

00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:30.810
It was pretty rare for
someone to go hungry

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.930
if their neighbor had food to spare.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.440
Europeans couldn't tell
if Native Americans

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.870
were just naturally generous, kind people

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.090
or if they maybe just didn't
get how business worked

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.920
and to Native Americans,
Europeans seemed greedy

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.470
and selfish, allowing others
to starve and do without

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.860
so that they could enrich themselves.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.420
Differences in gender roles
also confused the groups.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.660
In European societies, men
were the heads of household

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.610
and they were in charge of outdoor labor.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.500
Women took care of the
home but they also have

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.650
relatively few rights.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.690
They couldn't participate politically,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.260
own property, or get divorced.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.280
In Native American societies,
men hunted and fished

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.940
and conducted warfare which often meant

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.140
that they were away from
home for weeks or months.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.940
Consequently, women did the farming

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.160
since they were home to tend the crops.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.970
Native women also had a lot more freedom

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.140
than European women.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.280
They could get divorced, they could give

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.230
political advice to councils.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.180
Many Native American
societies were matrilineal

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.860
so children belonged to
their mother's family

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.070
rather than their father's
and when a couple got married,

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.370
the man moved in with his wife's family,

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.850
not the other way around.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.860
To Europeans, gender
roles in Native society

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.880
almost seemed like they
were flipped upside down

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.130
and they took this as evidence

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.370
that Native people were uncivilized.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.940
To Native Americans, it
looked like Europeans

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.110
could barely care for themselves.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.740
They had to be taught
how to farm, how to fish,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.820
even how to hunt effectively
in the new world.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.880
Finally, Native and European
religious practices differ,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.330
at least, on the surface.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.150
Native Americans tended to believe

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.250
that one great creator had made the world

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.460
and that nature was imbued with spirits

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.390
who would reward or punish them based

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.240
on how well they took care of the land.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.640
In fact, this actually
wasn't that much different

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.210
from the Catholicism of Europeans

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.220
who believed in a single god
but also many helpful saints.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.450
But where they differed
was in exclusivity.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.570
When Europeans introduced
them to Jesus and Mary

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.160
and the saints, many
Native Americans were happy

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.800
to include them in their
pantheon of helpful spirits.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.420
But this angered Europeans who insisted

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.810
on exclusive worship of the Christian god.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.370
All of this differences
lead to fraught interactions

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.580
between Europeans and Native Americans.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.680
But despite these
differences, they also adopted

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.940
many useful aspects of each
other's culture over time

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.110
especially in terms of trade.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.970
Native Americans were
keen to get their hands

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.630
on the metal implements
for cooking and farming

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.120
and hunting that Europeans possessed

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.470
as well as guns and
horses which were great

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.920
for transportation and
also for making war.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.000
Europeans were also willing to take part

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.450
in the social rituals and trading rituals

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.520
of Native Americans,
sometimes even marrying

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.630
into Native American families
so they could get access

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.980
to furs hunted by Native Americans

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.200
and to Native Americans as allies

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.460
in their wars against
rival European powers

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.520
and the Americas.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.660
So as we wrap up, I encourage you

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.930
to take a closer look at this chart.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.920
Is there anything you find
particularly surprising

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.270
about these differences?

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.250
Where do you think that
Europeans and Native Americans

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.930
were most likely to find
common ground between them?

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.870
And lastly, which of
these cultural aspects

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.200
do you think was the most
significant difference

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.543
between Europeans and
Native Americans and why?
