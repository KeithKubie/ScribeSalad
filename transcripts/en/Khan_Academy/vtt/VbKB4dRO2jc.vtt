00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:01.925
- [Instructor] In the
last video we discussed

00:00:01.925 --> 00:00:04.978
Christopher Columbus'
attempt to find the funding

00:00:04.978 --> 00:00:09.518
to find a western route
around the world to China

00:00:09.518 --> 00:00:11.119
and the East,

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:13.393
and how, although he didn't find that,

00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:16.810
in October of 1492, he
landed in the Caribbean

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.735
where he met the indigenous
people living there,

00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:20.652
the Tainos.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.265
So who were the Tainos?

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:25.556
So we know a little bit about them.

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:29.723
They were one of the indigenous
peoples in the Caribbean.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.744
This is a woodcut that
depicts people in the region

00:00:36.744 --> 00:00:38.037
made a little bit later,

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:40.394
so they may have looked
something like this.

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:43.671
And they were adept at fishing.

00:00:43.671 --> 00:00:46.245
We know that they were
probably matrilineal,

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:49.412
that is they traced their family lines

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.363
through the women, not the men.

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:57.399
We know that they were
very generous people.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.376
Columbus repeatedly describes

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:03.118
how people would really give
you anything that you asked for

00:01:03.118 --> 00:01:05.350
We also know religiously
that they worshiped

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.850
ancestor spirits called Zemis.

00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:12.329
And this is a statue of one of those

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.558
ancestor spirits that we still have today.

00:01:14.558 --> 00:01:17.132
Another thing I think is
really cool about the Tainos

00:01:17.132 --> 00:01:19.365
is that we still use some of their words

00:01:19.365 --> 00:01:20.784
in everyday language

00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:22.559
that were borrowed by the Spanish

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:24.407
and then came into English.

00:01:24.407 --> 00:01:28.240
So barbecue for example,
they called barbacoa.

00:01:29.413 --> 00:01:32.080
Hurricanes, they called huracan.

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.846
Tobacco was one of their
words for the plant

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.940
that will become so popular.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.436
Even the name of the island
itself, they called it Ayiti,

00:01:45.436 --> 00:01:49.603
which is still preserved
today in the nation of Haiti.

00:01:51.442 --> 00:01:53.436
So Columbus sailed around the Caribbean

00:01:53.436 --> 00:01:56.142
and then he made his way back to Europe.

00:01:56.142 --> 00:01:58.225
He left behind him 39 men

00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:04.435
whose ship had run aground
so they built a fort

00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:06.946
and when he arrived in Europe,

00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:10.220
he immediately wrote a letter
to the finance minister

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.094
to Ferdinand and Isabella,
Louis de Saint Angel.

00:02:13.094 --> 00:02:16.031
So let's look a little bit
more closely at what he wrote.

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:17.634
As I know you will be rejoiced
at the glorious success

00:02:17.634 --> 00:02:20.666
that our Lord has given me and my voyage,

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:23.239
I write this to tell you how in 33 days

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.852
I sailed to the Indies

00:02:24.852 --> 00:02:26.852
with the fleet that the
illustrious King and Queen,

00:02:26.852 --> 00:02:28.571
our Sovereigns, gave me,

00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:30.638
where I discovered a great many islands,

00:02:30.638 --> 00:02:32.494
inhabited by numberless people,

00:02:32.494 --> 00:02:35.080
and of all I have taken
possession for their Highnesses

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.422
by proclamation and display

00:02:37.422 --> 00:02:39.362
of the Royal Standard without opposition.

00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:41.757
To the first island I gave
the name of San Salvador,

00:02:41.757 --> 00:02:44.187
in commemoration of his divine majesty.

00:02:44.187 --> 00:02:47.136
The second I named the island
of Santa Maria de Concepcion,

00:02:47.136 --> 00:02:50.410
the third, Fernandina,
the fourth, Isabella,

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.705
the fifth, Juana,

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:53.056
and I found it so extensive

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:54.832
that I thought it might be the mainland,

00:02:54.832 --> 00:02:56.440
the province of Cathay.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.509
This is really interesting
because you can tell a lot

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:00.630
about what Columbus is thinking here.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.690
First he says that he's taken
possession of these islands

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.801
by proclamation and display
of the royal standard

00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:09.458
without opposition.

00:03:09.458 --> 00:03:11.489
And I love this image of Columbus,

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.675
he's reading in Spanish the proclamation,

00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:17.411
I claim this land in the name of Spain,

00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:19.427
and he's not opposed because the Tainos

00:03:19.427 --> 00:03:21.141
have no idea what he's saying.

00:03:21.141 --> 00:03:23.425
We can also see his
religious motivations here

00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:26.086
as he names the first islands after

00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:28.030
San Salvador, the savior, Jesus,

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.559
Santa Maria de Concepcion,
the Virgin Mary,

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:33.684
and that he's trying to win some points

00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:37.348
with Ferdinand and Isabella
by naming islands after them.

00:03:37.348 --> 00:03:39.293
We can also see here that Columbus thinks

00:03:39.293 --> 00:03:41.634
that he's found China, he says.

00:03:41.634 --> 00:03:43.091
He thought it might be the mainland,

00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:44.690
the province of Cathay,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.381
and Cathay is an old word meaning China.

00:03:48.381 --> 00:03:49.640
So let's read on, he says,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.400
I began fortifications there

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.595
which should be completed by this time,

00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:55.792
and I have left in it
men enough to hold it,

00:03:55.792 --> 00:03:58.754
with arms, artillery, and
provisions for more than a year,

00:03:58.754 --> 00:03:59.966
and a boat with a master seaman

00:03:59.966 --> 00:04:02.555
skilled in the arts
necessary to make others.

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:04.734
I am so friendly with
the king of that country

00:04:04.734 --> 00:04:06.185
that he was proud to call me his brother

00:04:06.185 --> 00:04:08.113
and hold me as such,

00:04:08.113 --> 00:04:11.586
Even should he change his
mind and wish to quarrel,

00:04:11.586 --> 00:04:14.618
neither he nor his subjects
know what arms are,

00:04:14.618 --> 00:04:16.741
nor wear clothes, as I have said.

00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:18.737
They're the most timid people in the world

00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:20.966
so that only the men remaining there

00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:22.838
could destroy the whole region.

00:04:22.838 --> 00:04:24.007
So he's kind of saying that

00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:26.367
we're getting along with the natives,

00:04:26.367 --> 00:04:29.534
but if we don't, they're not a threat.

00:04:31.276 --> 00:04:32.335
And he finishes by saying,

00:04:32.335 --> 00:04:34.894
to speak, in conclusion,
only of what has been done

00:04:34.894 --> 00:04:36.422
during this hurried voyage,

00:04:36.422 --> 00:04:38.311
their Highnesses will
see that I can give them

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.308
as much gold as they desire,

00:04:40.308 --> 00:04:42.053
if they will give me a little assistance,

00:04:42.053 --> 00:04:44.428
spices, cotton, as much
as their Highnesses

00:04:44.428 --> 00:04:46.378
may command to be shipped,

00:04:46.378 --> 00:04:48.840
and as many slaves as the choose
to send for, all heathens.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.682
So Columbus is finishing by saying,

00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:54.093
well this exploratory voyage has shown

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:57.464
that we can get a lot out
of colonizing this area.

00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.757
We can get gold, spices, cottons, slaves,

00:05:00.757 --> 00:05:03.283
and so if you'll give
me a little assistance,

00:05:03.283 --> 00:05:07.130
that is, give me more resources
to continue my mission,

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.690
Spain will get very wealthy
indeed from this new land.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.772
And that is exactly what
Ferdinand and Isabella do.

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:17.828
So they send him on a
second voyage in 1493.

00:05:17.828 --> 00:05:21.995
And this time they send him
with 1200 men and 17 ships,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.216
and they bring with them livestock,

00:05:31.216 --> 00:05:34.799
horses, cattle, pigs,
and sugar cane plants

00:05:35.907 --> 00:05:38.122
so they can turn this into a plantation.

00:05:38.122 --> 00:05:40.714
So they really intend
to use this settlement

00:05:40.714 --> 00:05:44.366
as not only a place to
try out growing crops

00:05:44.366 --> 00:05:46.484
and also mining for gold,

00:05:46.484 --> 00:05:48.787
they also see it as kind
of a jumping off place

00:05:48.787 --> 00:05:51.908
that they can use for further
exploration in this area.

00:05:51.908 --> 00:05:53.775
Because the Portuguese were so dominant

00:05:53.775 --> 00:05:56.744
in this early phase of colonialism,

00:05:56.744 --> 00:05:59.382
the Spanish are nervous
that the Portuguese

00:05:59.382 --> 00:06:01.977
are going to try to make inroads into

00:06:01.977 --> 00:06:04.731
their new acquisitions in the west.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.457
So with the help of the pope,

00:06:06.457 --> 00:06:10.040
they negotiate what's called
the Treaty of Tordesillas,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.707
dividing the world between them.

00:06:14.475 --> 00:06:16.642
So east of this line here,

00:06:17.517 --> 00:06:20.668
this will be Portugal's area of the world.

00:06:20.668 --> 00:06:23.835
And west of this line will be Spain's.

00:06:25.995 --> 00:06:29.302
Remember that Portugal had
lots of interests in Africa

00:06:29.302 --> 00:06:32.310
which they thought were much
more valuable at this time.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.213
But it was later discovered
that part of South America

00:06:36.213 --> 00:06:39.275
fell on Portugal's side of the line,

00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:43.578
and you'll recognize that
as being today, Brazil,

00:06:43.578 --> 00:06:45.304
which became a Portuguese colony

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:47.680
and even today speaks Portuguese.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.614
Now of course, they didn't
ask anybody else's permission

00:06:50.614 --> 00:06:52.904
to divide the world between them.

00:06:52.904 --> 00:06:55.343
They didn't ask the native
people of the Americas,

00:06:55.343 --> 00:06:57.538
they didn't ask anybody else in Europe,

00:06:57.538 --> 00:06:58.888
but it's important to understand

00:06:58.888 --> 00:07:02.503
that Spain thought of this area
as their sovereign territory

00:07:02.503 --> 00:07:04.065
and from this point forward,

00:07:04.065 --> 00:07:08.276
Spain will continue to send
what are called conquistadors,

00:07:08.276 --> 00:07:10.526
conquerors, to this region,

00:07:12.538 --> 00:07:14.121
Mexico and Florida,

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:20.320
and South America,

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.968
and from all of this they
will become very wealthy

00:07:22.968 --> 00:07:24.407
as a nation.

00:07:24.407 --> 00:07:28.001
So I just wanna finish by contrasting how

00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:31.357
Columbus' voyage affected the
native people of the Caribbean

00:07:31.357 --> 00:07:33.122
with how it affected Europe.

00:07:33.122 --> 00:07:37.485
So Columbus was not very
nice to the natives, in fact.

00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:41.132
He originally attempted to
enslave the native people,

00:07:41.132 --> 00:07:44.215
and send them back to Europe for sale

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.800
to continue to underwrite his ventures.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.212
But they were susceptible
to European diseases

00:07:52.212 --> 00:07:53.629
and quickly died.

00:07:54.931 --> 00:07:57.051
So he had to take another tack

00:07:57.051 --> 00:08:00.939
and that was by forcing the native people

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.022
to labor for the Spanish,

00:08:03.926 --> 00:08:06.093
particularly to mine gold.

00:08:06.934 --> 00:08:08.985
And not long after Columbus returned,

00:08:08.985 --> 00:08:12.985
he put a quota for all
people over the age of 14

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:20.034
that they had to give him a
certain amount of gold per month

00:08:20.034 --> 00:08:23.270
or they would have
their hands chopped off.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.145
And this is an engraving of

00:08:26.145 --> 00:08:28.900
what the Spanish were
imagined to have been like

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.055
in the New World.

00:08:30.055 --> 00:08:32.964
You can say that they're
feeding children to dogs here.

00:08:32.964 --> 00:08:34.489
They were not quite as bad as this,

00:08:34.489 --> 00:08:36.824
but they were still pretty bad.

00:08:36.824 --> 00:08:38.711
Historians estimate that there were about

00:08:38.711 --> 00:08:42.878
one to three million Tainos
living in the Caribbean

00:08:44.934 --> 00:08:46.555
when the Spanish arrived.

00:08:46.555 --> 00:08:49.888
By 100 years later, there were 200 left.

00:08:50.782 --> 00:08:52.615
Not 200 thousand, 200.

00:08:53.932 --> 00:08:56.265
And mostly this was due to disease,

00:08:56.265 --> 00:08:57.763
and we'll talk more in the next video

00:08:57.763 --> 00:09:01.230
about why native people
seemed to be so susceptible

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.565
to European diseases,

00:09:02.565 --> 00:09:06.732
but it was also due to
overwork and poor treatment.

00:09:07.882 --> 00:09:09.481
They were forced to mine

00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:12.524
when they should have been growing crops

00:09:12.524 --> 00:09:15.236
and many of them were
murdered by the Spanish

00:09:15.236 --> 00:09:17.020
for one reason or another.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.911
So for the people of the Caribbean,

00:09:18.911 --> 00:09:23.025
Columbus' arrival was
really a catastrophe.

00:09:23.025 --> 00:09:26.807
In Europe however, the New
World made Spain very rich.

00:09:26.807 --> 00:09:30.140
And the gold and silver being brought in

00:09:31.157 --> 00:09:33.656
from the New World to Spain

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:36.141
may actually have increased prices

00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:39.415
in the one hundred years
following Columbus' voyage

00:09:39.415 --> 00:09:42.415
by 500 to 600% due to inflation

00:09:45.654 --> 00:09:48.572
thanks to gold from the New World.

00:09:48.572 --> 00:09:51.013
Some historians even think that

00:09:51.013 --> 00:09:53.281
the influx of all this new wealth

00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:55.914
led to the creation of
the modern banking system

00:09:55.914 --> 00:09:57.164
to deal with it

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:04.230
and could even have been
the forbearer of capitalism.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.516
So Columbus' voyage really opened up

00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:08.765
a whole new world,

00:10:08.765 --> 00:10:10.313
not just to the people in the Americas,

00:10:10.313 --> 00:10:12.183
but also to the people in Europe.

00:10:12.183 --> 00:10:15.294
He started a process,
the Columbian exchange,

00:10:15.294 --> 00:10:17.531
and we'll talk more about
that in the next video.
