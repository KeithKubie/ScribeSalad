RYAN LOREN: All
right, everybody.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.070
We're here to welcome
Gordon Chambers.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.070
I'm so happy to have you here.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.950
It's been a long time coming.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.880
And Gordon, for those
of you who don't know,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.790
is probably one of the
best writers in existence.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.695
That's just one man's
opinion, but that's mine.

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:23.320
And so I'm going to talk to you
a little bit about your writing

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.040
process and all of that.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.800
But first, can you take
us back to the beginnings

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.810
and how you got started?

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.860
I know you've had
quite a background,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.520
and just take us back.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.070
GORDON CHAMBERS: It
began-- it was all a dream.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.512
I used to read
"Word Up" magazines.

00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:43.470
Give love to Brooklyn
and Biggie Smalls, y'all.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.386
Brooklyn in the house?

00:00:44.386 --> 00:00:45.255
AUDIENCE: Brooklyn!

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:46.630
GORDON CHAMBERS:
But I have lived

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.410
in Brooklyn for the
last 15 years or so.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.550
But I was born in
the Bronx, but raised

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.570
in a wonderful community
called Teaneck, NJ.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.910
And I think some
Teaneck people are here.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.270
And I'm grateful for
my town, because it

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.630
was a town where there
were just a wonderful group

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.260
of supportive parents, my
parents, and music teachers.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.590
And when I was in sixth
grade, I was writing songs.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.290
I was given an assignment
to write a short story

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.740
about the book "Jonathan
Livingston Seagull."

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.117
And being the Libra
creative person that I am,

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:18.700
I said well, instead of writing
a short story, I wrote a song.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.870
And I showed the
teacher the song.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.060
And she said, well,
that's a really good song.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.990
She said, why don't we teach
this to all the sixth graders?

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.840
And so she taught to
all the sixth graders.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.381
And it was performed
in a sixth grade

00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:29.620
assembly for all the kids.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.220
And then later on
in high school,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.500
I continued writing songs.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.208
And one of my best
friends in high school

00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:35.475
was murdered by her boyfriend.

00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:38.080
Donyel Morton-- may
she ever rest in peace.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.720
And after she passed, I
needed to do something

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.080
to process my feelings.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.940
And I wrote a song
called "Always Be There."

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.065
And once again, I showed
it to some of the teachers

00:01:49.065 --> 00:01:51.530
at the school, and they
were very moved by the song.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.960
And I shared it
with her parents.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.600
And one of the teachers
was a dance choreographer

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.140
at the school, Ms.
Miller-- and she

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.130
said, I'm going to choreograph
something to this song,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.760
so that this will forever live
in the Teaneck Terpsichoreans

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.529
repertoire.

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:06.820
So she choreographed something.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.070
And then other
students came forward.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.940
We'll do a poem.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.106
And then we'll do something.

00:02:10.106 --> 00:02:12.700
So the birth of that song
created a whole evening

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.790
where 2,000 people
came to just give

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.550
creative remembrances of Donyel.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.030
So I really felt like
God had chosen me

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.300
as a child to provide
songs that could inspire

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.440
and that could heal.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.140
And so after that,
I went to college.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.210
I went to Brown University,
kept on writing.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.160
Then I took a job at
"Essence" magazine

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.734
and became the entertainment
editor of "Essence."

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:38.650
And I served in that
position for seven years.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.890
And that was a great
networking place.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.580
And so while I was
there hanging out,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.910
I met a wonderful
lady, Phyllis Hyman,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.640
AUDIENCE: Oooh.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.830
GORDON CHAMBERS: Who's
also-- may she rest in peace.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.300
And she took me under her wing.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.730
And I also met Queen Latifah.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.440
And so Queen Latifah
and Phyllis Hyman

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.880
were the first two superstars
who not only became friends

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.417
but mentors and had me write
on some of their albums.

00:02:57.417 --> 00:02:59.750
And then I met other people
like producers Barry Eastman

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.590
and Dave Hall and
then started writing

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.217
some of the songs that became
number one hits and sold

00:03:06.217 --> 00:03:07.050
millions of records.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.580
God is good.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.830
So some of those songs include
Anita Baker's "I Apologize,"

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.130
Brown Stones' "If
You Love Me, Say It,"

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.580
the theme from "Set It Off,"
"Missing You" by Brandy, Tamia,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.100
Gladys Knight and Chaka Khan,
as well as cuts for Whitney

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.690
Houston, Tamia, Brandy,
Gladys Knight, Marc Anthony,

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.310
Patti LaBelle, Chaka Khan, Chaka
Khan and 75 recording artists.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.690
Thank you, Lord.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.600
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.910
I am curious about this.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.835
And I ask other artists too, but
can you talk about the process

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:43.260
you use to write
and how it happens.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.750
Is it different every time?

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.830
Do you create conditions
that make it happen?

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.000
Or what do you do?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.370
GORDON CHAMBERS: I have
different writing process.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.495
It just depends what it is.

00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:53.450
I mean, some songs of
mine, I write at the piano,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.940
and they tend to
be more ballads.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.890
But a lot of times,
collaborations

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.780
are about opposites attracting.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.150
So a lot of my songs
have been written

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.150
with producers that were
quote unquote "beat guys."

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.600
But the producers that I
got a chance to work with

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.090
were more than just beat people.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.880
Stevie J and Dave
Hall-- these are

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.320
guys who had real fabulous
musicianship on top

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.970
of their beats.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.435
But they had hard beats.

00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:21.620
They knew how to knock
their heads in the studio.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.250
My glasses are falling off.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.749
But it was like
I was the man who

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:26.290
would come in with
the melody on top,

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.873
and they would have
the beat knocking.

00:04:27.873 --> 00:04:30.271
And that's how you had that
great opposites attract

00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:30.770
of music.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.000
So sometimes, it was a situation
of being given a great track.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.020
You know that "If You
Love Me" was a track

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.390
that Dave Hall presented me.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.630
And he gave it to me on a CD.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.950
And one morning--
I'm Jamaican-- so

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.449
know Jamaicans are
notoriously late.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.010
I was on time today.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.920
But Jamaicans are
notoriously late.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.340
So one day I was on
my way late to my job

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.050
at "Essence" magazine,
I swear to God.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.424
It just started to pour rain
as I was thinking about what

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.510
lie I could call Susan
Taylor with and tell her

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.540
I was going to be late.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.040
Because I had every
lie in the book.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.150
The cat, the grandmother
died, the this, the that,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.860
blah blah blah.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.000
So what lie can I tell?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.124
And I swear, God was like
don't tell any more lies.

00:05:02.124 --> 00:05:03.820
Because the rain
started pouring down.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.090
I popped Dave Hall's track
into the CD player of my car.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.407
And all I heard
were those chords

00:05:09.407 --> 00:05:11.990
and the words-- the first line
of "If You Love Me" came to me.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.900
"I don't want to rain on this
parade" inspired by the rain,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.960
as I was late to work.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.420
So songs can come anywhere.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.520
I've literally had songs hit me.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.900
One day, I was
getting a haircut.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.120
I was in the barber shop.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.040
And just this idea came to me.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.920
And the barber
scratched my head,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.860
because I was like, I
need-- I need a pen.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.880
He's like I'm about to cut you!

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.700
And he really did cut me,
with the barber thing.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.790
But that was when the words to
a song that I wrote for Brandy

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.650
called "One Voice," they
came to me immediately.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.631
So I think being a songwriter
is about being open,

00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:44.630
having something to say.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.514
But it's also
being very attuned.

00:05:46.514 --> 00:05:47.930
It takes being a
sensitive person.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.690
You have to be in touch
with your emotions.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.712
You can't be the alpha male
to be a great songwriter.

00:05:53.712 --> 00:05:55.420
You really have to be
the sensitive male.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.720
You have to know what you feel
and be able to articulate it,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.572
because the women audience,
they get it right away.

00:06:02.572 --> 00:06:05.030
But it's interesting, since
I've become a performer and not

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.696
just a songwriter, I have found
that my songs now-- especially

00:06:07.696 --> 00:06:09.070
the songs on my
solo albums-- are

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.979
speaking to the men
very poignantly.

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.020
A lot of the men have told
me that buy my records

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.145
and they go to my concerts.

00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:16.010
They said, thank you
for saying for me

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.420
what I didn't have the
emotional sensitivity

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.270
and that kind of courage to say.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.615
So it's about being open.

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:22.310
RYAN LOREN: Great, thanks.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.018
Thanks very much.

00:06:23.018 --> 00:06:24.849
So can you talk
about-- obviously,

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:25.890
you're not just a writer.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.300
You're also a performer,
singer, artist.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.940
So what was the critical point
where you decided all right,

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.077
I'm going to do this.

00:06:34.077 --> 00:06:36.410
GORDON CHAMBERS: It had been
in my mind for a long time.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.210
Because I was in the
studio all the time

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.445
writing songs for
other artists, people

00:06:40.445 --> 00:06:42.570
don't realize that I sang
all of those songs first.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.870
I did the demo
for "I Apologize."

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.960
I did the demo
for "Missing You."

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.120
I did the demo for
"If You Love Me."

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.804
So the artists who
record the songs

00:06:47.804 --> 00:06:49.220
were always listening
to my voice.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.790
I would lay the lead vocals
and the background vocals.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.776
So I always in the
studios recording.

00:06:53.776 --> 00:06:55.150
And I knew how to
record and then

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.191
in my years as entertainment
editor at "Essence,"

00:06:57.191 --> 00:06:58.780
I was going to all the concerts.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.500
I've seen everyone in concert.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.630
And I was going backstage.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.340
I was hanging out
with the artist,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.400
interviewing the artist.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.980
So I was having the
best artist development

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.170
that one could ever have,
because I was seeing it

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.240
on the side of a journalist.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.280
So I was really learning
about the business,

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.450
but then there was the fear.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.230
I was like afraid to step
from one side to the other.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.900
And it was something I wanted to
do, but I was afraid to do it.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.770
And then sometimes you
just have to be open

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.120
and ask people for help.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.960
And what happened was
I started to-- not

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.260
get afraid of making the
music, but afraid of asking

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.986
the very people
around me to help me,

00:07:29.986 --> 00:07:32.360
because I knew that I didn't
have tons and tons of money,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.710
but I wanted to make
a quality project.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.390
But the day that
changed my life was I

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.440
was in the studio producing the
late and great Whitney Houston.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.990
And I was producing
a song for her,

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.180
and I told her that I wanted
her to hit a certain note.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.060
Then I kept telling her to
hit it higher and higher.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.518
And then she looked
me in the face,

00:07:48.518 --> 00:07:50.484
she said, "I think you
want to do what I do

00:07:50.484 --> 00:07:51.900
and if that's what
you want to do,

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.275
then that's what
you need to do."

00:07:53.275 --> 00:07:55.142
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:57.600
GORDON CHAMBERS: And I looked
at her like what did she say.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.865
She was really in my face too.

00:07:58.865 --> 00:08:00.240
And I was like
she's from Newark,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.739
so when she's get
in your face, it's

00:08:01.739 --> 00:08:06.312
kind of-- so the Newark came on
and the Brooklyn stepped back.

00:08:06.312 --> 00:08:07.770
And I said, well,
what do you mean?

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.020
She said, I think
you want to sing.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:09.940
And if that's what
you want to do,

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.770
then that's what
you should be doing.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.560
And it was like
one of those times

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.550
when an angel speaks Word into
your life and you feel it.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.010
And it penetrates your heart.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.380
So shortly after that, I went to
church, the Sunday after that,

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.780
and the minister, my
minister, Pastor Trufant

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.590
in Emmanuel Baptist
Church in Brooklyn,

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.930
gave a sermon about
how not to wait.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.679
Now is your time,
whatever you want to do.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.510
And he talked about
how Jesus died at 36.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.539
And many of the miracles
that you read about

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.780
were done in the last
three years of his life.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.039
So he said, don't
wait if there's

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.080
something you want to do.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.240
And so after Whitney
preached to me in the studio

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.096
and then Pastor Trufant preached
to me, then I said it's time.

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:51.220
The universe is telling me.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.159
And I called all my
friends in the business.

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:55.450
And as I said, I think I'm
ready to make a solo record.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.120
And everyone said yes.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.410
My producer, Troy Taylor,
said come on through.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.910
We're going to do
it in my basement.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.240
And we went to his basement.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.904
My friend, the publicist,
Gwendolyn Quinn, and these

00:09:04.904 --> 00:09:06.820
are people I had all
worked with at "Essence."

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.640
But I was afraid to ask them
to help me on my own stuff.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.030
Gwendolyn Quinn said
I'll do your PR.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.660
Everyone I reached
out to said we

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.250
have been waiting
for this moment.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.309
And they all helped me.

00:09:16.309 --> 00:09:18.350
Started booking shows,
booked the very first show

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.222
at Joe's Pub.

00:09:19.222 --> 00:09:21.180
I swear I thought 10
people were going to come.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.380
They had to turn
200 people away.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.880
Then the night at
the album release,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.630
we had the album release
around the corner

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.850
at BB King's packed, packed,
almost a sold out show.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.090
It's just from the jump.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.910
It's as if what the
world had been waiting

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.594
for me to step
into my greatness.

00:09:34.594 --> 00:09:36.010
And sometimes
that's what you have

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.920
to do is just listen to what the
universe is trying to tell you

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.530
and don't be afraid
to step into it.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:40.363
RYAN LOREN: Perfect.

00:09:40.363 --> 00:09:41.900
Thanks a lot.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.640
Let's give it up for that.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.440
Last question.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.610
So about the music.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.240
Talk to us about what the
last album meant to you.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.910
That was your third album
"Sincere" and then what's next?

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.870
GORDON CHAMBERS: Every albums
gets more and more personal.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.245
The first album was called
"Introducing Gordon Chambers,"

00:10:00.245 --> 00:10:02.040
which featured
collaborations with friends.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:08.199
Roy Hargrove, Mike Phillips,
Carl Thomas is on that album.

00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:09.990
So the first album had
a slightly different

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.790
jazzy feeling to it.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.435
"Love Stories" featured
a duet with Ledisi--

00:10:15.435 --> 00:10:18.070
"To Love Again" which
became a big hit

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.494
record on a lot
of radio stations.

00:10:20.494 --> 00:10:23.160
Then the third album, "Sincere,"
which is the most recent album.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.360
I just wanted to
make an album that I

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.810
thought was very, very personal.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.435
And I wanted to make
an album this time

00:10:27.435 --> 00:10:30.420
from the perspective of
being a live performer.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.850
The first two levels were
more from the perspective

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.550
of a songwriter that's
writing and also sings.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.980
This one started from the
perspective of a performer.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.032
And I want to give people
lyrically a backstage, up close

00:10:44.032 --> 00:10:45.990
and personal emotional
look at what my life is.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.361
I want to be more as vulnerable
as I could be with the lyrics.

00:10:49.361 --> 00:10:51.110
And that's why the
first song of the album

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.735
is called "I'm In
The Band," because it

00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:55.259
was being written
from that perspective.

00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:57.300
I'm in the process of
making another album called

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.000
"Conversations
with God." and it's

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.320
going to be an
inspirational album.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.962
But it's going to have
a spiritual tonality.

00:11:04.962 --> 00:11:06.670
But I'm also talking
about relationships.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.660
I'm talking about life.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.076
And I'm just getting
more and more

00:11:09.076 --> 00:11:11.400
vulnerable with each album.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.600
I feel that the
R&amp;B male tradition

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.910
has been taken over
by the sexuality.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.660
And I want to provide
more of the sensitivity

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.319
and the sensuality into
the lyrical landscape.

00:11:24.319 --> 00:11:25.360
RYAN LOREN: Amen to that.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.068
So yeah.

00:11:28.068 --> 00:11:29.474
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:29.474 --> 00:11:30.890
RYAN LOREN: Thanks
for being here.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.640
Everybody, I've learned a
lot from Gordon in my life.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.332
We've known each
other a few years.

00:11:36.332 --> 00:11:37.790
You're a role model
to many people,

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.350
GORDON CHAMBERS: Thank you.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.630
RYAN LOREN: Thanks so
much for being here.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.000
GORDON CHAMBERS: Thank you
for doing this-- for us here.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.510
Thank you.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.426
RYAN LOREN: Of course.

00:11:43.426 --> 00:11:44.350
Thank you.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.500
GORDON CHAMBERS:
See you all later!
