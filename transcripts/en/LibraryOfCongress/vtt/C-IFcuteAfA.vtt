I also want to thank our
presenting partner, Poet Lore.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.400
This is the second time in three
years that we've gotten the chance

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.920
to work with them,
and we're thrilled

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.640
to continue the relationship.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.400
We've had the chance again to

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.670

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.740
I'm proud to say that as a normal
citizen, Joe is also a member

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.020
of our Poet Laureate
Circle, so he supports poetry

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.530
in all sorts of wonderful ways.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.330 position:56%
This event is also made possible due
to the support of poets and writers,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.260
the James Irvine Foundation,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.620

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.510

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.930
Thanks so much for being here

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.760
and making this a truly
international event.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.540
Before we begin, I'd like to ask
you to turn off your cell phones,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.630
which I'm going to do myself,
and any other electronic devices

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.720
that you have that might interfere

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.400
with the recording
of tonight's event.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.270
I would also like to note that
this program is being audio

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.260
and video recording for the Library
of Congress, and by participating

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.350
in the question and
answer period later on,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.370
you give the library permission
for future use of your recordings,

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.880
so don't say anything crazy.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.390
Let me also tell you a
little bit about the Poetry

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.220
and Literature Center
here at the library.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.970
We are home to the Poet
Laureate Consultant in Poetry.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.870
We actually have our first
Hispanic Poet Laureate [inaudible],

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.010
who is kicking off his
second term next fall.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.390
But we put on literary
readings, lectures,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.300
and panels of all sorts
throughout the year.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.430
If you would like to find out
more about events like this,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.570

by the Hispanic Division, they have

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.560
brochures in English and in
Spanish to pick up and check out,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.110
and you can visit their
website at loc.gov/rr/hispanic.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.340
You all as you came in got
some forms, some survey forms.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.110
We've got a good crowd tonight.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.280
I'm hoping that many of you take
the time to fill out the form

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.090
after the event and hand it to us.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.390
You can give it to me.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.690
You can put it on the table.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.100
It gives us the opportunity
to hear your voice,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.950
get a sense of what you
think about this event,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.510 position:56%
and improve our events going
forward, so please do fill that out.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.890
So tonight's event
will work as follows.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.930
Jesse Lee Kercheval, translator
of Idea Vilarino's work,

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.860
will participate in
a bilingual reading

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.950
with our beloved Hispanic
Division chief,

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.400
and afterwards Hispanic Division
reference librarian Catalina Gomez

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.180
will lead a moderated discussion.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.640
We'll have plenty of time for
your questions in the end,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.170
and we hope you pick up the copies
of Poet Lore on the table outside

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.050
as well as The Invisible
Bridge, coedited by Jesse Lee.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.580
You're going to hear a little
bit more about Jesse Lee

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.320
in just a second, but I want
to tell you how excited I am

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.960
to feature someone I've known
as a tremendous writer, teacher,

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.350 position:56%
and professor since my undergraduate
days more than two decades ago.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.260
And now to find out more about
Jesse Lee, please join me

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.510
in welcoming the Translation Editor
of Poet Lore, Suzanne Zweizig.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.110
[ Applause ]

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.470
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Zweizig: Hi, everyone.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.190
I just want to reiterate
Rob's welcome and thank you

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.920
to all the parties
who made this happen

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.720
and especially our gracious host,
the Library of Congress Poetry

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.920
and Literature Center
and Hispanic Division.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.800
It's just really wonderful
to work with you all,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.100
and especially it has
been wonderful to work

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.050
with Jesse Lee on this portfolio.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.720
It's just been such an
honor and a pleasure.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.970 position:56%
And I just want to tell you a little
story about how this portfolio came

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.120
to be because I think it says a
lot about Jesse Lee and her role

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.270
as a translator and
what translation means.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.270
It was about two years ago
I guess we met at Ulta,

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.990
and somebody came up to me.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.830
They knew I was looking for
a portfolio for that issue

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.520
of Poet Lore, and they said,
"You've got to meet Jesse Lee.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.240
She's doing all this wonderful
work with Uruguayan writers,"

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.140
and then as it turns out, we
have a mutual friend and we ended

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.600
up having lunch together.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.280
And at the time, Jesse was,
Jesse Lee was really working

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.870
on her translations of Circe Maia,
and she, after the conference,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.360
she sent me a whole manuscript of
the poems, and they were wonderful.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.740
They were really good.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.300 position:56%
But at the same time, I had received
a manuscript of another poet,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.390
Rira Abbasi, an Iranian poet, and
Jesse Lee's poems, a lot of them,

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.590
the ones from Circe Maia
had already been published,

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.830
and none of the poems from this
Rira Abbasi, this Iranian poet,

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.080
had ever been published
in English before,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.590
and Jesse Lee had the
book coming out.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.300
And so thinking about Poet Lore's,
you know, emphasis on discovery

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.440
and bringing new voices to people,
I made a really hard decision,

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.580
and it was really hard to write
the email, but I said to Jesse Lee,

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.420
"I love these poems, but
you've got so many out

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.310
and the book's coming out,
and I've got this opportunity

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.690
to publish this poet who's never
been read in English before."

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.460
And she said, "I would've
done exactly the same thing."

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.190
And I think I told our managing
editor, Jen, about that,

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.940
and she said, "That was,
like, the perfect response."

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.920
And I said, "Yes," and not only
because it was gracious and kind,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.510
but also I think because it
embodies the spirit of translation,

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.410
which is you are putting
forth somebody else's work.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.810
You're expanding the circle so
that more voices can come in.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.350
Not just, you know,
promoting your own voice,

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.300
and that really made
an impression on me.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.160
And then this year,
as I was looking,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.200 position:56%
I remember Jesse Lee had said,
"Well, I'll be doing other writers."

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.430
So I sent an email
out, and lucky for me,

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.560
not only is Jesse Lee gracious and
generous, but she's hardworking

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.860
and prolific and talented.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.890
And I got back the next day this
manuscript, 50-page manuscript

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.890
of Idea Vilarino, who had,
she had been working on.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.040
And it was one of those
moments when you open up your,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.590
the document on your computer
and you're transported

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.840
to another place, you know.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.990 position:56%
And I think you'll, Vilarino's poems
aren't so much the place of Uruguay

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.750
but a place in her mind
that was different,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.910
and that's that trans
word for translation.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.500
You're carried somewhere else.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.200
So Jesse Lee's skill
and her subtlety

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.430
as a translator really
brought through what we strive

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.010
for in translation -- to
capture the voice of somebody.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.320
And I'm really excited that you're
going to hear that voice tonight.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.910
And, you know, as Rob already
said, Jesse Lee's a professor,

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.260
the Zona Gale Professor of English
at University of Wisconsin-Madison.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.360
She's the author of 13 acclaimed
books -- novels, memoirs, poems,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.060
short stories -- and her recent
translations include Invisible

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.830
Bridge, which is out
here tonight for you.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.340
And she's just coming
out I think in the --

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.680
when is it coming out,
the anthology?

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.170
&gt;&gt; September 15th.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.470
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Zweizig: September 15th.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.520
An Anthology of Emerging
Uruguayan Women,

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.890
Emerging Uruguayan Poets is coming
out from the University of Mexico,

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.340
and I've got a lot of hope for
the Idea Vilarino manuscript too.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.060
But in the meantime, you
can see the portfolio

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.170 position:56%
of the poems in the Poet Lore issue.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.610 position:56%
When I think about Jesse Lee and
translation of Uruguayan literature,

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.250
I think of that line from Frank
O'Hara's "The Day Lady Died"

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.170
where he said he wandered off
to the store to find a book

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.910
to see what the poets in
Ghana are doing these days.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.170
And I think, you know, thanks
to Jesse Lee, we can, you know,

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:55.380
find out what the poets in Uruguay
are doing these days, so thank you.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.750
[ Applause ]

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.630
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval: Idea
Vilarino is an amazing poet,

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:04.020
and she's actually a very amazingly
famous poet so that recently

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.430
when Copper Canyon published,
which is a very important press,

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.300
does many things, but
a lot of translation,

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.380
published their Essential Poems
of Latin America, I was irritated

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.910
to see that there were
only three women in it,

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.100
but Idea Vilarino was one of them.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.240
But she doesn't have a book in
English translated, and this,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.500 position:56%
these poems are from her most famous
book, Poemas de Amor, Love Poems.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.050
She was born in 1920
and she died in 2009

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.700
and lived her whole life
in Montevideo, Uruguay.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.600
But she, the poems, Poemas de Amor,
are a really fascinating story.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.040
Idea Vilarino was part of what's
called the Generation of 45

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.070
in Uruguay, which included
Mario Benedetti,

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.570
and is sort of an ex
officio Argentine member,

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.500
Borges, Jorge Luis Borges.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:55.630 position:56%
And she was, fell madly in love with
one of the most important members

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.780
of the group, the Cervantes
Prize winning novelist,

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.170
Juan Carlos Onetti, who was
ten years older than she was.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:06.280 position:56%
And I wish I could show you pictures
because Idea Vilarino looks like,

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.920
you know, looks like
a young Lauren Bacall.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.220
She's gorgeous.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.520
And I hate to say it,
but Onetti looks

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.900
like a frog wearing big glasses.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.410
And so their love affair
is very famous in Uruguay

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.880
and in Latin America, sort of
the Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera;

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.700
Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes; you know.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.000
I don't know.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.520
Lauren Bacall, Humphrey
Bogart romance.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.510
He dedicated a book to her.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.050
She wrote these poems to him, so
every amor, every love in the poem,

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.200
in the book, is addressed to him.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.130
But it has a story
almost beyond their love.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.730
She refers to [inaudible] as a
tiny, tiny little book in 1957,

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:45.500
and then every edition
got -- did it go up?

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.800
Every edition--

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.180
Every edition -- technical problem.

&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval:
Every edition larger?

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:05.570
And so she was going to -- again,
I feel like it's going in and out.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.780
Is it going in and out?

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.690
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval:
Can you just hear me?

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.490
I'll--

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.010
[ Inaudible ]

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.330
Every edition got larger.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.940
She did a final revision in,
like, 2006 before she died.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.500
Now, in the meantime, I have to
say Onetti was married three times

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.830
to women who were not
in [inaudible].

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.940
And so at first, it's a passionate
book about her love for him,

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:35.790
and then I think by the end, it's
about the idea of love and sort

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.450
of the impossibility of love
for a woman who is really

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.700
as independent -- an independent
scholar, teacher, essayist,

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.740
journalist -- as Idea
Vilarino was in her life.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.700
So [inaudible] about
more than Onetti.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:55.690
And I'm going to read
some of the poems that are

00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:03.130

amazing Poet Lore issue,

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:55.800
One of the things that
came between Idea Vilarino

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:01.380
and Onetti was the
dictatorship that came to Uruguay,

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:06.050
the military dictatorship that came
to Uruguay, and about the same time

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.650
as Argentina, which most people
are a little more familiar with.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:12.230
And Onetti was actually sent to
prison for a short period of time,

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.100
and then after many appeals
from outside, he was,

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.690
went to exile and he went to Spain.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:21.920
And many writers of that
Generation of 45 left Uruguay.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.420
Some didn't come back.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.720
Onetti didn't.

And Mario Benedetti went into exile.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.940
Idea Vilarino stayed in Montevideo.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:35.040
She lost her teaching
position, and she was isolated,

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:40.740
left in Montevideo, cut off from
what had been her literary world.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:46.700
And this period of time is,
you know, is very problematic,

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.220
very troubled in Uruguayan history,

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.090
and there are many poets
who wrote about it.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:55.520 position:56%
And one of the other poets who wrote
about it is a poet who I translated,

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.590
Circe Maia, the book
The Invisible Bridge.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.620
It's a selected of her poetry.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.630
And she is ten years younger than
Idea Vilarino, but her husband,

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.690
Aria, was sent to prison
during, under the dictatorship.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.320
He's a doctor who had been
accused of giving medical aid

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.150
to the Tupamaro [inaudible],
and when she writes poems,

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.870
she doesn't write directly
about this period.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:20.030
Another really just Idea
VIlarino, but if you're Uruguayan,

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.440
people will read a poem and they'll
look to see when it was published

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.500
or when it was written to
sort of see whether, you know,

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.850
silence is just silence
or whether it's silence.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:34.310 position:56%
And this poem of Circe Maia's makes
me think about Idea Vilarino sitting

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:37.680
in Montevideo and all of what was
going on in Uruguay at the time.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.910
It's called "Treason."

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:45.000
The last son did not say to
him, "I am the last son."

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.520
Nothing prepared him.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.910 position:56%
The water slid over his body, and
he didn't know that this was the way

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.520
that the water said goodbye.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.980
He did not know.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.070
No one told him anything.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:00.860
When night came, it came
to stay, and he never knew.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:05.630
And then there's a piece that's
probably the most famous thing

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.110
that Circe Maia is best known for,

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.850
but it actually isn't
one of her poems.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.250
It was never in one of her books,
but it's the lyrics that she wrote

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.110
for a poem, lyrics
she wrote for a song

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.030
that was sung by Daniel Viglietti.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.090
Daniel Viglietti is often
called the Bob Dylan of Uruguay,

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.100
but I think he's sort of more
the Pete Seeger of Uruguay

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.040
if you can understand
that distinction there.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.830
And this song became very
popular all through Latin America

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.990
as something about the
disappeared, and it's often done --

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.330
there's a wonderful version
on YouTube of a performance

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.100
where Daniel Viglietti
would sing this song

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.590 position:56%
and Mario Benedetti would recite one
of his poems about the disappeared.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:43.910

Voz Canta, but the poem version

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.420

Detras de mi Voz."

poem by another poet

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:38.990
who is again ten years younger than
Circe Maia, so 20 years younger

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.840
than Idea Vilarino, but went
really through the same experience

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.740
under the dictatorship,
and that's Tatiana Orono,

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.820

which is clearly about the,

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.300
this period in Latin
American history,

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.930
and it's called "The Discounted."

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.720

to Idea Vilarino's poems,

to think of this period

been translated already.

someone else to translate her work.

And the first person
that I actually picked up

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:53.760

reading those right away.

Everyone went to the beach
and I just sat in a hammock

tell from that, but there's a lot

Well, the [inaudible] thing
with Vilarino, as I spent a lot

herself about how she had a system

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.470
of stresses in her language.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:47.900
And she tracked them in her poems,
and I found that impossible to do

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.750
in English without rendering poems

couldn't be done.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.760

that despite playing, you know,

if you're a musician,

who's ever going to play them.

You're not the definitive version.

Someone may come along and
do something different.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.990
But any kind of formal poetry, you
make a decision whether to keep it

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:13.620
or not, and [inaudible] it's not
in a form that you would recognize

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:22.870
as formal poetry or that I would
necessarily, but I did spend a lot

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:26.750
of time thinking about
her system of stresses.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:35.040
And it just, as far as I could
tell, [inaudible] English.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.670
Her language is relatively
straightforward.

Both she and Circe Maia [inaudible]
tradition in Uruguayan poetry

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:51.040

of simplicity for different reasons.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:57.560
And, but there's an example of
a sort of classic poetry dilemma

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.490
in the title of [inaudible]
in Uruguayan that you just,

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:08.040
this is just a perfect example
of what you lose in translation.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.800 position:56%
"Ya" means both "now" and "already."

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.800
And so in Uruguay, people
use it all the time.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.200
In English, it sounds
much better [inaudible]

than it does in [inaudible].

So, like, the most common expression
or one of them is [inaudible],

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.880
which is, you know
[speaking Spanish], you know,

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:28.180
and they introduce that as just,
like, you know, here's your dinner.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.480
Or [inaudible].

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.840
And it, to translate it as
"not now" works in English.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.140
It works through the poem.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.440
The other possibility would be
"now, no," but you lose the idea

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.740
that it's also "already."

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.040 position:56%
So, for example, "ya" is the word
that's used in the [inaudible] poem.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.340
[inaudible] so I can remember it.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.640
Black stone on white stone where
it's usually translated, you know,

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.940
that you've, to say you
already died let's say in Paris.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.240
And so there--

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.220
Oh, it's usually translated, oh,
black stone on a white stone.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.660
"I will die in Paris in a rainstorm
on a day I already remember."

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:59.400
And so that's "ya," and
not "a day I now remember."

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.340
And so when you translate it, it
doesn't really work to translate it

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.570
as "already" [inaudible] the poem,
"already not," "already know,"

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.860
"already I know I won't,
you know, have your child."

Already I know I won't
do these things.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.210
But you do lose the
idea that it's both now,

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:18.760
this immediate realization, and
that you sort of already knew that,

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.930

bring that across in English.

those things that, you know,

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:48.550
in magazines like in the New
Yorker, and I will bring them,

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:52.660
and she would just read
other book of poems.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:58.280
And she has translated
Shakespeare into Spanish,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.410
so it's not that she can't
read the translations.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:07.430
After I published them, she noted
a couple places she really liked

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:12.660
something, but she won't
really talk about her poems.

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:18.820
I think if Idea Vilarino was alive,
because I talked to so many people

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:24.550
who knew her, and she just died in
2009, she would talk your ear off

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:27.140
about her poems, so I really regret
not having gotten to talk to her.

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.610
I think in some ways she was
a difficult person somewhat.

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:29.910
Not quite as zen about
her work as [inaudible],

00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:31.210
so maybe her being
dead is [inaudible].

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:32.510
I wish I could talk to her,
but at least, you know,

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:33.810
I just have to trust that
I'm doing the right thing.

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:35.110
Tatiana Orono is a
completely different case.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.410
She makes up words, and
so I honestly don't think,

00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:37.710
I have a feeling that
if I don't finish a book

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.010
of hers before something, you
know, I hope she lives to be 110.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.310
She's just in her 70's.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:41.610
I think no one would
be able to do it.

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:42.910 position:56%
You know, there are literally things

00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:44.210 position:56%
that I could ask 100 Uruguayans what
it meant, and no one would know.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:45.510
There's a title of one of her
poems that's "Mabror," M-A-B-R-O-R,

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:46.810
and I thought this
was a proper noun.

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:48.110 position:56%
I googled it, I asked 20 different
people, and then I wrote to Tatiana.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.410
[inaudible] because she
tends to write very long,

00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:50.710
and [inaudible] answered the
question, but it's the word "madre"

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.010
and "dolor" put together
for "mother pain."

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.310
So, like, how would you
know that [inaudible]?

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:54.610
So that's a classic example

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.910
of why you should translate
them [inaudible] and--

00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:57.210
[ Inaudible ]

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:58.510
Tatiana will ask, well, you
can talk to her at any point.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.030
She doesn't read English, so she's
not looking at my translations

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:04.220
so much, but some of her stuff
is just mysterious verging

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.520 position:56%
on the incomprehensible [inaudible].

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:09.410
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Okay, and
this next question actually

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:11.040
addresses the--

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.060
[ Inaudible ]

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:17.020
The amount of [inaudible]
that Uruguay has produced,

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.410
especially in the last century.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:22.680
And according from
your introduction,

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.760
you're saying this country

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.310
of [inaudible] million people have
produced a disproportionate number

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:32.230
of strong women poets in a
literary world dominated by men.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.530
[inaudible].

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:34.830
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval:
Yes, it's absolutely true,

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:36.630
and I could type out a list.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:41.210
[ Inaudible ]

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:46.780
But it's a phenomenon that makes
me impatient with this anthology

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.080
that has no women poets in it.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.330
I could fill a world class
anthology with nothing

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:54.140
but Uruguayan women
poets, and there's a lot

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.680
of discussion here
about why that's true.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.060
Part of that I think is because
it was early universal education

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:02.050
and because it's a relatively
middle class country.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:07.590
So, but there's actually a real
sense among women poets that's

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:11.650
handed from each generation
for the next generation.

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.010
They're all perfectly aware
of the mothers before them.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:15.810
Like, Circe Maia lives the
middle of [inaudible], well--

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.360
[ Inaudible ]

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.370 position:56%
Don't tell someone from [inaudible].

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:24.870
But five miles from, five hours
by bus from Montevideo where half

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:29.120
of the people, 1.5 million
people, in the country live,

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.590
and yet people get on a bus
and they go to visit Circe.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.180
They go make that pilgrimage.

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.480
And so, like--

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:42.500
Was born in 1892 and
[inaudible] born in 1892,

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:48.310
1886 to put it one generation.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:55.590
And then there's these wonderful
other poets besides Idea Vilarino

00:36:55.590 --> 00:37:04.170
in the Generation of 45, Amanda
Berenguer and Ida Vitale,

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.740
who actually lives in Texas.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:10.080
And then there are
people, just outliers.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.380
It's wonderful.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.530
Another part of that group
that's sort of the same age.

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.780
There's a wonderful [inaudible]
Uruguay poet [inaudible].

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:21.720
Another wonderful woman
who died early

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.130
in a plane wreck that [inaudible].

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:24.780
There's two wonderful translations

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.950
by this wonderful [inaudible]
totally different [inaudible] Circe

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:28.830
Maia, surreal, sexual, steamy,

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:30.130
religious [inaudible]
poems, [inaudible].

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:37.050
And goes on up to, I, you
know, I've had this anthology

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:42.440
of younger emerging
Uruguayan poets coming out.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.270
Half of them are easily women.

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:45.830
There was no problem with that.

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:49.040
You know, said that people
who were in their 20's

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.330
that are in that anthology.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:56.470
And there's two, three of
the actually male poets

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.090
that I know in Uruguay now.

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:01.710 position:56%
They're doing this wonderful project
where they go into high schools

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.030
and teach poetry workshops,
which isn't normal there,

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.330 position:56%
and they publish an online
anthology called [speaking Spanish],

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:05.630
which is they call it an
anthology of [inaudible].

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:06.930
So it's, you know, they're,
like, 16 to 18 years old,

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.230
and the women [inaudible].

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:09.530
And so I really think, oh, come on.

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:10.830
There have to be, I can't believe
this an isolated phenomenon,

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:12.130 position:56%
but I'm very Uruguay-centric, and so
I would like to see a reexamination

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:13.430
of the role of women
poets in Latin America.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:14.730
I can't think that Uruguay
is becoming [inaudible].

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:16.030
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: But
have you found, like,

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:17.330
what is it about our culture that--

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval: No, I really
think it starts earlier than that.

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:24.160 position:56%
I think it starts partly [inaudible]
Uruguayan culture for poets.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.620
I mean-

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.770
[ Inaudible ]

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:31.990 position:56%
But I think that it has to do, there
are a lot of things about Uruguay.

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:38.540
It's a lay country without the
same degree of, I don't know,

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.410
pressure on women by
the Catholic Church.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.640 position:56%
There's a complete
differentiation of church and state.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.470 position:56%
Their women, all the women that I've
listed here, including, you know,

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:49.770
Idea Vilarino, they
support themselves.

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:51.070
She never married.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.660
A lot of them taught school.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.590
It's just a culture in which
I think women were able

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:58.550
to establish themselves as
literary figures earlier

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.330
and keep up this tradition.

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.010
Now, I don't mean to
say that it was easy.

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:04.270
When you look at the
Generation of 45,

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:10.170
I think you can clearly see
sexism in the attitude of the men

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:13.490
in [inaudible] towards women, but
there are three important women

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:18.300
in that group, in that
literary group, so I just think

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.690
that it's kind of amazing.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:26.640
Something I'm more and more
interested in, and, you know,

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.230
Uruguayan [inaudible] too,

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:31.520
but I think sometimes they don't
quite understand how unusual it is

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.820
because they live in it.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.120
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Now
we're going to open

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.420
up for questions from the audience.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.720
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Since we
don't have a mike, [inaudible],

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.020
we'll just call on you
if you raise your hand.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.320
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval:
This is usually when I say

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.620 position:56%
that I'm a teacher, and if you don't
ask questions, we don't call on you.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:41.920
[ Laughter ]

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.220
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Go ahead.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:47.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [inaudible] really -- I'm
from the Caribbean, so, you know,

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:54.160
what is going on there has been
very interesting, and, you know,

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.210
in the Caribbean, [inaudible] some
very interesting women poets also,

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.010
right.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:02.520
[ Inaudible ]

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:07.530 position:56%
But the question that we [inaudible]
is that obviously she grows

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:10.500
up at the time when all around
her is these huge, political,

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.570
socioeconomic problems
in Latin America, right?

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:19.270
I mean, the kind of
problems, you know, in Chile.

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:23.560
I mean [inaudible] did she, and
obviously she was part of groups

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.380
of people [inaudible] who often--

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.750
[ Inaudible ]

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:31.510
In the right or left
wing direction, right?

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:34.940
[ Inaudible ]

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:40.460
Okay. Did she ever write political
poetry or is there a tradition

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:44.840
in Uruguay of women
writing political poetry,

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.140
or is this more [inaudible] things

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:49.090
and [inaudible] sexism,
et cetera, et cetera?

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:54.570
And did she ever talk about
[inaudible] in an open, direct way,

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:56.440
or was this all much
more [inaudible]

00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:01.830
and much more metaphorical as
some of the poetry [inaudible]?

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:03.540
And what is the relationship also

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:07.600
with other women poets
in Latin America?

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.900
Do they get together?

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.200
Do they meet a lot?

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.570
Or are they somewhat
isolated from one another?

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:15.230
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval: I would
say [inaudible] question here.

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:19.510
I would say, you know, Idea
Vilarino was openly left wing,

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.860
and she lost her job under the
dictatorship and, you know,

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:26.410
was lucky enough to have
had to go into exile,

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:32.510
and as were all the other
poets in the Generation of 45.

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:35.110
But I do say that there
is a tendency of the women

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:37.470
to write more personal poetry
and less political poetry.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:40.880
Mario Benedetti is just
openly, relentlessly sometimes,

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:45.090
or the young poets actually
find him tediously political.

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:48.840
I don't find him that way,
but there's kind of pressure,

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:53.960
pushback against this younger
generation against Benedetti,

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.940
who's the most famous
Uruguayan poet [inaudible].

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.370
And I think that even
now in the Anthology

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:03.080
of Emerging Uruguayan Poets,
the women tend to write

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:07.880
about personal things, and the
men write more political things

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.180
or historical things.

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:16.610
I see that same thing with my
own MFA students sometimes,

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:20.710
and that's kind of
a troubling trend.

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:28.750
It would not be that different
I think if you're looking again

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:31.990
to Sylvia Plath or
[inaudible] looking people

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:33.290
in the [inaudible] the barriers

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:37.770
that the women were breaking
were maybe not political ones.

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:46.680
They, as far as connections
between poets in other parts

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:52.990
of Latin America, yes, but not
as much maybe as you would think.

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:58.990
Uruguay has a kind of Europe
facing orientation in their poetry

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:03.450
and their culture, but there has
been, and over the last, you know,

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:07.040
100 years really --
it's 100 years now?

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:11.650
The usual trip that, as the
dictatorship fell, the usually trip

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:14.710
that an Uruguayan writer
gets to make is

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:17.440
to Cuba [inaudible] we're
not flying them in here.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.330
But so there were certainly
[inaudible] of,

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:23.440
conferences of South American
poets that happened there,

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.740
and there were other
things that happened --

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.040
the Paraguayan Embassy

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.340
or the Peruvian Embassy were
put together [inaudible]

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:28.640
to bring people in.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.940 position:56%
But I would say that the poetry, the
first person-to-person encounters

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.240
between the poets of Idea Vilarino
generation and that didn't go

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.540
out into exile and other poets of
South American relatively limited.

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:33.840
That doesn't mean that they
weren't reading everything.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.140
[inaudible] South America,
but it wasn't that easy to get

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.440
out of Uruguay and come back in.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.740
Lots of international travel,
so relatively [inaudible].

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.540
That's my impression.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:54.620
[ Inaudible ]

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:58.740
Uruguay is particularly that
way that the [inaudible] I guess

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:01.970
to the rest of Latin America as
they think they are, you know,

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:04.260
they stand with their
back to Brazil,

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.610
and they have some connection
to Argentina, but otherwise,

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:08.530
they're looking at Europe, and
they have very strong [inaudible]

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:14.650
connections to France, which
I'm surprised [inaudible].

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:18.690
&gt;&gt; I was curious at your choice
of poems to read as a sequence

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:21.470
because you talked
first about [inaudible].

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:29.480
And most of the poems that you read
were about the [inaudible] of that.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:34.410
And I'm just curious how
you made that choice.

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:36.200
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval: I would say
it is the choice of Idea Vilarino.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.510
Even though it's called Love Poems,

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:43.160
they are mostly my bed empty
and where are you poems.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.460
There are more angry poems

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:48.890
than actually remembers the
night or in the moment poems.

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:50.930
And these are the selection
that was in Poet Lore,

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:53.780
but I think you would find
that in the entire book.

00:44:53.780 --> 00:45:01.310
They are more prickly or
angry than absolutely adoring.

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:04.180
And so that's interesting too.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:07.780
I mean, if someone is asserting
their rights in a relationship,

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:13.210
so perhaps in that
sense, love poems.

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:20.030
It's almost a misnomer, but
that's what they are for her.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.470
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:29.170
&gt;&gt; And living abroad [inaudible]
in fact that you're teaching.

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:32.910
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval: Oh, I
started to bring translation

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:40.470
into the classroom -- we don't
actually teach a separate workshop

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:44.300
in translation, although
I'd like to,

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:54.120
and I've been visiting
a lot of them lately.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:58.790
The first time I went to
a translation workshop,

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:03.260
and the theory is that
in the United States is

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:10.700
that people are translating
all kinds of poems

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.750
that the teachers can't
read the original language.

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:18.410
It seemed strange to me at
first, but, so I brought it

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:23.740 position:56%
into my graduate student workshops
with my undergrad student workshops.

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.290
They do a unit on it.

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:30.510
And so last time, for example,
in my graduate workshop,

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:38.000
there were people translating
Turkish and Swahili, and so,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.360
you know, you try to connect
them with [inaudible] people.

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:48.370
In that language, it may need help,
and they, and you start to talk

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:54.130
about the general problems that
there are in translating English.

00:46:54.130 --> 00:47:00.740
There's some [inaudible] no matter
what language you're translating,

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:06.880
and you read the English versions
to see if they're working in poems.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:14.060 position:56%
And that is fine for an actual unit.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.730
I am looking forward
to and a little scared

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:20.600
about teaching an entire semester
of it, although I've now sat

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:24.290
through a lot of translation
workshops that [inaudible] taught

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:28.760
because I've been a
visitor in class.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:33.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Have you ever
heard of Walter Benjamin?

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.650
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval:
Yes, of course.

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:38.550
&gt;&gt; He wrote an essay on translation
and about how the translation

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:40.800
and each translation after that
basically followed Messianic

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.100
language, like, each, you know,

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.400 position:56%
a lot of people think translation
is [inaudible], and he was very much

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.700
that each transportation is that.

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:46.000
And [inaudible] was
a great example too

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.300
because they translated
everything [inaudible].

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:48.600
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval:
I think translation,

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:49.900 position:56%
it's a tricky and slippery business.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.200
I actually got a beautiful book
when I was just down in Uruguay,

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.500
there's a wonderful press
that published a collection

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:53.800
of poetry called Yauguru,
which is Uruguay backwards.

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.100
And they did a project where they
got someone to translate poems

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.400
through a whole roundabout
languages, right.

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.700
So, you know, if you
translate it from --

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.000
I have to look at the book now.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.300
I don't remember.

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.600
But from Spanish to French,
from French to German,

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.900
without even looking back at the
original, and then all the way back

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.200
to Spanish to see how it's
a completely different

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.500
poem [inaudible].

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.800
It's a poem in every language,
but it's not the same poem,

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.100
and that's what it's
[inaudible] all the decisions

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:09.400
that can be made along the way.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [inaudible] prose.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.000
I just want [inaudible]
what you're interested in,

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.300
who you're writing to, [inaudible],
are you [inaudible], or--

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.600
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:15.900
Interested in how geography and
place kind of, they form character.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.550
I'm curious to know then in
your role of a translator,

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:21.560
do you [inaudible] like that
or do you [inaudible] in some

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.410
of the things as you
might be [inaudible],

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:29.260
can you bring that to your
translation or do you have

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:32.980
to set your own [inaudible]
aside as far as [inaudible],

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:37.810
or is there something improved?

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:42.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval: Well, that's
a really interesting question.

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:49.270
I haven't really thought about
that, but I think it's probably one

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:55.280
of the reasons that I was
interested in Uruguay.

00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:04.100
Uruguay's a country everyone
chose in one way or another.

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:11.910
It's a country of immigrants
like the United States.

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:17.000
And then there are
these constant choices

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.230
like [inaudible] there's people
who left during the dictatorship,

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:30.600
there was a terrible
economic crash in 2001,

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:36.280
which was the biggest economic
influence on the [inaudible] work.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.660
Families [inaudible] move
to Israel for a while.

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.380 position:56%
And so I think I, maybe I'm bringing
my own obsession with place.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.850
I was born in France and
grew up in different places

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:43.150
in the United States,
and I have a sense

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:44.450
of displacement that's
in a lot of my work.

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:45.750
So maybe I identify with that,
but then in the Uruguayan,

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:47.050
I don't think I, it's
not the same thing where,

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:48.350
maybe you bring your interests
to the poet you choose,

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:49.650
but I think when you're
translating, you put that aside.

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:50.950
I wouldn't write poems
like Idea Vilarino.

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:52.250
I would aspire maybe to be a
little more like Circe Maia,

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:53.550
but I [inaudible] Idea
Vilarino, I'm not that, you know,

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:54.850
I don't know, open
about my emotions.

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:56.150
But you just get into
it, and especially

00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:57.450 position:56%
when you're translating a book, the
more poems you translate by someone,

00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:58.750
the more you understand them,
and you [inaudible] them on.

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:00.050
And so actually for me, having
written both fiction and memoirs,

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:01.350
sort of the most revealing
thing, and then a lot of poetry,

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:02.650
the great thing about
translation is sort

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:03.950 position:56%
of leaving your ego aside, you know.

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:05.250
You really are doing someone else's
work, even though I'm saying or,

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:06.550
you know, it's not like [inaudible]
it's completely transparent,

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:07.850
the choices that are made.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:09.150
But it just feels good
not -- I don't know --

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:10.450
not to be making up your
own stuff for a while.

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:12.030
I'm really enjoying the
vacation from myself.

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:14.040
[ Laughter ]

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.340
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Yeah,
one more question.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:16.640
Go ahead.

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:20.670
&gt;&gt; I was just going to say,
how much do you have to know

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:24.500
about these people in such a
[inaudible] memoirs and works

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:25.800
about them or [inaudible]?

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.680
&gt;&gt; Jesse Lee Kercheval:
It depends on the person.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.390
Just depends on how much there is.

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:33.080
So with Circe Maia, there is,
I [inaudible] just her books.

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:43.190
So her collected poems is about 400
pages, and now she has a new book.

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:48.760
And then meeting her
was interesting.

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:56.450
There's some interviews with
her which I read, but there,

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:59.340
it's a really critical
work on her [inaudible].

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:09.430
I mean, meaning there's a
chapter in it in an Uruguayan book

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:17.220
that [inaudible] trying to think
if there's one, there's two studies

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:22.550
of sort of all of Uruguayan poetry.

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:26.180
Idea Vilarino was more complicated

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:30.640
because there's a fair
amount written about her,

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:35.410
but nothing like you'd see
about an American author

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:40.490
in the same, you know, importance.

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:48.390
There, the woman who holds her
[inaudible] put together sort

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:51.620
of a collection of
letters and photographs.

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:53.270
Every time I ask someone in
Uruguay if they knew Idea Vilarino,

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:54.570
they have a different
Idea Vilarino story.

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:56.030
How much that's useful or not,
I don't know, so I did just sort

00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:57.330
of try to go into the poems.

00:51:57.330 --> 00:51:58.630
Where it came up, for example, is
right now, which version you want

00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:59.960
to translate of the book, you
know, it's like Leaves of Grass.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.260
She keeps changing it.

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.560
I decided not to do the '57
edition because it's missing most

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:03.860
of the famous poems like the
one I read in [inaudible].

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.450
And I didn't end up doing
the 2006 one because it's got

00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:07.190
about 20 additional poems in it,
and I just thought, I don't know.

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:08.490
Shoot me, enough already.

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:09.790 position:56%
So [laughter] I ended up translating
the '75 edition because I thought

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:11.090
that was really the one
that everyone remembered.

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:12.390
I walked around and said, "You
know, which one do you, you know,

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:13.690
do Uruguayans all own
copies in their house?"

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:14.990
It was sort of that
edition that they owned

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:16.290
that had all the famous
poems, but not the ones

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:17.590
that she wrote 40 years
after this relationship.

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:18.890
So, and so I ended up
[inaudible] being published.

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:20.190
A lot of it has to do with
the publisher and, you know,

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:21.490
what they decide to
do when they wanted

00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:22.790
to do a comprehensive version.

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:24.090
But then I think I wouldn't have
known unless I dug into her life

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:25.390
and with her going into
what she was thinking about.

&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Well on that note,
much thanks to Jesse Lee Kercheval

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.840

copies of Jesse Lee's translations,

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:41.490

00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:44.630

00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:52.420

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:56.510
That's in the Whittall
Pavilion across the street,

00:52:56.510 --> 00:53:00.800
so if you want some more
exciting poetry from another part

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.480
