00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.870
Here's a neat little party trick that's guaranteed
to be a blast, and all you're gonna to need

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.190
is a bottle of soda.

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:11.510
The next time you're at a house party, there's
a good chance that someone will show up, with

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.240
some bottles of soda. Now if a bottle gets
shaken up, it's going to take awhile to open,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.360
unless, or course, you don't mind making a
mess all over the place. But check this out.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.680
When you master the soda ninja swipe, you'll
blast the cap off with incredible power, and

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.590
did you notice the soda isn't spilling over?
Instead, it creates a cool misty vapor that

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.609
gently flows out the top and over the sides.
The pressure in the bottles is enough to ricochet

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.739
the cap off the ceiling, and all the way across
the room. You can be sure you'll get some

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.170
attention, because everyone will be looking
around, to see what just exploded. If we mark

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.620
the bottle, and slowly unscrew the cap, you
can see it takes about one and a half rotations

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.219
to fully release. I measured that distance,
on a paper plate, and it's roughly 6" of travel,

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.940
or about 15.5 cm. Now the trick to an instant,
deCAPitaion, is to start with your middle

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.089
finger on the side of the cap, then roll it
down to your wrist in one swift, and fluid

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.590
motion. It might take a couple of tries to
get a feel for it, but just focus on swiping

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.250
the cap down to your wrist. Now the next time
you're at a party and you see someone pouring

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.789
themselves a drink, just hang tight until
the bottles, are half empty. Now make sure

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.630
the cap is on tight, and shake it like a maniac
to build up the pressure. Give it a few seconds

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.899
for the bubbles to settle back down again,
then slowly unscrew the cap, until you hear

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.250
a hiss. Back it off just a touch, and now
your bottle blaster, is charged and ready

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.880
to fire. Grab the bottle by the neck, line
up the cap, and unleash the power. Not only

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.030
does this look awesome, but the sudden bang
will make people jump. Now if you misjudge

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.530
the carbonation in the bottle, and it starts
foaming over, just slap your hand down over top,

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.310
and pretend nothing ever happened. Well now
you know, how to turn a house party refreshment,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.259
into a soda bottle blaster, that will probably
leave your drinks a little flat, but will

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.749
definitely make you, the center of attention.
Well that's it for now. If you liked this
