00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
 Everything starts when my parents know in the Philippines 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.560
 Mia, my lively, funny and charming mother 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.120
 At that time, as a waiter 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.000
 My father, Willie, is a Marine Corps officer. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.220
 And he has a sense of morality like Superman 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.160
 He often describes himself as "boring but reliable" 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.120
 My mom overslept when they first dated. 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.100
 She also overslept on the second date. 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.180
 So he bought her a gift, an alarm clock. 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.940
 On the third date, success! :) 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.540
 Except my mom is farting when she is about halfway through the date. 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.100
 It’s in that moment, my mom knows that my dad is her true child. 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.500
 Because he looked back at her and said: 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.440
 "Are you stepping on the frog?" 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.300
 They got married and gave birth to me, my brother Will and my sister Kristina. 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.860
 As a military family, we move every two to three years. 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.440
 To the new state, if not to the new country 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.680
 When I was seventeen, Kristina killed herself. 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.340
 My life is really a contrast before and after this critical moment. 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.280
 This thing defines me, whether I want it or not. 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.480
 It’s this thing that turned me into the present. 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.880
 I started working on comedy when I was 19 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.960
 Because that is the only thing that makes me laugh. 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.900
 I was commuting to Los Angeles for two hours. 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.140
 Do some live performances and shows 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.140
 In the self-service laundry and coffee shop 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.000
 I was finally able to move to Los Angeles when I was 21 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.800
 I also started playing youtube. 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.040
 I have several failed channels and broken friendships. 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.720
 Until I found out that I was making progress on the recommendations and story-based videos, and I would play all the roles in the film. 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.780
 Until I found out that I was making progress on the recommendations and story-based videos, and I would play all the roles in the film. 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.020
 I started taking a movie in a week. 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.100
 Never stopped until now 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.760
 If I really have to paint my life, 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.320
 You will see the following things: 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.560
 I am filming at home and using a computer. 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.200
 I am filming at home and using a computer. 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.320
 At the filming scene, it may be the director or the actor. 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.380
 Study 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.360
 An impromptu performance or comedy on stage 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.300
 I can’t be proud of the number of meals such as In N Out. 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.500
 Drive to the conference and end the conference, drive, super conference, more to burst 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.720
 Drive to the conference and end the conference, drive, super conference, more to burst 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.220
 Have dinner and watch movies with my boyfriend 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.120
 Go to the gym three times a week 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.340
 I am delaying my dentist clinic XD 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.400
 I am going to audition 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.920
 I will hold my cat whenever I get the chance. 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.180
 I run a company 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.840
 I am mixed with my friends. 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.860
 I see all the shows are unrestrained. 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.600
 Sometimes I feel depressed 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.980
 You know, I will lie on the floor or in bed. 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.020
 Or just look at the air in the dark, like a weirdo 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.040
 Sometimes I will cry in the car without a reason. 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.840
 I will read an article about the living conditions of livestock. 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.900
 Or the proportion of teen suicide, then you will feel hopeless in life 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.960
 Or the proportion of teen suicide, then you will feel hopeless in life 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.740
 Sometimes I drink too much and eat too little 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.040
 Worried about what I know don't need to worry about 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.400
 Until now, my life is trying to make myself famous. 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.520
 I started my career and worked hard since I was 19 years old. 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.860
 Doubt: "How do I become a better person?" 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.220
 Or is there something I can bring to the world? 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.260
 My life is hard work, fast pace of life 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.980
 Still telling the truth, very confusing 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.640
 Just realize that my parents are just people. 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.000
 That is, everyone who has a sister 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.540
 Is to define ourselves through loss, achievement and failure. 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.160
 Is to define ourselves through loss, achievement and failure. 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.960
 But I am still young 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.880
 Life will continue to change, indicating the next stop, no matter what it is. 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.260
 All I can say is that I am really lucky to be able to do what I am doing now. 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.940
 Age is a privilege that some people can never have. 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.100
 And I love my life. 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.580
 Even when I am depressed and can't get up from the ground 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.580
 Because there is always a cat? 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.580
 Right, I mentioned that I have five cats? 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.180
 I am Anna Akana. Continue to be a great person, Gotham.
