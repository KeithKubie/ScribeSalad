00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.920
A lot of people don’t know is that any number
you’ve ever heard about police violence

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.740
comes through the aggregate of media reports.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.389
If you get killed in this country and a newspaper
doesn’t write about it, it’s not covered

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.410
on like a blog or like a TV or something,
you literally don’t exist in the data set.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.150
The federal government doesn’t collect information
about police killings in any systemic way.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.880
We can tell you the rainfall in Missouri in
1830, and we can’t actually tell you how

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.070
many people got killed, like, as a hard fact
last year.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.070
We don’t know it.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.790
What we know is like the aggregate of media
reports, these incredible activists years

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.020
ago set up these two big databases that essentially
called like an advanced Google alerts of like

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.250
police killings, and that is the source data
for everything that you’ve ever seen on

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.250
police killings.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.670
Some of the biggest databases that you might
have heard of are like the Washington Post

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.340
Database, fatal encounters killed by police.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.129
We created Mapping Police Violence to create
the single stop database that had the most

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.059
comprehensive data about police killings.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.960
If you think about the Washington Post Database,
for instance, they only have killings by officers

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.620
on duty that use a gun.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.110
So say for example an officer goes home and
runs somebody over with their car, like that’s

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.110
not counted.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.850
Say somebody is on duty and the officer runs
you over with their car, not accounted.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.490
Eric Garner’s death is not in the Washington
Post Database.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.490
Why?

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.490
Because he wasn’t killed with a gun.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.299
So we wanted to say that like whether you
got killed by a taser, a chokehold, whether

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.329
the officer was at home and like killed his
wife off-duty, we consider all of those to

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.220
be symptoms of the same sort of root problem.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.530
So that’s why we created the database.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.979
And what we know is that, left to their own
devices, that police will just never report

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:38.979
this data.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.330
There are times where the state of Florida
has reported zero police killings in entire

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.560
spans of years, and you’re like “We know
that’s not true, like we could just look

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.299
at the news and see it wasn’t zero!”

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.560
So the data actually is really important for
us to help locate what the problem is and

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.560
what the solution should be.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.020
And the last thing I’ll say is that we have
to figure out how to start talking about police

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.659
violence beyond death.

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:09.030
So we know that the police inflict damage
in communities in ways like sexual assault,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.940
verbal abuse, those sort of things, and the
data we have most readily available is about

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.480
death, but because we only focus on death
with the data, we’re losing how the police

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.359
impact women, how the police impact LGBT communities,
like any other ways that don’t result in

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.109
death but are still really bad—and we have
to figure out how to do that.

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.540
One of the limitations is that most police
departments definitely don’t make that data

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.580
publicly available or don’t collect it in
any systemic way.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.860
So you think about police departments like
Baltimore where so much of the data is on

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.390
paper, you’re like “Well, who is sitting
down analyzing ten million records on paper?

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.140
Nobody right now,” and that becomes like
a challenge.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.200
So what we found were a couple myth busters.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.820
We found things like there’s this idea that
community violence and police violence are

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.440
related, so in communities where there’s
just a lot of violence people say that “the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.920
police just have to be there, because the
communities are violent and so the police

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.920
must be there.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.170
And because the police must be there it’s
just more likely that they’ll probably engage

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.840
in violence against communities.”

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.729
And we found that that’s just not true.

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:11.449
There are places where there’s a lot of
community violence and almost no police violence,

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:15.480
and the inverse is also true that there’s
no real relationship between community violence

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.540
and police violence.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.150
We also found is that black people are actually
more likely to be unarmed than any other race

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.720
of people who are killed by police.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.100
So there’s this myth that black people are
just like carrying guns around and like they’re

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.920
in the presence of police, and that actually
isn’t true.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.970
And with regard to policy we found out a lot
of things.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.340
So we created the first public database of
use of force policies and police union contracts

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.650
in the country because we were trying to figure
out like why are the police not accountable?

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.780
Is it really that prosecutors and mayors just
don’t care?

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.820
Like what is it?

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.840
What we found is that there’s literally
just a different justice system.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.729
So you think about places like in Maryland,
in Maryland the law literally says that a

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:57.630
citizen can file an anonymous complaint against
an officer for everything except brutality.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.530
I don’t even know what that means.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.200
In California there is a law that says that
any investigation of an officer that lasts

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.359
more than a year can never result in discipline.

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.500
Like I don’t even know what that means.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.950
In places like in Baton Rouge you can’t
file a complaint over the phone against an

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:14.950
officer.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.340
There are places where you have to file an
affidavit, like where would you go to get

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.340
an affidavit today?

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.340
I don’t know.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.000
There are all these things that almost guarantee
that officers won’t be held accountable,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.150
and we shed light on them for the first time
with this big database trying to help people

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.400
see like - and actually you could get a great
prosecutor, but if the rules are set up against

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.360
everybody the great prosecutor is still hamstrung.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.940
You can get a mayor, you can get a city council,
but if we don’t focus on these structural

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.600
things that aren’t necessarily the most
“sexy,” but if they’re actually the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.600
most salient in terms of outcomes like we’ll
never win.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.750
And that’s why we created Mapping Police
Violence to get the data and then Campaign

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.040
Zero to talk about the policies and solutions
that actually might change the system of accountability.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.720
So we made the first valid database of use
of force policies in the country and it was

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.510
hard to get good—Use of Force policies,
for people that don’t know, are essentially

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.980
the rules that police use to say whether they
can use force against somebody, anything up

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.290
to (and leading to) death or murder.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.140
And what we found is that, A, it was just
really hard to get the record.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.280
So our data set right now is the hundred biggest
cities in the country and some places sent

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:24.160
us back almost entirely redacted policies,
some places, after a long battle we got them,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.690
and what we found are a couple of things:
one is that one of the things that we look

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.460
for is do you ban chokehold?

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.530
We know that there are almost no instances
where like it makes sense for an officer to

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.950
restrict somebody’s airway.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.930
We also found that there’s some slipperiness
that happens and New York City is a great

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.570
example of like chokeholds are banned in New
York City.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.780
“Eric Gardner,” the police would say,
“was not put me in a chokehold, he was put

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.260
in a stranglehold and strangleholds aren’t
banned in New York City.”

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.090
And you’re like people experience them all
the same, he still died.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.040
So we mapped that across places.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.180
We also map is there a continuum of force?

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.590
Is there like an officer has to use a verbal
warning then use something else?

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.330
There is a lot of places where there isn’t
a continuum, it’s sort of like you just

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.639
use force, and you’re like “Well that
doesn’t really make a lot of sense.”

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.550
We also mapped to look at: can you shoot in
moving cars?

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.889
What we find is that when you look at the
data the police would have you believe that

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.321
they respond, that they’re always responding
to bank robberies, like every single 911 call

00:06:18.321 --> 00:06:21.490
is a bank robbery, and the data just actually
doesn’t support that.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.730
So when you see some of the stuff that is
leading to these car chases it actually just

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.080
isn’t worth the collateral damage.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.960
It’s not worth somebody getting shot, their
legs still being on the gas, and them running

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.960
pedestrians over.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.340
Like none of it is worth it.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.860
Especially in a time where there’s like
helicopters, like if you wanted to find the

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.990
person you’re probably going to find them,
so we should ban shooting into moving vehicles.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.480
Like we are mapping all of these things so
that we can say to departments, A, we know

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.810
that there’s a problem in your city because
we have the data on police violence.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.730
B, there is structural things that you can
actually change that statistically suggest

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.780
that they’ll have a better outcome in those
places, so we mapped them.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.730
Does your partner have to intervene if they
see you using force unnecessarily?

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.910
We think that they should.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.880
Do you have to engage lesser force before
you use lethal force?

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.139
We think you should.

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:08.610
We’re up against a system that’s really
challenging.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.540
The police for decades have been taught something
called the 21-foot rule.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.600
I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of the
21-foot rule, but they get trained that if

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.490
somebody is within 21 feet of you they can
kill you.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.400
That’s like the rule that they get trained.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.022
So you’re like, why did you shoot the guy
with a knife?

00:07:24.022 --> 00:07:27.860
And they’re like “we were trained that
if they’re within 21 feet of us they can

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.030
run quick enough to kill you.”

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.060
And you’re like, who is making this stuff
up?

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.820
And like it’s been disproven.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.490
It’s like crackpot science, but those things
are actually like really dangerous and we

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.061
wanted to say :what are the policies and solutions
that either lead to these outcomes or that

00:07:40.061 --> 00:07:40.070
we can change?
