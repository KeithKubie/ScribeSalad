00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.664
So I'm here with Jessica Uelmen
who's the program manager for

00:00:02.664 --> 00:00:04.140
mobile nano-degrees here at Udacity.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.960
Thank you so much for
talking to us today.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, happy to be here.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.550
My pleasure.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.330
&gt;&gt; So the first thing I wanted to
ask you was, that there's this trend

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.650
in technology that the technology
industry tends to be very male-oriented.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.970
And there's this
perception that therefore,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.100
any educational technology that
comes out of the technology industry

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.650
will also be oriented more towards
male style ways of learning.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.490
So what can we do when we're designing
educational technology to make sure that

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.740
we're not preserving this trend
of it being by men for men?

00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:33.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a really tough question
and a tough thing to address, but

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.450
I think it really starts with awareness,
which is great to be here and

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.580
talking about it already.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.730
But, really scrutinizing and
looking at what's being designed,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.480
looking at things
through a neutral lens.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.415
Even getting feedback from women,
or from other teachers.

00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:57.890
Education as a field,
is primarily dominated by women.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.925
So it's kind of interesting that ed
tech then becomes more male skewed.

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:07.093
So I think if there's a way to sort
of start blending those worlds,

00:01:07.093 --> 00:01:10.335
we'll get to a little more diverse pool.

00:01:10.335 --> 00:01:12.953
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes a lot of sense,
I actually hadn't thought about

00:01:12.953 --> 00:01:16.275
that before, but you're right that with
technology it's very male oriented, but

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:18.146
teaching tends to be very
female oriented And so

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:20.436
there's a lot of great overlap there and
a lot of chance for

00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:22.780
collaboration as long as we
actually go out and do it.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.280
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.900
&gt;&gt; And talking to teachers I think
is something that anyone is on

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.020
the educational technology
needs to do more of anyway.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.620
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And so

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.530
now we kind of kill two
birds with one stone.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.100
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; So, but

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.250
given that we're probably not going to
change the entire industry in the next

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.970
four months.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.374
Of the students currently in the class,
what are some considerations they should

00:01:38.374 --> 00:01:41.435
make when they're developing their
tools besides possibly going out and

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:42.390
talking to teachers?

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.480
Are there any things
they can keep in mind?

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.710
&gt;&gt; I think maybe just even
surveying the landscape.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.620
I mean, there's also,
people do a lot of efforts for

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.240
putting educational technology
solutions towards women, and

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.520
a lot of times unfortunately,
that's like making it pink.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.220
So, let's not make it pink, okay?

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.770
But, looking at those solutions,
maybe seeing what they're doing and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.008
seeing how it might be able to
adapt to what they're building.

00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:11.400
&gt;&gt; And so I think that the other thing
that comes up here is that if our

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.650
ultimate goal is to make the technology
industry itself a little bit less

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.870
male dominated, the people in this class
will go on to careers in technology.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.650
What can they do when they're
in their future workplaces or

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.870
their current workplaces?

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.120
They can kind of try and
combat this trend a little bit.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.428
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I think the main thing
and something that I always push for

00:02:30.428 --> 00:02:33.920
is not necessarily making
a woman a commodity.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.565
It's not a hire because she's a woman,
or it's not collaborating because she's

00:02:38.565 --> 00:02:41.300
a woman, and
it's a very difficult thing to do.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.184
Because if you look at,
the percentages, and

00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:45.720
it's like wow,
there's not a whole lot of women here.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.210
We need to hire women, but
that's not always the best solution.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.780
And then when there are women in
the workplace in maybe leadership roles

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.550
making their impact more visible
externally and internally,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.610
will sort of help fill that role model
role that we are always talking about.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.316
We need more women in tech role models,
but doing so

00:03:09.316 --> 00:03:14.390
will then hopefully inspire more
people to pursue that as a field.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think there's a very
interesting alignment there between what

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.530
we deal with in industry, and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.690
what we actually deal with
here in the OMS program.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.765
That as I'm recording this, hopefully
it will change in future semesters.

00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:26.075
The OMS program is 90% male, and

00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:30.515
there's a tendency to think if it's 90%
male we just need to admit more women.

00:03:30.515 --> 00:03:31.675
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; But that's kind of,

00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:34.485
treating the symptom as the thing
to be treated as opposed to,

00:03:34.485 --> 00:03:36.735
it's a symptom of some underlying issue.

00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:40.612
And here the issue is appeal to women,
or if there are any obstacles that we're

00:03:40.612 --> 00:03:43.515
not really considering that
apply more to women than men.

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.732
Resolving those obstacles as
opposed to just, you know,

00:03:45.732 --> 00:03:47.915
changing admission criteria,
or something like that.

00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:48.895
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:52.915
And I think then, also, making things
a little bit more welcoming, or

00:03:52.915 --> 00:03:56.070
breaking down those like
a girl stereotypes.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.650
One of the things that
always pops into my head is

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.930
I majored in electrical engineering, and
so we had to take physics classes, and

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.610
it was my sophomore year, and
we were in a physics study group.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.760
It was me and a bunch of guys, because
that's the way it goes, and I was

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.200
helping them solve each of the problems,
and I was doing a lot of the teaching.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.060
And one of the guys piped up and
said hey,

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.735
are we going to let the girl
teach us how it's done.

00:04:19.735 --> 00:04:22.570
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And comments like that doesn't really

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.550
make for a welcoming environment, and
it's a very benign comment, right.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.200
It's not meant to be hurtful,
but it is uncomfortable.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.650
So just try to be aware of
those types of comments.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it plays some kind of
assumption that the assumptions really

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.460
need to be addressed.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.320
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Comment might be harmless but

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.770
what it's perpetuating is not.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.960
&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.100
&gt;&gt; Well, great.
Well, thank you much for

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.930
talking to us today.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah, my pleasure.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.865
Always happy to talk.

00:04:48.865 --> 00:04:49.444
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
