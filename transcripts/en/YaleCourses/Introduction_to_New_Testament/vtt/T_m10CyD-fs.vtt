1
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.100
While we're doing this week is talking,
extending our conversation.

2
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:10.101
We started last week about how was Paul used as a figure in early Christianity.

3
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.350
Today we're going to talk about the pastoral epistles,

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.750
which is first and second Timothy and Titus,

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.950
and then next time we'll talk about the acts of Paul and Thecla because these

6
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:24.951
are two practically opposite ways of interpreting Paul and using Paul.

7
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:27.240
That came about probably in the second century.

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.840
The pastoral epistles are called pastoral because it presents Paul as writing to

9
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.920
Timothy and Titus,
two of his followers,

10
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.630
but he's telling them how to be good pastors of a church.
He's in fact,

11
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:46.410
he's also doing something like almost acting like they're going to be something.

12
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:48.270
What would ads would become a bishop.

13
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.890
They're supposed to also be appointing other people as pastors of Churches,

14
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:57.030
so we call these the pastoral epistles because it presents Paul as himself

15
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.920
serving in a sort of pastoral role for his churches and assigning Timothy and

16
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:06.921
Titus pastoral roles for his charges also and establishing leadership positions.

17
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.190
What kind of leadership structures he wants to go on in the churches.

18
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.420
Most of us scholars believe that these letters are synonymous.

19
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.800
We don't believe Paul wrote them.

20
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.570
There's been some question in the last several years that may be the actual

21
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:25.500
historical Paul wrote Second Timothy Because Second Timothy,

22
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.790
uh,

23
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.330
looks sort of like a last will and testament of Paul that he may have written in

24
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:33.840
prison.
I and then,
but I don't tend to buy that.

25
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:36.480
I tend to group all three of them together as being probably about the same

26
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.310
author and all being synonymous.
Why do we think they're synonymous?
We all,
again,

27
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:43.360
as we saw with feeds and Collagen's,

28
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.240
the writing style in these letters is very different from the seven letters that

29
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.500
scholars all agree Paul actually wrote.
So the writing style is a big issue,

30
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.150
but as I'll show today,

31
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.710
there is a lot of way of seeing that these letters simply presuppose a different

32
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:00.450
stage in early Christianity.

33
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.910
They don't look like they're from the more primitive sort of time of when Paul

34
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:09.960
was actually founding churches.
So the,
the theology looks different.

35
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.350
This church structure looks different as I'll talk about,
uh,

36
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.910
positions on the household,
on marriage,
on slavery,
on family,
on women.

37
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.800
All of these things are different.

38
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.160
So I'm using the pastoral epistles in this lecture as one illustration of how

39
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.820
Christianity changes in different trajectories.

40
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.840
One trajectory becomes a very much pro household.

41
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.400
The traditional Roman style or Greco Roman family,
uh,

42
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.910
is promoted as the Christian way for families to be.

43
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:46.911
And even the church itself is molded to look like a household with the potter

44
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:52.080
Familias,
the head of the household and top women below that,
children in slaves.

45
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:54.990
Below that when we get to the acts of Paul and Beckla,

46
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.500
we'll see that that interpretation of Paul makes Paul anti household.

47
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.120
He actually is presented as going around preaching against marriage,
against sex,

48
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.590
against the Roman household,

49
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.950
and preaching a very kind of hierarchical disrupting,

50
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.850
even s city Polis,

51
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.870
disrupting gospel and certainly a household and family disrupting apostle.

52
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.420
So these two trajectories of Pauline Christianity show the diversity of

53
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:25.810
Christianity as it,
as it developed and even how they used the same figure,

54
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.340
Paul as founder of Christianity,
uh,
in radically different ways.

55
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.740
When did these letters come about?
It's everybody's guests.
I act,

56
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.770
I actually tend to think that the pastoral epistles were probably written

57
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.000
sometime in the second century and maybe even toward the middle of the second

58
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:47.290
century.
That's a bit later than a lot of scholars would put them.
Uh,

59
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:50.290
and we're just guessing.
Anyway.
We sort of have to imagine,
uh,

60
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:52.540
what kind of level of early Christianity,

61
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:55.550
what kind of phase of early Christianity do we imagine,
uh,

62
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.210
taking place before we can get this kind of a letter,
uh,

63
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.780
with this kind of theology and church structure written?

64
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.730
It is interesting that when we talked about Marcien early member,
the,
the,

65
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.320
the heretic in Rome who made his own first Canon list of New Testament books,

66
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.220
remember he included Luke as his gospel and his own edited version of it and

67
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.510
included the letters of Paul and marshy.

68
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.010
We don't have any evidence that Marsha and actually knew about these three

69
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.720
letters.
First,
second Timothy and Titus.

70
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.740
If Martian was riding in the middle of the second century,

71
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.130
maybe Marcien if he didn't mention them,
maybe he didn't know them.

72
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:33.780
And maybe that's evidenced that they weren't yet highly circulated a.

73
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.280
So that's one of the things that people have talked about the dating of these

74
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:38.470
letters since Marcy and didn't seem to know them.

75
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.670
Perhaps they were either just being written or not long written around the

76
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:47.170
middle of the second century.
What this author,
the first,

77
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:52.171
let me back up because I want to go through Paul really quickly and talk about,

78
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.690
uh,
what Paul's own view of the household is.

79
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:57.970
Look with me in First Corinthians seven.

80
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.640
We're going to review some things that we've gone on before,

81
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:03.870
but keep your bibles in front of you.
So look at first Corinthians seven.

82
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:08.803
<v 1>Okay.</v>

83
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.490
<v 0>Frustrating in [inaudible] 71 concerning the matters about what you wrote it as</v>

84
00:05:13.491 --> 00:05:18.290
well for a man,
not to touch a woman,
but because of cases of sexual immorality,

85
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.110
each man should have his own wife and each woman,
her own husband,

86
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.660
the husband should give his wife her conjugal rights.

87
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.590
Likewise the wife to her husband.
Notice how Paul balances these things.

88
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.040
He tells basically the man you have control of the body of your wife.

89
00:05:31.041 --> 00:05:34.070
But he also tells to the woman you have control of the body of your husband.

90
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.240
So there's something of a reciprocity in First Corinthians seven,

91
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.160
this will be important because that kind of reciprocity doesn't exist when you

92
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:47.910
get to the pastoral epistles.
So that's one thing to notice.
Um,

93
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.190
do not verse five,

94
00:05:49.191 --> 00:05:52.370
do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time to devote

95
00:05:52.371 --> 00:05:53.210
yourselves to prayer,

96
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.480
come together again so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self

97
00:05:56.481 --> 00:06:00.260
control.
This I say by way of concession,
not of command,
I wish,

98
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.860
I wish that all were as I myself am,
but each has a particular gift from God.

99
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.230
One having one kind and another different kind.
Notice.

100
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:09.500
He's basically saying have sex within marriage.

101
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.240
He's not condemning sex,

102
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.550
but he really prefers that all Christians be single like he himself is.

103
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.550
So Paul's preference is not marriage and sex and sex within marriage hit.

104
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.200
That's a concession that he gives for people that he says can't control

105
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:27.740
themselves.
Uh,
to the unmarried and widows.

106
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:30.740
I say that as well for them to remain unmarried as I am.

107
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:33.350
But if they are not practicing self control,
they should marry.

108
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.060
It is better to marry than to burn is what the Greek actually says is better to

109
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.600
marry than to burn.
And that's been an interesting question with scholars.

110
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.620
What does it mean by burned?

111
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.690
Does it mean burn in hell that it's better than Mary,

112
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:48.350
that that'd be tempted to sin a with sex outside of marriage and then you'd burn

113
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:49.040
in hell.

114
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.300
I've argued that what he means is burn with desire because it was very common in

115
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:57.740
ancient Greek culture to portray any kind of erotic desire as actually a

116
00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:00.560
physical burning.
They even portrayed it as a disease.

117
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.580
When you start having that itchy feeling that we all know so well,

118
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.130
that's because your body is actually heating up.

119
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.680
And that's what causes that desire.
So they,
in the ancient Greek doctors,
uh,

120
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.770
Greek and Roman doctors gave all kinds of prescriptions to people too,

121
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.700
to keep them to control that burning so they can control their erotic desire

122
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:21.770
because they felt like it made you actually unhealthy.

123
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.790
It was desire was unhealthy and sexual activity was dangerous.

124
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.100
So this was a concern throughout the ancient world.

125
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.400
And I think that's what Paul is talking about and what I've argued in and have,

126
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.670
uh,
argued this in my Corinthian body book and a few other places,

127
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.380
is that Paul actually prefers that people avoid sex entirely.

128
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:42.680
Christians avoid checks entirely if they can avoid sex entirely and they're

129
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:44.600
starting to have sexual desire burning in them,

130
00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:47.720
and that gets dangerous than they should get married and have sex.

131
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.480
But he only to decrease the burning.

132
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.660
What Paul wants is for them to experience sexual intercourse,

133
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.110
even in marriage without any erotic desire.

134
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.320
That's kind of a radical idea,

135
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:02.170
but I believe that's actually what Paul is teaching here.

136
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.350
That he can seize it possible that Christians could have sex without

137
00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:08.870
experiencing desire.
And that's his goal.

138
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.310
So notice Paul doesn't have a very positive view of sex.
Uh,

139
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:17.100
even within marriage,
it's a concession.
He allows people and notice,

140
00:08:17.101 --> 00:08:20.420
and none of this passage does,
he hit talk at all about having kids.

141
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.650
Sexuality for Paul is not to make children in,

142
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:26.150
in Paul's own letters set.

143
00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:30.950
You have sex in marriage only to keep you from desiring.
That's Paul's concern.

144
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.680
That will change later.

145
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.820
So that's one place where we also saw in first Thessalonians four if you'll

146
00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:40.010
remember,
we had the same kind of thing there.

147
00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:42.890
Paul is just talking to the men of the congregation and he says,

148
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.670
don't you start wanting your brother's wife?

149
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.810
She calls him,
is his their school offs,
your vessel.
He says each part,

150
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.250
each of you should have your own vessel.

151
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.040
And the debate is whether he's talking about their genitalia,

152
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.430
which is one possible interpretation with the Greek or their wife's body,

153
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.470
which is another possible interpretation of the Greek.

154
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.710
But for Paul in First Thessalonians four he's telling men also control yourself

155
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:10.080
and he says,
not in passion of desire like the gentiles.

156
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.370
So there again in first Thessalonians four Paul is really concerned that that

157
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:19.371
Thessalonians disciples are not lusting after their co,

158
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.760
their fellow Christians,

159
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.850
wife whole keep your own vessel and that's how you control yourself.

160
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.580
And notice again,
he's excluding the idea of passion and desire.

161
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.580
It just does not have a part in it.
So this is,

162
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.300
I admit this is kind of a radical argument and there's a lot of people out there

163
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:37.620
who haven't bought my argument,

164
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:40.410
but that seems to me to be precisely what the text is saying.

165
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.620
Paul never allows for a good notion of sexual pleasure or sexual desire.

166
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.300
He seems to want to exclude it in order to keep you from experiencing desire and

167
00:09:51.301 --> 00:09:53.580
he believes that you can do that even by having sex.

168
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.260
So in those ways we see Paul is not anti marriage.
Exactly,

169
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.760
but he's certainly not pro marriage and he's not anti-sex exactly,

170
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.650
but he certainly is not pro sex.

171
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.980
The one thing he does seem to be anti is desire,

172
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.960
sexual desire.
All right,
what is Paul's,
where do women fit in all this?

173
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.100
I pointed out that in first,
Chris,

174
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.020
first Thessalonians four Paul doesn't seem to tinker.

175
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.540
Think about women at all there.
In fact,

176
00:10:19.541 --> 00:10:23.240
they even propose when I lectured on first Thessalonians that by the time wrote,

177
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.620
Paul wrote that letter,
which is one of his earliest letters,

178
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:27.330
maybe the earliest letter we have in the Canon.

179
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.260
Paul May have been conceiving of the Christian group as being sort of a male

180
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:34.200
club because that's the way he tends,
tends to be talking to them,

181
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.440
a male club of mainly working class manual laborers.

182
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.800
That's changed by the time we get to first Corinthians,
right?

183
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.680
Because Paul directly talks about women a lot.

184
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.270
He sees women as being in something like a co relationship with their husbands

185
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:50.430
and sexual activity.
In First Corinthians seven,

186
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.480
he addresses women as leaders of churches at times.

187
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.140
So by the time Paul writes,
First Corinthians,
uh,

188
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.980
women very much are acknowledged as an important part of his churches.

189
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:06.390
Let's see what he says though.
Uh,
well,

190
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.640
but in First Corinthians 11,
look there

191
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.380
he's not,

192
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.650
he doesn't have women on a completely equal stance with men.

193
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.980
It's apparently in first Corinthians 11,
he says,

194
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.070
I commend you because you remember me and everything and maintain the traditions

195
00:11:23.071 --> 00:11:24.450
just as I handed them onto you.

196
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.380
But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man and the

197
00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:31.590
husband is the head of the wife of God is the head of the,
of the church.

198
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.460
There is a clear hierarchy there and Paul goes on to talk about what this is

199
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:38.520
going to have to do with women veiling their heads when they pray in prophecy,

200
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.870
which is another very complicated and and uh,
uh,

201
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.360
controversial passage in Paul,

202
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.160
but it's clear that Paul views just as he views God as the head of Christ,

203
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:54.010
that is Christ to being somewhat inferior person compared to God the father.

204
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.690
So women are inferior position with regard to their husbands.

205
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.590
So the Greek words here are not there,

206
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.300
they're just the word for man and woman.

207
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.590
But since the Greek doesn't have special terms for husband and wife,

208
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.600
when are you see a Greek turn like this?

209
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:12.610
In this context you have to make the decision,

210
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.840
are you going to translate this as man or woman and make this a generic kind of

211
00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:21.841
idea that women in general are supposed to be subordinated to men in general or

212
00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:25.570
do you take the terms and translated them husband and wife?

213
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.530
Both signs license are fine as far as the Greek Ngos and then you're taking that

214
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.700
sort of inferiority subordination complex to be something that's talking about

215
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:38.560
with husbands and wives.
Look at first Corinthians 14

216
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:41.563
<v 1>okay,</v>

217
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.220
<v 0>get verse 33</v>

218
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.350
as in all the churches of the saints,

219
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.920
women should be silent in the churches for they are not permitted to speak but

220
00:12:53.921 --> 00:12:57.820
should be subordinate as the law also says if there is anything they desire to

221
00:12:57.821 --> 00:12:59.650
know,
let them ask their husbands at home.

222
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.430
British shameful for a woman to speak in church or did the word of God originate

223
00:13:03.431 --> 00:13:07.480
with you or are you the only ones it has reached.
That's odd.

224
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.450
He seems to be telling women not to speak in church at all.

225
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.990
Although previously you'd given instructions for how they could pray and

226
00:13:13.991 --> 00:13:18.430
prophesy in church as long as they are wearing a veil.
What is going on here?

227
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.560
And also then this,
doesn't this have something to say?

228
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.150
Does have some something going to conflict with Galatians three 28 which is a

229
00:13:25.151 --> 00:13:30.040
famous verse in which Paul says,
in Christ there is no June our Greek.

230
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:34.210
There's no ma,
Ma a free or slave.
There's no male and female.

231
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.670
Now,
that verse has been interpreted,

232
00:13:36.671 --> 00:13:41.671
especially since the 1970s as teaching that Paul taught the equality of men and

233
00:13:42.131 --> 00:13:44.890
women in Christ.
In Christ.
There is no male and female.

234
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.900
Doesn't that mean they're equal?
Yes sir.

235
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.980
Galatians three 28 so this has been the,

236
00:13:51.981 --> 00:13:55.090
that an argument.
This is why I'm,
I'm talking about the stuff.

237
00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.640
Those of you who are writing papers this week need to talk about,

238
00:13:57.641 --> 00:13:59.350
but notice this is complex.

239
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.320
You got Galatians three 28 that looks like an egalitarian statement except a

240
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:08.360
very famous biblical scholar.
Hm.

241
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.860
Wrote an article arguing that Galatians three 28 is not an egalitarian statement

242
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.600
because Paul was talking about in the resurrection human being,

243
00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:24.040
Christians will be Androgens,
that they'll be male,
female,

244
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:28.390
uh,
combinations.
And in that male,
female combination,

245
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.540
the masculinity is still superior to femininity even in the androgen body of the

246
00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:35.254
resurrection.

247
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:41.970
So that's is is Galatians three 28 and a gala Terrian statement by Paul.

248
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:47.320
Some people say yes.
Is it not an egalitarian statement by Paul?

249
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:52.430
I say it's not,
but that's a complicated argument also.

250
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.960
And if first it's Galatians three 28 is an egalitarian statement,

251
00:14:56.961 --> 00:15:01.040
how does that fit then with this first Corinthians 14 passage where Paul seemed

252
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:05.240
to be saying women should be silent in church and and be subordinate.

253
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.130
Ask Your husband at home.
Did you,

254
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.570
do any of you noticed that those verses I just read in first [inaudible] 14 are

255
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:14.780
in some translations in brackets in parentheses.

256
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.810
How many people have a translation of First Corinthians 1434 through 36 that's

257
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:22.670
in either brackets or parenthesis.
Raise your hand.

258
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.690
How many people have a translation where they're not in brackets or parenthesis?

259
00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:28.580
Anybody.
Okay,

260
00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:32.630
so some of you don't have them in brackets that's showing you that these editors

261
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.450
are not sure whether that was actually part of the original letter.

262
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.870
There's a dispute here.
If you looked at your footnote,
so your Bible,

263
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.970
your footnotes might even say some ancient authorities don't include this or

264
00:15:43.971 --> 00:15:46.130
include these verses in a different place.

265
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.000
And so this is the issue and we do have some Greek texts,

266
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.360
some Greek manuscripts that either don't have these verses or have them in a

267
00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:56.930
different place in the text.
Well,
how would that happen?
Well,

268
00:15:56.931 --> 00:16:01.931
the idea goes that some scribe at some point was copying over first Corinthians

269
00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:10.961
14 and got to the point where this isn't a text and wrote out in the margin,

270
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.090
well wait a minute,
this is not right.

271
00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:17.330
Because of course it describes are living at a later time when women definitely,

272
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:19.400
we're in a more inferior position in churches.

273
00:16:19.401 --> 00:16:21.980
They couldn't be priest that couldn't be bishops in this sort of thing.

274
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.730
And that scribe writes in,
well,
no,
of course women can't do that.

275
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.900
So there's a little note that occurs there on the margins of the text.

276
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.220
Other scribes come along and find this manuscript and they decide,

277
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.630
well that shouldn't be out here in the margin.

278
00:16:35.631 --> 00:16:39.830
That should go into the text someplace.
So one scribe copying it over,

279
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.540
puts that extra expert in this part of the text and another one puts it in this

280
00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:47.990
part of the text in different places and then those manuscripts were copied over

281
00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:51.500
by other scribes and you end up with the Greek manuscripts with this little,

282
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:56.530
these verses in different places in First Corinthians 14 so some scholars have

283
00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:02.600
said that all looks like those verses that teach the subordination of women in

284
00:17:02.601 --> 00:17:05.960
First Corinthians 14 we're not originally by Paul,

285
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:11.470
but we're a later scribal interpolation insertion into the text.

286
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.710
Others,
other scholars disagree with that and they think that these two verses,

287
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:19.130
these verses were original with first graders,
14 in other words,

288
00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:21.410
I've given you a lot of problems to deal with.

289
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:23.810
If you're going to talk about what was Paul's view of women,

290
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.510
you've got to figure out what,

291
00:17:26.511 --> 00:17:28.670
what do you think Galatians three 28 really teaches?

292
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:33.260
Is that at a gala Terrian statement or not is first Corinthians 14 these verses

293
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.270
that part of Paul's original teaching or not?

294
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:40.550
And then you've got the situation where in like Romans 16 several verses in

295
00:17:40.551 --> 00:17:44.780
Romans 16 Paul actually addresses women as leaders of churches.

296
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.800
So there are places where Paul is willing to talk to women as leaders of

297
00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:49.620
churches.
In fact,

298
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:54.620
one of the verse in First Corinthians 16 Paul addresses to people and drawn to

299
00:17:54.901 --> 00:17:58.200
cuss and Julia and he says,

300
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.910
these are esteemed among the apostles,
among the apostles.

301
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.360
That sounds like he's actually saying that Andronicus and Junia are themselves

302
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:08.980
apostles.
So,
and Paul thinks he him,

303
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.330
the apostles in Paul's view doesn't include just the 12 right?

304
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:16.320
Because he thinks he's an apostle and he's not one of the 12th so the p the word

305
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:21.321
apostle for Paul is wider than the 12 and it refers to people who go out and

306
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:23.160
spread the gospel.

307
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:28.670
So apparently Paul is calling to people Andronicus and Junia Apostles in Roman

308
00:18:29.171 --> 00:18:32.340
16.
Interestingly enough,
that word Julia,

309
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.700
that might be in your translation as Julia nowadays,

310
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.200
but in older English versions,
it was translated as Junius,

311
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.700
which would be a man's name in Latin.
If you add an s on that word,

312
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:48.090
it looks like a man's name.
If you don't have the s,
it looks like a woman's name.

313
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.240
And there was debate among scholars about how to translate it.

314
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.290
It looks the same basically in Greek because of the way the word curves in the

315
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:57.390
sentence.
But when you translate it,

316
00:18:57.391 --> 00:18:59.370
it are you going to make it a man's name or a woman's name?

317
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.540
And people had always made it a man's name.
Why?
Because scholars just thought,

318
00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:06.860
of course,
all these scholars are men themselves.
Throughout hundreds of years,

319
00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:11.220
they thought,
well,
you can't have a woman apostle,
so it must be a man's name.

320
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.780
And in the 70s,
some feminist feel,
uh,

321
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.510
biblical scholars came along and pointed up that Junius is a very,
very,

322
00:19:18.511 --> 00:19:20.340
very rare man's name.

323
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.760
But Julia is a very common woman's name and argued again through textual

324
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:29.130
criticism that Paul originally was addressing a woman Julia,

325
00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.700
and now you have basically most scholars admitting that this is a woman.

326
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.020
It's a woman's name.

327
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.070
Paul was addressing a man Andronicus and a woman Julia and calling them both

328
00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:42.340
apostles.
There's some,
there's some uh,
evidence.

329
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:47.100
Depaul actually doesn't have such a negative view of women if he's going to

330
00:19:47.101 --> 00:19:49.080
allow them to have leadership roles in his churches.

331
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:54.030
So you got Paul and rather confusing situation is Paul's a feminist,

332
00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:00.270
is e four Egalitarian,
uh,
theology with women,

333
00:20:00.271 --> 00:20:01.104
men and women.

334
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.200
How does this relate to these different issues that come in and put his letters?

335
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.950
But those are Paul's basic views of both divorce,
I mean a,

336
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:12.970
both a marriage and the family and sex and the roles of women and often in early

337
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:17.400
Christianity in the history of Christianity,
these two things go together.
What a,

338
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:21.510
what a text is going to teach about the role of women in the church and in the

339
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:24.750
world often has something to do with what it teaches about the family.

340
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:29.430
And most of the time when a text is really,
really pro-family,

341
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.660
they teach the subordination of women more directly.

342
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.450
And when they're antifamily,

343
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.760
they often tend to allow women bigger roles in their congregations.

344
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.680
So it's kind of a pairing that goes along,

345
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.100
and that's exactly what we'll see this week when we see the pastoral epistles

346
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:52.530
that take Paul down the pro family anti-woman route and the acts of Paul and

347
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:54.190
Thecla,

348
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:59.190
which takes Paul down the antifamily pro woman route.

349
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.980
Okay,
so let's look at the pastorals first.

350
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.490
What does this author in First Timothy attacking,

351
00:21:06.491 --> 00:21:09.730
and I'm gonna say most of my time in first Timothy because that's where I can

352
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:10.600
get these examples.

353
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.660
A lot of this stuff occurs in the letter to Titus also because the letter to

354
00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:16.870
Titus repeats a lot of the stuff that's in the first letter of Timothy

355
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.450
in one three.

356
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.220
I urge you as I did when I was in on my way to Macedonia to remain in FSS so

357
00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:27.700
that you might instruct certain people not to teach any different doctrine,

358
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:33.340
not to occupy themselves with myths and endless genealogies that promote

359
00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:36.220
speculations rather than the divine training that is known by faith.

360
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.860
So myths and vain discussions and genealogies.
Uh,
he,

361
00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:44.500
in seven he talks about godless and silly myths.

362
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.250
Titus one 10 and 14 also.

363
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:52.210
And then he also in Titus says that he's against people who are teaching

364
00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:56.880
circumcision and Jewish myths.
He calls him,
well,

365
00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.380
what are these myths?
Well,
we're not really sure.

366
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:04.420
Are these sort of a gnostic type myths about different,

367
00:22:04.421 --> 00:22:08.050
many different gods doing things and having to placate those gods in order to

368
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:12.070
reach the highest God.
As we've seen in some gnostic texts,
uh,

369
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.220
that we talked about earlier in the semester,
we don't know,

370
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.200
but there's some kind of stories about either angels or Gods that some people

371
00:22:20.201 --> 00:22:25.060
are teaching and this author's writing against it and some and some aspect of

372
00:22:25.061 --> 00:22:29.230
somethings Jewish about this.
He doesn't like.
Look at four first Timothy four one

373
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.103
<v 1>yeah.</v>

374
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:38.010
<v 0>Now the spirit expressly says that in later times,
in the latter days,</v>

375
00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:42.750
some will renounce the faith by paying attention to deceitful spirits and

376
00:22:42.751 --> 00:22:47.670
teachings of demons through hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared with

377
00:22:47.671 --> 00:22:48.504
a hot iron.

378
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:53.520
They forbid marriage and demand abstinence from foods which God created to be

379
00:22:53.521 --> 00:22:56.580
received with Thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.

380
00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:01.020
So this author is against people who are challenging marriage.

381
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.290
He's against people who are challenged,

382
00:23:03.291 --> 00:23:07.110
who are promoting some kind of ascetic behavior with regard to foods or avoiding

383
00:23:07.111 --> 00:23:09.990
certain kinds of foods.
Is this cash route?

384
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.440
Maybe he's talking about people who are teaching people not to eat pork,

385
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.570
not to eat shellfish.
Are they teaching Jewish food laws?
He's not explicit.

386
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.290
So he's against people who are teaching that he's against people who are

387
00:23:22.291 --> 00:23:26.820
forbidding marriage and teaching any kind of dietary restrictions.

388
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.910
Look at five 23

389
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:31.463
<v 1>okay,</v>

390
00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.850
<v 0>this is when he tells Timothy,
no longer drink only water,</v>

391
00:23:36.851 --> 00:23:39.910
but take a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.

392
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.290
Why is he at to tell somebody to drink some wine and not just drink water?
Well,

393
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:48.590
because there were a sedex who taught to avoid wine in the angel world.

394
00:23:48.591 --> 00:23:52.520
That was one of those things that very strict ascetics might decide to avoid was

395
00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:56.780
wine and rich food.
So this author says to Timothy,
nope,

396
00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.010
you should drink wine.

397
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.860
This was our favorite verse when I grew up in a church that didn't allow

398
00:24:00.861 --> 00:24:04.820
drinking.
Of course,
I always like to throw this back at the elders of the church.

399
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:13.210
Look at six 21st Timothy six 20 Timothy Guard.

400
00:24:15.141 --> 00:24:16.490
What has been entrusted to you?

401
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:21.560
Avoid the profane chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called
knowledge.

402
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.270
What is the Greek word for knowledge?
Pardon?

403
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:32.040
No,
exactly.
See,

404
00:24:32.041 --> 00:24:34.020
you're getting more than you paid for in this course.

405
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.550
You didn't know you were going to learn Greek.

406
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:41.610
You get in some good cocktail party information and even some Greek language.

407
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:46.560
So gnosis is the word for knowledge here.
And uh,

408
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.980
this guy saying he's attacking people who are going around boasting about

409
00:24:49.981 --> 00:24:53.550
falsely called knowledge.
Again,
that's led some scholars to say,

410
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:58.290
is he talking about some kind of gnosticism?
Is that what he's opposing?

411
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.490
That would go along with this idea that they're using this word gnosis in ways

412
00:25:02.491 --> 00:25:06.510
he doesn't like their teaching myths.
They're teaching asceticism.

413
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.640
They're teaching the voting to marriage.
Well,

414
00:25:08.641 --> 00:25:11.640
that does look a bit like early other,
early Christian,

415
00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.290
second century Christian groups,

416
00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.990
some of whom their opponents would call gnostics,

417
00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.290
but we don't have enough information to be ready to,
easy to tell them.

418
00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:24.120
Now look at one more text.
This is second Timothy two 18.

419
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:27.933
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

420
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.990
<v 0>Oh,
let's see.
Yeah.
He's talking about,</v>

421
00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.950
he's actually giving some names of people he doesn't like in two 18 says these

422
00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:44.000
people have swerved from the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already

423
00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:46.940
taken place.
Hi,
he's,
he's contending that.

424
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:52.300
So remember how I even talked about with Collagen's in Ephesians last time you

425
00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:54.840
had this idea that uh,

426
00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.310
they almost sound like the resurrection has already taken place in your baptism

427
00:25:58.311 --> 00:25:58.671
with Christ.

428
00:25:58.671 --> 00:26:03.200
You had been raised with Christ and maybe there are other people running around

429
00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:06.290
the second century Christians saying that you've already been raised from the

430
00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:09.620
dead.
You've already expensed resurrection.
This author really condense that.

431
00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:12.380
He wants to say,
no,
the resurrection hasn't taken place yet.

432
00:26:12.381 --> 00:26:16.790
So he's condemning you can false teachers for all kinds of,
uh,

433
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.640
different activities and teachings that he doesn't like.

434
00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:24.090
So we're seeing a definite split here between different kinds of pollinization.

435
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.780
There's a pollen isn't represented by these texts,

436
00:26:26.781 --> 00:26:30.920
which is pro family pro-marriage,
uh,
pro procreation.

437
00:26:30.921 --> 00:26:32.470
We'll talk about see later that he's,

438
00:26:32.471 --> 00:26:35.900
he's for having children and mentions as explicitly,
um,

439
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.170
anti asceticism against,
uh,
you know,

440
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.950
con forcing people to control what they eat on these sorts of things.

441
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:47.760
And this idea about maybe Jewish myths being something and the teaching of the

442
00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:48.594
resurrection.

443
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:54.570
First Timothy one nine then gets us into another issue.

444
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.250
What is the law and what is this authors take on it?

445
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:05.940
One nine.
This means that one eight I'll start this verse eight.

446
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:09.990
Now we know that the law is good if one uses it legitimately.
Now of course,

447
00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:13.050
that can be quotation right out of Romans,
right?
Because Romans itself has,

448
00:27:13.051 --> 00:27:14.280
Paul says,
the law is good.

449
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:18.750
This means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent,

450
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.810
but for the lawless and disobedient for the godless and sinful,

451
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.410
for the unholy and profane for those who killed their father or mother or

452
00:27:25.411 --> 00:27:29.460
murderers,
fornicators,
sodomites,
slave traders,
liars,
perjurers,
whatever else,

453
00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:32.160
contrary to sound teaching that contradicts the Gracious,

454
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.340
the Glorious Gospel of the blessed God,
which he entrusted to me.

455
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:40.200
Notice this guy doesn't have really a problem with the law that we've seen

456
00:27:40.201 --> 00:27:41.490
sometimes in Paul's writings.

457
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.820
The law is basically just a set of rules in that designed to keep people who

458
00:27:47.011 --> 00:27:50.190
can't control themselves in line.
And in fact,

459
00:27:50.191 --> 00:27:52.860
he goes on to say that if you're a good person,

460
00:27:52.861 --> 00:27:54.240
you don't even need to worry about the law.

461
00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:59.370
Now this is again different from what Paul's view is.
Paul did not want his,

462
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:04.230
his gentile followers to keep the Jewish law,
and Paul said in Romans,

463
00:28:04.231 --> 00:28:06.990
the law is good,
but Paul,
for Paul,

464
00:28:06.991 --> 00:28:11.610
the law is still this cosmic entity almost that that was invaded history.

465
00:28:11.611 --> 00:28:13.500
This is very much Galatians memory.
When we,

466
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.240
I gave the lecture on Galatians and Romans,

467
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:19.710
I talked about how that the Jewish law for Paul is not simply a list of rules.

468
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.910
It was this thing that came into the cosmos as an invader.

469
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:28.070
It enslaved humanity.
It was the pedagogue that you know,

470
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.160
swatted humanity down when humanity was in its child,
childish state.

471
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.770
The law is,
is obeying.

472
00:28:34.771 --> 00:28:38.910
The law for Paul is equal to trying to worship this Stoy Kayah of the cosmos,

473
00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.060
these elemental spirits of the universe.

474
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.990
So the law for Paul isn't simply a list of rules.

475
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:50.860
The law for Paul is a very ambiguous cosmic entity.
It's almost,

476
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:54.660
it's just mythological in a sense for Paul,
for this author,

477
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.830
that's not what the law is,
the law.
You don't need to obey it.
He says,

478
00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:03.390
and he's against,
uh,
teaching his gentile converts to keep the Jewish law.

479
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.320
But he just says it's not important.
It's only for people who,
who are sinners,

480
00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:09.660
who can't control themselves.
As long as you're not a center,

481
00:29:09.661 --> 00:29:12.870
as long as you don't do this list of things that I can give you,

482
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.670
you don't need to concern yourself about the law.

483
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:19.470
So this is another one of the reasons that people like me say this is not Paul

484
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:24.060
writing.
People who believe Paul wrote these letters would say,
well,

485
00:29:24.061 --> 00:29:28.020
they're written years later,
is to a different context.
And Paul changed his mind,

486
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:31.860
or Paul's nuancing his message differently for a different context.

487
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.500
So there are scholars who would defend these letters are being by Paul and

488
00:29:34.501 --> 00:29:35.370
that's what they would say.

489
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:40.850
I look at and I say that's so not like Paul is a totally different view of the

490
00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:45.940
law and its role in the cosmos.
Then you see in Romans or Galatians,

491
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:49.450
which is another piece of evidence for me that Paul's not the author of this

492
00:29:49.451 --> 00:29:50.284
letter.

493
00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.080
<v 1>Okay,</v>

494
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.180
<v 0>pulse.
The strategy then of this author,</v>

495
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.500
he's trying to argue against all kinds of myths and practices that that somebody

496
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.480
going through Paul's churches and teaching,

497
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:06.130
so he writes a letter in Paul's name seemingly addressed to this,

498
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:10.420
to Paul's follower Timothy and he lays out what he doesn't like about that,

499
00:30:10.421 --> 00:30:11.131
but that's not the all,

500
00:30:11.131 --> 00:30:15.640
all of his strategy because what is his strategy for combating these things that

501
00:30:15.641 --> 00:30:17.500
he considers false teachings.

502
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.490
First he makes the church itself a household.

503
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.700
Now this is where all that lecturing,

504
00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.880
the first part of the semester when I talked over an argument,

505
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.320
what is the patriarchal household?
What is the Roman household?

506
00:30:29.321 --> 00:30:31.990
Was the potter Familias?
What is the structure of the household?

507
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.060
What is the patron client relationship?

508
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.870
What is the role of wives and women in the household and children and slaves?

509
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.650
All of that was because when you get to some of these are aspects of early

510
00:30:41.651 --> 00:30:42.484
Christianity.

511
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:47.140
This author is using the Roman household as the model for the church itself.

512
00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.780
That wasn't the way Paul did it,
right?

513
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:54.820
Paul never talked about the church as if it just had the same structure of a

514
00:30:54.821 --> 00:30:55.654
household.

515
00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.430
He didn't talk about men always being on top of the leadership organization and

516
00:31:00.431 --> 00:31:04.030
he doesn't,
didn't promote marriage very much.
What this author does,

517
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.980
three 15

518
00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.380
I hope to come.

519
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.100
This is three 14 first Timothy three 14 I hope to come to you soon,

520
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.010
but I'm riding these instructions to you so that if I'm delayed,

521
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:22.510
you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God,

522
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.570
which is the Church of the living God,
the pillar and bulwark of the truth.

523
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.200
The church is the household of God.

524
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.790
That same thing happens in first Timothy five the beginning of [inaudible] 85 do

525
00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:37.750
not speak harshly to an older man.
Speak to him as a father to younger men,

526
00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:39.190
as brothers to older women,

527
00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:42.040
as mothers to younger women as sisters with absolute purity.

528
00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.040
Notice he's got everybody in the church has some familial role.

529
00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:49.870
Older guys are fathers.
You're a younger men in the Church of your brothers,

530
00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.210
younger women's sisters,
older women,
mothers,

531
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.640
everybody has a household role in the church.
This is different.
We,

532
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.240
we might think this is automatic,

533
00:31:58.241 --> 00:32:01.840
but notice this is not treating the church as an Ekklesia,

534
00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:06.310
that Greek word that we translate church.
Where did the term Ekklesia come from?

535
00:32:06.311 --> 00:32:08.500
Do you remember?
In Greek,

536
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.680
what does the term Ekklesia originally referred to in classical Greek,

537
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.680
the assembly of the city.

538
00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.700
It's the assembly of the city state that came together for political purposes

539
00:32:18.701 --> 00:32:23.390
into vote.
It comes out of the Greek democracy with its notions of,

540
00:32:23.391 --> 00:32:27.760
of uh,
of some,
some kind of equality among citizens and all that.

541
00:32:27.761 --> 00:32:29.530
At least the men citizens getting a vote.

542
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:35.070
So it's important that early Christians for some reason chose this word Ekklesia

543
00:32:35.531 --> 00:32:37.660
to describe their house churches.

544
00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.660
It was an outsider with might've thought this is kind of ridiculous.

545
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.291
You're using.

546
00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:46.910
The term that people would have heard is the town assembly for a few people who

547
00:32:46.911 --> 00:32:50.750
can fit into one dining room.
It's kind of,
you know,

548
00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:55.370
a seating more important to yourself then you really should,

549
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.030
but I think it's important that early Christian groups use that term for

550
00:32:59.031 --> 00:33:01.760
themselves.
Why didn't early Christian groups call themselves synagogues?

551
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.590
That was a term already in use by Jews.
It would have been a normal term to use,

552
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.640
but we don't find many early Christians using the term synagogue for their

553
00:33:10.641 --> 00:33:13.310
groups.
We do find them using Ekklesia very quickly,

554
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.590
but in Ekklesia isn't a household.

555
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:21.050
What this author is doing is shifting in a not so subtle way.

556
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:26.890
Understanding these house groups as being more like town assemblies and making

557
00:33:27.621 --> 00:33:29.720
them look more like Roman households.

558
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.760
Then also then row men have certain roles.

559
00:33:34.761 --> 00:33:36.410
Then first 72 eight

560
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:39.900
<v 1>yeah,</v>

561
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.590
<v 0>I desire them that in every place the men should pray lifting up holy hands</v>

562
00:33:43.591 --> 00:33:48.510
without anger argument also that the women should pray lifting up.
Holy hands.

563
00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:53.100
The argument,
no,
Dale's lying to you again,

564
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.880
the women should dress themselves modestly,
decently in suitable clothing.

565
00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.270
Not with their hair braided girls.
Your last name

566
00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.710
or with gold pearls are expensive clothes,

567
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:08.190
but with good works as is proper for women who profess reverence for God.

568
00:34:08.191 --> 00:34:12.120
Let a woman learn in silence with full submission.

569
00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:17.070
I permit no woman to teach or have authority over a man she has to keep silent

570
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.180
for.
Adam was foreign first,
then eve and Adam was not deceived,

571
00:34:21.181 --> 00:34:23.370
but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.

572
00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.230
Yet she will be saved through childbearing provided they continue in faith and

573
00:34:28.231 --> 00:34:31.100
love and holiness with modesty.
Now,
that's kind of a,

574
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.950
this is something that my mom used to hate it when they'd preach about this in

575
00:34:34.951 --> 00:34:37.920
church
and also it's controversial.

576
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:42.720
Does it mean that she's saved in from the dangers of childbirth?

577
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:46.410
That's one way of reading.
It shall be saved from the dangers of childbirth.

578
00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.640
If she lives a pie as a holy life or a bit more of a radical way of reading,

579
00:34:50.641 --> 00:34:53.940
it would be to say her by having babies,

580
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:56.280
women help constitute their own salvation.

581
00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:00.900
That having children is one ways that women's save themselves.

582
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:03.710
Either way.
You look at it,

583
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:08.060
this author really wants women to be in a subordinate role,

584
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:11.720
silent in church.
They can't have any leadership authority.

585
00:35:11.721 --> 00:35:15.090
You're teaching authority over a man as we'll see.
They do have some offices,

586
00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.860
there are roles that women can play in the pastoral epistles but not in

587
00:35:18.861 --> 00:35:19.790
authority over men.

588
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:24.890
And then there's this odd thing about childbearing that somehow,

589
00:35:24.891 --> 00:35:29.770
and I think what it means is that childbearing actually can help save women,
uh,

590
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.300
from there,
uh,
sins in some way.

591
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:36.430
So that's what women have to be modestly dressed,
no jewelry,

592
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.740
save through childbearing

593
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.690
in order to maintain this kind of household structure,

594
00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:44.640
a very hierarchical household structure.

595
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:48.780
This author sets up offices in the church and here's what I want.

596
00:35:48.781 --> 00:35:51.420
Another reason we call these the pastoral epistles cause he's setting up

597
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:55.860
pastoral offices.
Look in three,
one through seven.
This saying is sure,

598
00:35:55.890 --> 00:36:00.690
whoever aspires to the office of Bishop desires a noble task.
Now a bishop,

599
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:05.270
anybody have a different translation for what I just read?
His bishop.
Overseer.

600
00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:09.480
Overseer.
Yes.
Overseers.
A translation.
Anybody have a different translation?

601
00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.040
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

602
00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:16.150
<v 0>Cause there were bishop here is,
it's the,
the Greek word is episcopals.</v>

603
00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.860
Wherever we get the English word bishop and you get the name for the episcopal

604
00:36:20.861 --> 00:36:24.550
church cause it's a church that has PR,
has bishops.
Um,

605
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.150
in Greek it basically means an overseer.
Someone in charge.

606
00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.310
The bishop must be above reproach.
Married only once.
Temperate,
sensible,

607
00:36:33.311 --> 00:36:36.760
respectable,
hospitable and APP teacher.
Not a drunkard,
not violent,
but gentle.

608
00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:40.450
Not Quarrelsome,
not a lover of money.
He must manage his own household well,

609
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:44.020
keeping his children submissive and respectful in every way for if someone does

610
00:36:44.021 --> 00:36:46.990
not know how to manage his own household,
how can you take care of God's church?

611
00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.000
Again,
the church is a household.

612
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.630
If you're going to be the bishop over the church,

613
00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:56.500
you have to be married because how can you manage the household,
the church,

614
00:36:56.501 --> 00:36:58.870
if you can't prove it by managing your own household?
Well,

615
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:02.410
he must not be a recent convert.
Baba Baba Baba.

616
00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.660
So the bishop or the episcopals is already himself now a male head of household.

617
00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.180
The other office,

618
00:37:10.181 --> 00:37:15.181
he talks about in five 17 let the elders now just as the word were translated,

619
00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.060
bishop or overseer

620
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:25.000
comes from the Greek word episcopals

621
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:30.800
<v 1>true.</v>

622
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.850
<v 0>The Greek for elder here is pres Butoh Ross presbyter,</v>

623
00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.550
and this is where the Presbyterian church gets the name of his church,

624
00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.750
if they're Presbyterians,

625
00:37:38.751 --> 00:37:42.620
because the Presbyterian church rejected the use of bishops like they found in

626
00:37:42.621 --> 00:37:46.430
the Catholic and Anglican churches and chose a plurality of elders.

627
00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:48.920
So they're called elders and a Presbyterian church.

628
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:51.810
And the Presbyterian church comes from this Greek word [inaudible],

629
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:54.890
meaning elder Presbyt duress.
And this is actually,

630
00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:00.380
this came to be later in English,
the name for a bishop who was not just the,

631
00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.750
the head of one particular church,
but became the head of a series of churches,

632
00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:10.400
a bunch of churches.
That is the bishop and now is not the head of one church,

633
00:38:10.401 --> 00:38:13.820
but the head of a whole diocese that has a grouping of geographical grouping.

634
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:15.650
So the,
the words changed a bit,

635
00:38:15.651 --> 00:38:20.330
but that's bishop comes from this word and pres boot or US turned into the word

636
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.910
priest.
So an edamame,

637
00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.230
one of the suggested etymologies for where that the English word priests kings

638
00:38:26.231 --> 00:38:30.440
from is from this Greek word itself.
You can kind of say Pres Butaro,

639
00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:34.070
Presbyterian,
presbyter Pres Boudreau priest,
right?

640
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:40.150
Just kind of happens in English over,
you know,
a few hundred years.

641
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.760
So elders are also have to,
um,

642
00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.240
have wives be family men and all this sort of thing.

643
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.480
There are other offices to look at real quick.
They're going to go through this.

644
00:38:52.481 --> 00:38:56.800
Deacons.
Three,
eight deacons likewise,

645
00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.800
must be serious,
not double tongue,
not indulging in much wine,

646
00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:00.670
not greedy for money.

647
00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.370
They must hold fast to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.

648
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.160
Let them first be tested.
Then if they proved themselves blindness at them,

649
00:39:06.161 --> 00:39:08.950
serve as deacons.
Women,
likewise,
must be serious.

650
00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:10.570
Now there's an exegetical problem.

651
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:15.880
Does this women refer to women who were themselves independently be deacons?

652
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:19.630
In other words,
is he allowing women to be deacons on their own?

653
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.320
Or is this supposed to be taken to be just the wives of the male deacons that

654
00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:25.390
they're called deacons or deaconesses?

655
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.430
That word for Deacon here comes from the Greek word [inaudible].

656
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.353
<v 1>Okay.</v>

657
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:35.880
<v 0>C D arch,
Deacon Jaak Anos Deacon</v>

658
00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:40.950
comes into English directly.
So,
and that we're just means a servant,

659
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:46.950
someone who serves or ministers.
So the women in three 11,

660
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:51.030
some extra genes would say this shows that this author does allow at least women

661
00:39:51.031 --> 00:39:55.500
to have to be roles as deacons deaconesses and they have certain kinds of roles.

662
00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:59.580
Uh,
let verse 12 let deacons be married only once.

663
00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.380
Let them manage their children are households.

664
00:40:01.381 --> 00:40:04.620
Well for those who served well as deacons get a good standing for themselves.

665
00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:09.210
So notice in the beginning all of these,
uh,
roles,

666
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.300
whether it's the elder presbyter or the bishop,

667
00:40:12.301 --> 00:40:14.790
and there's some debate about whether Presbyterian,

668
00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:18.390
it refers to the same role as a bishop.
In these letters,

669
00:40:18.391 --> 00:40:22.500
they seem to be combined and some of the layer pastoral letters or whether

670
00:40:22.501 --> 00:40:26.100
they're for to two separate offices.
So there's a bit of a debate.
But anyway,

671
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.980
all of these people where they are,
you're talking about bet bishops,

672
00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.870
presbyters deacons,

673
00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:35.100
they all are required to be married and all are required to have children.

674
00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.660
So in the beginning of early Christianity,
see,

675
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:43.610
you did not have the celibate ministry to celebrate ministry comes about later

676
00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.013
and,

677
00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:50.620
but this is in line with this author's intention to set up the church as a

678
00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:54.260
household structure with men on top women having their own roles.

679
00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.580
Now there are other roles here,
uh,

680
00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:59.750
to look at five three through 10.

681
00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:05.403
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

682
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:07.620
<v 0>honor widows.</v>

683
00:41:07.621 --> 00:41:11.880
This is firstly with e five three honor widows who are really widows.

684
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:13.860
If a widow has children or grandchildren,

685
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:17.640
they should first learn their religious duty to their own family and make some

686
00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:20.190
repayment to their parents.
For this is pleasing in God's sight.

687
00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:24.360
The real widow left alone has set our hope on God and continues and

688
00:41:24.361 --> 00:41:26.520
supplications and prayers night and day.

689
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:29.940
But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.

690
00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.240
Give these commands as well so that they may be above reproach.

691
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:36.680
Whoever does not provide for relatives and especially for family members has

692
00:41:36.681 --> 00:41:40.250
denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
Now it gets really interesting.

693
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:44.660
Let a widow be put on the list,
let her be registered.

694
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:47.150
Ah,
this is a way of,

695
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:52.280
it seems like he's actually creating another kind of office in the church that

696
00:41:52.281 --> 00:41:57.281
is the office of widows and sure enough in Christianity later widow became

697
00:41:57.321 --> 00:42:00.740
almost like an office in early Christianity.
There can be,

698
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:04.430
they can be registered and they receive financial help from the churches.

699
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:10.310
Let a widow be put on the list if she is not less than 60 years old and has been

700
00:42:10.311 --> 00:42:11.360
married only once.

701
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.510
Notice over and over here we've seen this thing about being married once.

702
00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.830
Apparently this author believes in marriage and once we will be married,

703
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:23.180
but his ideal is that people should be married once you shouldn't.

704
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:25.310
You certainly should not be divorced and remarried.

705
00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:29.840
Paul himself a forbids people in his church from being from being divorced and

706
00:42:29.841 --> 00:42:34.841
remarried as we saw in First Corinthians 11 but this author seems to say that if

707
00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:38.330
you're married and your spouse dies,

708
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.210
he still kind of prefers that these women to be married once.

709
00:42:41.211 --> 00:42:45.470
He also said that the bishop or the predators should be men who are married only

710
00:42:45.471 --> 00:42:46.040
once.

711
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:51.040
So multiple marriage is really frowned on even though marriage itself is highly

712
00:42:51.171 --> 00:42:52.004
valued.

713
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.690
This led to what is currently the practice and many of the eastern churches,

714
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:59.360
eastern Orthodox or the Greek Orthodox,
the Russian Orthodox,

715
00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.120
they do not forbid their priest from being married,

716
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.120
but you have to be married before you become a priest.

717
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:09.710
So you'll have a lot of young men and Greece or Russia who are going to become

718
00:43:09.711 --> 00:43:13.160
priest and they want to quickly get married right out of seminary.

719
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.900
They're looking around for a partner because if they become ordained as a priest

720
00:43:17.901 --> 00:43:18.740
and they're not married,

721
00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:23.860
they're expected to stay on married and if their or wife dies after they become

722
00:43:24.291 --> 00:43:25.010
a priest,

723
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:29.000
they're expected to stay celibate and single for the rest of their lives also.

724
00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:33.650
So this led to the tradition in eastern Christianity that you can be a married

725
00:43:33.651 --> 00:43:35.720
priest,
unlike the Roman Catholic church,

726
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:39.080
but only if you get married before you become a priest.

727
00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:42.800
And it kept this idea of being married once only,

728
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:45.500
I can't go into the rest of this,

729
00:43:45.501 --> 00:43:50.501
but notice how this whole hierarchy of man and woman in the household,

730
00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:56.740
old and young is also extended to children and slaves already in collages.

731
00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:01.370
In Ephesians we had what we call the household household codes.

732
00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:06.170
Met Masters,
treat your slaves well.
Slaves be obedient to your masters.

733
00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:10.250
Husbands treat your wives well.
Wives submit to your husbands,

734
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.100
children submit to your father's father.
His treats are general.

735
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.820
So these are called household codes and already in Colossae and Ephesians they

736
00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:19.580
set up the household in a clear hierarchical,

737
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:23.720
patriarchal situation that is intensified in the pastoral epistles.

738
00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:28.490
You have much longer household codes and whereas in Collagen's in Ephesians that

739
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:31.980
Rye,
those writers at least said there was some reciprocity.
They would,

740
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.620
they would address the slaves.
You have to obey the master,

741
00:44:34.621 --> 00:44:37.860
but they would also address the master and say,
treat your slaves.
Well,

742
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:41.990
when you get to the pastoral epistles,
they left out the reciprocity.

743
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:46.410
It's mainly directed to the slaves,
to the children,
to the wives saying,

744
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.550
submit.

745
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:53.900
So this is the strategy that this writer uses to combat the forms of

746
00:44:54.361 --> 00:44:58.200
Christianity that he doesn't like,
is to construct the house,

747
00:44:58.201 --> 00:45:03.201
the church as a rigid patriarchal household in which each person has a role.

748
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.810
Even young women,
he says they're not supposed to be enrolled as widows.

749
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.160
If you have one women,

750
00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.980
young women who are widows and they start running around gossiping,

751
00:45:10.981 --> 00:45:15.210
getting lot of trouble,
he says,
get them married off again.
Old Women.

752
00:45:15.211 --> 00:45:16.830
Of course you couldn't marry off again.

753
00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:21.000
There are not enough old men around in ancient Loda Merrim off so you,

754
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:23.670
he creates this structure by which women,

755
00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:27.720
older women get pulled back into the household.
By this role as widows,

756
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.710
no matter what happens to a woman in this op authors view,

757
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:35.700
they have to be put back into their submissive place in the household structure,

758
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:39.150
even if that means creating a new role for them called widows.

759
00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:44.430
This is this strategy this author uses to bring Paul into his own time.

760
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:48.210
He's taking appall that we sent.
Scene is a bit different from this,

761
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:52.560
and he's reinventing Paul for a second century Christian environment and

762
00:45:52.561 --> 00:45:54.720
restriction the church as the household.

763
00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:00.200
We'll see an author on Wednesday doing precisely the opposite with Paul.

764
00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:01.560
See you next time.
