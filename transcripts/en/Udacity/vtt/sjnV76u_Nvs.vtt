00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.900
&gt;&gt; All right, so we've defined our terms, we,

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.100
we know, what it takes to do, at least

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.360
supervised learning. So now I want to do a specific

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.140
algorithm and a specific representation, that allows us to solve

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.740
the problem of going from instances to, actual concepts.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.140
So what we're going to talk about next are decision trees.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.230
And I think the best way to introduce decision

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.500
trees is through an example. So, here's the very simple

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.900
example I want you to think about for a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.500
while. You're on a date with someone. And you come

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.840
to a restaurant. And you're going to try to decide

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.630
whether to enter the restaurant or not. So, your, input,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.450
your instances are going to be features about the

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.740
restaurant. And we'll talk a little bit about what those

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.910
features might be. And the output is whether you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.184
should enter or not. Okay, so it's a very simple,

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:52.485
straightforward problem but there are a lot of

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:54.570
details here that we have to figure out.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.710
&gt;&gt; It's a classification problem.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.800
&gt;&gt; It's clearly a classification problem because

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.150
the output is yes, we should enter or

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.860
no, we should move on to the next restaurant. So in fact, it's not just

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.519
a classification problem, it's those binary classification

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.580
problems that I said that we'd almost exclusively

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.110
be thinking about for the next few minutes.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.588
Okay. So, you understand the problem set up?

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:15.270
&gt;&gt; Yes, though I'm not sure exactly what the pieces of the input are.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.570
&gt;&gt; Right, so thats actually the right next question to ask. We

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.250
have to actually be specific now about a representation. Before I was drawing

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.940
squiggly little lines and you could imagine what they were, but now since

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.700
we're really going to go through an example, we need to be clear about

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.880
what is it mean to be standing in front of the restaurant.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.650
So, let's try to figure out how we would represent that, how we

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.820
would define that. We're talking about, you're standing in front of a restaurant

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.290
or eatery because I can't see the reliably small restaurant. And we're going to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.760
try to figure out whether we're going to go in

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.500
or not. But, what do we have to describe our

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.190
eatery? What do we have? What are our attributes? What

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.800
are the instances actually made of? So, what in, or

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.510
another way of putting it is, what are the features

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.270
that we need to pay attention to that are going to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.320
help us to determine whether we should yes, enter into

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.450
the restaurant. Or no, move on to the next restaurant.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.350
So, any ideas Michael?

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.850
&gt;&gt; Sure. I guess there's like the type of restaurant.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.910
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.504
&gt;&gt; Oh, is it tall or short, and is it a good credit risk?

00:02:15.504 --> 00:02:16.263
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:16.263 --> 00:02:17.710
&gt;&gt; Oh wait, no, no, no wait, I know.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.910
Like the Italian versus French, versus, you know, Vietnamese.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.080
&gt;&gt; So let's call that the type.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.108
So it could be Italian, it could be French, it could

00:02:27.108 --> 00:02:29.940
be Thai, it could be American, there are American restaurants, right?

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.300
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.060
&gt;&gt; Greek, it can be, Armenian. It can any kind of

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.390
restaurant you want to. Okay, good. So that's something that probably

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.940
matters because maybe you don't like Italian food or maybe you're

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.940
really in the mood for Thai. Sounds perfect. Okay anything else?

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.860
&gt;&gt; Sure. How about whether it smells good?

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.180
&gt;&gt; You know, I like cleanliness. Let's let's, or

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.150
you know what, let's, let's be nice to our eateries and let's say atmosphere.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.383
&gt;&gt; Mm. Right because if there's, you know, no atmosphere,

00:02:57.383 --> 00:02:58.870
then it is going to be really hard to breathe.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.660
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. So is it

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.520
fancy? Is it a hole-in-the-wall, which I'm going

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.320
to spell HIW. Is it a hole-in-the-wall,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.750
umm, those sorts of things. The, you know?

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.730
&gt;&gt; Casual, I guess, is another category.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.790
&gt;&gt; Casual.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.060
And so on, and so forth. You could imagine

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.120
lots of things like that, but these things might matter

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.740
to you and your date. Okay, so, we know the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.510
type of the restaurant that we have, we know whether

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.360
it's fancy, whether it's casual, whether it's a hole

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.370
in the wall. Some of the best food I've ever

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.050
had are in you know, well-known hole in the walls.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.350
Those sorts of things. Anything else you can think of?

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.710
&gt;&gt; Sure, Sometimes, I might use

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.550
something like looking inside and seeing whether

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.960
there's people in there and whether they look they're having a good time.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.670
&gt;&gt; Right. So that's an important thing. So let's just say

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.940
If it's occupied. Now why might that matter in reality? Well

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.530
it matters because if it's completely full and you may have to

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.210
wait for a very long time, you might not want to

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.880
go in. On the other hand. If you're looking at a restaurant

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.510
you've never heard of, and there's only two people in it,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.030
and it's Friday at 7 p.m. Maybe that says something about something.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.110
Maybe you want it to be quiet. You know, those sorts

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.980
of things might matter. Okay, so, we've got type, we've got atmosphere,

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.519
we've got occupied. Anything else you can think of?

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.810
&gt;&gt; And I have been out of the dating market for a while, but I guess

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.610
it could imagine, I could imagine how hard

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.260
I am trying to work to impress my date.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.980
&gt;&gt; perfect. So do you have a hot date or not? Or, this is

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.680
someone who you really, really, really want to impress and so, maybe it matters

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.310
then, it's even more important whether it's a fancy restaurant or a hole in

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.150
the wall, or whether it's French or

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.290
whether it's an American restaurant. That make sense?

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.220
I think that makes sense. Notice, by the way, that the

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.540
first two sets that we have have multiple possible categories here.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.886
So it could be Italian, French, Thai, American, so on and

00:04:49.886 --> 00:04:53.990
so forth. Atmosphere is something that can have many, many possible

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.490
values, but the last two things that we talked about were

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.020
all binary. Either it's occupied or it's not. Yes or no

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.550
or, you have a hot date or you don't. And I

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.520
think we could go on like this for a long time but,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.100
let's try to move on to maybe a couple of other features

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.460
and then try to actually figure out how we may actually solve this.
