00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.410
In the last video we set out to
find the eigenvalues values

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.830
of this 3 by 3 matrix, A.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.280
And we said, look an eigenvalue
is any value,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.410
lambda, that satisfies
this equation if v

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.280
is a non-zero vector.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.300
And that says, any value,
lambda, that satisfies this

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.390
equation for v is a
non-zero vector.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.760
Then we just did a little bit
of I guess we could call it

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.370
vector algebra up here
to come up with that.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.890
You can review that
video if you like.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.700
And then we determined, look
the only way that this is

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.710
going to have a non-zero
solution is if this matrix has

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.320
a non-trivial null space.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.790
And only non-invertible matrices
have a non-trivial

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.970
null space.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.020
Or, only matrices that have
a determinant of 0 have

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.770
non-trivial null spaces.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.510
So you do that, you got your
characteristic polynomial, and

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.680
we were able to solve it.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.000
And we got our eigenvalues where
lambda is equal to 3 and

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.370
lambda is equal to minus 3.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.050
So now, let's do-- what I
consider the more interesting

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.840
part-- is actually find out
the eigenvectors or the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.530
eigenspaces.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.800
So we can go back to this
equation, for any eigenvalue

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.570
this must be true.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.300
This must be true but this
is easier to work with.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.140
And so, this matrix right here
times your eigenvector must be

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.100
equal 0 for any given
eigenvalue.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.720
This matrix right here--
I've just copied

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.740
and pasted from above.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.120
I marked it up with the Rule
of Sarrus so you can ignore

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.870
those lines-- is just
this matrix right

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.430
here for any lambda.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.810
Lambda times the identity
matrix minus A

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.330
ends up being this.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.600
So let's take this matrix for
each of our lambdas and then

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.190
solve for our eigenvectors
or our eigenspaces.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.390
So let me take the case of
lambda is equal to 3 first. So

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.290
if lambda is equal to 3, this
matrix becomes lambda plus 1

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.900
is 4, lambda minus 2 is 1,
lambda minus 2 is 1.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.590
And then all of the other terms
stay the same, minus 2,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.380
minus 2, minus 2, 1,
minus 2 and 1.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.390
And then this times that vector,
v, or our eigenvector

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.010
v is equal to 0.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.070
Or we could say that the
eigenspace for the eigenvalue

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.990
3 is the null space
of this matrix.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.230
Which is not this matrix.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.690
It's lambda times the
identity minus A.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.060
So the null space of this matrix
is the eigenspace.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.510
So all of the values that
satisfy this make up the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.540
eigenvectors of the eigenspace
of lambda is equal to 3.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.400
So let's just solve for this.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.940
So the null space of this guy--
we could just put in

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.750
reduced row echelon form-- the
null space of this guy is the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.580
same thing as the null space
of this guy in reduced row

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.560
echelon form.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.310
So let's put this in reduced
row echelon form.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.650
So the first thing I
want to do-- let me

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.070
just do it down here.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.940
So let me-- I'll keep my first
row the same for now.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.200
4 minus 2, minus 2.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.250
And let me replace my second row
with my second row times 2

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.150
plus my first row.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.970
So minus 2 times
2 plus 1 is 0.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.270
1 times 2 plus minus 2 is 0.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.190
1 times 2 plus minus 2 is 0.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.900
This row is the same
as this row.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.180
So I'm going to do
the same thing.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.360
Minus 2 times 2 plus 4 is 0.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.860
1 times 2 plus 2 is 0.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.570
And then 1 times 2 plus
minus 2 is 0.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.840
So the solutions to this
equation are the same as the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.270
solutions to this equation.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.250
Let me write it like this.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.470
Instead of just writing
the vector, v,

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.700
let me write it out.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.570
So v1, v2, v3 are going to
be equal to the 0 vector.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.300
0, 0.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.180
Just rewriting it slightly
different.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.010
And so these two rows, or these
two equations, give us

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.700
no information.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.490
The only one is this row up
here, which tells us that 4

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.560
times v1 minus 2 times v2--
actually this wasn't complete

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.820
reduced row echelon form
but close enough.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.050
It's easy for us to work with--
4 times v1 minus 2

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.920
times v2 minus 2 times
v3 is equal to 0.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.050
Let's just divide by 4.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.830
I could've just divided by 4
here, which might have made it

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.970
skipped a step.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.210
But if you divide by 4 you get
v1 minus 1/2 v2 minus 1/2 v3

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.620
is equal to 0.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.490
Or, v1 is equal to 1/2
v2 plus 1/2 v3.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.400
Just added these guys to both
sides of the equation.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.770
Or we could say, let's say that
v2 is equal to-- yeah I

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.180
don't know, I'm going to just
put some random number-- a,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.830
and v3 is equal to b, then we
can say-- and then v1 would be

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.200
equal to 1/2 a plus 1/2 b.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:07.020
We can say that the eigenspace
for lambda is equal to 3, is

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:14.900
the set of all of vectors, v1,
v2, v3, that are equal to a

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.350
times times-- v2 is a, right?

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.200
So v2 is equal to a times 1.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.810
v3 has no a in it.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.020
So it's a times 0.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.950
Plus b times-- v2 is just a.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.490
v2 has no b in it.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.640
So it's 0.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.290
v3 is 1 times-- so 0 times
a plus 1 times b.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.745
And then v1 is 1/2
a plus 1/2 b.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.800
For any a and b, such
that a and b are

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.600
members of the reals.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.660
Just to be a little bit
formal about it.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.180
So that's our-- any vector
that satisfies this is an

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.320
eigenvector.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.260
And they're the eigenvectors
that correspond to eigenvalue

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.190
lambda is equal to 3.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.200
So if you apply the matrix
transformation to any of these

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.450
vectors, you're just going
to scale them up by 3.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.800
Let me write this way.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.220
The eigenspace for lambda is
equal to 3, is equal to the

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.950
span, all of the potential
linear combinations of this

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.290
guy and that guy.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.710
So 1/2, 1, 0.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:36.430
And 1/2, 0, 1.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.640
So that's only one of
the eigenspaces.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.750
That's the one that
corresponds to

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.640
lambda is equal to 3.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.290
Let's do the one that
corresponds to lambda is equal

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.060
to minus 3.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.420
So if lambda is equal to minus
3-- I'll do it up here, I

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.410
think I have enough space--
lambda is equal to minus 3.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:57.850
This matrix becomes-- I'll do
the diagonals-- minus 3 plus 1

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.300
is minus 2.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.950
Minus 3 minus 2 is minus 5.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.960
Minus 3 minus 2 is minus 5.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.160
And all the other things
don't change.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.520
Minus 2, minus 2, 1.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.110
Minus 2, minus 2 and 1.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:20.210
And then that times vectors
in the eigenspace that

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.390
corresponds to lambda is equal
to minus 3, is going to be

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.050
equal to 0.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.140
I'm just applying this equation
right here which we

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.550
just derived from that
one over there.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.116
So, the eigenspace that
corresponds to lambda is equal

00:07:34.116 --> 00:07:37.315
to minus 3, is the null space,
this matrix right here, are

00:07:37.315 --> 00:07:40.040
all the vectors that satisfy
this equation.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.210
So what is-- the null space of
this is the same thing as the

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.670
null space of this in reduced
row echelon form So let's put

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.190
it in reduced row
echelon form.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.510
So the first thing I want to do,
I'm going to keep my first

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.360
row the same.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.620
I'm going to write a little bit
smaller than I normally do

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.800
because I think I'm going
to run out of space.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.010
So minus 2, minus 2, minus 2.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.170
Actually let me just
do it this way.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.830
I will skip some steps.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.000
Let's just divide the first
row by minus 2.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.230
So we get 1, 1, 1.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.190
And then let's replace this
second row with the second row

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.470
plus this version of
the first row.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:22.170
So this guy plus that guy is 0
minus 5 plus minus-- or let me

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:22.960
say this way.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.350
Let me replace it with
the first row

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.720
minus the second row.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.179
So minus 2 minus minus 2 is 0.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:36.450
Minus 2 minus minus
5 is plus 3.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:43.669
And then minus 2 minus
1 is minus 3.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:44.770
And then let me do
the last row in a

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.060
different color for fun.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.330
And I'll do the same thing.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.840
I'll do this row
minus this row.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.110
So minus 2 minus
minus 2 is a 0.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.150
Minus 2 plus 2.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.390
Minus 2 minus 1 is minus 3.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:03.210
And then we have minus
2 minus minus 5.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.330
So it's minus 2 plus 5.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.090
So that is 3.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:13.770
Now let me replace-- and I'll
do it in two steps.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.570
So this is 1, 1, 1.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.770
I'll just keep it like that.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:23.480
And actually, well let me
just keep it like that.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.590
And then let me replace my third
row with my third row

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.870
plus my second row.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:28.660
It'll just zero out.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.270
If you add these terms, these
all just become 0.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.540
That guy got zeroed out.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.410
And let me take my second
row and divide it by 3.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.530
So this becomes 0, 1, minus 1.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.970
And I'm almost there.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.330
I'll do it in orange.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.680
So let me replace my first row
with my first row minus my

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.470
second row.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:57.250
So this becomes 1, 0, and then
1 minus minus 1 is 2.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.440
1 minus minus 1 is 2.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.760
And then in the second
row is 0, 1, minus 1.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.770
And then the last
row is 0, 0, 0.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.910
So any v that satisfies this
equation will also

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.480
satisfy this guy.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.650
This guy's null space is going
to be the null space of that

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.180
guy in reduced row
echelon form.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:26.010
So v1, v2, v3 is equal
to 0, 0, 0.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:26.930
Let me move this.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.530
Because I've officially
run out of space.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.110
So let me move this lower
down where I have

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.620
some free real estate.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:36.800
Let me move it down here.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.430
This corresponds to lambda
is equal to minus 3.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.830
This was lambda is equal to
minus 3, just to make us--

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.200
it's not related to this
stuff right here.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.620
So what are all of the v1s, v2s
and v3s that satisfy this?

00:10:51.620 --> 00:11:00.100
So if we say that v3
is equal to t.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.310
If v3 is equal to t, then
what do we have here?

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.530
We have-- this tells us that
v2 minus v3 is equal to 0.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:15.700
So that tells us that v2 minus
v3-- 0 times v1 plus v2 minus

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.150
v3 is equal to 0.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:22.660
Or that v2 is equal to v3,
which is equal to t.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.340
That's what that second
equation tells us.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.150
And then the third equation
tells us, or the top equation

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:34.060
tells us, v1 times 1-- so v1
plus 0 times v2 plus 2 times

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.990
v3 is equal to 0.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:45.240
Or v1 is equal to minus 2v3 is
equal to minus 2 times t.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.110
So the eigenspace that
corresponds to lambda is equal

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:56.930
to minus 3 is equal to the set
of all the vectors, v1, v2 and

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:07.820
v3, where-- well, it's equal
to t times-- v3 is just t.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.790
v3 was just t.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.400
v2 also just ends up being t.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.320
So 1 times t.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.530
And v1 is minus 2 times t.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.390
For t is any real number.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:25.030
Or another way to say it is that
the eigenspace for lambda

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:31.380
is equal to minus 3 is equal
to the span-- I wrote this

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.200
really messy-- where lambda is
equal to minus 3 is equal to

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:45.020
the span of the vector
minus 2, 1, and 1.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.540
Just like that.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.620
It looks interesting.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.510
Because if you take this guy
and dot it with either of

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.280
these guys, I think you get 0.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.510
Is that definitely the case?

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:59.790
Take minus 2 times 1/2, you
get a minus 1 there.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:00.750
Then you have a plus 1.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.580
That's 0.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.750
And then minus 2 times 1/2.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:04.160
Yeah.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.230
You dot it with either of
these guys you get 0.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.200
So this line is orthogonal
to that plane.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:09.790
Very interesting.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.990
So let's just graph it just so
we have a good visualization

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.770
of what we're doing.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.070
So we had that 3
by 3 matrix, A.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.920
It represents some
transformation in R3.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.210
And it has two eigenvalues.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.030
And each of those have a
corresponding eigenspace.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.030
So the eigenspace that
corresponds to the eigenvalue

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.930
3 is a plane in R3.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.600
So this is the eigenspace for
lambda is equal to 3.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.370
And it's the span of these
two vectors right there.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.040
So if I draw them, maybe
they're like that.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.040
Just like that.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.440
And then the eigenspace
for lambda is equal to

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.850
minus 3 is a line.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.260
It's a line that's perpendicular
to this plane.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.460
It's a line like that.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.710
It's the span of this guy.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.870
Maybe if I draw that vector,
that vector might look

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.150
something like this.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.440
And it's the span of that guy.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.920
So what this tells us, this is
the eigenspace for lambda is

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.600
equal to minus 3.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.830
So what that tells us-- just
to make sure we are

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.300
interpreting our eigenvalues and
eigenspaces correctly-- is

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.700
look, you give me any
eigenvector, you give me any

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.960
vector in this, you give me any
vector right here, let's

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.800
say that is vector x.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.320
If I apply the transformation,
if I multiply it it by a, I'm

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.980
going to have 3 times that.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.440
Because it's in the eigenspace
where lambda is equal to 3.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.420
So if I were to apply a times
x, a times x would be just 3

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.460
times that.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.220
So that would be a times x.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:36.900
That's what it tells me.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.890
This would be true for
any of these guys.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.390
If this was x, and you took a
times x, it's going to be 3

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.740
times as long.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:47.950
Now these guys over here, if you
have some vector in this

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.520
eigenspace that corresponds to
lambda is equal to 3, and you

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.640
apply the transformation.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.500
Let's say that this
is x right there.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.710
If you took the transformation
of x, it's going to make it 3

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.320
times longer in the opposite
direction.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.230
It's still going to
be on this line.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.720
So it's going to go
down like this.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.340
And that would be a times x.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.510
It would be the same, it'd be
3 times this length, but in

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.360
the opposite direction.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:11.190
Because it corresponds to lambda
is equal to minus 3.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.420
So anyway, we've, I think,
made a great achievement.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.290
We've not only figured out the
eigenvalues for a 3 by 3

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.760
matrix, we now have figured out
all of the eigenvectors.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.260
Which are-- there's an infinite
number-- but they

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.590
represent 2 eigenspaces that
correspond to those two

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:31.170
eigenvalues, or minus 3 and 3.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.270
See you in the next video.
