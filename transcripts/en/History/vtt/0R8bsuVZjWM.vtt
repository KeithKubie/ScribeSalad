00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.406
NARRATOR: In South Carolina,
a century-old sawmill

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:09.109
stands between Eustace
and a much needed bonus

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.511
payday worth
thousands of dollars.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.246
The dang thing's
going backwards.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.547
Oh man, that ain't good.

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:15.749
NARRATOR: But he
and Joseph have hit

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.450
a new snag with the saw blade.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.518
Yeah, the saw will fly off.

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.923
Oh my gosh.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.426
We gotta get this
thing turned around.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.595
NARRATOR: To shift the
blade in the forward motion,

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.331
Eustace eases the
transmission into first gear.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.869
I'm glad we caught that.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.037
You ready again?

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:39.038
Yeah.

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.374
OK.
Here we go.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:55.789
Rev it up a little bit.
Yeah.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:59.726
It seems like it's
going to work.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.928
I mean, it's going fast enough
that it at least looks it.

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:03.797
We just got to try it out now.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:04.998
JOSEPH: That throttle enough?

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:06.633
Yeah, go ahead
and speed it up.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.701
Let's see what we can do.
JOSEPH: All right.

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:20.747
EUSTACE: So far
it's working well.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.588
The more we saw, the
more I can kind of

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.924
figure out and develop
a little confidence

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.225
in how this thing works.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.894
And Joseph's getting
his job done well.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.296
We get into quite a rhythm here.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.785
NARRATOR: Eustace and
Joseph's quick fix

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.187
of the old-time sawmill
isn't holding up.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.889
EUSTACE: We have to
shut the mill off

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.960
before it burns something
up, tears something up.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.129
We have a major problem here.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.131
That is scary.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:15.502
JOSEPH: Well it just
wasn't going that fast.

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:17.036
NARRATOR: Their goal
is to get the mill

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:18.671
working well enough
to cut boards

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:20.740
from the trees they've felled.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.342
If he can't cut
the lumber, he'll

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:25.211
have to leave thousands
of dollars on the ground,

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.347
at the moment he needs it most.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:31.918
What happened is the blade
got lodged in the wood.

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.988
And so, the motor's
smoking because that power

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.923
is being delivered.

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.825
But it couldn't go anywhere.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.960
The saw could not
turn, dislodged in the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.795
would like that.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:46.533
Basically, you got
too much pressure on it.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.635
Maybe it's too dull.

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:49.736
JOSEPH: You couldn't turn it.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:50.803
Yeah.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.572
I just think we got
to sharpen that saw.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:53.840
There's just too
much for resistance.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.776
This thing been sitting out
20 or 30 years, you know.

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:57.844
Yeah.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:59.679
We'll just take a
minute and sharpen it.

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.414
All right.

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:04.350
It's important to dig in
the bottom of the tooth.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.286
The good thing is
they're all still here.

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:07.620
We didn't lose one in the log.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.656
JOSEPH: Yeah, that is good.
- Yeah.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:21.501
Looks like this is the
one we're looking for,

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:22.602
this last one.

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:25.004
Let's see if we can
get this thing going.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.289
EUSTACE: It's amazing to see
this old mill actually work.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.958
With the power
units working good,

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.225
the mill's cutting straight.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.565
Looks like we're going to be
able to make this thing happen.

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:55.034
Every time we get another
board coming off this mill,

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:56.469
I feel like we're
one step closer

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.605
to buying that land back home.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:00.106
Well all right,
let's get back to it.

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:00.873
JOSEPH: All right, man.

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:02.875
Sounds good.
