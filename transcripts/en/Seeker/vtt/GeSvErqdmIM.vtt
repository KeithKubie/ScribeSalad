00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.250
Researchers recently and quite accidentally
discovered something that could change the

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.509
whole electric car ballgame.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.190
If their predictions are accurate, we could
one day live in a world where cars can be

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.080
fully charged in minutes instead of hours,
and their power storage units would last decades

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.500
instead of years.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.440
What is this tantalizing breakthrough you
ask?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.470
A monumental leap forward in capacitor technology.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.070
Many of the current drawbacks of electric
cars stem from how batteries work.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.070
Batteries rely on chemical reactions, which
means for a lithium-ion battery to release

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.219
energy you have to wait for the lithium to
shuffle through an electrolyte, and when you

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.799
want to store energy you have to wait for
the lithium to shuffle back.

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:42.910
Lithium-ion batteries also degrade, and replacing
one in an electric car would be enormously

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.030
expensive.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.559
In contrast capacitors store static electricity,
like what builds up on a balloon as you rub

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.309
it on your hair.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.440
Capacitors can be as simple as two metal plates
separated by air.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.569
When a current is applied to the plates, a
positive charge builds up on one plate and

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.929
a negative charge builds up on the other.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:05.070
No electrolytes, no shuffling ions, just electrons
on a plate waiting to pounce like a caged

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.070
lion.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.710
As a result capacitor can be fully charged
almost instantly, and since they can also

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.280
deliver energy quickly, that means capacitors
can provide more power than batteries.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.479
They are much more durable than lithium-ion
batteries too, lasting through tons of charge

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.350
and discharge cycles with little degradation.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.380
There is an achilles heel: they just can’t
hold very much energy.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.249
There are tricks to squeeze more charge onto
the plates, like increasing their surface

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:34.930
area and reducing the distance between them
by swapping out the air with a thin insulator.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.149
Do that and you’ve created a supercapacitor,
but even then, the best supercapacitors today

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:45.649
hold just 10 watt-hours per kilogram, about
5% of the energy of a lithium ion battery

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:46.969
of the same weight.

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.700
You would need a capacitor the size of a bus
to get any real use out of it.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.479
As it happens in 2010 Shanghai experimented
with electric buses powered by capacitors

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.600
that charged up every couple of stops.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.200
That’s a pretty clever use for them, but
if you want a personal car smaller than a

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.270
bus that can travel more than five miles without
stopping, capacitors are going to have to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.490
step up their game.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.370
Bizarrely the big breakthrough in supercapacitor
technology may come from… contact lenses?

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.150
Soft contacts use a polymer mesh that can
swell up and store water.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.920
One of the original inventors has been tinkering
with the polymer ever since, and found that

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.920
adding different elements imbues it with different
properties, like the ability to store electricity.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.760
Actually they were shocked at just how much
energy the polymer could store.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.070
A 2016 test of the little blue material found
it stored 100 times the energy the researchers

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.070
expected.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.860
Since then they’ve been testing the material
to see if it works in real world conditions,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.189
and after 14 months of research have concluded
that the material could eventually store 180

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:51.129
watt-hours per kilogram, putting it almost
on par with battery energy density, at least

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.310
by weight.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.659
The supercapacitors could be quite a bit more
voluminous, perhaps 30% bigger than an equivalent

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:58.659
battery.

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.209
Still, they’d be faster to charge, cheaper
to make, and wouldn’t have the risk of catching

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.190
fire since they’d be mostly water.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.150
They could also have applications outside
of cars, like storing energy for when it’s

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.300
in high demand, or when renewable sources
aren’t generating electricity.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.489
For now regular old chemical batteries are
still the best fit for electric cars.

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.650
But if this is the breakthrough the researchers
believe it is, batteries could be on their

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.069
way out in the next decade.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.769
In a weird way, soft contact lenses may help
us see a brighter future.

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.150

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.560
Just because capacitors are improving doesn’t
mean we’re not developing new and better

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.700
batteries too.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.980
Like a squishy battery!

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.060
You can learn more about that here!

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.250
None other than Elon Musk himself has said
that supercapacitors are the future of electric

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.250
cars.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.180
But he also thought a tiny submarine would help… so ya know,

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.709
grain of salt and all that.

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.999
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you next
time on Seeker.
