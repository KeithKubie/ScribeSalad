ERIC M. RUIZ: Ryan Holiday,
our guest this afternoon,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.540
is the best selling author
of "Trust Me, I'm Lying,"

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.180
"The Obstacle Is The
Way," "Ego Is The Enemy,"

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.040
and other books about
marketing, culture,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.450
and the human condition.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.150
His work has been translated
into 28 languages, including

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.640
Spanish, and has appeared
everywhere from the "Columbia

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.890
Journalism Review"
to "Fast Company."

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.780
His company, Brass
Check, has advised

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.227
companies such as Google,
TASER, and Complex

00:00:29.227 --> 00:00:31.060
as well as multi-platinum
musicians and some

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.710
of the biggest
authors in the world.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.981
He lives in Austin, Texas.

00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:35.480
All right.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.479
RYAN HOLIDAY: All right.

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:39.140
ERIC M. RUIZ: So, Ryan, I've
been a huge fan of your work

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.450
and following your career since
the Tim Ferriss stoicism post

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.410
days, and something that I
noticed about your latest book

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.829
was that it was very
much kept under wraps.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:48.620
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.869
ERIC M. RUIZ: Yeah, was that--

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:51.620
so can you tell us if
that was by design,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.794
and can you tell us more
about your newest release?

00:00:54.794 --> 00:00:56.210
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah,
so usually you

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.470
announce a book
when it comes out,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.636
and you tell people you're
working on it because you

00:00:59.636 --> 00:01:02.450
want pre-publicity attention.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.960
With this one, there was a
number of other people circling

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.925
around it, and so
I sold it first,

00:01:09.925 --> 00:01:12.050
but I didn't want to tell
people that I had sold it

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.540
because I wanted them to
think that they had more time.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.080
So we kept it secret
for a long time.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.110
I sold it-- instead of like
going out to an auction

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.290
to sell the rights to it, I
sold it to my same publisher

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.880
that I usually sell my books to.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.460
And then when I was
interviewing people,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.020
I told people that it was a
book about media, which it is,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.900
but it's also
about other things.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.620
And so yeah, it was sort of
secret, and I think part of it

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.480
was just fun.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.510
I mean, it's a book
about conspiracies,

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.850
so it was fun to be a
little bit conspiratorial.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.046
And then when we
announced it, we--

00:01:46.046 --> 00:01:47.420
when we did announce
it, the book

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.090
was already 3/4 of the way
written, so I had a big lead.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.040
I felt comfortable.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.910
And then when we said
when it was coming out,

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.540
we put the release date
earlier than it really probably

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.410
ever was going to be
just to go, there's

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.430
no way you're going
to beat us on it.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.151
I think-- and I heard from--

00:02:07.151 --> 00:02:09.650
when it was announced, I heard
from a bunch of other writers

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:10.316
that were like--

00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:12.230
they're basically
like, god damn it--

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.740
ERIC M. RUIZ: You beat me to it?

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.156
RYAN HOLIDAY: You beat me, and
now I'm not going to do it.

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:16.660
So that was sort of the idea.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.100
ERIC M. RUIZ: Nice.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.600
Well done.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.320
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah, it worked.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.860
It worked.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.590
ERIC M. RUIZ: So yeah, this
book, this storyline, it's so--

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.100
it's crazy.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.600
It seems like
something straight out

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.300
of the 19th century, where you
have these crazy characters

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.758
from disparate backgrounds,
some of the greatest crossovers

00:02:28.758 --> 00:02:30.142
since Marvel's "Infinity War."

00:02:30.142 --> 00:02:31.850
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah,
I mean, if you made--

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.190
if you made up--

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.350
so first, I've just the
simple story, which is--

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.000
this was a story of the
professional wrestler Hulk

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.450
Hogan having sex with
his best friend's wife.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.190
His best friend was legally
named Bubba the Love Sponge,

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.860
and then Bubba the Love
Sponge was secretly

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.960
recording them having sex.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.570
And then that tape is stolen,
leaked, a website runs it,

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.280
and then Hogan
sues the website--

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.990
sues Gawker for $100 million and
wins in court many years later,

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.550
and Gawker's put
out of business.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.960
That would be weird--

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.089
that, in itself, was an insane
story that got headlines

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.880
all over the world.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.350
I mean, that was great.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.980
And then to zoom out a few
months later and find that,

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.710
actually, an enigmatic
libertarian billionaire

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.470
had put the entire set
of events into motion,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.550
and he'd done so because nine
years previous, that website

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.740
had outed him as gay.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.510
It's just-- and then to flash
forward and find out that

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.440
the same lawyers who are
involved on both sides of this

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.560
end up representing and fighting
a case between the President

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.460
of the United States, who is
Donald Trump of all people,

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.340
and Stormy Daniels
the porn star--

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.940
it's just-- I mean, if I was--

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.714
we're spit balling this idea,
and I was-- you'd be like--

00:04:06.714 --> 00:04:08.380
you would have cut
me off at some point,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.090
like we don't need anymore.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.109
This is already
completely unbelievable.

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.650
It's like a choose
your own adventure

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.130
one where you pick like the most
ridiculous of all the options

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.430
over and over and over
again until it sounds--

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.290
it sounds like something
that could not have

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.240
possibly happened, let alone--

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.530
history is weird.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.070
But I do feel like things
are less weird in the--

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.560
part of the reason this
story was such big news

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.580
is people don't do
shit like this anymore.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.260
If you heard that Cornelius
Vanderbilt sued a media outlet

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.349
for embarrassing him,
you'd be like, OK,

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:45.640
that's what they did back then.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.570
But it's much stranger, I
think, that this happened in--

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.250
the verdict came down in 2016.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.560
It's very weird.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.850
ERIC M. RUIZ: And to
follow along that thread,

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.120
it seems amongst our peer group
that there was two lines drawn,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.090
where one side of the
sandbox, so to speak,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.160
very much said this a
great example of what

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.819
happens when you do
things that aren't right.

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:06.610
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.401
ERIC M. RUIZ: And then
the other side of it

00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:12.290
was like, wait, actually, a
billionaire just bankrupted

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.537
a journalism company.

00:05:14.537 --> 00:05:16.370
This is the end of
journalism as we know it.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.249
What president has
this [INAUDIBLE]??

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:19.790
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah,
well, it is weird

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.360
because there was
this period, and you

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.820
can see what people thought
during this two months--

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.780
two month period.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.020
You can see basically
up through the trial.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.040
In fact the coverage of
Gawker during the trial

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.080
is universally--

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.700
almost universally negative.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.740
These people deserve
what's happening to them.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.340
Even from the media itself,
how could they do this?

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.440
AJ Daulerio's testimony
is a sort of media crisis

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.460
where almost everyone
is uniformly anti-Gawker

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.540
at this point.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.550
Then the verdict happens, and
the verdict surprises everyone

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.830
in just how enormous it is.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.330
I mean, obviously having
a stolen sex tape of you

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.460
run has damages.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.950
Are those damages $140 million?

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.290
That's pretty enormous.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.540
But still, people were almost--

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.460
there was very--
in this two month

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.580
period between the verdict
and when Thiel's involvement

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.860
is revealed, the story is
seen as much less ominous

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.050
as it is after his unmasking.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.940
So there is a period
where people--

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.249
even the "New York
Times--" the co-counsel

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:27.040
of the "New York Times"
has interviewed him

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.581
in a "New York Times"
story, and he's

00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:30.130
like, there's no precedent here.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.320
He's like, basically,
you just don't

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.300
run sex tapes of celebrities
without permission.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.340
It's only when
Thiel's involvement

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.770
that suddenly everything--

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.380
all the history is revised,
and the entire narrative

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.310
shifts, which in some ways,
Thiel should have anticipated.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.720
That he didn't--

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.960
I think there was some naiveness
there, or some wishful thinking

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.870
about how it would be seen.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.780
He's the-- as soon
as you win, you're

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.130
not the underdog anymore, and
so there's that part of it.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.020
But then the idea--

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.060
people go like,
he just set this--

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.500
I mean, he did nothing that
hasn't been done many times

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.190
in the past.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.240
The difference here is that
media outlets don't usually

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.640
run stories that open them
up to such enormous damages

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.470
judgments, and they
usually settle cases

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.900
long before they ever--

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.950
media companies
know, basically, you

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.440
don't let cases get
in front of a jury.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.277
Because once it gets
in front of a jury--

00:07:34.277 --> 00:07:35.860
the jury is not
sitting there thinking

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.910
they have this immense
constitutional obligation.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.559
In this case, they
were like, man,

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:43.600
you really screwed over
this Hulk Hogan guy who's

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.100
from the town that we live in.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.139
Fuck you.

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:47.680
I think that was
the jury's verdict--

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.500
that was what reflected
the jury's verdict.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.040
So I think in a
weird way, I think

00:07:54.040 --> 00:08:01.490
the precedent is much less
than media personalities

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.840
and academics and stuff want
to make you think there is.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.960
ERIC M. RUIZ: That's fair.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.635
And to kind of follow
along with that,

00:08:07.635 --> 00:08:09.551
too, something that I
found really fascinating

00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:10.880
was that Gawker--

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.310
they have Valleywag, which is
where the article went out,

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.060
but then they had
this other outlet

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.860
they called Jezebel,
which I believe is still--

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.580
might still be running.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.840
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.256
ERIC M. RUIZ: But Jezebel was
very much of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:20.256 --> 00:08:24.132
protecting female celebrities,
going out of their way

00:08:24.132 --> 00:08:26.090
to make sure that things--
that leaks like this

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.840
don't happen and get
posted on their site.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.150
So isn't that kind of a
hypocrisy in and of itself?

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.858
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well,
to be perfectly fair,

00:08:31.858 --> 00:08:34.370
I mean, there's conservative
voices at the "New York Times"

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.120
and liberal voices at
the "New York Times"

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.570
and different editors
at different times,

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.600
different divisions.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.150
They're not going to necessarily
always be a uniform point

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.740
of view from any media outlet.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.737
Just like YouTube or Google
has different departments that

00:08:49.737 --> 00:08:51.320
do different things,
and sometimes, it

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.070
feels like those are in conflict
with each other, when really,

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.990
they're just not overlapping.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.920
So it's not--

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.780
I don't think you want to
paint it as too hypocritical,

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.320
but there is an interesting--

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.400
I mean, there's one quote I have
in the book from a Jezebel--

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.510
they were like-- the story says,
do not out people who do not

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.200
want to be outed, end of story.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.790
And it's like--
and then it's just

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.700
like, everyone has
a right to privacy.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.760
And so there is some irony
that the media outlet that

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.350
owns Jezebel would then be
destroyed when they egregiously

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.820
out one person and
egregiously violate

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.640
the privacy of another
person, and that at any point,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.680
instead of apologizing
or settling

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.670
the case or some
admission of wrongdoing,

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.700
they take it all
the way to a jury,

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.940
and then those exact words
are held against them

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.815
in that court of law.

00:09:47.815 --> 00:09:49.814
ERIC M. RUIZ: Yeah, that
was really interesting,

00:09:49.814 --> 00:09:52.273
about how at no point did they
ever just stop and say, wow,

00:09:52.273 --> 00:09:53.439
maybe we should just settle.

00:09:53.439 --> 00:09:54.920
Maybe we should just apologise.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.360
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well,
they did try to settle.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.860
Much later on, they
tried to settle,

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.470
but the right thing to
do, I think strategically,

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.300
would have been--

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.720
so Hogan files the case in 2012.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.514
He does not-- it's
a $100 million case,

00:10:07.514 --> 00:10:08.930
but I don't think
they necessarily

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.090
thought they would be
winning $100 million.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.570
It's not until after the
discovery and then as Gawker--

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.390
as they go through the
case that their odds get--

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.850
so if Gawker had taken it
seriously at the outset,

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:20.754
and maybe they'd--

00:10:20.754 --> 00:10:22.670
well, first off, they
get two cease and desist

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.870
orders that tell them--

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.370
that demand they
take the tape down.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.230
So if they'd taken
it down then, we

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.895
wouldn't even be talking here.

00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:30.770
So they ignore it, but
then if, at some point

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.460
they looked at the actual merits
of the case, and they said,

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.320
look, this isn't worth fighting.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.080
Let's pay this guy a half
million dollars to go away,

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.860
or we offer him a certain
amount and an apology,

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.440
I think Hogan would
have taken it.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:49.640
But as the case wound on,
Hogan is sort of lost.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.252
He ends up losing his job
because of it, because

00:10:53.252 --> 00:10:53.960
of things he did.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.820
He said some racist
things on the same tape.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:02.000
But Hogan got to this point of
no return, and so it was less--

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.980
less and less likely
that he would settle.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.250
I think it's more
that, had Gawker

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:11.810
taken a tack that was,
essentially, look,

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.630
we're a media outlet, our
job is to run stories.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.130
We ran this story
because we thought

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.560
it was newsworthy at the time.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.340
We believed that we were within
our rights to publish it.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.240
We did not intentionally
hurt anyone.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.722
We've taken the story down.

00:11:27.722 --> 00:11:28.430
We've apologized.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.390
We've attempted to settle
this case many times.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.680
I think that would have--

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.190
that legal strategy
would have played

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.680
much better in that courtroom
than the legal strategy which

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.260
they did run, which
was like, first,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.640
we can run anything we want.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.840
Why are we even here?

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.530
And then two, we believed
this story was newsworthy,

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.820
which is what they claimed.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.670
But then that opened
up Thiel's legal team

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.770
to be able to go, OK,
what research did you

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.300
do before running this story?

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.950
Why was it newsworthy?

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.840
Why did you say
in your deposition

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.790
that you didn't believe
it was newsworthy?

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.990
So they really--

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.570
I think in some ways, they did
not get great legal advice,

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.050
and they ended up fighting this.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.990
They were-- look,
they were fighting--

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.340
they weren't fighting on
first amendment grounds.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.930
They were fighting on a
right to-- they were fighting

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.790
a right to privacy
case in Florida,

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.410
and they were fighting
the intentional infliction

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.430
of emotional distress.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:24.117
And so this idea of, we've
said before that no one should

00:12:24.117 --> 00:12:25.700
be outed, that they
shouldn't be hurt,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.744
made it look very intentional
and very difficult to defend.

00:12:30.744 --> 00:12:32.660
ERIC M. RUIZ: So 2007,
they write this article

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.410
about Peter Thiel.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:34.160
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yep.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.350
ERIC M. RUIZ: 2012, they
post the Hulk Hogan video.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.040
So then how did Hulk Hogan
and Peter Thiel link up?

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.690
Because I'm assuming
there's a lot

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.690
of people that had
vendettas against Gawker.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.860
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah,
yeah, obviously, they

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.520
weren't friends beforehand.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.980
Actually, I went to a
dinner at Thiel's house,

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.540
sort of a victory
dinner, when I was

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:58.890
writing the book, which is in
the hills, and Hogan was there.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.180
This was the first time they'd
ever-- this was in 2000--

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.310
early 2017.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.380
It's the first time they'd ever
met or been in the same room

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.470
together, so this is
months after the verdict.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:15.480
So they-- and Hogan
actually did not

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.090
know who was backing his case.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.060
He just knew that a wealthy
businessman, or group

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.700
of businessmen,
was doing the case,

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.200
and that was, in
some ways, I think,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.330
how they were able to keep
it secret for so long.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.190
But what happened was--

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.120
so in 2011, Thiel had embarked
on this strategy of, OK,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.850
we think that, in
Gawker's archives,

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.500
there are causes of action.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.982
There are articles
they've written

00:13:38.982 --> 00:13:41.190
that have crossed some line,
whether it's a copyright

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.000
violation.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.760
Maybe they were running photos
they didn't have the rights to.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.490
Maybe they were--
they thought maybe

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.560
there'd be something on
the affiliate commissions

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.018
they weren't disclosing, that
they were taking an affiliate

00:13:52.018 --> 00:13:55.840
cut, or maybe that they had
violated someone's privacy,

00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.270
any number of violations,
that they would find people

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.910
who were willing to let Thiel
back their case against Gawker.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.910
And they really didn't
find anything right away.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.701
They looked, but they
didn't find anything.

00:14:07.701 --> 00:14:12.420
And so it's not until October
of 2012 that the tape runs,

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.890
and Hogan had actually been
very public about his intention

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.660
to sue whoever runs it.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.550
And Gawker was aware
of this as well.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.890
There's like a-- there's a
TMZ headline that's like--

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.010
and you can see this all
in the legal documents.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.920
But there's a TMZ headline
that's like, Hogan--

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.190
I will sue whoever
runs sex tape.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:37.260
And then the publicist
at TMZ sends it

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.710
to Gawker's tip line, which
goes to all their editors.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.930
So they knew that this
was going to happen,

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.200
or they knew that there
was a risk of it happening.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.880
And so he'd been
very public about it,

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.620
and then Gawker runs it.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.440
And that's the--

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.110
Thiel is, at that point,
laying in wait for something

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.950
like that to happen.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.670
So they see the tape when
it runs like everyone else,

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.570
and then Charles Harter, who's
the lawyer that was running

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.910
the conspiracy, puts a
call into Hogan and says,

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.430
hey, do you need any help.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.406
And that sets this in motion.

00:15:10.406 --> 00:15:11.280
ERIC M. RUIZ: Got it.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.849
And earlier, when we were
describing the characters

00:15:13.849 --> 00:15:16.140
in this book, there was one
that we didn't mention yet,

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:20.210
which is Mr. A, and he's
got-- so two questions there.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.470
The first one is,
could he have--

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.730
was Mr. A the only option
for a secret agent name?

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:27.835
RYAN HOLIDAY: No, I mean--

00:15:27.835 --> 00:15:28.710
I guess you're right.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.560
It's not the most creative--

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.360
it's not Deep Throat or
something cool like that.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.540
But no, I think--

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:40.350
he didn't want his
identity known, and that--

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:43.800
I wouldn't have chosen Mr.
A, but that's the name they--

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.417
that I first heard from them.

00:15:46.417 --> 00:15:48.000
And so I was like,
OK, we'll use that.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.510
ERIC M. RUIZ: We'll run with it.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.100
And so he was
really the one that

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.464
brought this plan to Thiel?

00:15:51.464 --> 00:15:53.880
RYAN HOLIDAY: He basically
pitches it like a tech startup.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.330
He's-- he has a dinner with
Thiel in Berlin in April

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.800
of 2011.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.830
And they're sitting
there, and Thiel's used

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.000
to getting pitched.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.210
And he says, hey, look, I
know you don't like Gawker.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.956
I have this idea.

00:16:07.956 --> 00:16:09.330
And I think the
remark-- not just

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.400
like is it kind of remarkable
that he pitches this.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.358
I think the remarkable
thing about that meeting

00:16:13.358 --> 00:16:17.770
is he actually says I think
it'll take three to five years,

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.720
and I think it will cost
roughly $10 million.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.330
And that's almost
exactly what happened,

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.040
so he completely called it.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.210
But, yeah, this
26-year-old kid pitches

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:34.170
Peter Thiel on this idea, and
Thiel backs it on the spot.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:38.220
And it sets in motion
all this stuff that--

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.320
the meeting's in 2011.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.340
No one even knows
of Mr. A's existence

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.357
until the book came out
in February of 2018.

00:16:47.357 --> 00:16:49.440
ERIC M. RUIZ: Yeah, something
like a Facebook post

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.470
or something, like a photo.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:51.570
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well,
no, some people

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.944
obviously in Thiel's orbit
knew, and obviously the people

00:16:53.944 --> 00:16:55.980
involved in the conspiracy.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.990
Mr. A was the one
interacting with people.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.040
That's how Thiel
kept his distance.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.910
But I'm saying that
his involvement in it

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:06.380
was totally secret until even
the publication of the book.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.490
So I guess it just goes
to show, on the one hand,

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.040
secrecy is really important,
but two, this thing that

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.260
had been covered by every major
media outlet on the planet

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.420
didn't go--

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.880
I think what's fascinating is
that it was actually easier

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.200
for people to hold onto the
idea that this billionaire was

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:31.090
personally reviewing
legal documents,

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:35.530
than the idea that he might
have paid someone to help him.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.290
So I think it's also
illustrative of just how

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:44.830
little we understand how things
work and how superficial--

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.200
how willing we are to
just stop at the surface

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.550
and be like oh, OK.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.380
We're like, oh,
Hogan's suing Gawker.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.210
That's what it is, and
then it's like, oh,

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:53.290
Peter Thiel backed it.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.510
OK, that's what it is.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.860
No one was like,
what's the real story,

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.204
and that's why this
didn't get out.

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:00.620
ERIC M. RUIZ: And
so in this book,

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:05.080
you had access to Mr. Thiel,
to Nick Denton, Hulk Hogan

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.190
as well.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.260
How did that come to be?

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.580
How did-- did both of
them reach out to you?

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:13.210
Did Gawker and Thiel's camp
come forward with information,

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.590
or did you reach out to them?

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:16.870
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah, so
Thiel emailed me first

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.240
because he'd read some of the--

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.850
I have a media column for the
"Observer," which he had read,

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:21.500
so he likes something.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.660
He just sent me an email.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.180
He said, hey, I
liked your column.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.760
We should-- he said,
next time you're

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.910
in New York or San Francisco,
said we should have dinner,

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.210
we should talk about the MBTO,
and then in parentheses he

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:37.570
says, Manhattan Based
Terrorist Organization, which

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.910
is how he'd always refer
to Gawker, I guess.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.330
So he's already giving me this
glimpse into how it works.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.090
So we ended up
talking, and then--

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.006
so I was thinking about
doing a book about it,

00:18:47.006 --> 00:18:50.230
and then independently, Nick
Denton reached out to me

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.910
because he'd read my more
philosophical writing and--

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.630
like that, and we were
talking about that.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.560
And then I basically
was like, hey, look,

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.860
I'm talking to Thiel.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.200
Will you talk to me?

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.800
And the fact that I was talking
to both of them, I think,

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.990
contributed to the--

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.970
became a dynamic
where neither of them

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:14.500
necessarily wanted to
disengage because then

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.446
it would be lopsided in
favor of their mortal enemy.

00:19:18.446 --> 00:19:20.320
ERIC M. RUIZ: Something
that really stood out

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.105
from your description of
Thiel in the book was that--

00:19:23.105 --> 00:19:25.210
and this is a quote
from the book--

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.550
you describe him as,
quote, "as if he is always

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.060
in the process of deciding what
he thinks," which is beautiful.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.710
Can you talk more
about that line?

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:35.335
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah, I don't know
if it's beautiful necessarily,

00:19:35.335 --> 00:19:36.515
but I appreciate that.

00:19:36.515 --> 00:19:39.120
When you're talking to
Thiel, it's strange.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.354
He has this tick.

00:19:40.354 --> 00:19:41.770
At first, I thought
it was a tick,

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.186
and then I realized it was
more-- it was deeper than that.

00:19:44.186 --> 00:19:46.060
If you ask him a-- if
you ask me a question,

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.700
and then I was just like--

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.780
ERIC M. RUIZ: That--

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.780
RYAN HOLIDAY: See, you're
getting uncomfortable.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.110
ERIC M. RUIZ: Yeah.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.360
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah, because
you're like why am I not--

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.970
and so he really just stops
and thinks about everything

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.040
before he answers.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.400
And so it was actually weird.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.230
I get uncomfortable
from that myself,

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.940
and so I'd always be like, oh,
did I ask the wrong question?

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.850
Should I ask a
different question?

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.190
And then by the time I'd
start the second question,

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:12.050
he was just getting around
to his first answer,

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.580
and so then that it was
this sort of comedy of,

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.170
you go this way,
I'll go this way.

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.330
But he's very--

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.700
I think he's a
very deep thinker.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.527
He's a very considerate thinker.

00:20:23.527 --> 00:20:25.360
Not necessarily considerate
to other people,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.980
but I mean, he really considers
and deliberates about his work.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.140
There's not much
sloppiness there.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.600
He's not willing-- he's not
willing to just pull something

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.440
out of his ass.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.100
He's really going
to think about it.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.880
And then what I think is
interesting is that he has--

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:44.770
he does this every time,
even if it's something

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.580
he's talked about before.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.470
So he sort of--

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:48.760
ERIC M. RUIZ: Like he's
willing to change his opinion?

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.426
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well,
no, it's like he's--

00:20:50.426 --> 00:20:52.930
instead of having
this shortcut, like

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:56.770
I already have an opinion
about x, so that's my opinion.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:02.080
If you ask him, I think he
almost goes to first principles

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.930
and thinks about it
from scratch again.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.290
So that's why there's
the delay, like he's not

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:11.060
utilizing the shortcuts
that most of us are doing.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.670
And so I think this does--

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.190
this is a much more--

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:18.780
this is a much less sloppy
way to think and act and talk.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.870
So I think that's
where, I think,

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.540
some of these deeply
counterintuitive,

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.840
if not occasionally
strange, insights come from,

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:34.054
is that he's not
just winging it.

00:21:34.054 --> 00:21:35.470
ERIC M. RUIZ: So
this is very much

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.290
a new type of book for you, and
I saw somewhere, maybe Reddit,

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.081
maybe your website,
that you read something

00:21:40.081 --> 00:21:41.969
like 25,000 pages
of legal documents?

00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:42.760
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.180
ERIC M. RUIZ: Wow.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:43.900
RYAN HOLIDAY: A lot.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.160
ERIC M. RUIZ: So tell
us, then-- can you

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.493
tell us about the process of
writing a new type of book?

00:21:47.493 --> 00:21:48.530
What was that like?

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:49.440
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well,
my other books,

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.898
they're all about basically
dead-- they're either about me,

00:21:51.898 --> 00:21:56.500
or they're about dead people,
so that's much easier.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.890
And most of my books
are not chronological,

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.390
so I'm just telling different
stories here or there of stuff

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:02.980
that's interesting to me.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.470
This was harder because
a set of things happened,

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.750
and they happened
in a specific order,

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.740
and then I had to tell them
more or less in that order.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.740
So I had to first just
figure out what happened.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.370
So obviously, I
haven't done a lot

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.070
of interviews for my previous
books, so that was new.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.570
I had to read a lot of legal
documents, which was definitely

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:22.070
new.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:27.120
There was 17 binders,
25,000 pages,

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.770
and that was after we got rid of
all the unnecessary pages, all

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:36.054
the redundant pages or
duplicates or whatever.

00:22:36.054 --> 00:22:38.220
Yes, so I had to read it,
so yeah, it was different.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.520
I just had to come up with
a different methodology

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.240
for writing.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.544
I had to do much more
outlining, organization.

00:22:46.544 --> 00:22:47.460
It was just different.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.830
But I think it was--

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.681
I enjoyed the challenge
of it, for sure.

00:22:51.681 --> 00:22:52.680
ERIC M. RUIZ: And it's--

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.490
got it.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.620
And I read it, I think
it was last week,

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.870
that the book's been optioned.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:57.995
RYAN HOLIDAY: It has, yeah.

00:22:57.995 --> 00:22:59.295
ERIC M. RUIZ: There's a movie.

00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:01.379
RYAN HOLIDAY: A
movie or a TV show.

00:23:01.379 --> 00:23:01.920
I don't know.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.705
My other books have
been optioned before,

00:23:04.705 --> 00:23:05.830
and sometimes, they happen.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:06.746
Sometimes, they don't.

00:23:06.746 --> 00:23:11.190
But a bunch of really big
people are interested in it,

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:12.047
so we'll see.

00:23:12.047 --> 00:23:13.130
I mean, I hope it happens.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:17.720
I mean, you could not invent
a more cinematic series

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.450
of events.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:22.470
I mean, like it was said, it
feels like fiction or history.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.200
I mean, it's
basically the "Count

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.620
of Monte Cristo" in modern days
is how I've been describing it.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.590
ERIC M. RUIZ: In Silicon
Valley and in Florida.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:31.340
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yes.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.650
Yeah, I mean, it's
a crazy story.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.010
So it would be great--

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:39.260
it sort of reminds me of the
People versus OJ Simpson,

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:43.010
a contained legal drama.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.240
So yeah, I hope it'll happen.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:44.600
We'll see.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:44.890
ERIC M. RUIZ: Nice.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.640
Well, wish you the
best of luck with that.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.950
And to kind of switch
tracks for a little bit,

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.800
you read a lot about
strategy, and it's

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.330
a theme in your other books.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.150
It's also the underlying
theme in this book as well.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.230
And to kind of start
off with, a quote that--

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:00.980
I think it was from a
master chess player.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.567
It said that, to begin with,
you must study the end.

00:24:03.567 --> 00:24:05.150
You don't want to
be the first to act.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.590
You want to be the
last man standing.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:07.100
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.390
ERIC M. RUIZ: Can you talk
about that a little bit?

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.931
RYAN HOLIDAY: So that's one of
Thiel's favorite quotes, which

00:24:11.931 --> 00:24:15.300
is why it's in the book, and
it's from Raul Capablanca.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.840
And its point is that you
have to know where you're

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:24.340
trying to end up, so then you
can evaluate your decisions

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.600
with that end in mind.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.970
What oftentimes
happens, we're like,

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:30.360
oh, we generally want
to go in a direction,

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.840
and then we make decisions that
take us, because the decisions

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.290
compound on each other,
that take us in a completely

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:39.770
different direction.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.240
So I think, in this
case, for instance,

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:51.280
Thiel wasn't thinking, oh, I
would like to just hurt Gawker.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.590
I think he was like, I want
Gawker to not exist at the end,

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:59.561
which is somewhat ominous and
can be scary depending on where

00:24:59.561 --> 00:25:00.060
he's--

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.240
but he had a very
clear end in mind,

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.200
which I think is the
strategic imperative.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.710
You have to-- what are
we trying to accomplish?

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.300
What does success look like?

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.760
And if you don't have
that, how can you properly

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.180
evaluate opportunities and
decisions as they come up?

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.490
You can't.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:20.580
You're looking too short term.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.830
And so the decisions--

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.670
the logic that you're
doing might make sense

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:28.560
in those individual decisions,
but they get you further.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.980
So the way this would
apply in ordinary life

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.960
would be like, if
you don't know what

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.600
you want to do, if you don't
know where you want to end up,

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.080
if you don't know what
happiness or success looks like,

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:40.950
you end up--

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.020
you're offered a
promotion, but it

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:47.040
requires you to move to a place
you don't want to live in.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.710
Or you end up getting
paid more money,

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.430
but now you have to work more
hours, so you're less happy.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:56.700
Or there's this opportunity to
do this thing in your career,

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.060
but it's going to inflict
a certain amount of stress

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.570
or damage that your
marriage cannot sustain.

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.730
And so people end up
making short term decisions

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.190
where it's like, of course,
if someone offered you

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:09.990
x amount of dollars
you should accept it,

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.510
or who wouldn't want
to live in this city.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.570
Well, maybe the answer is you.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.730
And so we go, oh,
I should do this,

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.460
or I have to do this
because it makes

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.580
so much overwhelming sense
in the context of these two

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:24.600
options.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.360
But what you're not
seeing is, over here, you

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.490
have your giant pool
of options, and this

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:33.160
is shrinking as a result
of one decision or another.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:39.860
And so for me, I love writing,
and then I'm pretty good at it.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.860
And it's what makes me--

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.540
I'm happy when I'm writing.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:46.440
But then I get offered all sorts
of other opportunities in life

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.100
that can shrink or expand the
amount of time that I have

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.340
to do writing, and so if I
don't know what the end--

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.594
what I'm working towards, what
I want my life to look like,

00:26:56.594 --> 00:26:57.510
then I'm going to be--

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.010
of course, I should go here,
or of course, I should do this,

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:02.440
or of course, I should hop on
the phone with this person.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:07.050
But it's actually-- it's a
short term success that's

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.019
causing a long term failure.

00:27:09.019 --> 00:27:11.310
ERIC M. RUIZ: And that's one
I think about quite a bit.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.476
I think, in our peer group--

00:27:12.476 --> 00:27:14.340
I know we're both--
you're, what, from '87?

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:14.700
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.260
ERIC M. RUIZ: We're Reagan
babies. '87 as well.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.110
RYAN HOLIDAY: OK.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.660
ERIC M. RUIZ: And it
seems to me that my group

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.190
of friends and my
colleagues kind of fall

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:21.120
into one of two camps.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.010
It's either, I have
too many options,

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.570
and I don't know
which one to take.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.220
I don't know what
to optimize for.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.490
Or I don't know what I want
to do, I have no options,

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.110
and I'm just stuck here.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:33.660
And I feel like there's
this balance of,

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:37.830
you want to not be so focused
that you only have one--

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.600
one destination,
but you also don't

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.655
want to be so broad that
everything is now an option

00:27:42.655 --> 00:27:44.280
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah,
those are two sides

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.550
of the same coin in the sense
that if you don't know what you

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:51.325
want to do, it looks like
you have less opportunities

00:27:51.325 --> 00:27:52.200
than you actually do.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.930
If you know-- if you know
clearly here's what I want

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.630
to do, there's lots of
little-- you might not be--

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.060
you might not have some world
changing opportunity right

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.680
in front of you, but
you have little things

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.388
you can do that might
put you on the path

00:28:03.388 --> 00:28:05.340
to get where you want to go.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.696
And then, yeah, if you
have too many options,

00:28:07.696 --> 00:28:09.320
and you don't know
what you want to do,

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.370
it's obviously a
champagne problem.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.050
Many people would
kill to be there.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.350
But how-- you're not
going to optimize or make

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:19.200
the right decision in
that set of circumstances

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.980
because you don't know
which option is better

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.440
than the other options, and
there's always a better option,

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.023
I would think.

00:28:26.023 --> 00:28:29.220
So I think this is also
true as a business.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.445
If you don't know what--

00:28:30.445 --> 00:28:32.070
if you don't know
what your business is

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:34.170
and what your business
does, how do you

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.810
know which opportunities
are in your wheel house

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.390
and which ones are
outside your wheel house.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:41.098
ERIC M. RUIZ: And then
how do you balance

00:28:41.098 --> 00:28:43.470
this idea of being happy
with what life has given you,

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:45.011
or the things that
you've worked for,

00:28:45.011 --> 00:28:46.830
and then going
for the next step?

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.280
How do you know when
an impulse is ambition,

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.900
or if it's going to come at a
cost of more fame, more glory?

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.700
Which is-- in a way,
those are good things,

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.200
but what's the cost to that?

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.030
RYAN HOLIDAY: I
mean, that's-- yeah,

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:00.488
that's the million
dollar question.

00:29:00.488 --> 00:29:01.450
How do you know?

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:05.520
I don't have-- like here's the
answer to all life's problems

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.810
in one sentence.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:08.670
I wish.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.785
But I do think you--

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.180
here's how I do it--

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.560
I go what do I want
my day to look like?

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.200
I think about it in
terms of one day--

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.020
one day, like right now?

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.230
What do I want one day to
look like in five years,

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.730
in 10 years?

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.440
What do I want my
life to look like?

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:33.730
And then I try to make decisions
that get me to that life.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:38.905
So I had a conversation
with someone--

00:29:38.905 --> 00:29:40.280
I had a conversation
with someone

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.570
pretty early on in my career.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.549
I'd been successful
early, and I was

00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:44.840
thinking about doing something.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.036
And he said, what do
you do with your money?

00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:49.410
And I was like,
what do you mean?

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:50.680
And he's like, what do you do?

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.430
Do you buy boats, or do save it?

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.259
Or do you give it
all to charity?

00:29:58.259 --> 00:29:59.550
What do you do with your money?

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.674
And I was like, I don't
really do anything with it.

00:30:01.674 --> 00:30:03.710
It just sits in a bank account.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:06.950
I live a relatively
cheap lifestyle,

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:11.610
and I have what I want to
have, so I don't need it.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.407
And he was like, so why
are you doing this thing?

00:30:14.407 --> 00:30:16.490
Why are you doing this
thing that you don't really

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:19.040
like to get more of
a thing that you're

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.650
saying you don't really need?

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:22.820
And so that's a
long way of saying

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:27.280
that, I realize that having more
or less money within a range--

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.530
a normal-- not a
billionaire range or even--

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:33.110
just a normal range--

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:38.930
was not affecting my life in
any positive or negative way.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:43.270
So it was like,
oh, OK, what do I--

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:48.020
then what do-- what does
positively or negatively affect

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.040
my life?

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.810
I fucking hate
going to meetings.

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.600
I hate living in certain
places that I've lived.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.310
I hate getting on the
phone for no reason.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.120
So it's like, oh, OK,
so I'm going to make--

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.209
the decisions I should
make should not be like,

00:31:01.209 --> 00:31:02.750
is this going to
make a lot of money,

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:06.580
or is this going to get me
a lot of media attention?

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.440
But is this thing going to
increase the amount of phone

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.960
calls that I have to be on, or
decrease the amount of phone

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.130
calls I want to live on?

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:16.601
Or is this going to free me up
to live where I want to live,

00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:19.100
or is it going to force me to
spend a lot of time in a place

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.510
that I don't want to be?

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:26.056
And so that is kind of how
I evaluate those decisions.

00:31:26.056 --> 00:31:26.930
ERIC M. RUIZ: Got it.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:28.760
Another quote that
really stuck out to me

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.130
was from BH Liddell Hart--

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:32.780
in strategy, the
longest way around

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.500
is often the shortest
way home, which is,

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.750
in a way, kind of changed
my life in a good way, where

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:38.300
it's like, ah!

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.620
RYAN HOLIDAY: What
does it mean to you?

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.910
ERIC M. RUIZ: To me,
I think it's that--

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:43.368
it's that idea that you have
to start from the end and work

00:31:43.368 --> 00:31:46.760
backwards, where you have to
have that objective in mind

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.240
and know that it's not going
to be there immediately.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:54.840
For example, let's say that I
want to write for a major blog.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.410
Well, it's going to be very
hard to write for, let's say,

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.040
Fast Company.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:58.831
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:31:58.831 --> 00:32:01.606
ERIC M. RUIZ: But if I can write
for a few lesser known blogs

00:32:01.606 --> 00:32:03.980
or maybe some very specific
ones to build my credibility,

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.600
it's going to take longer
as opposed to me just

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.190
pitching the guy
at Fast Company,

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:09.320
but if I can prove myself
in these three blogs,

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.336
I can then package that,
give myself some credibility,

00:32:12.336 --> 00:32:14.210
and then go talk to the
guys at Fast Company.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:15.510
RYAN HOLIDAY: Or you
could do all that,

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:17.360
and then you might
get an incoming email

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.970
from them asking you--

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:19.887
ERIC M. RUIZ: Exactly.

00:32:19.887 --> 00:32:22.220
RYAN HOLIDAY: I think that's
what the quote means, yeah.

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:25.100
Oftentimes, we try-- and I think
this ties into the conspiracy

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.920
thing, or what happened in
this specific conspiracy, which

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.760
is that we think you should
do the straight forward

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.860
or the obvious thing.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.400
That's like, oh, Thiel
says they outed me,

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.130
so I think the more reactionary
person in that situation

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.840
will go, I'm going
to sue you for that.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.160
You shouldn't be
able to do that.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.650
Well, the law is pretty clear.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:46.880
I mean, there's some debate--

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.254
the law is pretty
clear that it's

00:32:48.254 --> 00:32:49.830
not illegal to out someone.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:51.710
It might be in bad taste.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:53.750
It might not be cool.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:56.300
It might cause consequences
for the-- but there's not--

00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:01.310
even if you were to win, one,
the verdict would probably not

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.320
be very large, and two, I'm not
sure it would send that much.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.360
It might almost send
the opposite message

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.670
that Thiel would want to say.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.490
You essentially
are-- in that case,

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.390
you would be arguing
that, you outed me as gay,

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:18.680
and it's bad to be gay, so
by making me see-- being

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.630
seen as gay, you've hurt me.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:25.180
That's not a strong
position, so he waits.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:29.137
I mean, he waits for four years
until 2011 to have the meeting,

00:33:29.137 --> 00:33:30.970
and then he waits until
another-- so a total

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:34.340
of five years, basically,
until he filed a case.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.340
The Hulk Hogan-- the running
an illicitly recorded sex

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.120
tape that the person
had loudly said,

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.840
do not run that-- cease and
desists had been ignored,

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.780
et cetera, is a
much stronger case.

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.590
So that's the long way home.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:50.720
That's the long way around.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.880
He waited five years
for this opportunity.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.360
But you could argue
that, from the minute

00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:02.040
they filed that case, they
were on a track to win.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.110
Do you know what I mean?

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:08.270
But had he filed a case
in 2007 or a weaker case

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:12.122
in 2008 or 2009, it might have
gone to trial much faster,

00:34:12.122 --> 00:34:13.580
but what it would
have accomplished

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.156
would have been far less.

00:34:15.156 --> 00:34:16.280
ERIC M. RUIZ: Got it, yeah.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.540
It almost seems like,
again, going back

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.581
to our peer group, our
colleagues, our coworkers,

00:34:19.581 --> 00:34:20.631
our friends.

00:34:20.631 --> 00:34:22.130
It seems one of the
recurring themes

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:25.399
is this want to immediately
dart towards the finish line,

00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:27.440
so immediately get to
wherever it is we're going.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.359
And I think that one of
the downsides to that

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:31.400
is, and I think seemed
[INAUDIBLE] alluded to it,

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.060
is that you cut yourself off
from serendipity, for one.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.469
And you also short
change and try

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:38.659
to hack a system that eventually
might hurt you down the line,

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.033
where it's like,
oh, that's Eric.

00:34:40.033 --> 00:34:42.781
That's the kid that tried
to do this the wrong way.

00:34:42.781 --> 00:34:44.030
I don't want to work with him.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.330
RYAN HOLIDAY: Sure.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:45.854
I mean, look, I'm
all for shortcuts

00:34:45.854 --> 00:34:48.020
where you're cutting off
unnecessary things that you

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:48.830
don't need to do.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:53.330
But yeah, I think
generally, doing it right

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:54.679
is better than doing it fast.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:55.470
ERIC M. RUIZ: Yeah.

00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:58.836
RYAN HOLIDAY: And
it's like whatever

00:34:58.836 --> 00:35:00.460
the first thing you
think you should do

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.380
is probably not the right thing.

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:07.090
But I do-- not to stereotype
millennials, but I do--

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:10.240
I think we're-- having grown
up with the internet the way

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.970
we've grown up with it,
there is this belief that,

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:15.250
because everything is
at your fingertips,

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.710
because things can
magically go viral,

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:21.650
because it's so easy to gather
large amounts of people,

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:24.410
that that is--

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:28.370
that's the hammer that
we have, so everything

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:30.020
looks like a nail.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:34.820
And those tools are a solution
to a very small subset

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.050
of problems.

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:40.430
Again, you can agree or
disagree with Thiel's criticism

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:43.220
of Gawker and the
outcome that he wanted,

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.230
but I'm not sure there
was any other way

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:48.110
to accomplish what he
wanted to accomplish.

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:51.260
So Denton said to me, if
Thiel's a libertarian,

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.870
why didn't he meet
speech with speech?

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.480
Why didn't he write
an op ed about Gawker?

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.670
Why didn't he start
a rival media outlet?

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:02.394
Why didn't he create a
public relations campaign?

00:36:02.394 --> 00:36:04.060
And the reason he
didn't do those things

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.720
is that they
wouldn't have worked.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.490
They wouldn't have
destroyed Gawker.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:09.050
He was trying to destroy Gawker.

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.900
That was the thing he felt
needed to be accomplished.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.960
Again, agree or disagree,
that's the fact--

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.960
that is the strategic
objective, and he

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.570
was willing to be patient
and creative enough

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:26.120
to find the strategy that
achieved that objective.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.570
Meanwhile, I think we're
changing our Facebook photos

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:31.130
and things that--

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:37.460
think that's going to
intimidate the NRA or something.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.960
ERIC M. RUIZ: But
the hashtags, bro!

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.470
RYAN HOLIDAY: Right.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:40.340
No, we think we're--

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.650
look, a hashtag-- first
off, I'm not actually sure

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:45.560
there's that many
examples of viral videos

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.540
or hashtags or
social media activism

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:49.600
solving that many problems.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.780
There is the AOS challenge.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.280
That seemed like
it actually worked.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.571
I wouldn't have thought it
would work, but that worked.

00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:57.060
But very few-- that
is not something

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.480
that's infinitely replicable.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.710
Power is somewhat
timeless in how it works,

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:07.130
and power is typically
required to fight power.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:08.870
And I think we've--

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:12.257
you don't solve every
problem by marching.

00:37:12.257 --> 00:37:13.840
ERIC M. RUIZ: I would
agree with that.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.501
And on that note, I want to
leave some time for some FAQs

00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:17.000
from--

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.880
QAs from you guys.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.260
So without further
ado, any questions?

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.460
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:23.790
RYAN HOLIDAY: Do we have to
throw this weird microphone?

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:24.200
ERIC M. RUIZ: We do.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.020
Would you like to do the honors?

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.447
RYAN HOLIDAY: No, you can do it.

00:37:26.447 --> 00:37:27.530
ERIC M. RUIZ: No pressure.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.140
Yes, my Tom Brady impersonation.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.897
RYAN HOLIDAY: That
was brilliant.

00:37:34.897 --> 00:37:35.980
ERIC M. RUIZ: Brett Favre.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.390
AUDIENCE: Thanks very
much for coming today.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.645
RYAN HOLIDAY: Of course.

00:37:37.645 --> 00:37:38.410
AUDIENCE: It was
really interesting,

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:40.420
and I'm looking forward
to reading the book.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:43.450
I was wondering, and you started
to touch on it a little bit,

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:48.970
about the meth addicted
ferret attention

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:52.570
span of people on the internet.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.860
I feel like that's
progressively gotten worse.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.660
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.493
AUDIENCE: And I was
wondering if you thought

00:37:57.493 --> 00:38:02.020
that maybe that kind of
facilitates conspiracies

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:05.380
like this one to go
undetected for a long time

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.530
because, basically, everyone
put it out of their heads

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:11.260
that Peter Thiel had been
outed, and that was it.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:15.070
They were on to the next
thing, and so there's probably

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:16.660
a lot more things
like this going on

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.993
that we don't know about
because everyone's looking over

00:38:18.993 --> 00:38:19.494
there now.

00:38:19.494 --> 00:38:20.868
RYAN HOLIDAY:
Well, look, I mean,

00:38:20.868 --> 00:38:23.080
you could argue, depending
on what you think happened

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.110
in the 2016 election, whether
there was Russian collusion

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:29.410
or intrusion or
not, the truth is

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:33.750
we were up in arms
on social media

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.060
about a lot of shit
that didn't matter--

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:40.230
tweets-- as opposed to what was
happening behind the scenes,

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.860
what was really going on.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.650
So I think you're totally right.

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:45.990
I would say two things
facilitate the conspiracy.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:49.610
So one is that we don't
believe these things happen.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:52.770
We sort of have this simplistic
understanding of the world.

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.050
We think everyone's friends,
everything's awesome,

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.797
and we don't realize
that people have agendas,

00:38:57.797 --> 00:38:59.130
and they're trying to do things.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:02.712
So that's-- there's a quote
from one of the Gawker writers--

00:39:02.712 --> 00:39:03.420
it's in the book.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.670
It's also in the documentary--

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:06.660
where he goes, we
scarcely could have

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.110
believed something so
vindictive and conspiratorial

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.140
could have happened.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.650
Well, it's like, that's
exactly why it happened.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:16.620
You literally couldn't
believe it could happen,

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.136
so you didn't see the somewhat
obvious signs in front of you,

00:39:20.136 --> 00:39:21.010
so that's part of it.

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.040
And then yeah, as
the general public

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.610
follows titillating
story to story,

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.700
gets distracted by things,
is outraged all the time,

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:35.150
in some ways, this makes
it easier for people

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:37.400
to either get away with things.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.950
Thiel was saying that, at
first, he was very nervous

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:44.050
that people would catch him.

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:46.330
And he was convinced
they would get caught,

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:49.180
and then he realized that no
one was even looking or thinking

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.580
about it at all, and
that, in some ways,

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.695
that was almost more alarming.

00:39:53.695 --> 00:39:56.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you could argue
that the current administration

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.590
is taking advantage of the fact
that you don't remember what

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.170
happened last week because
five other things have happened

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:05.620
this week that you've already
put at the top of your brain

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.490
stack.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:07.865
RYAN HOLIDAY:
Yeah, I think we're

00:40:07.865 --> 00:40:12.160
lucky that the chaos
is probably more

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:17.080
of a byproduct of
the incompetence than

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:21.700
of Machiavellian mastery.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:26.060
But yes, certainly,
whatever they are doing,

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.990
the fact that we're exhausted
from being outraged all

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:32.710
the time is-- makes--

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:36.130
the resistance is mostly
outrage resistance

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:42.760
as opposed to well organized,
established resistance

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.775
in that more traditional sense.

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:46.140
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.529
ERIC M. RUIZ:
Question over here?

00:40:47.529 --> 00:40:48.612
AUDIENCE: Oh, right by me?

00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:49.640
AUDIENCE: No, he was up first.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:50.181
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:52.929 --> 00:40:53.970
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:54.660
RYAN HOLIDAY: Of course.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.576
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I've
read a few or your books,

00:40:56.576 --> 00:40:59.340
and I enjoy them.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.730
If you had to pick one
feature on social media

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:06.630
that you think is causing
a pernicious behavioral

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:10.320
incentive, which
feature would that be?

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.450
And I guess you can
eliminate that feature.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:14.920
What feature would that be?

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.220
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well, I think
one of the more pernicious

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:21.980
and subtle ones was the 140
character limit on Twitter,

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:25.850
and I think Twitter's
over-representation--

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.000
media is on Twitter.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.500
Normal people don't spend that
much time on Twitter anymore,

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.020
but reporters spend all
their time on Twitter.

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:39.500
And so I think there's
been this effect of--

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:43.430
you see these smart people
who write long form writing

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:46.850
for a living competing
with each other

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:52.460
to reduce complicated issues
to the shortest, snarkiest,

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:56.630
least nuanced version
of whatever it is.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:59.090
It's like, you put the
hashtag section on Twitter,

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.340
and it's like you
click on it, and it's

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:05.390
the same top 100
journalists in America

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:08.030
immediately
responding and trying

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:11.270
to encapsulate this complicated
thing with as little nuance as

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:12.090
possible.

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:13.280
And I think that's very bad.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.970
Obviously, the expansion
to 280 characters

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:21.470
is better, but probably still--

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:24.935
it's crazy to think that
the reason all of that--

00:42:24.935 --> 00:42:28.910
the faux certainty
and simplification

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:33.440
and toxic culture of Twitter
just comes from the fact

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.170
that, when they launched, that
was how many characters you

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:37.640
could send in a text message.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:42.770
That's totally insane to me, and
then it took so long for them

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:44.130
to expand it.

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:46.490
And I don't know what
they were worried about,

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:49.100
but it hasn't changed--

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.660
it made only a marginal--

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.820
it's definitely improved
the site, I think.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.530
But that they didn't do that in
2010, I think, is a travesty,

00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.960
and we're still dealing with
the consequences of that.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:00.668
AUDIENCE: Indeed.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.410
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:09.890
Can you point to any
media or political event

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:12.470
since the Gawker
decision that you

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.270
think might have
turned out differently

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:18.480
had this case not been
decided the way that it was?

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.739
How has it impacted us?

00:43:19.739 --> 00:43:21.030
RYAN HOLIDAY: I don't think so.

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:23.750
Well, OK, so on the
one hand, simple answer

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:25.820
would be, no, I don't think so.

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.980
More complicated answer--

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.410
Thiel and the people
around him told me

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:33.404
that what he learned in
that Florida courtroom--

00:43:33.404 --> 00:43:34.070
he wasn't there.

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:37.970
But what he saw and how
this thing developed

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:42.560
was part of what gave
him both the confidence

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.780
and the insight to back
Trump in the election.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:47.972
So in that sense, yes.

00:43:47.972 --> 00:43:49.430
So I don't think
it's the precedent

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:52.790
of the verdict legally,
but more like the lessons

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:54.189
that were learned there.

00:43:54.189 --> 00:43:55.730
And then I mean,
you could also argue

00:43:55.730 --> 00:44:01.880
that Gamergate, which is a
movement loosely connected

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:08.280
to what happened here and
is very much anti-Gawker

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:13.820
becomes the alt-right,
which becomes this sort

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.870
of toxic force in our culture.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:18.440
So I think, indirectly, yes.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.367
Directly, no.

00:44:19.367 --> 00:44:21.700
AUDIENCE: So is that something
we should be happy about,

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.710
then, that it hasn't
had a chilling effect

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:25.637
on media outlets in some way?

00:44:25.637 --> 00:44:27.220
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well,
I mean, it's weird

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:31.460
because since 2016,
at least in terms

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.492
of traditional
journalism, you can

00:44:33.492 --> 00:44:36.422
argue we're living in a golden
age of investigative reporting.

00:44:36.422 --> 00:44:37.880
I mean, the Harvey
Weinstein stuff,

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.280
the entire MeToo movement--

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.430
this all-- I mean, the
traditional media is doing

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.930
a spec--

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.430
in some ways, I think they're
doing a terrible job reporting

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:49.056
on Trump because they get caught
up in things that don't really

00:44:49.056 --> 00:44:49.555
matter.

00:44:49.555 --> 00:44:51.260
But they're also
doing a fantastic job

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:55.510
of just nuts and bolts
reporting on what's happening.

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:59.340
So I mean, I don't think
there's been a chilling effect.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:07.650
I think the irony is Gawker and
this breed of publish first,

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:12.630
verify later, rumors are just
as valid a form of journalism

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:16.620
as triple fact checked
news articles--

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:21.750
if anything, that contributed
to the decline in the public's

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:25.050
trust in the media, and
that maybe over time,

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:27.150
we can come out of
that on the other side.

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.850
But I don't think it's
had the effect that some

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:33.330
of the more histrionic critics
have tried to say that it has.

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.600
Can you think of an example?

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.817
I'd be curious.

00:45:35.817 --> 00:45:37.650
AUDIENCE: Certainly not
off the top my head.

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:38.872
I kind of agree
with the golden age

00:45:38.872 --> 00:45:40.080
of investigative journalism.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.663
But I was also
wondering a little bit,

00:45:41.663 --> 00:45:46.120
is that perhaps because Gawker
had this salacious reputation,

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.210
and if it had been
the "New York Times"

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:51.480
or some other reputable
media company,

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.870
that the jury might not have
been so willing to slap them

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:56.200
with such a huge penalty?

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.350
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well,
with the lawyers who

00:45:58.350 --> 00:45:59.769
represented Hogan in Florida--

00:45:59.769 --> 00:46:02.310
not Charles [INAUDIBLE],, but
the lawyers who represented him

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:05.190
in Florida who did actually most
of the arguments in the trial--

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:08.100
they represented Sarah
Palin in a lawsuit

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.500
that she did file against
the "New York Times."

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.060
It was a "Times" story.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:13.400
They made a mistake.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:17.190
They said that
she'd put a target--

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:20.100
they implied that
she'd said that guy

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.550
that had attempted to
assassinate Gabby Giffords

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:28.030
was incited by Sarah
Palin, which wasn't true.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.390
And she sued the
"New York Times,"

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:31.800
but it was tossed out of court.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.400
So I don't think Thiel
could have sued and beaten

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.342
the "New York Times."

00:46:36.342 --> 00:46:38.550
One, I don't think they
would have handled it legally

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:39.171
the same way.

00:46:39.171 --> 00:46:40.920
I think they would
have done a better job.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.160
But two, I don't think he ever
would have had the opportunity

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:47.400
to do so because I don't
think they ever would

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.860
have run a story like this.

00:46:52.819 --> 00:46:54.860
AUDIENCE: This conversation
is really interesting

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.930
because it's actually causing
me to reframe my own opinions

00:46:57.930 --> 00:46:59.820
on the case because
before, I had thought

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:04.120
it was this really sad day for
our First Amendment rights,

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.970
and now I'm thinking maybe
this is sort of capitalism

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:10.020
at its finest,
where we're calling

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.630
the herd of media outlets
that maybe should have never

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:13.400
existed.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.240
RYAN HOLIDAY: So there was some
argument about the chilling

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:15.740
effect.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.400
They've called it
the Gawker Effect,

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:21.840
and for instance, there
was a story about R. Kelly

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:29.250
that a reporter in Chicago
tried to publish, that he--

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:30.870
the same sort of
R. Kelly stories

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:32.370
that have gone on
for a long time.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:35.190
And a couple of outlets
passed on publishing it,

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:37.020
and then Buzzfeed published it.

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.430
And so there was some--

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:39.960
oh, they didn't
run it because they

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.376
were afraid-- the other outlets
didn't run it because they

00:47:42.376 --> 00:47:45.640
were afraid of being sued.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.404
But in the end, an
outlet did run it,

00:47:49.404 --> 00:47:50.820
and they haven't
been sued for it.

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.130
So I mean, I don't
think a chill--

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:55.190
a chilling effect
sounds very ominous,

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:56.880
but if a chilling
effect is properly

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.930
defined as the media pausing
briefly before publishing

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:05.460
an article and making sure
that their T's are crossed

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:07.710
and their I's are
dotted, provided

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:10.470
that they do run
legitimate stories

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:15.030
that pass legal muster on
the other side of that test,

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:16.900
I'm not sure that's
a bad thing either.

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:20.610
And perhaps it's a bad thing
that it took this lawsuit

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:24.510
to get people to go, oh,
let's think about what--

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:27.180
let's think about
it before we run

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:30.420
videos that show up in an
anonymous brown envelope

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:31.740
from an unnamed source.

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:33.010
You know what I mean?

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:35.504
It could end badly.

00:48:35.504 --> 00:48:38.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I'm coming at
this from a strange perspective

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:39.794
because I've been at
Google for a year,

00:48:39.794 --> 00:48:43.424
but before that, I did six
years working at Gawker media.

00:48:43.424 --> 00:48:43.924
[LAUGHING]

00:48:43.924 --> 00:48:44.342
Yeah.

00:48:44.342 --> 00:48:44.760
ERIC M. RUIZ: Plot twist.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.820
AUDIENCE: I've seen
some shit, guys.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:46.653
I've seen some shit.

00:48:46.653 --> 00:48:47.999
RYAN HOLIDAY: I'm sure you have.

00:48:47.999 --> 00:48:49.540
What did you-- what
did you do there?

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:52.520
AUDIENCE: I ran film
partnerships here in LA.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:53.560
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.379
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:54.379 --> 00:48:55.670
I knew Nick Denton pretty well.

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:57.335
RYAN HOLIDAY: Sure.

00:48:57.335 --> 00:48:58.210
AUDIENCE: But I had--

00:48:58.210 --> 00:48:59.376
I have a bunch of questions.

00:48:59.376 --> 00:49:00.810
RYAN HOLIDAY: Go for it.

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:03.520
AUDIENCE: To the point you just
made, though, don't you feel--

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.544
this is to everybody--

00:49:05.544 --> 00:49:07.960
that there are a lot of-- there
potentially could be a lot

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:11.230
of stories that now news sources
are holding back that would

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:14.914
make powerful people
afraid for fear of--

00:49:14.914 --> 00:49:16.330
so we don't really
know the impact

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:18.413
because people could be
holding these stories back

00:49:18.413 --> 00:49:20.574
that could have legal
ramifications, which is--

00:49:20.574 --> 00:49:21.740
RYAN HOLIDAY: No, it's true.

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:25.060
Look, Gawker's-- as you
know, Gawker sort of--

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:28.117
Nick would say that
Gawker's ideal story was

00:49:28.117 --> 00:49:29.950
the kind of story that
two journalists would

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:34.620
gossip about at a
bar, the story that--

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:38.410
the real story that they
hadn't been able to run.

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:40.990
And that sounds great
in theory, but there

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:43.120
could be a lot of
reasons why they're not

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.860
able to run that story.

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.510
It could be that it's not true.

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:49.480
It could be that
they haven't been

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.300
able to prove it yet, that they
haven't done enough work on it.

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:53.930
There could be a lot of reasons.

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:59.200
And so two journalists
gossiping at a bar

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:07.300
that a big Silicon Valley
investor is semi openly gay,

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:10.930
is fine for two
journalists to gossip about

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:14.100
because it's two people.

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.170
That's what gossip is.

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:18.750
But when you publish it in
front of potentially millions

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:21.710
of people, then it
gets more complicated.

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:22.710
Do you know what I mean?

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:23.970
It gets more complicated.

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:25.360
Is it the right thing to do?

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.620
What is the news--

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.440
what is the news
value of this story?

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.480
Do the costs outweigh--

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:34.080
so I do think, Gawker's
instinct was always,

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.720
as you know, to publish.

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:40.020
Publish first and think
about consequences second,

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:43.740
and that is why they were
early to the Louis CK story.

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.100
They were early to a number--

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.620
the Bill Cosby story.

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:50.670
They were-- they got the
story of Rob Ford, the Toronto

00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:53.790
mayor who was apparently
a crack addict.

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:56.340
They were early to
a lot of stories,

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.765
and they should be
commended for that.

00:50:58.765 --> 00:51:00.390
Part of the reason
those stories didn't

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:02.550
have an enormous amount
of impact at the time

00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:07.920
is because people also knew
that Gawker's standard for what

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:10.050
they ran was not the
same as other outlets.

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:11.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:14.392
I mean, Nick's
theory on the stuff

00:51:14.392 --> 00:51:16.600
that other places wouldn't
publish is I worked there.

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:21.700
But I also think they did some
indefensible things, so yeah.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:23.920
RYAN HOLIDAY: It's
complicated, and in a way,

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.170
I respect that Nick--

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:27.204
I think Nick is as--

00:51:27.204 --> 00:51:28.620
we talked a lot
about Peter, but I

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:32.070
think Nick is as
brilliant and as creative

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:36.932
and as sort of singularly unique
as an individual as Thiel is.

00:51:36.932 --> 00:51:39.390
And in a way, that's probably
why they ended up in conflict

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:39.990
with each other.

00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.740
AUDIENCE: Totally.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.300
RYAN HOLIDAY: And
so in some ways,

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:46.444
I very much respect that
was Denton's vision.

00:51:46.444 --> 00:51:47.860
Denton's vision
was that the world

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.920
would be better if those stories
that people were gossiping

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.460
about would be published.

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.300
And you quoted [INAUDIBLE],,
he had real skin in the game.

00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.100
He didn't just say
this in theory.

00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.020
He built a whole
company around it.

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:01.930
It reached billions of people.

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:03.490
He fought for it.

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:07.930
He also made the calculation
rightly, up until this case,

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:13.640
that people would get
mad about Gawker stories,

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.910
but would rarely do
anything about it.

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:20.980
I think Denton had a very
high tolerance for being sued,

00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:24.140
and he was-- that's why he was
willing to fight this case.

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:28.430
And had Thiel not been
backing Hogan in secret,

00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:30.200
Hogan probably would have lost.

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:34.280
So Thiel-- so Denton made
the right calculation

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.500
given the facts that he had.

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.560
He just missed a
very important fact,

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.200
which is that several
years previous,

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.650
he picked a fight with
probably the wrong person.

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:46.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.520
So I guess my other question
why I wanted this was--

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:52.760
so you spent so much
time with all of this.

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.960
Where do you personally land
when it comes to the two posts

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:56.690
the question--

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:59.600
the outing and the sex tape?

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.810
Do you-- when it comes to,
did they have a constitutional

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:06.347
right to post it, and did
they have an ethical--

00:53:06.347 --> 00:53:07.180
what are the ethics?

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.410
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah, so I
think, constitutionally, you

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:13.060
have the right to
out someone, just

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:17.630
in the way that you would have
the right to say that someone

00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:19.130
is having an affair.

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:23.720
A pseudo-- Thiel was not a
completely private individual.

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.750
I mean, he'd sold a company
for a billion dollars to eBay.

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:29.210
I don't know the sexuality
of the other early Facebook

00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:33.000
investors or really any of
the early Paypal investors,

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.900
but I think he would pass the
public figure test enough.

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:39.950
And I feel like it shouldn't
be seen as a bad thing

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:43.790
to be seen as gay, so although
he might think it's secret,

00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:45.930
I don't think it was
illegal by any means.

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:48.680
I there was an
ethical consideration

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:51.650
that I would probably
disagree with Denton on.

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:54.570
But I'm also not gay, and
I haven't lived that life,

00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:57.650
so I don't have super
strong opinions there.

00:53:57.650 --> 00:54:00.360
I think the Hogan tape--

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:04.010
the First Amendment
is very expansive.

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:07.640
Celebrities give up a good
chunk of their privacy

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.590
by nature of being
public individuals who

00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:14.870
benefit from publicity, but
there is a line somewhere.

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:21.330
If Jennifer Aniston
was in a changing room,

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:25.680
and someone had put a hidden
camera there and films her

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.190
and then leaked it
to TMZ, does TMZ

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:30.770
have the right to publish
that because she's

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:33.530
a public individual
because she's done

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:35.150
nude scenes in movies before?

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:36.470
I mean, of course not.

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:39.320
No one-- does the media have
the right to the Erin Andrews

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:39.890
footage?

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:41.750
I would say absolutely not.

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:44.480
So I feel like there
is a line somewhere,

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:48.560
and I think we can safely, and
without endangering our right

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:52.520
to free speech, say that
the line more or less ends

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:56.780
at private individuals
having sex--

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:59.270
any individual having
sex in the privacy

00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:01.854
of a bedroom in a private home.

00:55:01.854 --> 00:55:03.520
Where it gets
interesting, for instance,

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:07.150
is if there was video footage
of Donald Trump and Stormy

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:08.040
Daniels--

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.850
does the media have
the right to that?

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:12.370
Or if there were pictures
from the Bill Clinton-Monica

00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:15.940
Lewinsky scandal--

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:17.300
is that right?

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:20.680
It does get-- there's not
a super right line where

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:26.390
I'd confidently say everything,
but I would say this tape,

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:30.010
I think the jury
made the right call.

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:36.470
$140 million may be too
much, but it shouldn't have--

00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:38.379
I think I shouldn't have run it.

00:55:38.379 --> 00:55:40.420
AUDIENCE: I waffle myself,
so I just was curious.

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:41.384
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:55:41.384 --> 00:55:42.300
ERIC M. RUIZ: Awesome.

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.637
Well, I think we're--

00:55:43.637 --> 00:55:44.720
yeah, we're close on time.

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.180
So, guys, thank you so
much for coming out,

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.440
and I think we have a couple
of books still available,

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.600
so don't be shy.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.530
Come up and grab them.

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:52.584
Ryan, you can sign or
give high-fives or both.

00:55:52.584 --> 00:55:53.500
RYAN HOLIDAY: Alright.

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.280
ERIC M. RUIZ: But,
guys, thank you.

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:54.580
RYAN HOLIDAY: Thanks.

00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:55.180
ERIC M. RUIZ: Thank you, Ryan.

00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:55.971
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:55:55.971 --> 00:55:58.530
[APPLAUSE]
