00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.380
Some days in Beijing are so hazy schools shut
down, which isn’t as fun as a snow day because

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.320
you can’t go outside and build a smog man. (Do you want to build a smog man?)

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.940
The main contributor is coal burned in power
plants, but the city’s 5 million cars aren’t

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.570
helping the problem much either.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.070
So a Dutchman named Daan Roosegaarde has a
solution: bicycles.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.210
Leave it to the Dutch to suggest bikes.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.390
There are more bikes in the Netherlands than
people.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.439
If anything, bicycles are now a source of
pollution over there because Amsterdam has

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.210
to dredge its canals to clean out all the
bicycles, and that is not a joke.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.350
But the bicycles Roosegaarde is pitching aren’t
just any bikes; he wants to make bikes that

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.910
actually clean the air as you ride.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.370
Roosegaarde has some experience in this area:
his design firm helped create a tower in a

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.240
Beijing park that takes in polluted air and
gives the smog particles a positive charge.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.500
Once the smog is ionized, it’s attracted
to an electrode with a negative charge.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.830
Roosegaarde claims his tower can remove up
to 70% of particles 10 micrometers in diameter,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.470
and up to 50% of particles 2.5 micrometers
in diameter.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.940
Both of which can damage the heart and lungs.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.670
The plan is to scale down the same technology
and fit it on a bicycle.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.229
It will be powered by a combination of solar
and pedal power, and the stream of clean air

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.880
will be directed towards the rider’s face,
so they immediately reap the benefits of their

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.880
work.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.030
Roosegaarde has partnered with Ofo, a large
chinese bike sharing company already with

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.759
3 million daily users.

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.710
But there’s still work to be done, like
actually making the bikes and, perhaps as

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.850
importantly, figuring out how to make people
give them back every month when the filter

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.850
needs cleaning.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.509
Sort those things out and Beijing will have
bicycles that not only reduce the need for

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.580
cars, but actually clean up after them too.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.799
Speaking of bicycles, how about a segue?
