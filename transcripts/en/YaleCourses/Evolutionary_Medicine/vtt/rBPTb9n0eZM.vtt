1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.530
The second major concept and evolutionary thinking is randomness.

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.030
It's the role of chance in evolutionary events

3
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.040
and random things are also referred to as neutral processes and neutrality means

4
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:23.450
selection is not operating.

5
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.260
Things are neither being selected or not being selected.
They're just neutral.

6
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.200
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.740
<v 0>There are two general reasons for neutrality.</v>

8
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.360
One is that many genotypes may produce the same phenotype.

9
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.170
That's because the genetic code is redundant because some DNA is not expressed

10
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.670
because some amino acid substitutions actually produce no difference in the

11
00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:52.600
shape or function of a protein,
and because development is catalyzed.

12
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.040
The other major reason is that many phenotypes may have essentially the same

13
00:00:59.041 --> 00:00:59.874
fitness,

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.740
so even if you produce a phenotype,

15
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.660
there is still another level at which randomness can occur or neutrality can

16
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:10.494
arise.

17
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.130
That can be either because that particular trait is varying in a way that makes

18
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:20.870
very little difference to reproductive success or because the impact on fitness

19
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:25.250
of a change in one trait compensates for that have a change in another trait.

20
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.370
<v 1>Okay,</v>

21
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.810
<v 0>let's unpack those conditions.</v>

22
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.650
<v 0>First,
the genetic code is redundant.</v>

24
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.630
It produces 23 different meanings.

25
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.780
That is either a starter stop code on or coding for a particular amino acid and

26
00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:47.590
it uses 64 triplet code downs to do so.

27
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.080
So just to take one example,

28
00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:55.081
you can see here that proline is being coded for by four different codes.

29
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.340
So that variation is usually at the third position.

30
00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:05.341
So all of the DNA sequences that are coding for proline are starting with CC.

31
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

32
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.070
<v 0>And it is the fourth position that can be different,</v>

33
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.600
excuse me,
the third,
the third position and the code on that could be different.

34
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

35
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.310
<v 0>Then some DNA is not expressed.
Pseudo genes for example,</v>

36
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:26.390
are genes that are no longer expressed.
Here we have an example of a pseudo gene,

37
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.360
uh,
in the chimpanzee.

38
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:33.770
This gene is functional in humans that is not functional and there have been

39
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.800
three different mutations between humans and chimpanzees and insertion or

40
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:41.720
deletion and a point mutation.

41
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.970
<v 1>Okay?</v>

42
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.970
<v 0>So pseudo genes result from a gene duplication that's usually followed by loss</v>

43
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:54.011
of function in one copy function is lost because the pseudo gene is not

44
00:02:54.711 --> 00:02:55.544
expressed.

45
00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.670
All of its nucleotides are then free to diverge at random is they mutate.

46
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:02.670
And so you see the,
in the pseudo gene,

47
00:03:02.671 --> 00:03:06.130
there will be a buildup of genetic variation for mutation.

48
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.010
Some other DNA is also neither described a transcribed nor translated.

49
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.740
It's also free to accumulate mutations at random.

50
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.880
So although we've recently discovered that much more of the genome is functional

51
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:22.750
than we had thought,

52
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.780
there are still portions of the genome that are essentially free to vary at

53
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:31.360
random because they are not having impact on phenotypes.

54
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.860
So here's an example of what happens when a particular variant as neutral alpha

55
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:44.530
globin evolution in vertebrates has had many amino acid substitutions.

56
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.310
Down here on the x axis we have time and millions of years and on the y axis we

57
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:56.761
have the number of amino acid substitutions and each spot is a comparison

58
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.860
between animals that have been evolving over the last 500 million years and are

59
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:05.480
examined today.
Well,

60
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.120
we can see is that the line is very close to straight and that is what we would

61
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:15.121
expect if the rate of amino acid substitution is uniform and that means it's

62
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:18.070
occurring at random.

63
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.830
This happens in Alpha globin evolution because there were parts of the molecule

64
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:27.790
or an amino acid substitution makes essentially no difference to its function

65
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.410
and those are the parts of that molecule in which the randomness is occurring.

66
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.420
It is not occurring in the functional center where the oxygen binding is

67
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:38.254
occurring.

68
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.680
The next mechanism that produces neutrality and evolution is canalization.

69
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.420
The canalization of development.

70
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.400
Cannibalization is a word that means the limitation of phenotypic variation by

71
00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:57.840
developmental mechanisms.

72
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.860
Canalizing mechanisms are those that resist the tendency of variation in either

73
00:05:07.281 --> 00:05:11.030
genetic or environmental factors to perturb the phenotype.

74
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.410
You can think of them is buffering the phenotype against variation in genes and

75
00:05:17.871 --> 00:05:19.370
variation in the environment.

76
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.770
Genes whose impact on the phenotype has been reduced or eliminated by catalyzing

77
00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:32.891
mechanisms are then free or to accumulate neutral variation.

78
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.650
Then those whose impact is directly expressed,

79
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.060
so if development is sitting between the genes and the phenotype and is

80
00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:46.061
buffering the impact of variation in the genotype on variation in the phenotype,

81
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.490
then the genotype is actually free or to vary.

82
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.120
It can accumulate more mutations.

83
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.210
Some of the traits that are canalized in tetrapods include four limbs,

84
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.150
two eyes,
one mouth,
five digits.

85
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.890
Genetic variation is affecting many things about these traits,

86
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.700
but it is not affecting their number.
Their number is catalyzed.

87
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:13.743
<v 1>Now,</v>

88
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.030
<v 0>another reason for neutrality is that there is some phenotypic variation that</v>

89
00:06:19.031 --> 00:06:22.330
makes very little difference to reproductive success.

90
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.500
This is another level at which neutrality arises.

91
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.710
The population may be too small to establish a consistent correlation between

92
00:06:32.711 --> 00:06:34.630
the trait and reproductive success.

93
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.080
That is a sampling issue or the variation may simply be irrelevant.

94
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.320
For example,

95
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.030
variation and traits that can't be detected by mates are pollinators are

96
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:48.250
predators or parasites or prey,

97
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:53.790
so it's simply can't be detected or variation that lies within the so-called

98
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.350
normal ranges of blood tests.

99
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.730
If total cholesterol is between 110 and 150 or systolic,

100
00:07:00.731 --> 00:07:05.731
blood pressure is between 100 and 130 or diastolic blood pressure is between 65

101
00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:11.761
and 85 anything within that range is not likely to be affecting reproductive

102
00:07:13.181 --> 00:07:14.200
success very much.

103
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.370
Another reason is for neutrality is that a fitness gain in one trade can

104
00:07:24.661 --> 00:07:27.390
compensate for a fitness loss in another.

105
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.940
If those traits are connected by a trade off,

106
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.980
if the compensation is precise,
then change will be neutral.

107
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.220
It could happen in principle with any tradeoff including more offspring,

108
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.690
less survival,
more success,
fighting for mates,

109
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.550
less resistance to disease,
more resistance than normal infection,

110
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:54.480
more costs of inflammation.
Those are all significant trade offs,

111
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.070
all involved with medical issues,
and if the compensation is precise,

112
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:04.170
then it's possible that you could have people with many different offspring who

113
00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:09.120
had the same reproductive success because they had very many different
survival's

114
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.910
or more success fighting for mates,
less resistance to disease and so forth.

115
00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:18.930
If the compensation is precise,
you'll get neutrality.
However,

116
00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:23.130
the compensation is often not terribly precise.
For example,

117
00:08:23.131 --> 00:08:25.410
in the 1918 influenza pandemic,

118
00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:29.700
the mortality rate was highest in young adults with the strongest inflammatory

119
00:08:29.701 --> 00:08:30.450
responses.

120
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.170
Their lungs flooded with fluid and many then died of secondary bacterial

121
00:08:34.171 --> 00:08:35.004
pneumonia.

122
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:40.550
So this was a trade off between having a strong inflammatory response and a

123
00:08:40.921 --> 00:08:44.910
robust immune system that would deal with most other infections but was

124
00:08:44.911 --> 00:08:49.911
inappropriate for the h one n one variant they cause the 1918 flu epidemic.

125
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:57.470
That was a a new experience for the immune system and it resulted in a spike in

126
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:00.330
mortality

127
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.510
in people who are between about 20 and 35 years of age.

128
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.050
So we'll come back to this in later lectures,

129
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:14.850
but you can see that we have here both the percentage of people with pneumonia

130
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.970
in blue and we have the influenza related mortality rate in red.

131
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.320
The people who died were people who are at their peak physiological fitness in

132
00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:29.304
midlife.

133
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:32.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

134
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.730
<v 0>So what are the mechanisms that cause random change?</v>

135
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.430
There's mutation and the sense in which we Taishan is random.

136
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.410
There are founder effects in genetic bottlenecks passaging through small

137
00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:50.730
population sizes.
There's the mundelien lottery,

138
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.970
the idea that Meiosis is a fair coin and there's variation in reproductive

139
00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:58.920
success and populations of any size.

140
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:03.750
I've highlighted in red here the factors that contributed to genetic drift and

141
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:06.360
that will follow through the next couple of slides.

142
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:08.470
<v 1>Okay,</v>

143
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:12.370
<v 0>so first,
what about mutations?
In what sense are they random?</v>

144
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.270
Well,
there are several senses in which they're not random.

145
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.960
They occur more frequently at some sites than at others.

146
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

147
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.920
<v 0>Have you taken rate and pathogenic bacteria increases in response to certain</v>

148
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:26.754
signals?

149
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.960
That is their mutation rate across much of their genome

150
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:33.870
transitions.

151
00:10:33.871 --> 00:10:37.440
That means a puring to a pure green or a perimeter into a perimeter [inaudible]

152
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.280
are more common than trans versions of Trans version would be a mutation that

153
00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:44.820
took a Purina to a perimeter thing or a permitting to a pure rain.

154
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.590
Your patients do not produce random change in phenotype space.

155
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:57.220
That means that mutations are only able to modify the phenotype that's already

156
00:10:57.261 --> 00:11:00.410
evolved.
Now,

157
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.120
what is the sense in which mutations really are random?

158
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.510
This is the critical sense for evolution.

159
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.920
There is no systematic relationship between their phenotypic effect and the

160
00:11:15.171 --> 00:11:17.810
needs of the organism in which they occur.

161
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.740
You tations are random with respect to fitness.

162
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.710
You're not random with respect to these other things.

163
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.693
<v 1>Okay.</v>

164
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.990
<v 0>What does the second mechanism,
well,</v>

165
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.790
the second mechanism causing random change or effects of small population sizes,

166
00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:39.050
and let's take a look at things that experienced some small population sizes,

167
00:11:39.051 --> 00:11:44.051
the Pitcairn islanders and other founder populations in humans and Cheetahs.

168
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.710
The founder effect occurs with just a few individuals,

169
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.920
found a new population with only a small portion of the variation that was in

170
00:11:54.311 --> 00:11:58.000
the original stock and when that happens,

171
00:11:58.001 --> 00:12:01.480
if there happens to be a mutation for a genetic disease,

172
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:06.250
it can suddenly occur at high frequency because you have a few people and one of

173
00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:08.470
them has a mutation.
In the large population,

174
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:10.090
it might've been at much lower frequency.

175
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.780
Examples are the genetic diseases in Quebec,

176
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.630
Tay Sachs disease among the Afrikaner's,

177
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.740
that's Porphyria and on Pitcairn island,
which is diabetes

178
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:27.130
<v 1>type one diabetes.
The other</v>

179
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.010
<v 0>population size effect is a genetic bottleneck,</v>

180
00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:33.370
so a population crashes to very small size.

181
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.730
This is not a founder effect.
This is the same population,

182
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:38.470
but it crashes to very small size.

183
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.400
Only a few illegals then make it through because there are only a few

184
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:44.620
individuals they can carry them.

185
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.130
An example is the homozygosity of Cheetahs,

186
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.460
which is confirmed by reciprocal skin transplants.

187
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.080
You can transplant skin between any two cheetahs in the world and the skin

188
00:12:56.081 --> 00:12:57.700
transplant will not be rejected.

189
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.570
They have lost that much genetic variation in their immune systems.

190
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.171
Another effect,

191
00:13:04.171 --> 00:13:07.600
it's quite important is that correlations decrease in small samples.

192
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.470
If selection is really there but it's rather weak,

193
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:16.960
then it can only be effective in a large population because in a small

194
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:17.651
population,

195
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:21.970
the correlation of reproductive success with the trait will just be eroded by

196
00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:25.510
sampling error,
so things get noisy and small samples.

197
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.250
The third mechanism that is causing random change is the fact that Meiosis is a

198
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:34.090
fair coin.

199
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:39.930
It's a very interesting observation and it probably is the result of evolution

200
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:45.270
designing Meiosis to be absolutely fair about which Leo gets into which Gammy

201
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.750
that's expressed in Mendel's law of segregation.

202
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.580
If there are two wheels at a locus,

203
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:56.581
the probability that one of them we'll get into a given gammy is 50% exactly 50

204
00:13:57.791 --> 00:14:00.520
50 in the long run.

205
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:05.790
The average number of successful haploid gametes per parent in a diploid sexual

206
00:14:05.831 --> 00:14:09.160
species is too.
That's because in the long run,

207
00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:13.000
populations are stable and organisms are just replacing themselves.

208
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.200
If there just two chances and two flips of the coin,
then

209
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.190
on average individuals we'll just replace themselves in the population.

210
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.753
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

211
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:32.050
<v 0>The fourth mechanism causing random change is that the treat or the gene lands</v>

212
00:14:33.201 --> 00:14:36.470
at random and families of different size.
Okay.

213
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.420
That is actually what we mean by random variation in reproductive success.

214
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:45.440
If an illegal randomly lands in a sequence of families that have different

215
00:14:45.441 --> 00:14:50.390
numbers of children,
it will increase or decrease at random and frequency,

216
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:56.470
so that is what we mean by a zero correlation with reproductive success.

217
00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.960
This producer's genetic drift,

218
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:06.080
it's the random aimless wandering of frequencies of neutral genes.

219
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.570
It resembles the Brownie in motion.

220
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.430
A small particles that are being pushed about by the thermal motion of molecules

221
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.800
and it is driven by the lottery of Meiosis combined with variation and

222
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:23.270
reproductive success.
It fixes neutral,

223
00:15:23.271 --> 00:15:25.940
Ilias faster in smaller populations,

224
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.140
but it occurs in populations of all sizes.

225
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:34.310
Genetic drift is not confined to small populations.

226
00:15:34.311 --> 00:15:35.900
It's going on all the time.

227
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.460
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

228
00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.190
<v 0>So what happens to neutral deals?
Well,</v>

229
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.820
most of them never make it to high frequency.

230
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:50.030
Those that do get fixed in the population take longer to do so in larger

231
00:15:50.611 --> 00:15:54.840
populations.
So if you're thinking about the dynamics of random change,

232
00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:59.670
a lot depends on how big the population is.
Large populations,

233
00:15:59.671 --> 00:16:02.400
however,
also have more mutations.
You can think of.

234
00:16:02.401 --> 00:16:07.401
The size of the population is being a net out there to catch you tations because

235
00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.490
the more genomes there are,
the more times a mutation can occur.

236
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.260
This exactly compensates for longer fixation times.

237
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.920
So well it takes longer to fix a neutral video in a bigger population.

238
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:27.230
There are more mutations arising in that larger population which are generating

239
00:16:27.631 --> 00:16:30.270
neutral variants and drifting through to fixation.

240
00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:36.290
That results in the exact compensation for the number of new neutral mutations

241
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.260
that will be fixed in a given time period.

242
00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.800
So we don't know which mutation will be fixed,

243
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:49.180
but we do know how many will be fixed on average.

244
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:54.370
In that sense,
this sort of process,
which produces a molecular clock,

245
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.760
it's like an atomic clock that's driven by radioactive decay in any given period

246
00:16:59.951 --> 00:17:03.550
of time.
We don't know which Adam will decay,

247
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.450
but we do know how many will decay,
and in fact,

248
00:17:07.451 --> 00:17:12.451
that's so precise that atomic clocks are an international standard for precise

249
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.860
timekeeping.
Now,
in both cases,

250
00:17:17.861 --> 00:17:22.861
the regularity emerges is the result of a very large number of independent

251
00:17:23.111 --> 00:17:27.970
random events.
Just to give you some idea of how large that number is,

252
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:32.710
the Hathaway human genome consists of about three times 10 to the ninth DNA base

253
00:17:32.711 --> 00:17:36.010
pairs.
That's 3 billion base pairs,

254
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:41.290
and one mole of uranium contains about six times 10 to the 23rd Adams.

255
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.750
So there are many,

256
00:17:43.751 --> 00:17:47.860
many opportunities for random events to occur in both contexts.

257
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:55.300
If we go back and we look at the example of evolution occurring in the genome of

258
00:17:55.641 --> 00:17:56.540
influenza,

259
00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:03.040
we can see again this signature of a very straight line relating how much time

260
00:18:05.391 --> 00:18:09.390
there has been for change to occur and the number of nucleotide substitutions.

261
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:11.990
So time on the x axis,

262
00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.810
Nucleotide substitutions on the y axis.

263
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.800
These are influenza samples that were frozen and then sequenced later.

264
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:23.330
And we can see that even though population sizes fluctuated and fluctuated

265
00:18:23.331 --> 00:18:27.020
enormously because these things have gone through epidemics and then they've

266
00:18:27.021 --> 00:18:31.460
crashed and they've gone through epidemics again,
substitutions were regular.

267
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.000
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

268
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.630
<v 0>the effect of population size on the number of new mutations</v>

269
00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.930
per generation.
Exactly.

270
00:18:40.931 --> 00:18:44.770
Compensated for the slower rate of fixation of neutral mutations in larger

271
00:18:44.771 --> 00:18:45.640
populations.

272
00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:50.470
So you can estimate time from the number of substitutions.

273
00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:56.220
The point about this being not being influenced by population size is important

274
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:02.890
because it allows us to pick up a clear signal of how much time has elapsed even

275
00:19:02.891 --> 00:19:07.600
though populations have fluctuated dramatically and you can estimate time from

276
00:19:07.601 --> 00:19:09.340
this molecular clock.
So,
for example,

277
00:19:09.341 --> 00:19:14.341
if I told you that the number of nucleotide substitutions and a new sample was

278
00:19:14.711 --> 00:19:19.030
about 60 different from a base sample,

279
00:19:19.031 --> 00:19:24.031
that would indicate that it had been a period of about 35 years that those two

280
00:19:26.441 --> 00:19:27.274
were apart.

281
00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.690
That gives you a molecular clock that allows you to estimate time to last common

282
00:19:31.691 --> 00:19:35.260
ancestor.
So to summarize,

283
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.160
there are several reasons why variation in DNA and variation and traits might

284
00:19:41.171 --> 00:19:43.330
make no difference to reproductive success.

285
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.410
Meiosis is like a fair coin.

286
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.310
The probability of getting into a specific gammy is 50%

287
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:56.440
the fixation of neutral illegals is like radioactive decay.

288
00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:00.790
In neither case do we know which mutation will be fixed or which atom will
decay.

289
00:20:00.791 --> 00:20:04.240
But we do know how many events will happen and that gives us a clock.

290
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:11.070
Genetic drift fixes neutral deals at a regular rate independent of population

291
00:20:11.171 --> 00:20:12.004
size.

292
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.510
And the regularity of the fixation of neutral illegals allows us to estimate

293
00:20:18.511 --> 00:20:22.620
times to last common ancestor by comparing DNA sequences.

294
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.653
<v 1>Thus</v>

295
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:29.970
<v 0>random evolution at the level of the population,</v>

296
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.070
which is micro evolution,

297
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.880
gives us a clock that allows us to put timelines on the macro evolutionary

298
00:20:39.511 --> 00:20:42.660
pattern of relationship and to phylogenetic trees.
