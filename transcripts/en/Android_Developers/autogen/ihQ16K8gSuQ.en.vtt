years always working on support

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880
years always working on support
 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.750
years always working on support
libraries and I'm adding power you may

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
libraries and I'm adding power you may

have seen me earlier this morning I've

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
have seen me earlier this morning I've
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.240
have seen me earlier this morning I've
been at Google for five six years now

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250
been at Google for five six years now
 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.250
been at Google for five six years now
working on the Android UI toolkit and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260
working on the Android UI toolkit and
 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.550
working on the Android UI toolkit and
framework right so when we when I first

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
framework right so when we when I first
 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.529
framework right so when we when I first
slide think about this talk it was

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539
slide think about this talk it was
 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.910
slide think about this talk it was
originally gonna be like a deep dive on

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920
originally gonna be like a deep dive on
 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.740
originally gonna be like a deep dive on
sort of the internals the sources and

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750
sort of the internals the sources and
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.540
sort of the internals the sources and
support libraries how we've implemented

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
support libraries how we've implemented
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.639
support libraries how we've implemented
them and all that kind of stuff but then

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
them and all that kind of stuff but then
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.840
them and all that kind of stuff but then
I realized that there's a lot of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850
I realized that there's a lot of
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.830
I realized that there's a lot of
developers out there that don't actually

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
developers out there that don't actually
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.380
developers out there that don't actually
know some of the basics how we actually

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390
know some of the basics how we actually
 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.840
know some of the basics how we actually
architect it sort of how you actually

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850
architect it sort of how you actually
 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.520
architect it sort of how you actually
use it and what you would use it so

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530
use it and what you would use it so
 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.670
use it and what you would use it so
we've got these five questions of why

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680
we've got these five questions of why
 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.779
we've got these five questions of why
around the support library sort of what

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
around the support library sort of what
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.790
around the support library sort of what
it is why you use it some of the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
it is why you use it some of the
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.369
it is why you use it some of the
implications of using it how and then

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
implications of using it how and then
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.090
implications of using it how and then
sort of bugs so let's first talk about

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
sort of bugs so let's first talk about
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.529
sort of bugs so let's first talk about
what it actually is yeah sure

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
what it actually is yeah sure
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.710
what it actually is yeah sure
so what's included the support library

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
so what's included the support library
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.630
so what's included the support library
started out as this very small component

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640
started out as this very small component
 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.789
started out as this very small component
we had this support v4 jar it was a very

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799
we had this support v4 jar it was a very
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.520
we had this support v4 jar it was a very
simple piece no resources just a little

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530
simple piece no resources just a little
 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.719
simple piece no resources just a little
bit of code that you could add into your

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
bit of code that you could add into your
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.670
bit of code that you could add into your
applications and it provided some extra

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680
applications and it provided some extra
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.200
applications and it provided some extra
stuff that you can statically link into

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
stuff that you can statically link into
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.719
stuff that you can statically link into
your applications to gain more

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
your applications to gain more
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.109
your applications to gain more
functionality over time it's grown it's

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
functionality over time it's grown it's
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.700
functionality over time it's grown it's
grown into a number of other libraries

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
grown into a number of other libraries
 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.800
grown into a number of other libraries
so saying the Android support library

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
so saying the Android support library
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.780
so saying the Android support library
hasn't really been accurate for several

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
hasn't really been accurate for several
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.420
hasn't really been accurate for several
years now and so we've started growing

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
years now and so we've started growing
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.890
years now and so we've started growing
all these extra features we've started

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
all these extra features we've started
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.020
all these extra features we've started
adding resources and today this is

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
adding resources and today this is
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.399
adding resources and today this is
really an integral part of building any

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409
really an integral part of building any
 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.660
really an integral part of building any
modern Android application so the rough

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
modern Android application so the rough
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.270
modern Android application so the rough
layout or diagram of how the support

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280
layout or diagram of how the support
 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.069
layout or diagram of how the support
libraries look today look something like

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079
libraries look today look something like
 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.569
libraries look today look something like
this so off to one side we have a series

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579
this so off to one side we have a series
 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.249
this so off to one side we have a series
of feature libraries that are really

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259
of feature libraries that are really
 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.950
of feature libraries that are really
pretty standalone they don't

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960
pretty standalone they don't
 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.640
pretty standalone they don't
have a whole lot of extra

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650
have a whole lot of extra
 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.800
have a whole lot of extra
interdependencies we've got stuff like

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810
interdependencies we've got stuff like
 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.900
interdependencies we've got stuff like
the new custom tabs library for browsers

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910
the new custom tabs library for browsers
 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.900
the new custom tabs library for browsers
to use we have grid layouts card view

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910
to use we have grid layouts card view
 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.970
to use we have grid layouts card view
stands on its own and we have the pallet

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980
stands on its own and we have the pallet
 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.440
stands on its own and we have the pallet
library for extracting information from

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450
library for extracting information from
 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.750
library for extracting information from
images there are probably a few more in

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760
images there are probably a few more in
 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.040
images there are probably a few more in
there but this kind of gives you the

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050
there but this kind of gives you the
 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.100
there but this kind of gives you the
basic idea we have the core that is

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110
basic idea we have the core that is
 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.320
basic idea we have the core that is
still this basic support v4 library that

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330
still this basic support v4 library that
 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.170
still this basic support v4 library that
we have from the very beginning now this

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180
we have from the very beginning now this
 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.360
we have from the very beginning now this
really provides a number of API shims

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370
really provides a number of API shims
 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.100
really provides a number of API shims
for newer api's that have been added to

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110
for newer api's that have been added to
 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.010
for newer api's that have been added to
the platform since a given release a lot

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020
the platform since a given release a lot
 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.440
the platform since a given release a lot
of people who ask ok well where did yv4

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450
of people who ask ok well where did yv4
 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.090
of people who ask ok well where did yv4
where does this come from well it comes

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100
where does this come from well it comes
 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.390
where does this come from well it comes
from what the min SDK level is for your

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400
from what the min SDK level is for your
 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.210
from what the min SDK level is for your
application when you use this library so

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220
application when you use this library so
 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.680
application when you use this library so
we support all the way back to donut

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690
we support all the way back to donut
 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.870
we support all the way back to donut
which is I understand so has many users

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880
which is I understand so has many users
 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.310
which is I understand so has many users
today that way so again we've had some

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320
today that way so again we've had some
 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.170
today that way so again we've had some
some legacy in here and you'll start to

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180
some legacy in here and you'll start to
 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.030
some legacy in here and you'll start to
see that in this in some of this as well

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040
see that in this in some of this as well
 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.699
see that in this in some of this as well
some of the reasons for the design of

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709
some of the reasons for the design of
 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:49.960
some of the reasons for the design of
the support library and kind of how it's

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970
the support library and kind of how it's
 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.130
the support library and kind of how it's
grown it's grown very organically so in

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140
grown it's grown very organically so in
 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.020
grown it's grown very organically so in
addition to API shims for new things

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030
addition to API shims for new things
 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.720
addition to API shims for new things
we've got back ports of several items so

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730
we've got back ports of several items so
 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.910
we've got back ports of several items so
for example the fragment library from

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920
for example the fragment library from
 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.440
for example the fragment library from
the fragment system that was introduced

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450
the fragment system that was introduced
 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.830
the fragment system that was introduced
in android 3.0 honeycomb is available to

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840
in android 3.0 honeycomb is available to
 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.490
in android 3.0 honeycomb is available to
all applications even before that as and

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500
all applications even before that as and
 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.590
all applications even before that as and
again we have a large large number of

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600
again we have a large large number of
 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.960
again we have a large large number of
users on devices that old these days

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970
users on devices that old these days
 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.630
users on devices that old these days
however the fragment support library has

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640
however the fragment support library has
 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.520
however the fragment support library has
kept up to date with newer features such

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530
kept up to date with newer features such
 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.770
kept up to date with newer features such
as embedded child fragments and similar

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780
as embedded child fragments and similar
 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.800
as embedded child fragments and similar
features we've got other standalone

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810
features we've got other standalone
 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.930
features we've got other standalone
features things like a view pager you'll

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940
features things like a view pager you'll
 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.970
features things like a view pager you'll
recognize view pager from any sort of

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980
recognize view pager from any sort of
 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.710
recognize view pager from any sort of
tabbed UI across Android these days

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720
tabbed UI across Android these days
 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.180
tabbed UI across Android these days
this component doesn't actually have a

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190

recyclerview is developed in the manner

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490
recyclerview is developed in the manner
 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.870
recyclerview is developed in the manner
that it was it's pluggable so you can

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880
that it was it's pluggable so you can
 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.810
that it was it's pluggable so you can
provide your own your own components and

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820
provide your own your own components and
 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.350
provide your own your own components and

treatment of recycled view pools all the

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470
treatment of recycled view pools all the

complexity that you may want to add to

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050
complexity that you may want to add to
 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.040
complexity that you may want to add to
this or not and it really tries to

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050
this or not and it really tries to
 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.200
this or not and it really tries to
enforce some better practices that built

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210
enforce some better practices that built

overtime app compat that can pop so I'll

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770
overtime app compat that can pop so I'll
 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.800
overtime app compat that can pop so I'll
compare yeah so this is the thing I've

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:20.810
compare yeah so this is the thing I've
 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.420

it's my starter project actually and

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:25.100
it's my starter project actually and
 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.280
it's my starter project actually and
it's generally trying to be a massive

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.290
it's generally trying to be a massive

polyfill over the UI toolkit
 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.510
polyfill over the UI toolkit
now as the UI talk it's changed over the

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520
now as the UI talk it's changed over the
 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.670
now as the UI talk it's changed over the
different platform releases we tried the

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680
different platform releases we tried the
 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.530
different platform releases we tried the
app compat up to date so originally

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:35.540
app compat up to date so originally
 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.730
app compat up to date so originally
started out as a action bar and I'm sure

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:39.740
started out as a action bar and I'm sure
 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.840
started out as a action bar and I'm sure
you were all using the action bar

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:40.850
you were all using the action bar
 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.250
you were all using the action bar
Sherlock at a time

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:42.260
Sherlock at a time
 

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.650
Sherlock at a time
now and many questions why we actually

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:44.660
now and many questions why we actually
 

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.480
now and many questions why we actually
released maximum or compact which was

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:46.490
released maximum or compact which was
 

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.180
released maximum or compact which was
this and now the reason why we did that

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:49.190
this and now the reason why we did that
 

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.830
this and now the reason why we did that
is so that we can give you what it is

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:50.840
is so that we can give you what it is
 

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.290
is so that we can give you what it is
today so that's a base that we built and

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:53.300
today so that's a base that we built and
 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.960
today so that's a base that we built and
now we've kept it at the framework and

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:55.970
now we've kept it at the framework and
 

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.820
now we've kept it at the framework and
so yeah it backports framework features

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:57.830
so yeah it backports framework features
 

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.040
so yeah it backports framework features
but one people know it goes no further

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.050
but one people know it goes no further
 

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.720
but one people know it goes no further
it will never add new features that

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:01.730
it will never add new features that
 

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.000
it will never add new features that
aren't in the framework and its goal is

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.010
aren't in the framework and its goal is
 

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.110
aren't in the framework and its goal is
that always to stay up with the

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120
that always to stay up with the
 

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.220
that always to stay up with the

behind but with those interim releases

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:10.520
behind but with those interim releases
 

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.860
behind but with those interim releases
that we talked about earlier we will

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:11.870
that we talked about earlier we will

things which I think are compact gives

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:16.910
things which I think are compact gives
 

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.600
things which I think are compact gives
you the first is is themes it gives you

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:19.610
you the first is is themes it gives you
 

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.840
you the first is is themes it gives you
one theme to extend or use which works

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:22.850
one theme to extend or use which works
 

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.550
one theme to extend or use which works
and look to mostly the same across all

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560
and look to mostly the same across all
 

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.350
and look to mostly the same across all
different ipi levels so that's including

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:26.360
different ipi levels so that's including
 

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.670

gingerbread for it's a hollow through

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680
gingerbread for it's a hollow through
 

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.650
gingerbread for it's a hollow through
some material it gives you one theme to

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:29.660
some material it gives you one theme to
 

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.990
some material it gives you one theme to
use

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.000

second is toolbar now as we said earlier

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760
second is toolbar now as we said earlier
 

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.370
second is toolbar now as we said earlier
there's we give you the action bar in

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:35.380
there's we give you the action bar in
 

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.529
there's we give you the action bar in
ipi 11 but it was always these black box

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:37.539
ipi 11 but it was always these black box
 

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.270
ipi 11 but it was always these black box
like you couldn't really control it you

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:39.280
like you couldn't really control it you
 

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.159
like you couldn't really control it you
can animate it isn't you never really

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:41.169
can animate it isn't you never really
 

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.469
can animate it isn't you never really
had any much control over it so toolbar

00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:43.479
had any much control over it so toolbar
 

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:45.120
had any much control over it so toolbar
isn't the manifestation of that as an

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.130
isn't the manifestation of that as an
 

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.250
isn't the manifestation of that as an
actual widget you control it from top to

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:47.260
actual widget you control it from top to
 

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.810
actual widget you control it from top to
bottom where it is in your hierarchy you

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:48.820
bottom where it is in your hierarchy you
 

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.580
bottom where it is in your hierarchy you
can animate it you can scroll it you can

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:50.590
can animate it you can scroll it you can
 

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.130
can animate it you can scroll it you can
do what we want with it

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140
do what we want with it
 

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.440
do what we want with it
and secondly tinting it's probably on

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:55.450
and secondly tinting it's probably on
 

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.290
and secondly tinting it's probably on
top of this but enmity not material we

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:58.300
top of this but enmity not material we
 

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.670

view these pneumatic views wick which

00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680
view these pneumatic views wick which
 

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.900
view these pneumatic views wick which
can control them look and feel of your

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:00.910
can control them look and feel of your
 

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.780
can control them look and feel of your
app for its colors and stuff now how

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:03.790
app for its colors and stuff now how
 

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.720

compact tries to do that as well using

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:06.730
compact tries to do that as well using
 

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.030
compact tries to do that as well using
its own attributes there are certain

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040
its own attributes there are certain
 

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.580
its own attributes there are certain
things which before lollipop don't quite

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:11.590
things which before lollipop don't quite
 

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.620
things which before lollipop don't quite
work and so it's really important to

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:13.630
work and so it's really important to
 

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:17.160
work and so it's really important to
test and make sure it does so we'll move

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.170
test and make sure it does so we'll move
 

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.840
test and make sure it does so we'll move
on to the design library which is kind

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:18.850
on to the design library which is kind
 

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.790
on to the design library which is kind
of the Larry above app compat and which

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800
of the Larry above app compat and which
 

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.460
of the Larry above app compat and which
means it goes beyond the framework and

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:23.470
means it goes beyond the framework and
 

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:24.960
means it goes beyond the framework and
even in design library stuff that isn't

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:24.970
even in design library stuff that isn't
 

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.640
even in design library stuff that isn't
in the framework

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:26.650
in the framework
 

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.470
in the framework
it's a UI feature library which tries to

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480
it's a UI feature library which tries to
 

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.420
it's a UI feature library which tries to
implement material design interactions

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:30.430
implement material design interactions
 

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.000
implement material design interactions
and so the stuff what we think is stable

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.010
and so the stuff what we think is stable
 

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.610
and so the stuff what we think is stable
and that are good interactions to use

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.620
and that are good interactions to use
 

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.930
and that are good interactions to use
more specifically the design library

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:36.940
more specifically the design library
 

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.460
more specifically the design library
offers us an outlet for all these

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:38.470
offers us an outlet for all these
 

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.470
offers us an outlet for all these
components that may have sort of a

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480
components that may have sort of a
 

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.270
components that may have sort of a
fashion lifecycle associated with them

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:42.280
fashion lifecycle associated with them
 

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.250
fashion lifecycle associated with them
you can probably think of a number of

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:44.260
you can probably think of a number of
 

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.540
you can probably think of a number of
components over the years that we've

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:45.550
components over the years that we've
 

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.940
components over the years that we've
introduced that maybe haven't stood the

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:47.950
introduced that maybe haven't stood the
 

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.220
introduced that maybe haven't stood the
test of time some of these components in

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:50.230
test of time some of these components in
 

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.510
test of time some of these components in
the android framework today have been

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:51.520
the android framework today have been
 

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.220
the android framework today have been
marked as deprecated such as Android

you may be able to recall this basically
gives us an ability to still iterate

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:02.860

so this is another number that you're
 

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.910
so this is another number that you're
probably familiar with not only is it a

hmm okay well that's kind of a big
number and that's also a lot to ask

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:23.510
number and that's also a lot to ask
 

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.810

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.740
scintilla counting that number as well
just because like those support

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:35.750
just because like those support

right so there's a little bit of folding

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:43.100
right so there's a little bit of folding
 

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.190
right so there's a little bit of folding
that happens here but it also starts

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:45.200
that happens here but it also starts
 

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.410
that happens here but it also starts
incrementing the count pretty pretty

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:47.420

that's a little bit more manageable than
what we had before of course the more of

able to cut down over half of that and
 

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.390

wanted to know that is that that is the
 

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.240
wanted to know that is that that is the

that might be able to help out with some
 

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.230
that might be able to help out with some
of that now that we have the the new

then when you ask you want to release
 

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:19.579
then when you ask you want to release
that's when you turn on pro guard and so

anyway there's a lot of trade-offs but

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260
anyway there's a lot of trade-offs but
 

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.750
anyway there's a lot of trade-offs but
there are options available so don't

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760
there are options available so don't
 

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.039
there are options available so don't
think that you're stuck when you run up

00:17:34.039 --> 00:17:34.049
think that you're stuck when you run up
 

00:17:34.049 --> 00:17:35.630
think that you're stuck when you run up
against some of these problems and one

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640
against some of these problems and one

thing to actually say that we know that

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:37.380
thing to actually say that we know that
 

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.770
thing to actually say that we know that
this is a problem like we know that

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:39.780
this is a problem like we know that
 

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.440
this is a problem like we know that
support before is quite large and we are

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:42.450
support before is quite large and we are
 

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.299
support before is quite large and we are
thinking of ways to improve the

00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:44.309
thinking of ways to improve the
 

00:17:44.309 --> 00:17:46.730
thinking of ways to improve the
situation like we don't the short

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:46.740
situation like we don't the short
 

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.870
situation like we don't the short
version of it is we're gonna delete a

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880
version of it is we're gonna delete a
 

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.130
version of it is we're gonna delete a
lot of code okay so how how are we gonna

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:52.140
lot of code okay so how how are we gonna
 

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.340
lot of code okay so how how are we gonna
delete a lot of code no how do we use

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:54.350
delete a lot of code no how do we use
 

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:59.210
delete a lot of code no how do we use
how do we use it so we all I'm guessing

00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220
how do we use it so we all I'm guessing
 

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.440
how do we use it so we all I'm guessing
we can grade all these days and so you

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:00.450
we can grade all these days and so you
 

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.860
we can grade all these days and so you
just add the library to your dependency

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:02.870
just add the library to your dependency
 

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.150
just add the library to your dependency
but one thing I've seen sort of been

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160
but one thing I've seen sort of been
 

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.169
but one thing I've seen sort of been
quite a lot of open source apps is that

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:06.179
quite a lot of open source apps is that
 

00:18:06.179 --> 00:18:07.820
quite a lot of open source apps is that
you're we be using more than one support

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:07.830
you're we be using more than one support
 

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.919
you're we be using more than one support
library and then you'll forget to update

00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:09.929
library and then you'll forget to update
 

00:18:09.929 --> 00:18:11.419
library and then you'll forget to update
the version number on one of them and

00:18:11.419 --> 00:18:11.429
the version number on one of them and
 

00:18:11.429 --> 00:18:13.370
the version number on one of them and
then I'll get our sink and then bad

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:13.380
then I'll get our sink and then bad
 

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.770
then I'll get our sink and then bad
stuff can happen so is this just a small

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:15.780
stuff can happen so is this just a small
 

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.690
stuff can happen so is this just a small
tip and I'm sure most you're using this

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:17.700
tip and I'm sure most you're using this
 

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.280
tip and I'm sure most you're using this
anyway is that you can extract the

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:19.290
anyway is that you can extract the
 

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.570
anyway is that you can extract the
version number into a variable in your

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:20.580
version number into a variable in your
 

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.610
version number into a variable in your
Gradle file and then you can use it you

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620
Gradle file and then you can use it you
 

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.830
Gradle file and then you can use it you
can replicate in that dependency line so

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840
can replicate in that dependency line so
 

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.180
can replicate in that dependency line so
after that it actually clicks okay your

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:29.190
after that it actually clicks okay your
 

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.039
after that it actually clicks okay your
dependencies come this what it means is

00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:31.049
dependencies come this what it means is
 

00:18:31.049 --> 00:18:32.900
dependencies come this what it means is
that whenever you want to update your

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:32.910
that whenever you want to update your
 

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:33.940
that whenever you want to update your
version number when you have a little

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:33.950
version number when you have a little
 

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.200
version number when you have a little
loops the new version at the support

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:36.210
loops the new version at the support
 

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.060
loops the new version at the support
library you can change this one line it

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:38.070
library you can change this one line it
 

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.340
library you can change this one line it
works for everything else it means

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:40.350
works for everything else it means
 

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.810
works for everything else it means
you're gonna hit less problems and also

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820
you're gonna hit less problems and also
 

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.980
you're gonna hit less problems and also
so less time money editing rate of files

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:44.990
so less time money editing rate of files
 

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.450
so less time money editing rate of files
but you know everyone wants to spend

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460
but you know everyone wants to spend
 

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.200
but you know everyone wants to spend
last time there

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:48.210
last time there
 

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:52.070
last time there
okay so bugs in the support libraries

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080
okay so bugs in the support libraries
 

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.350
okay so bugs in the support libraries
never ebooks no so what you want half of

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360
never ebooks no so what you want half of
 

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.289
never ebooks no so what you want half of
this we know there are bugs there are

00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299
this we know there are bugs there are
 

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:01.250
this we know there are bugs there are
always gonna be bugs in the support

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:01.260
always gonna be bugs in the support
 

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.530
always gonna be bugs in the support
library just because that just the

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:03.540
library just because that just the
 

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.930
library just because that just the
nature of what it is we have to support

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:05.940
nature of what it is we have to support
 

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.120
nature of what it is we have to support
all the way back to API version forms

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:08.130
all the way back to API version forms
 

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.340
all the way back to API version forms
and support we for I can pass me seven

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:10.350
and support we for I can pass me seven
 

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.680
and support we for I can pass me seven
all the others so there are there are

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:12.690
all the others so there are there are
 

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.450
all the others so there are there are
sometimes gonna be bugs we know that

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:14.460
sometimes gonna be bugs we know that
 

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.430
sometimes gonna be bugs we know that
so we are very grateful for when you

so we are very grateful for when you
 

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.529
so we are very grateful for when you
actually submit stuff and hope you'll

00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539
actually submit stuff and hope you'll
 

00:19:18.539 --> 00:19:20.119
actually submit stuff and hope you'll
see that we're pretty hot in it like we

00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:20.129
see that we're pretty hot in it like we
 

00:19:20.129 --> 00:19:21.909
see that we're pretty hot in it like we
will assign stuff pretty quickly and

even though we don't release as quickly

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480
even though we don't release as quickly

even though we don't release as quickly
as what some of you would like we know

00:19:26.389 --> 00:19:26.399
as what some of you would like we know
 

00:19:26.399 --> 00:19:28.039
as what some of you would like we know
that it's something that we should

00:19:28.039 --> 00:19:28.049
that it's something that we should
 

00:19:28.049 --> 00:19:30.560
that it's something that we should
improve and this is something where

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:30.570
improve and this is something where
 

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:31.789
improve and this is something where
we've got a number of things in progress

00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799
we've got a number of things in progress
 

00:19:31.799 --> 00:19:34.249
we've got a number of things in progress
we have heard you we got a lot of

00:19:34.249 --> 00:19:34.259
we have heard you we got a lot of
 

00:19:34.259 --> 00:19:36.139
we have heard you we got a lot of
feedback from the last couple releases

00:19:36.139 --> 00:19:36.149
feedback from the last couple releases
 

00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:37.489
feedback from the last couple releases
that we had that were maybe a little bit

00:19:37.489 --> 00:19:37.499
that we had that were maybe a little bit
 

00:19:37.499 --> 00:19:39.909
that we had that were maybe a little bit
rougher than we would have preferred and

00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919
rougher than we would have preferred and
 

00:19:39.919 --> 00:19:42.109
rougher than we would have preferred and
we're working on it so this is something

00:19:42.109 --> 00:19:42.119
we're working on it so this is something
 

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:43.999
we're working on it so this is something
that if there's some more stuff that we

00:19:43.999 --> 00:19:44.009
that if there's some more stuff that we
 

00:19:44.009 --> 00:19:46.970
that if there's some more stuff that we
miss please submit them we this is not

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:46.980
miss please submit them we this is not

miss please submit them we this is not
just a black box that you're gonna throw

just a black box that you're gonna throw
 

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:51.409
just a black box that you're gonna throw
stuff throw reports down into and we

you'll see this showing up in the design
support library yeah I mean if you look

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:13.450
support library yeah I mean if you look
 

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.659
support library yeah I mean if you look
at this material design spec it's it

00:22:15.659 --> 00:22:15.669
at this material design spec it's it

so believe what it is that you're
 

00:22:53.879 --> 00:22:56.029
so believe what it is that you're
referring to is that on some devices

00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039
referring to is that on some devices
 

00:22:56.039 --> 00:22:58.340

working with manufacturers on to to try
 

00:23:08.519 --> 00:23:09.889
working with manufacturers on to to try
and help with this and in the meantime

00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:09.899
and help with this and in the meantime
 

00:23:09.899 --> 00:23:11.600

that'll hopefully make your lives as
 

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:21.080
that'll hopefully make your lives as
developers a little bit easier with like

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:21.090
developers a little bit easier with like
 

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.180

studio also probably a great question to

00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279
studio also probably a great question to
 

00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:54.680
studio also probably a great question to
bring up at like the fireside chat

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:54.690
bring up at like the fireside chat
 

00:23:54.690 --> 00:24:06.490
bring up at like the fireside chat
around tools as well

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:06.500
 

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.640
I did any plans of bringing animations

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:09.650
I did any plans of bringing animations
 

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.700

to gridview similar to recyclerview to

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:12.710
to gridview similar to recyclerview to
 

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.490
to gridview similar to recyclerview to
grid view similar to a recycler view I

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:15.500
grid view similar to a recycler view I
 

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.650
grid view similar to a recycler view I
believe that the plan on that is to

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:17.660
believe that the plan on that is to
 

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.600
believe that the plan on that is to
build more grid layout managers for

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:19.610
build more grid layout managers for
 

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:21.340
build more grid layout managers for

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.680
has a grid view right now is based on
the same internals that ListView is

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:26.690

we couldn't have resources in there so
 

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.160
we couldn't have resources in there so
we had a bunch of other pieces I mean

we had a bunch of other pieces I mean
 

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:55.450

this is part of the reason why you can't

would totally add all these additional

it kind of sits in on its own just

it kind of sits in on its own just
 

00:26:29.999 --> 00:26:30.799
it kind of sits in on its own just
because it's a little bit more

animations and view pagers let's

00:26:59.530 --> 00:26:59.540
animations and view pagers let's
 

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.820
animations and view pagers let's
specifically like remove into add

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:00.830
specifically like remove into add
 

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:04.180
specifically like remove into add
animations there that's also a great

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:04.190
animations there that's also a great
 

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:07.030
animations there that's also a great
question so I've kind of had this idea

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:07.040
question so I've kind of had this idea
 

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.590
question so I've kind of had this idea
kicking around my head for a while that

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:08.600
kicking around my head for a while that
 

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.870

at some point a viewpager would be

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880
at some point a viewpager would be
 

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.660
at some point a viewpager would be
updated into sort of the new world into

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:13.670

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:15.730
updated into sort of the new world into
kind of a new view page or two based on

kind of a new view page or two based on
 

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.700
kind of a new view page or two based on
top of recycler view in which case again

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:18.710
top of recycler view in which case again
 

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.560
top of recycler view in which case again
just just like with grid views you'd

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:20.570
just just like with grid views you'd
 

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:21.490
just just like with grid views you'd
kind of inherit a lot of that

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:21.500
kind of inherit a lot of that
 

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.200
kind of inherit a lot of that
functionality for free we haven't gotten

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:23.210
functionality for free we haven't gotten
 

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:24.400
functionality for free we haven't gotten
around to doing that sort of thing yet

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:24.410
around to doing that sort of thing yet
 

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.490
around to doing that sort of thing yet
but if you were feeling so inclined to

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:27.500
but if you were feeling so inclined to
 

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.020
but if you were feeling so inclined to
build something kind of like that and

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:29.030
build something kind of like that and
 

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.270
build something kind of like that and
you feel like you want to take a crack

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:31.280
you feel like you want to take a crack
 

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.020
you feel like you want to take a crack
at it

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:32.030
at it
 

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.390
at it
that's probably how I would start in

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:34.400
that's probably how I would start in
 

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.220
that's probably how I would start in

what types of animations are you
 

00:27:37.309 --> 00:27:38.530
what types of animations are you
thinking of I mean we do have a little

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:38.540
thinking of I mean we do have a little
 

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.940
thinking of I mean we do have a little
bit of capability in there around the

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:39.950
bit of capability in there around the
 

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.980
bit of capability in there around the
lines of like Page transformers and that

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:55.820
a few other effects as you're paging
 

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.580
a few other effects as you're paging
through things so what were you thinking

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:57.590
through things so what were you thinking
 

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:03.700
through things so what were you thinking
of more specifically oh sorry they took

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:03.710
of more specifically oh sorry they took

animations so removing pages from it and
 

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.940
animations so removing pages from it and
also being maybe this is a little bit

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:14.950
also being maybe this is a little bit
 

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:18.360
also being maybe this is a little bit
too far out but be far out come on being

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:18.370
too far out but be far out come on being
 

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:20.340
too far out but be far out come on being
like being able to fling multiple pages

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:20.350
like being able to fling multiple pages
 

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:24.029
like being able to fling multiple pages
but land on page boundaries I see yeah

00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039
but land on page boundaries I see yeah
 

00:28:24.039 --> 00:28:25.919
but land on page boundaries I see yeah
this is it huh it sounds like gallery

00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:25.929
this is it huh it sounds like gallery
 

00:28:25.929 --> 00:28:27.990
this is it huh it sounds like gallery
yeah it actually does it so we have this

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000
yeah it actually does it so we have this
 

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.220
yeah it actually does it so we have this
wonderful deprecated widget in the

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:29.230
wonderful deprecated widget in the
 

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:30.510
wonderful deprecated widget in the
framework that you can take a look

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:30.520
framework that you can take a look
 

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.409
framework that you can take a look
no so again this is one of those

00:28:34.409 --> 00:28:34.419
no so again this is one of those
 

00:28:34.419 --> 00:28:36.450
no so again this is one of those
features that's kind of a kind of a

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:36.460
features that's kind of a kind of a
 

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.620
features that's kind of a kind of a
well-known feature request for a

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:37.630
well-known feature request for a
 

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:39.570
well-known feature request for a
recycler view in general which is being

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:39.580
recycler view in general which is being
 

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.440
recycler view in general which is being
able to stop on item detent boundaries

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:42.450
able to stop on item detent boundaries
 

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.850
able to stop on item detent boundaries
this is something that a number of teams

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:44.860
this is something that a number of teams
 

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.919
this is something that a number of teams
have wanted for a number of other types

00:28:46.919 --> 00:28:46.929
have wanted for a number of other types
 

00:28:46.929 --> 00:28:48.419
have wanted for a number of other types
of applications but the core piece of

00:28:48.419 --> 00:28:48.429
of applications but the core piece of
 

00:28:48.429 --> 00:28:49.980
of applications but the core piece of
functionality remains the same for all

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:49.990
functionality remains the same for all
 

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:51.720
functionality remains the same for all
of it it's just kind of like that

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:51.730
of it it's just kind of like that
 

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.460
of it it's just kind of like that
spin it around along the other axis of

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:53.470
spin it around along the other axis of
 

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.769
spin it around along the other axis of
scrolling and make the item sizes either

00:28:55.769 --> 00:28:55.779
scrolling and make the item sizes either
 

00:28:55.779 --> 00:28:58.019
scrolling and make the item sizes either
uniform or not it all kind of boils down

00:28:58.019 --> 00:28:58.029
uniform or not it all kind of boils down
 

00:28:58.029 --> 00:28:59.760
uniform or not it all kind of boils down
to the same thing in the end so that's

00:28:59.760 --> 00:28:59.770
to the same thing in the end so that's
 

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:00.690
to the same thing in the end so that's
something that we're definitely thinking

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:00.700
something that we're definitely thinking
 

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.490
something that we're definitely thinking
about in terms of recyclerview as an

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:02.500
about in terms of recyclerview as an
 

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:12.640
about in terms of recyclerview as an
infrastructure component anyone else

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:12.650
 

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.910
hello could we expect some of the

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:15.920
hello could we expect some of the
 

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.130
hello could we expect some of the
material spec components to be added

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:18.140
material spec components to be added
 

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.630
material spec components to be added
anytime soon something like the bottom

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:19.640
anytime soon something like the bottom
 

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:25.960
anytime soon something like the bottom
sheet maybe yes

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:25.970
sheet maybe yes
 

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:28.390
sheet maybe yes
so bottom sheets a weird one in that

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:28.400
so bottom sheets a weird one in that
 

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.910
so bottom sheets a weird one in that
there's two types of bottom sheets from

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:30.920
there's two types of bottom sheets from
 

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.890
there's two types of bottom sheets from
what I remember the spec they're not too

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:32.900
what I remember the spec they're not too
 

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.420
what I remember the spec they're not too
prescriptive over what the content is

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:34.430
prescriptive over what the content is
 

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:37.120
prescriptive over what the content is
it's more the interaction so the thing

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:37.130
it's more the interaction so the thing
 

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:38.440
it's more the interaction so the thing
that we'll be concentrating on is the

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:38.450
that we'll be concentrating on is the
 

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:39.700
that we'll be concentrating on is the
interaction because that's probably the

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:39.710
interaction because that's probably the
 

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:42.160
interaction because that's probably the
most difficult thing to get right so

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:42.170
most difficult thing to get right so
 

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:46.020
most difficult thing to get right so
that might be coming soon yeah so

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:46.030
that might be coming soon yeah so
 

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.450
that might be coming soon yeah so
Krista's being very cagey basically I

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:49.460
Krista's being very cagey basically I
 

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.549
Krista's being very cagey basically I
would say that in the fullness of time I

00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:51.559
would say that in the fullness of time I
 

00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:52.960
would say that in the fullness of time I
think it's our ideal that the design

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:52.970
think it's our ideal that the design
 

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:54.549
think it's our ideal that the design
work library would reflect to the

00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559
work library would reflect to the
 

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:57.130
work library would reflect to the
contents of the material design spec the

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:57.140
contents of the material design spec the
 

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.200
contents of the material design spec the
important bits the behind the stuff

00:29:59.200 --> 00:29:59.210
important bits the behind the stuff
 

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:00.480
important bits the behind the stuff
you're going to use so the parts we like

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:00.490
you're going to use so the parts we like
 

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:04.540
you're going to use so the parts we like
yeah well the stuff that we want them to

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:04.550
yeah well the stuff that we want them to
 

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:18.269
yeah well the stuff that we want them to
use yes all of it I guess okay

00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:18.279
 

00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:21.989
I I'm wondering if there are any plans

00:30:21.989 --> 00:30:21.999
I I'm wondering if there are any plans
 

00:30:21.999 --> 00:30:26.359
I I'm wondering if there are any plans
for like supporting font features in the

00:30:26.359 --> 00:30:26.369
for like supporting font features in the
 

00:30:26.369 --> 00:30:30.209
for like supporting font features in the
support libraries so on newer versions

00:30:30.209 --> 00:30:30.219
support libraries so on newer versions
 

00:30:30.219 --> 00:30:33.200
support libraries so on newer versions
of Android there's the Roboto font so

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:33.210
of Android there's the Roboto font so
 

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:36.479
of Android there's the Roboto font so
for example in a navigation view for

00:30:36.479 --> 00:30:36.489
for example in a navigation view for
 

00:30:36.489 --> 00:30:38.820
for example in a navigation view for
example in a spec it's supposed to be a

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:38.830
example in a spec it's supposed to be a
 

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:40.950
example in a spec it's supposed to be a
medium font which does not exist on

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960
medium font which does not exist on
 

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.459
medium font which does not exist on
older API levels so or like in the

00:30:44.459 --> 00:30:44.469
older API levels so or like in the
 

00:30:44.469 --> 00:30:46.499
older API levels so or like in the
toolbar so are there any plans for

00:30:46.499 --> 00:30:46.509
toolbar so are there any plans for
 

00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:48.539
toolbar so are there any plans for
supporting fonts and that kind of thing

00:30:48.539 --> 00:30:48.549
supporting fonts and that kind of thing
 

00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:50.310
supporting fonts and that kind of thing
you went to race talked earlier didn't

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320
you went to race talked earlier didn't
 

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.989

that we'll try and make that a little

00:31:02.879 --> 00:31:02.889
that we'll try and make that a little
 

00:31:02.889 --> 00:31:05.099
that we'll try and make that a little
bit more extensible at least so that you

00:31:05.099 --> 00:31:05.109
bit more extensible at least so that you
 

00:31:05.109 --> 00:31:06.570
bit more extensible at least so that you
can get those sorts of things plumb down

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:06.580
can get those sorts of things plumb down
 

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.369
can get those sorts of things plumb down
into those widgets that do sort of

00:31:08.369 --> 00:31:08.379
into those widgets that do sort of
 

00:31:08.379 --> 00:31:09.810
into those widgets that do sort of
generate their own items that contain

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:09.820
generate their own items that contain
 

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.519
generate their own items that contain
text I think that's a great piece of

00:31:11.519 --> 00:31:11.529

some pretty interesting font tricks to
 

00:31:35.139 --> 00:31:38.099
some pretty interesting font tricks to

well the example was it was well you're

and I had another fit but basically

00:33:06.079 --> 00:33:06.089
and I had another fit but basically

animated was the wrong direction things

00:33:19.799 --> 00:33:19.809
animated was the wrong direction things
 

00:33:19.809 --> 00:33:21.690
animated was the wrong direction things
like that and it was it was like when

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:21.700
like that and it was it was like when
 

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.070
like that and it was it was like when
you scroll thing and when you fling it

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.080
you scroll thing and when you fling it
 

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.570
you scroll thing and when you fling it
it was like it was moving it along

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:24.580
it was like it was moving it along
 

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.849
it was like it was moving it along
nicely nicely and then it just went to

00:33:26.849 --> 00:33:26.859
nicely nicely and then it just went to
 

00:33:26.859 --> 00:33:28.589
nicely nicely and then it just went to
the bouncing back the completely

the bouncing back the completely
 

00:33:28.599 --> 00:33:30.329
the bouncing back the completely
opposite direction yeah we see in the

00:33:30.329 --> 00:33:30.339
opposite direction yeah we see in the
 

00:33:30.339 --> 00:33:32.039
opposite direction yeah we see in the
chi-square if you haven't tried the

00:33:32.039 --> 00:33:32.049
chi-square if you haven't tried the
 

00:33:32.049 --> 00:33:33.629

latest version of recyclerview or other

00:33:33.629 --> 00:33:33.639
latest version of recyclerview or other
 

00:33:33.639 --> 00:33:35.669
latest version of recyclerview or other
support v7 mm-hmm libraries but

00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679
support v7 mm-hmm libraries but
 

00:33:35.679 --> 00:33:37.769
support v7 mm-hmm libraries but
supposedly it's fixed I haven't tried it

00:33:37.769 --> 00:33:37.779
supposedly it's fixed I haven't tried it
 

00:33:37.779 --> 00:33:41.089
supposedly it's fixed I haven't tried it
yet though we know the issue just

00:33:41.089 --> 00:33:41.099
yet though we know the issue just
 

00:33:41.099 --> 00:33:43.349
yet though we know the issue just
wondering like do you have any tips and

00:33:43.349 --> 00:33:43.359
wondering like do you have any tips and
 

00:33:43.359 --> 00:33:45.060
wondering like do you have any tips and
tricks in terms of when it develop this

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:45.070
tricks in terms of when it develop this
 

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.739
tricks in terms of when it develop this
kind of things so the difficulty with

00:33:46.739 --> 00:33:46.749
kind of things so the difficulty with
 

00:33:46.749 --> 00:33:48.089
kind of things so the difficulty with
debugging this kind of stuff is when you

00:33:48.089 --> 00:33:48.099
debugging this kind of stuff is when you
 

00:33:48.099 --> 00:33:49.379
debugging this kind of stuff is when you
start moving the view at the same time

00:33:49.379 --> 00:33:49.389
start moving the view at the same time
 

00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:50.579
start moving the view at the same time
so that's when it gets a little

00:33:50.579 --> 00:33:50.589
so that's when it gets a little
 

00:33:50.589 --> 00:33:52.560
so that's when it gets a little
difficult which is why this this

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:52.570
difficult which is why this this
 

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:54.269
difficult which is why this this
particular book has been quite hard to

00:33:54.269 --> 00:33:54.279
particular book has been quite hard to
 

00:33:54.279 --> 00:33:54.629
particular book has been quite hard to
track down

00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639
track down
 

00:33:54.639 --> 00:33:58.589
track down
we think we're there now we think yeah

00:33:58.589 --> 00:33:58.599
we think we're there now we think yeah
 

00:33:58.599 --> 00:34:01.139
we think we're there now we think yeah
we think with that basically being cagey

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:01.149
we think with that basically being cagey
 

00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:02.279
we think with that basically being cagey
about it but yes we were actually

00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:02.289
about it but yes we were actually
 

00:34:02.289 --> 00:34:03.690
about it but yes we were actually
looking at exactly this problem last

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:03.700
looking at exactly this problem last
 

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.390
looking at exactly this problem last
week yes

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:06.400
 

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.550
this bug in particular so yes we're

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:09.560
this bug in particular so yes we're
 

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:14.200
this bug in particular so yes we're
sorry that's one of things with mrs.

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:14.210
sorry that's one of things with mrs.
 

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.820
sorry that's one of things with mrs.
golden actually because I mean the IPR

differently so that's one the written
 

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.080

the reason for these kind of issues

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:23.090
the reason for these kind of issues
 

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:26.230
the reason for these kind of issues
still crop up because I mean some of

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240
still crop up because I mean some of
 

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.520
still crop up because I mean some of
this just kind of owes to the way that

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:27.530
this just kind of owes to the way that
 

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.560
this just kind of owes to the way that
the recyclerview is a really great

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:29.570
the recyclerview is a really great
 

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:31.780
the recyclerview is a really great
example of this I mean if if one piece

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:31.790
example of this I mean if if one piece
 

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:33.490
example of this I mean if if one piece
of scrolling code covered every possible

00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:33.500
of scrolling code covered every possible
 

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.050
of scrolling code covered every possible
use case then we would have been done

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:35.060
use case then we would have been done
 

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.960
use case then we would have been done

with scroll view so recycler view and
other things scroll by completely

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.040
other things scroll by completely

other things scroll by completely
different mechanisms for one reason or

different mechanisms for one reason or
 

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:45.580
different mechanisms for one reason or
another and it ends up leading to bugs

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:45.590
another and it ends up leading to bugs
 

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.320
