I'm sure they hear things just find the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
I'm sure they hear things just find the
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.400
I'm sure they hear things just find the
first time they hear them but then what

first time they hear them but then what
 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.290

happens for me is that if I listen to it

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
happens for me is that if I listen to it
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.549

a couple more times there are pieces

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559
a couple more times there are pieces
 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.200
a couple more times there are pieces

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
chunks of it that start to fall into

I can see the beauty sort of shine

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020
I can see the beauty sort of shine

I can see the beauty sort of shine
through those and then eventually the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719
through those and then eventually the
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.200
through those and then eventually the
whole thing links together and then I

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
whole thing links together and then I
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.610
whole thing links together and then I
can listen to it especially if it's a

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
can listen to it especially if it's a
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.430
can listen to it especially if it's a
complex piece of music many many many

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
complex piece of music many many many
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.490
complex piece of music many many many
times and the more complex and probably

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
times and the more complex and probably
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.170
times and the more complex and probably
the better the piece of music the more I

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
the better the piece of music the more I
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.700
the better the piece of music the more I
can listen to it but if I listen to it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
can listen to it but if I listen to it
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.040
can listen to it but if I listen to it
enough at some point then I've had

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050
enough at some point then I've had
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.010
enough at some point then I've had
enough of it and that's all very strange

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020
enough of it and that's all very strange
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.650
enough of it and that's all very strange
phenomena because one of the things you

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
phenomena because one of the things you
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.240
phenomena because one of the things you
might ask yourself is what exactly are

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250
might ask yourself is what exactly are
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.740
might ask yourself is what exactly are
you learning while you're doing that you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
you learning while you're doing that you
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.600
you learning while you're doing that you
know it seems like you want the music

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
know it seems like you want the music
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.039
know it seems like you want the music
it's something like you want the music

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
it's something like you want the music
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.789
it's something like you want the music
to be just exactly the right amount of

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
to be just exactly the right amount of
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.380
to be just exactly the right amount of
predictable and unpredictable and if

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
predictable and unpredictable and if
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.730
predictable and unpredictable and if
it's too unpredictable then you can't

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
it's too unpredictable then you can't
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.810
it's too unpredictable then you can't
understand it and if it's too

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
understand it and if it's too
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.580
understand it and if it's too
predictable it's boring and so it's just

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
predictable it's boring and so it's just
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.380
predictable it's boring and so it's just
like the conversation that way it's

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390
like the conversation that way it's
 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.690
like the conversation that way it's
actually just like life as well you know

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
actually just like life as well you know
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.950
actually just like life as well you know
because you want things to be

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
because you want things to be
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.530
because you want things to be
predictable and stable and you want

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
predictable and stable and you want
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.640
predictable and stable and you want
things to be unpredictable and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
things to be unpredictable and
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.700
things to be unpredictable and
interesting and the degree to which you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710
interesting and the degree to which you
 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.039
interesting and the degree to which you
want each of those is going to depend on

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049
want each of those is going to depend on
 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.740
want each of those is going to depend on
the time in the context and also on your

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
the time in the context and also on your
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.830
the time in the context and also on your
own intelligence and temperament so now

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840
own intelligence and temperament so now
 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.770
own intelligence and temperament so now
I'm going to tell you a bunch of stories

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
I'm going to tell you a bunch of stories
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.630
I'm going to tell you a bunch of stories
and give you a bunch of a number of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
and give you a bunch of a number of
 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.030
and give you a bunch of a number of
pieces of information and hopefully

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
pieces of information and hopefully
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.940
pieces of information and hopefully
they'll pick together now I think the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
they'll pick together now I think the
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.410
they'll pick together now I think the
reason that this information is always

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
reason that this information is always
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.420
reason that this information is always
being transmitted in story and image

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430
being transmitted in story and image
 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.069
being transmitted in story and image
form is because it's very very difficult

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079
form is because it's very very difficult
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.340
form is because it's very very difficult

to transform them into articulated like
 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.830
to transform them into articulated like

isn't really how it works you know we're

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
isn't really how it works you know we're
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.490
isn't really how it works you know we're
not really accustomed to thinking about

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
not really accustomed to thinking about
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.350
not really accustomed to thinking about
the idea that there are certain forms of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
the idea that there are certain forms of
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.040
the idea that there are certain forms of
information that and that that are valid

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050
information that and that that are valid
 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.700
information that and that that are valid
forms of infor

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710
forms of infor

nation that can't be transmitted

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090
nation that can't be transmitted
 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.280
nation that can't be transmitted
verbally but of course if you think

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
verbally but of course if you think
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.960
verbally but of course if you think
about it we all understand this deeply

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970
about it we all understand this deeply
 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.790
about it we all understand this deeply
because well I can give you a bunch of

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800
because well I can give you a bunch of
 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.420
because well I can give you a bunch of
examples the first example is that when

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430
examples the first example is that when
 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.390
examples the first example is that when
you speak not only do you speak in words

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400
you speak not only do you speak in words
 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.370
you speak not only do you speak in words
and phrases and sentences and paragraphs

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380
and phrases and sentences and paragraphs
 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.760
and phrases and sentences and paragraphs
but you also speak melodically and in

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770
but you also speak melodically and in
 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.500
but you also speak melodically and in
fact part of the reason that you can

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510
fact part of the reason that you can
 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.600
fact part of the reason that you can
understand melodies and that they make

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610
understand melodies and that they make
 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.180
understand melodies and that they make
sense to you is that what artists have

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190
sense to you is that what artists have
 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.760
sense to you is that what artists have
done is separated the melodic element of

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770
done is separated the melodic element of
 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.670
done is separated the melodic element of
speech from the semantic element and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680
speech from the semantic element and
 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.710
speech from the semantic element and
then played with the melodic element and

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720
then played with the melodic element and
 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.350
then played with the melodic element and
the melodic element tends to carry a lot

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360
the melodic element tends to carry a lot
 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.560
the melodic element tends to carry a lot
of emotion and intent and so if you're

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570
of emotion and intent and so if you're
 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.590
of emotion and intent and so if you're
listening to someone speak you can tell

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600
listening to someone speak you can tell
 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.210
listening to someone speak you can tell
when they're being ironic you know

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
when they're being ironic you know
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.100
when they're being ironic you know
because they raise an eyebrow and their

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110
because they raise an eyebrow and their
 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.780
because they raise an eyebrow and their
voice changes slightly even though they

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790
voice changes slightly even though they
 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.550
voice changes slightly even though they
might be using in fact they are using

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560
might be using in fact they are using
 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.200
might be using in fact they are using
exactly the same words and in fact

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210
exactly the same words and in fact
 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.970
exactly the same words and in fact
someone who's very good at being witty

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980
someone who's very good at being witty
 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.150
someone who's very good at being witty
or ironic will set the situation up so

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160
or ironic will set the situation up so
 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.890
or ironic will set the situation up so
that you can barely tell that they're

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900
that you can barely tell that they're
 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.770
that you can barely tell that they're
joking and the better they are at that

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780
joking and the better they are at that
 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.600
joking and the better they are at that

the situation is so so we know that
 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.340
the situation is so so we know that
information can be transmitted through

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350
information can be transmitted through
 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.410
information can be transmitted through
nonverbal channels it even happens

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420
nonverbal channels it even happens
 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.150
nonverbal channels it even happens
during speech and then of course we

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160
during speech and then of course we
 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.190
during speech and then of course we
understand that music presents to us an

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200
understand that music presents to us an
 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.330
understand that music presents to us an
intimation of meaning that's very

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340
intimation of meaning that's very
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.510
intimation of meaning that's very
difficult to fully grasp and music for

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520
difficult to fully grasp and music for
 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.990
difficult to fully grasp and music for
me has always been a ineffable

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000
me has always been a ineffable
 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.450
me has always been a ineffable
phenomenon in some sense because it

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460
phenomenon in some sense because it
 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.370
phenomenon in some sense because it
carries the information of meaning in a

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380
carries the information of meaning in a
 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.750
carries the information of meaning in a
manner that can't be rationally

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760
manner that can't be rationally
 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.780
manner that can't be rationally
dismissed or that people are interested

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790
dismissed or that people are interested
 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.380
dismissed or that people are interested
in rationally dismissing so you even

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390
in rationally dismissing so you even
 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.240
in rationally dismissing so you even

punk-rock nihilists listen to punk rock
nihilistic music and they you know they

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620
nihilistic music and they you know they
 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.710
nihilistic music and they you know they
find that meaningful even though they

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720
find that meaningful even though they
 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.600
find that meaningful even though they

some sense they're victims of their own
rationality because they do believe in

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660
rationality because they do believe in
 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.000
rationality because they do believe in

they could possibly believe in it so

they're rational mind has dispensed with
 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.250
they're rational mind has dispensed with

the idea and sometimes that's people
 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
the idea and sometimes that's people
dispense with the idea of meaning for

dispense with the idea of meaning for
 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.090
dispense with the idea of meaning for
lots of reasons partly because of

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100
lots of reasons partly because of
 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.310
lots of reasons partly because of
because it's inevitable in some sense

because it's inevitable in some sense

the underbelly of things because it also

justifies not bearing any responsibility

justifies not bearing any responsibility
for your life and not necessarily what

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360
for your life and not necessarily what
 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.110

that can be a very desirable side-effect

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120
that can be a very desirable side-effect
 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.450
that can be a very desirable side-effect
of a particular ideological irrational

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460
of a particular ideological irrational
 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.489
of a particular ideological irrational
belief and then there's dance of course

00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:43.499
belief and then there's dance of course
 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:46.580
belief and then there's dance of course
and dance is even more ineffable than

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590
and dance is even more ineffable than
 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.320
and dance is even more ineffable than
music although it's often paired with

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330
music although it's often paired with

music you know honest and if it grips
people if you see a remarkable dance

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639
people if you see a remarkable dance
 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.700
people if you see a remarkable dance
performance well part of it is that

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710
performance well part of it is that
 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.709
performance well part of it is that
you're sort of thrilled and excited

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719
you're sort of thrilled and excited
 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:59.869
you're sort of thrilled and excited
about seeing just exactly what the human

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879
about seeing just exactly what the human
 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.240
about seeing just exactly what the human
form can do you know because perhaps

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250
form can do you know because perhaps
 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.670
form can do you know because perhaps
partly because you're human and when you

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680
partly because you're human and when you
 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.879
partly because you're human and when you
see someone extending a certain ability

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889
see someone extending a certain ability
 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.269
see someone extending a certain ability
far beyond the norm then it expands your

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:11.279
far beyond the norm then it expands your
 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:12.589
far beyond the norm then it expands your
sense of what a human being is capable

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599
sense of what a human being is capable
 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.629
sense of what a human being is capable
of so there's so there's that there's

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639
of so there's so there's that there's
 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.339
of so there's so there's that there's
just the pure skill element and then

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349
just the pure skill element and then
 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.740
just the pure skill element and then
there's a novelty element because often

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750
there's a novelty element because often
 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.800
there's a novelty element because often
if you watch a particularly good dancer

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810
if you watch a particularly good dancer
 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.360
if you watch a particularly good dancer
there's things they do that you haven't

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370
there's things they do that you haven't
 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.890
there's things they do that you haven't
seen before that you didn't know anyone

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900
seen before that you didn't know anyone
 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.929
seen before that you didn't know anyone
can do and that's pretty fun and then

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:26.939
can do and that's pretty fun and then
 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:30.019
can do and that's pretty fun and then
often the dances is joined with the

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029
often the dances is joined with the
 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:32.149
often the dances is joined with the
music and the body is expressing what

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159
music and the body is expressing what
 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.860
music and the body is expressing what
the music means and even though you

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870
the music means and even though you
 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.480
the music means and even though you
can't tell what the music means you can

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490
can't tell what the music means you can
 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.570
can't tell what the music means you can
tell that the dance is expressing it and

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580
tell that the dance is expressing it and
 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.249
tell that the dance is expressing it and
see I think what happens there is that

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259
see I think what happens there is that
 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.670
see I think what happens there is that
music represents the patterns of being

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680
music represents the patterns of being
 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.320
music represents the patterns of being
it's actually because people think of

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330
it's actually because people think of
 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.240
it's actually because people think of
music as a non representational art but

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250
music as a non representational art but
 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.649
music as a non representational art but
I think that's wrong I think it might be

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659
I think that's wrong I think it might be
 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.689
I think that's wrong I think it might be
the most representational art is that

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699
the most representational art is that
 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.149
the most representational art is that
being is made up of layers of patterned

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159
being is made up of layers of patterned
 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:56.170
being is made up of layers of patterned
layers of patterns constantly interact

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180
layers of patterns constantly interact
 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.459
layers of patterns constantly interact
interacting and hopefully in a

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469
interacting and hopefully in a
 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.529
interacting and hopefully in a
relatively harmonious way and music

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539
relatively harmonious way and music
 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.740
relatively harmonious way and music
music demonstrates that mimic that in

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750
music demonstrates that mimic that in
 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.469
music demonstrates that mimic that in
some sense abstractly and then the dance

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479
some sense abstractly and then the dance
 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.420
some sense abstractly and then the dance
is an abstract representation like

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430
is an abstract representation like
 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.610
is an abstract representation like
people adapt to the patterns of being

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620
people adapt to the patterns of being
 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.860
people adapt to the patterns of being
and the dancer adapts to the pattern of

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870
and the dancer adapts to the pattern of
 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.129
and the dancer adapts to the pattern of
music and so it's a it's a symbolic it's

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139
music and so it's a it's a symbolic it's
 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.429
music and so it's a it's a symbolic it's
an embodied display of the place of the

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:19.439
an embodied display of the place of the
 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.040
an embodied display of the place of the
person in the cosmos and you can you can

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050
person in the cosmos and you can you can
 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.929
person in the cosmos and you can you can
also make that case when you see people

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:23.939
also make that case when you see people
 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:25.999
also make that case when you see people
dancing in pairs because you can dance

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009
dancing in pairs because you can dance
 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.800
dancing in pairs because you can dance
alone or you can dance in pairs and

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810
alone or you can dance in pairs and
 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.000
alone or you can dance in pairs and
that's basically standard

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010
that's basically standard
 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.800
that's basically standard
human adaptation so and music is

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810
human adaptation so and music is
 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.270
human adaptation so and music is
interesting too because one of the

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280
interesting too because one of the
 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.770
interesting too because one of the
things that you'll notice is that

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780
things that you'll notice is that
 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.560
things that you'll notice is that
there's always music in a movie almost

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570
there's always music in a movie almost
 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.240
there's always music in a movie almost
always there's the Audrey movie that

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250
always there's the Audrey movie that
 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.190
always there's the Audrey movie that
doesn't have it but it's quite marked

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200
doesn't have it but it's quite marked
 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.050
doesn't have it but it's quite marked
when it's absent you know the movie

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060
when it's absent you know the movie
 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.640
when it's absent you know the movie
feels a lot more cold and clinical

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650
feels a lot more cold and clinical
 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.640
feels a lot more cold and clinical
though it can work but we accept the

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650
though it can work but we accept the
 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.040
though it can work but we accept the
idea that music can be used to fill in

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050
idea that music can be used to fill in
 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.900
idea that music can be used to fill in
the missing context in a movie without

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910
