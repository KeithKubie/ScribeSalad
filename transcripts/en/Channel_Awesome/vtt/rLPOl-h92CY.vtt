00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.300
[Disneycember theme]

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.600
Doug Walker: Oh my god, guys. Camp Rock is so bad.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.959
I know I kind of sound like a giggling idiot saying that, but I'm sorry.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.829
It's really hard not to laugh when talking about this movie. It is just so bad.

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.609
Okay, it's not as surreal as Can of Worms, or as annoying as Cheetah Girls

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:39.600
But it really is kind of amazing how they hit every single possible cliche you could do with this story

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.000
Where do I even begin?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'll start at the beginning, cuz yeah, it's like everything immediately seems awkward and out of place even from the start

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.000
There's this high school girl named Mitchie, who's really excited to go to Camp Rock.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.200
But it looks like her parents aren't able to have her go

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.850
But then it turns out they can

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.450
Yeah...

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.500
That's the opening. What was the point of that?

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.800
She finds out she can't go. She mopes for maybe a minute

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.800
And then the parents are so excited they tell her that they can go because they're catering there, and she's excited again.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.800
Why wasn't that edited out? I'll tell you exactly why. because they saw in other movies

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.800
Because they saw in other movies, this cliche where somebody is sad that they can't go to a place, but then happy when they find out they can.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.499
Even though they don't really grasp that that goes through a long time,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.400
and there's ups and downs, peaks, and valleys and arches and stuff like that.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.200
No, you just need a minute of this not yet developed character sulking and then suddenly being happy.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200
And that's pretty much how the rest of the film works

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.200
Just trying to cram in as many cliches as possible. They can't even juggle them all.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.600
You see the Jonas Brothers-

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.150
Oh wait, I'm sorry, not the Jonas Brothers.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:51.200
A completely different band has the lead singer who's acting out and totally forgetting what it means to be about the music

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.400
So his band members drop him off at Camp Rock to hope he will regain his voice

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.400
Yeah, because a teenybopper pop singer surrounded by teens is gonna help him discover his voice.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.850
Isn't that what you already get?

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.000
Even the first scene we have with him and Mitchie at the camp is just a mix of too many cliches

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.800
He's running away from a bunch of girls so he hides in a bush.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.489
She suddenly gets an urge to play in the piano

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.400
You know, be herself and play her little solo that she wrote

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.900
I think the idea is that he's supposed to hear her music and be inspired, but they don't show any thing like that

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.600
She's playing and it keeps cutting back to him, but he's not looking up at her or acting like he's hearing anything.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.000
He's just looking at these girls he's trying to hide from.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.200
Then she disappears, then he goes inside and it's like "Was anybody here?"

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.300
Oh, okay, so you did hear what was in there?

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.600
How come nothing on your face indicated that?

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.000
How come none of the editing indicated that?

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.800
Well, no time to answer that.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.000
We have to get to all our incredibly cliched characters like the popular bully who apparently runs the camp.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.600
Well, how does a teen pop singer run a camp?

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.200
Even the snarky, best friend stereotype is like "Yeah, music doesn't fly here. It's all about the bling.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.870
That's why she runs the camp."

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:09.400
But it's okay, because Michie, of course, makes up a lie that her parents are incredibly popular and presidents of companies and stuff like that.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.000
And she's totally been in a lot of music videos.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.600
And, uh oh, well that lie be revealed somewhere down the road

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.599
Well again, we have no time for that cliche because we had to get to the cliche of the Jonas Brother

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.628
just sitting alone and saying he doesn't like being a label.

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.200
He wants to work in his own music and not this cookie cutter stuff.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.400
Uh, news flash jackass, the guy sitting alone on the beach playing his guitar is also a label.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.950
You're a living proof of that being a Jonas Brother acting out this cliche.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.359
But up, we have to get to the cliche of the bully girl throwing food at another girl.

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:47.000
But it's okay, because she'll still sabotage her by interrupting her performance saying that she saw a snake this okay

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.870
This... okay.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.370
So got interrupted the girl can go right back to play up. No. She's too mad apparently.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.000
She can't keep playing, what reality is this in?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.319
Where the hell are the counselors?

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.739
There's no order at this place.

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:05.569
But apparently that's still not enough cliches so the bully girl makes it look like she stole something from her.

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.400
Oh my god, this is overload.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.800
Did anybody have an original thought when making this?

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.959
But it's tragic too because that bully girl, it turns out her mother is a pop star and doesn't have time for her.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.600
Ohhh, this film's deep guys.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.200
So now Mitch is a liar and apparently a thief.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.000
But of course, it'll take some sort of big Jam concert at the end to make everybody okay.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.760
Michie, her best friend, Jonas brother number three, even the bully girl ends up being a best friend at the end

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.800
Okay, you know what I am there sick of this. There need to be some consequences.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.400
I'm usually for forgive and forgetting everything, but this is ridiculous

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.000
What number Disney Channel movie is this where they just kiss and make up at the end.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.200
Totally forget all the terrible things they've done, and they just allow them to be friends again

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.600
I know it's good to be nice, but I'm sorry. There's got to be some goddamn responsibility in this world.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.000
Oh, and by the way an answer to the first question you were probably asking when you saw this review;

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The answer is no. The Jonas Brothers cannot act.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.200
Jonas Brother 1: We have a problem with that

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.200
Jonas Brother 2: Actually, I don't really have a problem with that.

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.200
We have a problem with that.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.000
Jonas Brother 3: One word, payback.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.600
Jonas Brother 2: That's two words by God is that painful this film doesn't have a corny charm like the high school

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.600
Doug Walker: By god, is that painful.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.600
This film doesn't have a corny charm like the High School Musicals or the Twitch's films.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.500
It's just manipulative beginning to end.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.310
Nothing seems real, nothing seems interesting

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.600
Which is a shame because I think the girl playing the main lead actually isn't that bad.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.000
She's got this awkward smile and okay delivery that I could totally see working in another film, but here

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.500
But here, there's nothing she or any of these cast members can do.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.800
It's just every cliche checklist you can imagine

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.400
But I'll be honest. It's hard to say I didn't kind of enjoy how bad it was.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.400
I mean, good lord, even the songs suck.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.300
For Jonas Brother Number Three talking about cookie cutter pop songs, there sure are a lot of cookie cutter pop songs in this.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.470
So yeah, I can kind of see people looking back on this and laughing the same way

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.200
we look back on Space Jam and laugh, like it's just so incredibly dumb and dated.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.000
But if you're looking for a legitimately good or charming movie. I can easily say get the rock out of here
