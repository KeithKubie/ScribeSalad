00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.850
Here are 10 Life-changing Lifehacks that you can try right now

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.160
This little trick will make it so you can
play games on your smart phone without having

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.970
to deal with strategically placed ads. Simply
try switching your phone over to airplane

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.079
mode. This will turn off the phones radio
function, and even make your battery last

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:21.999
longer, so you get more playing time, without
the incessant distractions.

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:25.509
If you've ever rented a car, you know the
feeling of pulling in to the gas station,

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.060
only to realize too late, that you forgot
to check which side the fill port was on.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.960
Rather than being caught doing the walk of
shame, you can avoid the embarrassment altogether,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.890
by glancing at the pump icon on your gas gauge.
There's a little arrow pointing to the side

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.000
you need to fill up on. So remember this little
trick the next time you borrow a car, and

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.930
you'll be a gas pump hero on the very first
try.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.540
It's the season for grilling, and if you want
to switch things up at your next party, why

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.510
not skip the lighter fluid, and try starting
your charcoal with a handful of potato chips?

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.110
They make a surprisingly flammable tinder,
and will easily burn long enough to light

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.030
up a stack of coals. And this way, you won't
get that lighter fluid taste in your meat.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.350
Ah, the kiwi fruit. It's so exotic and so
delicious, but how do you peel it without

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.830
hacking it up and leaving so much fruit on
the skins? The solution is so simple you won't

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.490
believe it. Try using a spoon. Just cut the
ends of the kiwi, then push your spoon inside,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.690
making sure the back slides in along the peel.
Now carefully work the spoon around the inside

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.600
edge, until the entire fruit pops right out.
It really is that quick and easy, and hardly

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.350
anything gets left behind.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.380
Uh oh. Somebody just lost their smart phone,
and will probably be in a panic once they

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.850
realize it. Before this happens to you, take
a picture of your email address, or some other

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.619
contact information written in big letters.
Go ahead and save it as your lock screen photo,

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.860
and now if your phone ever does get lost,
the first thing anyone will see, is exactly

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.159
how to get it back to you.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.360
Every day we face a torturous moment of truth,
when we turn on the shower, and get blasted

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.420
by icy cold water. If it's not cold, then
it's unbearably hot. But you can easily fix

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.540
this daily challenge with a bottle of nail
polish or white-out. The next time you find

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.250
the sweet spot, mark the trim plate and the
handle with a couple of dabs that line up

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.250
with each other. Now you've got the power
to win this epic battle, by hitting the perfect

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.170
temperature on the very first try.
How Embarrassing. Your tie keeps getting twisted

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.810
out of place, and it's so frustrating to have
to keep checking and straightening it all

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.620
the time, isn't it? Let's rig up a permanent
fix with an old dress shirt, and a pair of

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.650
scissors. Carefully cut the front strip so
you end up with a piece just a bit longer

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.510
than the two button holes. Now then next
time you dress up, simply slip one of these

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.120
"tie savers" through the keeper loop on your
tie. Fasten it to the buttons on your shirt,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.380
and now your tie will always be straight,
look great, and fall back into place even

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.980
when it gets knocked around in the wind.
The frustration that comes when wrapping

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.290
up leftovers, because the rolls keep pulling
up out of the boxes. Sometimes they seem more

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.459
trouble than they're worth, but luckily, there's
a quick and easy fix. Just get a knife and

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.800
cut a downward facing arrow on the ends of
the boxes, directly in the center. Now simply

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.720
push these tabs inward to secure the roll
in place, and keep it conveniently in the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.050
box, every time you pull. By the way, some
boxes already have little push tabs built

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.340
right in. So start using them, and make
your life that much easier.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.750
Do you wake up in the morning with a stiff
neck and a headache? It might be because your

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.739
pillow is cranking on your spine all night
long. But rather than spending loads of money

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.410
on specialty pillows, try lifting your head
a bit and tucking the edge of your pillow,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.769
under your neck. Lay back down, with the corners
over top of your shoulders, and you've just

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.180
made an ergonomic support for your neck and
head. This will help straighten out your spine,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.930
and instantly make any pillow you're using,
feel like it should have cost a lot more.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.879
Plastic grocery bags. They're worth hanging
on to, but they can quickly take over your

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.580
drawer space. To eliminate the clutter, simply
flatten them out, and fold the bags in half

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.550
lengthwise. Now lay them in a straight line,
with the handles overlapping the bottoms of

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.920
the previous bags, then roll the whole thing
up. You can add as many bags as you want,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.909
and in a couple of minutes, you'll have an
instant bag dispenser that will take up very

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.470
little space. Now if you put this in some
kind of container, it will dispense one bag

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.769
at a time, whenever you need it.
Well there are 10 life changing life-hacks

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:14.769
that you can try right now. If you liked these
