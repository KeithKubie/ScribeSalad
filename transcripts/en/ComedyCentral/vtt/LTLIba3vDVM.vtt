00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:01.801
... on the left.
That's the sister, right?

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.335
Yeah.

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:04.637
From That '70s Show? Yeah.
They were all like that.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.206
Whoa look at this shot.

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:07.940
Is that her now?

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.642
No, that's not true.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.377
It says Eric's sister from
That '70s

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:12.978
Show is still not doing well.

00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:14.680
Why does she have
Mac and Me eyes?

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.982
Yeah, what the fuck?

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:17.684
I thought she died.
I'm pretty sure she died.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.884
Ah man.
Did she die?

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:20.486
No.
What happened?

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:22.088
It looks like she got exposed
to the atmosphere of Mars.

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:25.158
Yeah, come on ...
you have to do the three

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.101
We weren't able to get
to the reactor in time.

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.269
She looks like as the reactor,

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.472
before the air is let in,
right before.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:42.508
Yeah, right before.
Aw they found her. Look at her.

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:44.143
Oh yeah, she died in 2013.

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:45.377
Finally.
Aw man.

00:00:45.377 --> 00:00:46.712
What happened to her?

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:48.448
They said she couldn't
be stopped.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.622
I brought some Colorado pot.

00:00:56.622 --> 00:00:59.426
I got some back to New York.
I'll just say that.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:04.030
How's your butthole doing?
Is it recovering all right?

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.597
It's still open.

00:01:05.597 --> 00:01:07.266
You had a barrel of weed
up there.

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:11.171
Yeah, I took it,
I emptied out a giant dildo

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:12.772
and filled it full of weed.

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:17.243
Yeah, they offered it to him in
something that had a point on it

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.777
so it could go in.

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:21.347
And Dan said no, I want blunt.
I want a blunt force.

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:23.582
You want to stretch
around a flat surface.

00:01:23.582 --> 00:01:26.019
I believe what I said
is I want to Wylie Coyote it

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:29.255
and just sit in on it
in a Wylie Coyote fashion.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:30.790
You got home and you know
the barrel

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.558
they put around
a St. Bernard's neck?

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:35.194
One of those. Got it up his ass.
No point, no point at all.

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.529
No lube.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.764
Blunt side. Set it straight up
and down,

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:40.900
fucking breathed into it,
squatted down.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.168
Give you the name of the guy

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.702
that does the seminar
in San Diego.

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:45.404
Teaches you to breathe
open your asshole.

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:46.840
His name is Jordan something.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.941
Sweetheart, sweetheart of a man.

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:51.377
Can get you to fit
anything up your butt.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:55.514
We were saying coke earlier.
Your eighties coke phase

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:57.717
that we were imagining
you going through.

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:59.719
I saw this weekend,
I was outside smoking

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.221
a cigarette
at my hotel in Buffalo.

00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:03.422
Lovely Buffalo, New York.

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:05.357
And a guy was out there,

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:09.695
he looked like a 90s
Latino drug dealer.

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:15.835
He was wearing a giant oversized
leather Pelle Pelle jacket.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.505
He had the winter hat on.

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.840
His jacket matched his jeans,
they were very tan.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.943
Everything was tan on him
and his boots.

00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:27.013
And he's walking around upset
because he says this hotel man,

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:30.849
I had confirmation they had
a hot tub room for me man,

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.685
a hot tub.
I go K.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.121
Which by the way
I had a hot tub room.

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:36.655
It had a fireplace.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:38.557
Wait you had a hot tub
and a fireplace in your room?

00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:40.226
The fireplace was awesome.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.095
Wait, but you had a hot tub.

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.696
Yeah.

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:46.399
Not like a big bath tub like a
hot tub filled with water.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.234
Not a hot tub, no.
A jacuzzi tub.

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:49.668
A jacuzzi tub.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.971
Yeah, I think that's
what he was saying too.

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.973
He's saying they don't have it
for him and he's outside.

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:56.943
He's upset and he goes,
I ain't even worried about me,

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.644
I'm worried about this pig
I got in the car

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:00.346
which I thought was
an interesting way to put it.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.382
Oh, real romantic.

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:04.650
I'm worried about this pig
I got in the car.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.021
And then I see him
pull a bag out of his pocket.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:14.193
There is security around.
There is hotel staff around.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.795
And he goes,
yo you want a bump.

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:17.730
To you?

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.198
He goes you want to do bumps.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:20.566
To you?

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:21.901
Yeah to me.
He goes you want to do bumps.

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:24.370
I went ha no, no,
I'm okay man.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.172
Thank you. And he goes well
I'm gonna man, don't mind me,

00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:29.508
he goes I'm having fun
this night no matter what.

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:31.477
And I've never seen this before.

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:33.112
I told Christine,
I was so blown away by this.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:37.617
He reached with three fingers
into a pretty big bag of cocaine

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:41.954
and grabbed cocaine
with his fingers.

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:45.658
And then just sloppily
put it under his nose

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:48.594
and just started snorting up.
And it was all over his face-

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:50.763
That's the coke version
of putting water in your hands

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:51.965
and drinking it?

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.633
Dude.

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:56.236
He's just like ...

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.138
It was so obvious.
He almost made the ...

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:02.508
He did the LeBron chalk throw
at the beginning of the game.

00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:06.412
It also sounds like the way
a child would do coke.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.047
If we were like
how do you do coke.

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.782
And they're like you just
grab it and put it in your face.

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:13.719
You have to shove it
into your nose with your hands.

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.288
There's a certain thing
with coke, if I ever did coke

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:18.724
I'd want the ring that opens up
and you just go ...

00:04:18.724 --> 00:04:19.825
Oh yeah?

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:21.961
Just fucking get yacked
and just like ....

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:23.462
Not me. I want a fucking-

00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:25.098
Fang necklace-

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.567
I'd want a diamond necklace
with a little spoon on it.

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:30.102
Ew. And then at one point-

00:04:30.102 --> 00:04:32.204
And I'm gonna grow a fucking
sick ass fingernail.

00:04:32.204 --> 00:04:33.472
Like a vampire fingernail.

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:35.074
Oh absolutely.

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:36.909
Just a real Lestat and just
get in there and fucking ...

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.010
Doing gummers.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.946
Blast it up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah for sure.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.780
I'm lucky I wasn't
living in 1972

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.650
because I'd be dead by 1981?

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:49.155
Last night me and Christine
dropped Isabella

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:51.757
at home in Long Island.
We were driving home.

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:53.559
We were having such
a good time in the car.

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.862
We're listening .... you know,
we're not in our car a ton.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:57.096
Yeah, jamming out.

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:58.264
Playing music-

00:04:58.264 --> 00:04:59.465
Sunday night drive.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.167
Yeah.
No traffic, it was nice.

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:02.401
No traffic, we're just cruising.

00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:04.337
Daughter's back at home
with mom,

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:05.838
you two are back
on the prowl.

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:06.839
Ripping butts.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.574
In the car?
Yeah man.

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:12.578
Aw man. So fucking funny.
The week they got that car

00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:14.346
and we came to your house
to watch Joey Lagano

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:16.749
take it all. They're like dude,
no we're not smoking in there.

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.518
You'll never,
ever smell it buddy.

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:21.420
I am all over
that car, meticulous.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.123
It just didn't feel like our car
until we smoked in it.

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:25.391
You fucking ...

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:26.792
Stopped smoking all around.

00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:28.227
But while we are,
car's best place.

00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:30.029
Car's the best place
to smoke in the world.

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.830
In the world.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.299
It's the place
I miss smoking the most.

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:35.100
When we were in the car
for the first day we got it

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.370
and we were in it for seven
hours on the way to Philly,

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.271
I think we only smoked
one cigarette.

00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:41.240
But how good does that one feel

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.875
when you go like you guys
want to smoke one,

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.743
you want to split one
and you're like oh.

00:05:44.743 --> 00:05:47.246
We're like leaning out
the window.

00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:51.617
In a snow storm. Oh, smoking.

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:55.020
Hey good job evil people
who made it.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.757
So we were driving,
smoking cigarettes,

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:01.794
literally singing along.
Me and Christine are going 18,

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:07.300
I get confused every day.
Put that on in the background.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.568
This is bert kreischer-esq
story.

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:13.005
Me and Christine are having
such a good time

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:15.808
singing along with this.

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:20.079
And then I get interrupted by,
it's Bluetooth to the car.

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:23.482
So the song gets interrupted by,
says Jacob

00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:25.385
Battat
calling.

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.353
And me and Christine
are feeling good.

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:29.121
And we go hey
Jacob sort of thing.

00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:30.890
Windows are down
so we're smoking,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.892
it's very windy and loud.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:35.394
And we push the button,
answer the call,

00:06:35.894 --> 00:06:37.429
and we go Jacob what's up?

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:40.099
We're gonna really fly this week
aren't we buddy.

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:42.568
I mean legit. I go Jacob's
what's up.

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:45.804
Christine goes this better be
good, you're interrupting

00:06:45.804 --> 00:06:49.308
Alice Cooper.
And Jacob, it's funny ...

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:52.545
bad reception for whatever
reason, we're not getting.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:07:00.152
He goes, yeah I was just,
email came and I don't know.

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:03.322
And I go wait Jacob wait
what's going on.

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:07.559
He's like, you tell me.

00:07:08.927 --> 00:07:10.896
We can't really hear you
very well, I'm going Jacob.

00:07:10.896 --> 00:07:12.765
Now me and Christine
are both thinking,

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.166
we found out later,
we were both thinking.

00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:16.669
I go is Jacob OD-ing?
Jacob's on drugs.

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:19.038
Jacob's on drugs and he doesn't
know what's going on.

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:20.673
It was like he must have
had a dream or ...

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:23.142
He had a weird mix
and he's calling us.

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:24.944
It also sounds
so discombobulated.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.846
Gotta get me out of the mud man.

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:29.115
The mud man's coming for me.
We're all falling.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.383
The mud man.

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:32.050
We're all falling
and everyone's sleeping.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.320
And I ain't ready
to go to sleep.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.988
I don't want to sleep forever.

00:07:37.022 --> 00:07:38.924
I want to wake up.
Please help me wake up.

00:07:38.924 --> 00:07:40.960
You need to drive
over here right now.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.061
Wake me up.

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:44.063
Bring me a Red Bull,
shoot me to space.

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:46.199
I need wings baby.

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:48.568
JB needs wings.

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:52.205
JB. JB needs his wings baby.

00:07:53.672 --> 00:07:59.211
He goes, very disturbing
email I got.

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:01.780
Still it's kinda loud
with the car

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.749
and I go disturbing email
you got?

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.217
I go what's wrong. He goes-

00:08:05.217 --> 00:08:07.186
Well he called me too.
So I'm like from me?

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:09.788
Is my email ...
I'm going through my emails.

00:08:09.788 --> 00:08:12.190
No the way he said it,
please why does no one trust

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.826
that I can just tell
this story the best.

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:15.961
I am looking at you listening.

00:08:15.961 --> 00:08:19.265
I know but this one jumps ahead,
that's what she does.

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.599
She's a momentum killer.

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:23.402
Let's kiss.
Get in here,

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.338
nothing that two tongues
knocking around won't change.

00:08:26.338 --> 00:08:27.573
It's just ridiculous. So-

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:29.208
It was a tempo changer.

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:31.510
He goes, I got a very disturbing
email. I go disturbing email?

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.146
I go well wait
a second from who?

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:39.819
It was like a horror movie.
I go from who? He goes from you.

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:41.787
And I went what?

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:43.388
I go, Christine bail
these cigarettes

00:08:43.388 --> 00:08:45.491
we gotta roll the windows up
and hear what this is happening.

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:48.127
Now pause the story right there.

00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:50.296
Now I want to go
to Jacob's perspective.

00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:54.166
When you called Jay, and I'm not
gonna say what happened.

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:56.968
When you called Jay and you know
it's a dire situation

00:08:56.968 --> 00:08:58.303
and you hear
Jay acting so ...

00:08:58.303 --> 00:08:59.839
His tone couldn't have
been happier.

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.873
It was the greatest day
of his life.

00:09:02.841 --> 00:09:04.410
And so was this
making you feel crazy?

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.878
Yeah.

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:08.380
Dude, it was Sunday.
We were eating shit all day.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.049
I said what did you do ...

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:12.818
but I don't want
to get in the story

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.486
but how could you be
in such a good mood?

00:09:14.486 --> 00:09:16.088
I went to a Sixer's game.

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:18.224
Eagles lost but that was
a hell of a season.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.659
Hell of a season.

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:22.194
Good job Eagles getting back
in the playoffs after losing.

00:09:22.194 --> 00:09:24.563
Yeah, I'll give an official
Nick Foles send off,

00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:28.367
fucking memorial
at some point.

00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:32.237
But overall just yeah, spent
the whole day with Isabella.

00:09:32.237 --> 00:09:35.240
We had fun. We dropped her off
back in Long Island.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.142
Good time listening
to music with her.

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:40.512
It's a good day, yeah,
that's the emotion he got.

00:09:40.912 --> 00:09:44.116
From you. I go wait,
bail these cigarettes,

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:45.651
roll these windows up,
now I gotta hear.

00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:48.120
The call is coming
from inside the house.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.122
Yes. That's the weirdest,
when he said that I go ...

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:51.891
I started thinking back-
It's you.

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:54.059
Now by the way, right away
I was going through my head

00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:56.461
I go if I sent
something weird or something.

00:09:57.229 --> 00:10:00.999
Like a voice memo accidentally
in your phone gets sent.

00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:03.001
Yes, now I'm like was something
sent accidentally

00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:06.338
that's like weird or something.
I've definitely ...

00:10:06.338 --> 00:10:09.308
I mean I don't sent
Christine dick pics,

00:10:09.308 --> 00:10:10.676
or send dick pics around.

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:13.445
You know what I mean?
I'm like what could this be

00:10:13.445 --> 00:10:15.414
and why would
that be disturbing anyway.

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:18.784
Who could it be now?

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:21.287
I'm in complete ... I'm like
what is he talking about.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:24.689
This is a mistake. Christine's
going through her phone looking.

00:10:24.689 --> 00:10:26.558
Did you get an email?

00:10:26.558 --> 00:10:27.793
No I didn't get an email.

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:32.164
He called me
so it was confusing.

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:33.799
Then all of the sudden
I was like,

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:36.235
I'm going into
Jay's sent folder.

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:38.237
You want me to read the email?

00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:39.871
No.

00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:41.072
Who do you want to read
the email?

00:10:41.072 --> 00:10:43.109
This is what Jacob
just says to me.

00:10:43.742 --> 00:10:45.610
He goes, from you.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:49.248
I go Jacob what are you talking,
I didn't email you.

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:51.516
I've never emailed you
I don't think even.

00:10:51.516 --> 00:10:53.752
I text you. And he goes-

00:10:54.386 --> 00:10:56.421
That's something
I wouldn't say baby.

00:10:56.421 --> 00:11:00.258
And all I hear is he goes,
it's an email saying

00:11:00.258 --> 00:11:03.862
that you had
a humongous fight with Jonas

00:11:03.862 --> 00:11:05.731
who's a big dog
Comedy Central.

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:06.898
Yeah, one of the top dogs.

00:11:06.898 --> 00:11:08.767
One of the top dogs.

00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:11.170
He goes you had
a big blow out with Jonas

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:15.174
and in the split second
my mind went from ...

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:19.211
when he said that I was like
my thing got hacked,

00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:21.213
something terrible.

00:11:21.213 --> 00:11:23.815
And I swear to you
in a split second I went huh,

00:11:23.815 --> 00:11:25.951
and started
laughing hysterically.

00:11:26.484 --> 00:11:29.388
And I go oh,
it just took me back

00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:36.394
to half time of the Eagles game,
they're up by four points.

00:11:36.394 --> 00:11:37.596
Yep 14-10.

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:40.031
They're up 14-10
and I'm like you know

00:11:40.031 --> 00:11:41.400
what,
they're losing momentum

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.801
but they're gonna
fix it at half time.

00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:44.136
They're gonna come back.

00:11:44.136 --> 00:11:46.839
I'm just alive
with hope and promise.

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:53.479
Already had seen
the Sixer's win live.

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:58.416
And I go oh half time
of the game,

00:11:58.416 --> 00:12:00.486
I go still looking good,
we're gonna be good.

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:03.856
Hey Christine you want to go
outside and smoke a cigarette.

00:12:04.356 --> 00:12:06.125
She goes yeah.

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:08.728
Ari Shaffir goes hey while
you guys are smoking a cigarette

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.297
can I use your laptop
for a minute.

00:12:12.564 --> 00:12:17.903
So in my mind I go,
had a fight with ... Ari.

00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:20.406
I go Ari completely ...

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.207
Jacob I don't know
what that email says

00:12:22.207 --> 00:12:24.543
and I don't want to know yet
but I'm just telling you

00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:28.247
that that's definitely
Ari Shaffir went into my email.

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:29.781
'Cause like an idiot
I gave him my computer

00:12:29.781 --> 00:12:32.017
thinking why would Ari go
through my personal email.

00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:33.418
Yeah, why would he do that?

00:12:33.418 --> 00:12:34.820
So this is fantastic.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.122
I want to explain, we'll read
the email in a second.

00:12:37.122 --> 00:12:39.158
'Cause I have it still unopened
because he sent it.

00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:40.392
Great.

00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:41.560
Now let me tell you.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.396
He sent it to the wrong
email address for me.

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:45.564
That's hilarious.

00:12:45.564 --> 00:12:47.966
So he sent it to a throw away
one that I have.

00:12:47.966 --> 00:12:50.135
So you didn't get a chance
to see it?

00:12:50.135 --> 00:12:51.336
So I didn't see it.

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:53.505
Well Jacob did see.

00:12:53.505 --> 00:12:55.140
You don't know what it says
either, neither do I.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:00.145
Christine read it.
But this is the best I go watch,

00:13:00.145 --> 00:13:01.747
let's go give him
his victory lap

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:03.182
'cause he left that grenade.

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:05.717
I bet he himself forgot
about it already.

00:13:05.717 --> 00:13:07.019
This is the best part.

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:09.355
I described what our night
was so far,

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:11.556
spending time with Isabella
and everything all day.

00:13:11.556 --> 00:13:14.292
We call Ari and put him
on three-way with Jacob.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.562
And Ari just starts
laughing right away.

00:13:17.562 --> 00:13:20.299
I go dude, I just want you
to understand

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:23.068
what you did worked wonderfully
because Jacob interrupted ...

00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:25.003
then I described the whole thing
I just described to you.

00:13:25.003 --> 00:13:26.505
Amazing night,
we're listening to music,

00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:29.307
and Jacob called and goes you
sent me the message.

00:13:29.307 --> 00:13:33.978
And he just starts cackling,
cackling laughing on the phone.

00:13:33.978 --> 00:13:35.280
And then he goes, yeah

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.917
and also I made it
a real teaching moment.

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:40.252
I went Isabella, you see
when someone hands you

00:13:40.252 --> 00:13:42.921
an opportunity
to do something like this.

00:13:42.921 --> 00:13:46.058
So Isabella completely aware,
didn't say a word all day.

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:47.793
Completely aware
that bomb's laying out there

00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:50.362
that she's gonna possibly
kill Jacob with anxiety.

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:53.065
So funny, and possibly me.
And it was aimed at me too.

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:54.466
I still don't know
what the email says.

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:57.536
We're gonna read it
right now on air.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.138
So what and we have
guests coming.

00:14:00.138 --> 00:14:01.640
But they're supposed
to be here at 7:00.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.508
What are you gonna do.
Stop panicking Jacob.

00:14:03.508 --> 00:14:04.676
I'm not panicking.

00:14:04.676 --> 00:14:05.844
You fucking nervous ass.

00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:07.079
I'm telling you.

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:09.047
Guys let's just flex it out.

00:14:09.047 --> 00:14:12.885
So yeah, who do you want
to read the email?

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:15.020
Maybe Christine.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.755
I'm completely out of nowhere.

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:19.224
Maybe Jacob, maybe Jacob's voice
reading will be so good

00:14:19.224 --> 00:14:23.362
because he read it
and it shot fear into him.

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:26.198
Yeah, and I can tell
by the first line,

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:27.733
if it is the same email
I got.

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:29.001
It is.
Oh it is.

00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:30.335
Okay, so it's a group email.
Perfect.

00:14:30.335 --> 00:14:31.837
He sent it to both of you.

00:14:31.837 --> 00:14:33.672
That's why when Christine
got on she panicked

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:35.140
and started telling you.

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:38.043
By the way then Christine's
anxiety kicks in hard

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:39.444
'cause she starts
going into panic mode.

00:14:39.444 --> 00:14:41.513
She goes well
what if Dan sees it.

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:43.581
I go what do you think
Dan's gonna do call Comedy

00:14:43.581 --> 00:14:45.550
Central before he calls us
to be like what happened?

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:46.685
Comedy Central, Dan

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:49.622
Soder, I just got
a nasty little email.

00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:53.392
I heard of a disagreement
between ...

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:55.594
The only words I heard was got

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:59.231
into a fight with Jonas
at Comedy Central.

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:01.567
And I just have an email
that says bad fucking news.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:02.835
Bad fucking news.

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:04.069
Is that the name of the email
?

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:05.203
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:15:05.203 --> 00:15:06.438
So Jacob's gonna read it?

00:15:06.438 --> 00:15:08.140
So why don't we read the email.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.842
He wrote it, I gotta say
give him credit, in your style.

00:15:10.842 --> 00:15:12.076
I could see you
writing like this.

00:15:12.076 --> 00:15:13.778
That's hilarious.

00:15:13.778 --> 00:15:16.148
It's just misspellings and
you spell like Corey Feldman.

00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:17.382
It's like R is AR.

00:15:17.382 --> 00:15:20.886
Got to be kicking ass
all the ...

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:22.120
Wasn't scared so much as anger

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.455
'cause I called
my brother before

00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:25.323
and I was like
what the fuck happened.

00:15:25.323 --> 00:15:27.259
I can't do it.
I can't do this.

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:28.660
You called your brother before?

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.395
What could he have
possibly said to this guy?

00:15:30.395 --> 00:15:33.064
Oh I don't know dude,
I have to hear this email.

00:15:33.798 --> 00:15:35.800
You're getting ahead,
I don't know what this thing is.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.269
Well the email goes ...

00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:42.608
It starts off saying we just
into a massive fight with Jonas

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:43.709
at Comedy Central.

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:45.778
He's threatening
to end the Bonfire.

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.912
I'm dealing with it
all right now with

00:15:47.912 --> 00:15:50.182
Ed Brooke

00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:52.517
but if they call
you don't say anything.

00:15:52.517 --> 00:15:54.653
Actually, don't even
take the call

00:15:54.653 --> 00:15:56.689
until I get a chance
to talk to you.

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:58.357
This is really fucking bad.

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:08.500
So this weekend
I checked Instagram

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.271
and I got a very long
DM that I was like ...

00:16:13.271 --> 00:16:14.906
It was a request.
I never check the requests

00:16:14.906 --> 00:16:17.008
but I checked the requests
and I was like what the fuck.

00:16:17.008 --> 00:16:18.477
You know I check them
once in a while.

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:20.245
I check them very rarely.
Let them build.

00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:21.946
Yeah, check them very rarely.

00:16:21.946 --> 00:16:23.681
So I'm checking it and I'm like
God this is fucking weird.

00:16:23.681 --> 00:16:26.451
What is this one?
It's this long fucking thing.

00:16:26.451 --> 00:16:28.387
At first I'm like someone's mad

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:30.189
so you have that reaction
of like what are you mad about.

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:31.623
It was mad for sure right away?

00:16:31.623 --> 00:16:32.825
Right away.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.193
How can you tell right away?

00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:38.464
Man. The exclamation
points are out of ...

00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:42.667
'Cause the subject was you
really fucked me on this one.

00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:44.036
Oh dude.

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.871
And it starts in such a way
that you're like already

00:16:46.871 --> 00:16:49.641
I can tell I can mentally
beat you in an argument.

00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:51.643
So immediately you're like
I understand they're mad.

00:16:51.643 --> 00:16:53.412
They're always like
some things aren't funny.

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:54.546
Yeah.

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:55.914
A line like that will always
make you go ...

00:16:55.914 --> 00:16:57.148
yeah, let's have
this argument.

00:16:57.148 --> 00:16:58.784
It just started
a couple days ago ...

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:00.552
oh dude this is just great,
I'll read the whole email.

00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:02.654
So then I'm like
this is fucking hilarious,

00:17:02.654 --> 00:17:04.690
I screen grab it.
I try to send it

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.593
but it's like six screen grabs
or I'd have to allow the message

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:09.361
and I'm not allowing
the message.

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:11.964
I'm not allowing this fucking
dork to get through.

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:14.967
So then I check my email
and this lady emailed my website

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.002
too with the same message,
just copy and pasted.

00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:20.772
So I was like beautiful.
Now I got it in one slick place

00:17:20.772 --> 00:17:23.008
where I can read it
on my radio show.

00:17:23.008 --> 00:17:24.543
Or as she calls it, my concert.

00:17:26.778 --> 00:17:27.946
So what it is is ...

00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:29.447
Wait your concerts?

00:17:29.447 --> 00:17:34.552
I did a joke on Conan
and at Live at Gotham years ago

00:17:34.552 --> 00:17:36.822
about Russians being
the scariest white people.

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:38.323
And then your world tour also.

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:41.393
And my world tour called
You Think This Bad Neighborhood.

00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:44.662
Nate Bargatze always used
to joke around

00:17:44.662 --> 00:17:46.665
that it was my Free Bird.
It was like the only good joke

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:48.800
I wrote
play Russian and you're like

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.102
I don't fucking play
that song no more.

00:17:51.102 --> 00:17:52.771
But you know I did it ...

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:54.873
Can we only call our shows
concerts from now on?

00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:56.274
Well let me read the email

00:17:56.274 --> 00:17:57.375
and you'll see
what she called a concert

00:17:57.375 --> 00:17:58.844
and it's fucking hilarious.

00:17:58.844 --> 00:18:00.645
I was gonna say can we call them
all concerts though.

00:18:00.645 --> 00:18:02.647
He goes guys if you want
to see me live in concert,

00:18:02.647 --> 00:18:03.881
I'll be ...

00:18:03.881 --> 00:18:05.917
Dude I'm gonna be live
in concert, yeah.

00:18:05.917 --> 00:18:08.386
Tomorrow night we're doing
a big concert

00:18:08.386 --> 00:18:11.156
where there's a bunch of
different performers coming out.

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:12.524
It's gonna be a hell
of a concert.

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:14.259
I'm going to do a concert
at Frantic.

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:15.660
I'm gonna be playing
on that concert.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.229
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a big concert.

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:18.463
And then we're gonna
have a thing

00:18:18.463 --> 00:18:20.131
at the Comedy Cellar Concert
Hall.

00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:21.533
Yeah, Comedy Cellar
Concert Hall.

00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:23.602
It's a big deal.
It's a real big deal.

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:26.171
So I'll just read
you the message.

00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:27.806
I won't read you
her name or anything

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:29.107
but this is fucking great.

00:18:29.107 --> 00:18:34.113
Let me get some Russian music
there Blue if you could.

00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:36.982
Dan Soder, couple of days ago

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:42.153
my kids complained that somebody
mocked them scary Russian.

00:18:42.153 --> 00:18:43.788
I didn't believe it.

00:18:43.788 --> 00:18:46.958
I live in Virginia
already about three years

00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:49.961
and we never ever had
this kind of problems.

00:18:50.528 --> 00:18:55.533
I think she's definitely Russian
because this is written

00:18:55.533 --> 00:18:57.969
in the broken English of a
Russian, or are you making ...

00:18:57.969 --> 00:18:59.170
Dude, I swear. No.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:00.805
Like you make big mistake.

00:19:00.805 --> 00:19:02.174
Dude, this is written.

00:19:02.174 --> 00:19:06.044
Okay. I'm intrigued.

00:19:06.044 --> 00:19:08.514
Listen, I'm a voice guy,
I love to joosh it up.

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:10.582
I love to bring it
more closer to me.

00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:12.784
This is just straight
fucking farm to table bud.

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:13.985
Love it.

00:19:13.985 --> 00:19:15.520
I'm just adding the accent.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.721
I'm just throwing
a little bit of parsley on it.

00:19:16.721 --> 00:19:17.922
F2T?

00:19:17.922 --> 00:19:19.358
F2T.

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:21.826
Later I turn on the radio
in my car

00:19:21.826 --> 00:19:24.529
and understood
what the problem is.

00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:26.731
You created this problem.

00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:31.102
It was an advertising
of your concert on the radio

00:19:31.102 --> 00:19:33.805
with "Russians are scary."

00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:37.709
My daughter was at the moment
in car with me.

00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:42.680
She started to cry
and ask me why am I scary?

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.419
She is six.
How I have to explain it to her.

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:51.389
How I have to explain
that we're not scary to friends

00:19:51.389 --> 00:19:54.326
and classmates of kids
to my neighbors.

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:56.361
To my coworkers?

00:19:58.329 --> 00:19:59.731
Question mark?

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:00.932
Yeah.

00:20:00.932 --> 00:20:02.700
Now I feel terrible.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.404
It is insult based
on nationality.

00:20:05.937 --> 00:20:09.141
You are nationalist
Dan Soder. Stop it.

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.210
You are nationalist?
Not a nationalist.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.445
You are nationalist.

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:14.913
You're nationalist.

00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:17.516
You are nationalist Dan Soder.
Stop it all caps.

00:20:17.949 --> 00:20:19.617
Wait when someone says
someone is a nationalist,

00:20:19.617 --> 00:20:21.419
does that mean
their racist condonations?

00:20:21.419 --> 00:20:22.754
Yeah, you can also call it

00:20:22.754 --> 00:20:24.656
Xenophobic, you can call it
a lot of things.

00:20:24.656 --> 00:20:26.124
But when they say
someone's a nationalist

00:20:26.124 --> 00:20:27.993
isn't that what the ...
is that what they mean?

00:20:27.993 --> 00:20:29.461
Yeah, I think so.

00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:32.464
Like it's the same ist
as racist? Or sexist?

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:33.998
Yeah, it's got an ist in it
so it's ...

00:20:33.998 --> 00:20:35.900
I've never put those things
together in my life.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.902
Maybe it's the dumbest thing
I ever said out loud.

00:20:37.902 --> 00:20:39.470
No it's okay.
But nationalist?

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.206
Dude I call the receipt
a recipe.

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:45.076
You know what then, if I could
take these gloves off

00:20:45.076 --> 00:20:46.878
I'd clap right now.
But they're part of me.

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:48.346
Yeah.

00:20:48.346 --> 00:20:50.148
I don't know if you know,
I had them sewed into my skin.

00:20:50.148 --> 00:20:52.817
Well she goes on to explain what
she thinks a nationalist is.

00:20:52.817 --> 00:20:53.818
Hell yeah.

00:20:53.818 --> 00:20:55.954
You can't insult
and blame people

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:57.856
only because
of their nationality,

00:20:58.323 --> 00:21:02.026
only because they are Russian.
So according to you, Dan

00:21:02.026 --> 00:21:05.130
Soder, Russians are
the scariest white people.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:09.300
I'm Russian. I've got PhD degree
and I speak three languages.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.569
Not well.

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:13.738
My husband was U.S. Navy
for many years.

00:21:13.738 --> 00:21:16.742
He is a submariner.
I mean that's hilarious.

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:18.410
Submariner.

00:21:19.644 --> 00:21:22.113
I'm Russian language professor
here in Virginia

00:21:22.113 --> 00:21:23.115
and I'm not scary.

00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:25.083
She's certainly not
an English professor.

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:26.351
Yeah.

00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:27.986
My daughter is six
and her classroom

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:31.289
teacher said in her grade report
she is just sweet little girl.

00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:33.358
Like she's writing
in the grade report against me.

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:34.559
Wow.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.194
It's like you stupid shit head,

00:21:36.194 --> 00:21:39.731
this is a joke that I did on
Conan fucking eight years ago.

00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:43.435
This is the best. She started
to play piano this year.

00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:46.838
She's Russian
and she's not scary.

00:21:46.838 --> 00:21:48.673
I want that to be
the new catchphrase.

00:21:48.673 --> 00:21:50.108
Russians playing piano is scary.

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:51.243
It's terrifying.

00:21:51.243 --> 00:21:52.544
It's terrifying, yeah.

00:21:52.544 --> 00:21:53.878
Empty a house out
and just put a piano

00:21:53.878 --> 00:21:55.513
with a little Russian girl
playing piano.

00:21:55.513 --> 00:21:57.215
I won't believe
she's not a ghost.

00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:58.649
I'll leave before I check.

00:21:58.649 --> 00:22:00.318
Yeah, oh you want
another ghost like scenario.

00:22:00.318 --> 00:22:01.652
How about this one.

00:22:01.652 --> 00:22:03.888
My son is 13.
He is trying his best to-

00:22:03.888 --> 00:22:07.658
He walks in circle in corner
of dimly lit room

00:22:07.658 --> 00:22:10.428
wearing school boy uniform
from many years ago.

00:22:10.428 --> 00:22:14.432
He sings song and when you try
to listen it turns to scream.

00:22:14.432 --> 00:22:15.667
Is he scary.

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:17.769
He's constantly shushing you

00:22:17.769 --> 00:22:21.172
and telling you if you
make noise it will get us.

00:22:21.739 --> 00:22:23.208
That's scary to you?

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:27.545
He turns his head backwards
and crawls like animal.

00:22:27.545 --> 00:22:29.480
Is he not scary to you?

00:22:30.381 --> 00:22:34.686
He's stare you in eye while you
watch him choke dog to death.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.022
That strike you as terrify?

00:22:38.022 --> 00:22:42.326
He climb up side of wall,
right along ceiling.

00:22:42.326 --> 00:22:44.062
Is that scary to you?

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.834
You watch him bite bullet
out of his own hand.

00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:53.872
You find that not to be
family boy but to be scary?

00:22:56.007 --> 00:22:57.675
So it says ...

00:22:58.976 --> 00:23:02.914
Watch your back Dan Soder.
Anyways, what I'm saying is,

00:23:02.914 --> 00:23:05.116
you'll never know
when I'll strike.

00:23:05.116 --> 00:23:06.618
I'll find you.

00:23:07.218 --> 00:23:10.287
Sleep well on your Sleep Number.
How does she know that?

00:23:10.688 --> 00:23:12.123
She must be
a consistent listener.

00:23:12.123 --> 00:23:13.825
We haven't had them
as sponsors for years.

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:16.495
Christine probably gave
your address out over the air.

00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:18.496
That's his phone number
and his address.

00:23:18.496 --> 00:23:20.231
You got it all.

00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:21.432
This is Trish's address.

00:23:21.432 --> 00:23:22.934
But thank goodness for

00:23:22.934 --> 00:23:27.505
security cameras.
You come for my mom you get got.

00:23:27.505 --> 00:23:29.440
You got to get got.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.975
So it ends like this.

00:23:30.975 --> 00:23:32.477
She's talking about her son.

00:23:32.477 --> 00:23:34.045
Because English
is second language.

00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:35.480
He loves our dog.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.284
He is Russian
and he is not scary.

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:41.819
Sometimes he love dog too much

00:23:41.819 --> 00:23:44.256
which is concerning
but not scary.

00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:47.959
Not scary. He says dog
is friend and lover?

00:23:49.361 --> 00:23:50.528
Anyways ...

00:23:50.528 --> 00:23:52.230
Romantic, not scary.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:57.469
Not scary. Sensual, against
rules of society, not scary.

00:23:58.069 --> 00:24:01.806
Little off the grid,
you know off the reservation

00:24:01.806 --> 00:24:04.809
they say, but not scary.

00:24:04.809 --> 00:24:06.711
I say different strokes
for different folks.

00:24:07.211 --> 00:24:08.746
No scary.

00:24:08.746 --> 00:24:10.648
I have friends in Richmond.
I won't call names.

00:24:10.648 --> 00:24:13.918
She's a student in Richmond
University and he's a doctor.

00:24:13.918 --> 00:24:16.254
Her name is Boris Yolchelsky.

00:24:16.254 --> 00:24:19.758
Her name is Olga ...

00:24:20.191 --> 00:24:21.793
... that's I don't know,
she's Swedish.

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:23.995
He's working at hospital
intensive therapy department.

00:24:23.995 --> 00:24:26.631
He's saving people's
lives every single day.

00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:30.936
They are Russian
and they are not scary.

00:24:33.204 --> 00:24:38.676
My friend from Portsmith
is an operationist at bank.

00:24:38.676 --> 00:24:40.945
She has very cute
little daughter.

00:24:40.945 --> 00:24:45.083
They are Russian
and they are not scary.

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:46.751
They are not scary.

00:24:47.318 --> 00:24:51.957
Not scary, not Russian
are scary, you are scary.

00:24:51.957 --> 00:24:53.458
Dan Soder scary.

00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:55.259
You are the scariest white man.

00:24:55.259 --> 00:24:57.195
She said it so it's
fucking cred right here.

00:24:57.195 --> 00:24:58.396
Wow.

00:24:58.396 --> 00:25:00.498
Yeah, guess what pinkies,
you got a new king

00:25:00.498 --> 00:25:01.932
and his name is Danny Sodes.

00:25:01.932 --> 00:25:04.002
If you don't get the words
scary written

00:25:04.002 --> 00:25:05.703
across the top
of your back in crazy

00:25:05.703 --> 00:25:06.905
Gothic letters dude.

00:25:06.905 --> 00:25:09.574
Oh my God, yeah bro,
with knives.

00:25:09.574 --> 00:25:12.043
Like really Gothic,
the word scary.

00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:14.546
Oh dude, the eye is a knife.

00:25:15.046 --> 00:25:17.248
So the A's in the middle,
you could make the A something.

00:25:17.248 --> 00:25:19.650
Anarchy because
you can't hold me.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:24.155
Oh so the words, S and C
in old crazy block,

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.593
crazy shadowing in them,
Gothic letters.

00:25:28.593 --> 00:25:30.395
And then the A
is an anarchy symbol.

00:25:30.395 --> 00:25:31.863
Fucking rad dude.

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:34.165
And then the R and Y
are back to the Gothic shit.

00:25:34.165 --> 00:25:36.534
Oh man come get some.
Come get some of that.

00:25:36.534 --> 00:25:38.970
If you don't get it
there's a chance I might get it.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.538
Gosh I wish
I was the scariest white guy.

00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:41.740
Well you know what-

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:42.974
She took it as a fucking insult

00:25:42.974 --> 00:25:45.109
but now I wish
I was dubbed with that.

00:25:45.109 --> 00:25:47.011
She told me
I should apologize.

00:25:48.112 --> 00:25:50.415
I've been told I'm the fattest
guy a girl would fuck.

00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:51.983
That's pretty cool.

00:25:51.983 --> 00:25:53.485
But that's ...
You can't even make an acronym

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:54.786
that makes that work
across my back.

00:25:54.786 --> 00:25:55.953
Yeah you can. Yeah.
What?

00:25:55.953 --> 00:25:57.288
Cushion for the pushin'.

00:25:57.288 --> 00:25:58.656
Yeah, but where's
the anarchy part?

00:25:58.656 --> 00:25:59.824
Where's the anarchy sign go?

00:25:59.824 --> 00:26:01.092
One of the U's?

00:26:01.092 --> 00:26:03.361
Cushion for the pushin'
across my back.

00:26:04.061 --> 00:26:07.131
Cushion number four, DA pushin'.

00:26:07.131 --> 00:26:09.166
And the four is also
an anarchy sign.

00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:12.671
We solve problems
at the Bonfire.
