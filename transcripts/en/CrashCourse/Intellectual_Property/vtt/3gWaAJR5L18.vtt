Hi! I'm Stan Muller, this is Crash Course Intellectual
Property, and today we're talking about trademarks.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.880
Trademarks are everywhere, and they can often be confusing, so today we're gonna talk about

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.899
why just about everything seems to be trademarked,
and why trademarks are good for business.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.080
Mr. Muler! Trademarks don't intersect with my life,
so I really don't see why we need to cover this.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.700
One, its Muller, and two, just watch the video.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:29.320
[Theme Music]

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.760
A trademark is any word, name, symbol, or
device, used to identify and distinguish goods

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.680
from those manufactured or sold by others,
and to indicate the source of the goods, even

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.340
if that source is unknown. This bit about
unknown sources means that you, as a consumer

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.160
don't usually know the person or factory that
actually made the goods you buy.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.380
Before the industrial revolution, you often
knew exactly who was making your stuff, and

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.050
how it was made. If you wanted a hammer, you
went to the blacksmith, and you knew his name.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.280
It was probably Smith.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.379
These days, brand names assure you that you're
buying the same product, say toilet paper,

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.789
that you bought last time you went shopping.
You know, like the stuff with the ripples.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.840
Seriously though, getting the wrong medication
because of brand name confusion or counterfeiting

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.700
could be disastrous. The rational for granting
legal protection for trademarks is that they're

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.650
a type of property -- it demonstrates to the
purchasing public a standard of quality and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.670
embodies the good will and advertising investment
of its owner.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.610
In other words, companies expend a tremendous
amount of resources to develop the product,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.670
market it to customers, and provide customer
support, and back up their product with warranties.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.080
At its core, trademark law functions like a consumer
protection measure. It prevents consumer confusion,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.020
and makes it easier for consumers to select and
purchase the goods and services they want.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.180
For example, if you go shopping for a new
television, you don't have to sift through

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.420
dozens of products that are confusingly similar to Samsung. Knockoffs like Samsong or Wamsung or Sony.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.500
You want the Samsung, maybe based on past experience, or the company's reputation, or even a funny ad.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.040
Because the law protects the manufacturer's
use of the trademark, you can be reasonably

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.060
sure that the TV you're picking up at Best
Buy is the TV you saw the Verge reporters

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.380
freaking out about at CES. Though trademarks
are often classified as intellectual property,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.180
the Supreme Court held, in the 1879 trademark
cases, that Congress has no power to protect

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.720
or regulate trademarks under the intellectual
property clause of the Constitution. Which,

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.510
as you'll recall, provides congress with the
authority to regulate and protect copyrights

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.940
and patents. But this didn't stop congress
from regulating trademarks - they used the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.370
commerce clause of the constitution which
gives them the power to regulate commerce

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.170
with foreign nations, and among the several
states, and with the Indian tribes.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.480
Beyond trademarks, there are also service
marks, which are very similar in that they

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.860
distinguish one particular service. An example
of a service mark is that roaring lion at

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.840
the beginning of MGM movies - it's registered
for motion picture production or something.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.040
Trade dress or product packaging is protected
if it's distinctive and nonfunctional. Like,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.840
the shape of a nutter-butter cookie is protected
trade dress. What they oughta trademark is

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.580
the smell. Some people have registered smells,
but we'll get to that in a minute.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.900
Trademarks are symbols, and since human beings
might use as a symbol or device almost anything

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.860
that is capable of carrying meaning, just
about anything conceivable thing can function

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.210
as a trademark. Trademarks can be words like
Kraft or Lego, logos, designs like the Nike

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.150
swoosh, aromas, like there's a brand of oil
for race cars that smells like cherries, sounds

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.780
like:
*to the tune of the NBC ad* bong bong bong

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.210
or *to the tune of the T Mobile ad* ba da
da da dong

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.770
or *to the tune of the Intel ad* dong dong
dong dong

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.930
or *to the tune of the McDonald's ad* ba da
ba ba baaaa.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.320
Even *in the manner of Homer Simpson* "Doh!"
is a registered trademark.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.730
You can register colors like UPS brown or
Home Depot orange or Tiffany blue or John

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.190
Deere green, personal names like Taylor Swift
- T Swizzy's name is registered for 61 different

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.590
goods and services, from shoes to Christmas
tree ornaments. Even containers like the Coca-cola

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.520
bottle or this perfume bottle shaped like
a human skull can be registered. In short

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.490
they can be almost anything that distinguishes
the product from others and which signifies

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.910
the source of the goods.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.530
Despite the breadth of potential trademark
subject matter, there are some limits on what

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.970
can be a valid trademark. Recently, a restaurant
in Texas asserted trademark rights in the

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.480
flavor of it's pizza. One of the restaurants
former employees allegedly stole the recipe

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.600
and opened up a competing pizza joint, selling
pizzas that tasted a lot like those made by

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.670
his former employers. The judge rejected the
claim and dismissed the case, finding that

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.390
it is unlikely that flavors can ever be inherently
distinctive because they do not automatically

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.200
suggest a product's source. Also, functional
product features are not protectable under

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.390
trademark law. Pizza has only one function
- and that's to taste delicious.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.410
So, there are three requirements for trademarks.
We just discussed the first one - that a trademark

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.160
has to be a symbol or a device that a court
or the patent and trademark office deems to

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.150
qualify. The second requirement is that the
mark has to be used in interstate commerce,

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.450
and the third is that it has to identify the
mark owners goods and distinguish them from

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.540
those manufactured or sold by others. It has
to be distinctive.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.660
Let's talk about trademarks and what makes
them distinctive in the Thought Bubble.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.840
Courts rank trademark distinctiveness along
a spectrum, ranging from unprotectable to

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.310
highly protectable. At the bottom end of the
spectrum is generic. Generic names refer to

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.330
stuff like using the word orange for the fruit
or dog for the canine or cheese for... cheese.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.770
Descriptive terms simply describe the goods
and convey an immediate idea of what the product

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.530
is, such as "break and bake" for scored cookie
dough.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.580
Suggestive marks require some imagination
or perception to link them to the goods, like

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.840
Sheikh for middle eastern food or Froot Loops
for circular fruit flavored breakfast cereal.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.880
Arbitrary marks are commonly used words used
in unexpected ways - Apple for computers,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.620
or Amazon for book sales, or Shell for gasoline.
The most distinctive marks are usually made

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.220
up words. Fanciful marks are non dictionary
words such as Google for an internet search

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.120
engine, or Clorox for bleach, or Kodak for
film.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.460
Fanciful, arbitrary, and suggestive marks
receive automatic protection upon use because

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.560
they are considered to be inherently distinctive.
So the owner of the break 'n bake mark has

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.750
to show that the consumers identify the product
with Nabisco or Pillsbury or whoever makes

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.250
the product. I honestly don't know who makes
it, which isn't a good sign as to whether

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.800
it's acquired secondary meaning.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.920
Generic terms are never entitled to protection.
This becomes important when trademarks are

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.660
gradually assimilated into the language as
common names. Through a process sometimes

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.280
called "genericide," the public comes to view
such names as referring to the products themselves

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.070
rather than as distinguishing the source of
the products. As a result, the name loses

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.910
its protection. Words like escalator, cellophane,
and aspirin were all once protected by trademark.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.060
This process is ongoing today and there are
a lot of modern marks that are threatened

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.870
by genericide, like Google or Kleenex or Photoshop
or Xerox. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.280
So, once an owner meets the requirements for
trademark and has a protected product they'll

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.550
often put a TM or a little r in a circle next
to a product name or brand. The TM shows that

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.440
the owner is asserting trademark in the product.
When you see the little circle r, that means

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.530
the trademark has been registered with the
US patent and trademark office. Like in copyright

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.010
law, one you're registered with the feds,
you have standing to take your case to federal

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.010
court and maybe be awarded damages. Once the
PTO is satisfied that the mark meets all the

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.960
requirements the application is published
for opposition. Anyone who might be affected

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.450
by the registration has 30 days to oppose
it. If no one opposes, the mark is registered!

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.389
The owner is then required to file affidavits
of continuous use -- basically you have to

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:47.110
submit proof you are still selling the product
associated with the trademark. You have to

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.740
do this every five years to maintain the registration.
Trademark owners can do this forever. This

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.730
is different than patents and copyrights,
whose trademarks are DOOMED by the limited

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.340
times language in the intellectual property
clause.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.860
So when it comes to trademarks, you have to
use it or lose it.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.860
Trademarks are often disputed, and in pretty
much every case, likelihood of confusion is

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:12.120
the central issue. The principles set forth in an 1877
Supreme Court opinion in an unfair competition case:

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.430
"What degree of resemblance is necessary to
constitute an infringement is incapable of

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.300
exact definition, as applicable to all cases.
All that courts of justice can do, that regard,

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.940
is to say that no trader can adopt a trade-mark,
so resembling that of another trader, as that

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.840
ordinary purchasers, buying with ordinary caution,
are likely to be misled."

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.320
Every court uses a slightly different set
of criteria for deciding trademark cases.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.720
We're going to talk about the 7th Circuit Court of the
United States' definition, which has seven parts.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.280
Those criteria are: One, similarity between
the marks in appearance and suggestion.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.640
Two, similarity of the products.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.070
Three, the area and manner of concurrent use,

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.680
which means where in the United States the product is for sale.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.300
Four, the degree of care likely to be exercised
by the consumers.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.660
Five, the strength of the plaintiff's mark
or how distinctive it is.

00:07:57.669 --> 00:08:01.169
Six, whether there is evidence that people
were actually confused, which is a pretty

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:03.740
strong sign that there's a likelihood of confusion.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.830
And seven, whether the defendant intended
to palm off his product as that of the plaintiff.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.050
These factors are going to be weighed differently
in individual cases, but the court has often

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.639
noted that the similarity of the marks, the
defendant's intent, and evidence of actual

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:20.520
confusion are of particular importance. In
addition, the Seventh Circuit has held that

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.320
a court may consider other relevant factors
such as the party's marketing channels and

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.290
whether a trademark is being used in a parody.
Trademark protection is also available under

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:33.660
certain circumstances, even in the absence of likely or
actual confusion. The Federal Trademark Dilution Act

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.200
benefits only famous trademarks trademarks against
a weakening of their valuable distinctive quality.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:43.030
There are two basic types of dilution: dilution
by blurring, and dilution by tarnishment.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.880
Dilution by blurring happens when a similar
trademark chips away at the distinctiveness

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.200
of a famous trademark. For example, someone
selling Apple brand toilet seats or bulldozers

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.460
will blur the ability of Apple to identify
a single source, even if people buying that

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:00.070
stuff didn't think Apple computer made their
bulldozer. Dilution by tarnishment happens

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.670
when similarity between a mark or trade name
and a famous mark harms the reputation of

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:08.550
the famous mark. For example, and this is
a real case, the guy that uses the trade name

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.360
Victor's Little Secret for his store selling
sex related products is likely to tarnish

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.730
the famous Victoria's Secret mark. There's
no real risk of confusion here, but the company

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.440
Victoria's Secret is seeking to prevent the
gradual tarnishing of their mark. One major

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.540
issue with dilution is that famous trademarks
are hard to come by. While there are super

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.340
marks, like IBM, Google, Budweiser, Microsoft,
courts have typically been hesitant to find

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.520
less well known trademarks to be famous. It's
not like YouTube or something, where you can

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:39.260
be kind of famous, your trademark has to be
really, actually, IRL famous to attain this status.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.760
Trademarks are fascinating, regardless of
whether you are someone who enjoys strolling

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.790
through the shopping mall with logos firmly
affixed to your bags and coffee and clothes,

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.370
or whether you believe brands and trademarks
have become so powerful that they have been

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:55.000
internalized by modern society and dictate
our aspirations, our self image and our lifestyles.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.450
As we've watched Don Draper and James Bond
conspicuously guzzle Heinekens, maybe we worry

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:04.930
that brands are controlling and corrupting our creative
content. Regardless, trademarks are ubiquitous.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:09.020
Trademarks help us make sound decisions about
the products we need and want. They protect

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.490
us from knock off goods and allow us to go
about the daily business of our lives more

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:17.260
quickly and more efficiently so that we can
sit down tune our Samsung television to PBS

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.640
on our Comcast cable tuner, watch the season
finale of Downton Abbey, brought to you by

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.920
Viking River Cruise Lines and Ralph Lauren.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.860
Thanks for watching, and as they say in Hank
and John's hometown, don't forget to be awesome.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.920
Which is not a registered trademark. Which
is how this happened:

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.060
Tell either Eleanor or Alice not to forget
to be awesome.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.500
Oh! Thank you, sir!

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.620
Crash Course Intellectual Property is filmed

Speaking of Patreon, we'd like to thank our
Headmaster of Learning Thomas Frank and our

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:04.830
Vice Principals Kathy and Tim Philip and Linnea
Boyev. Thank you so much for supporting Crash

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.360
Course. You can get awesome rewards for your
support. You cannot get ownership of the Crash

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.220
Course copyright, but you can get the satisfaction
of helping people learn.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.480
Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week.
