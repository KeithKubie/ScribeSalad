00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.370
To continue, we are in fact interested in four different quantities.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.430
One is a true positive.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.030
A true negative.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.780
A false positive.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.480
And a false negative.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.440
What this picture shows us here is actually what is called the confusion matrix.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.210
This is called a confusion matrix because it makes it easy to tell whether

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.130
the classifier is confusing the positives with the negatives.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.640
So here, the actual cases of negatives are on the top, or the x direction,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.850
and the predicted cases by the classifiers are in this side here.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.550
So true positive is an actual positive that has been predicted to be positive.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.670
Similarly, a true negative is an actual negative that has

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.100
been predicted to be negative.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.250
Now, you can also have false positives.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.650
These are also known as type I errors.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:07.770
In this case, an actual negative is classified or predicted to be positive.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.390
Similarly, you can also have false negatives.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.750
They're also known as type II errors.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.250
In this case, an actual positive is predicted to be negative.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.780
In the next video, we are going to define a few

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.750
performance metrics based on these concepts we just defined.
