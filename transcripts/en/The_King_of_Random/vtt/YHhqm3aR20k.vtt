00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.530
Have you noticed that when your garbage starts
getting full, there’s a point where the

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.859
bag slips off the edges and messes everything
up? Not only does it look terrible and get

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.770
in the way, but the bag’s usually so heavy,
you can’t get it to hold back on.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.770
So for this video I’m going to show you
a cool little trick to save you this weekly

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.870
frustration, by repurposing a handful of hanging
hooks.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.140
All you need for this household hack, are
two common “command hooks”, which you

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.110
can probably find at any grocery, or home
improvement store.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.880
Stick the hooks onto your trash-can so they’re
upside down, and halfway down the sides.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.820
Then double-check you secured them with the
hooks pointing upward, because this won’t

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.829
work properly, if they’re the other way
around. Now believe it or not, you’re done.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.899
Simply line your bin, with a fresh, handle-tie
trash bag, and loop the handles over the convenient

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.130
hooks you just made, on either side.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.720
As easy as that, your trash bags will hold
neatly in place, making the chore of taking

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.450
out the garbage a lot less revolting, because
now, when your garbage starts filling up and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.800
getting heavy, your bag won’t fall into
the can and make a mess like it did before.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.960
Instead, it’ll hold strong, and neatly handle
even more garbage, than it did before.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.510
Now taking out the trash, is so much cleaner
and easier this way as well.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.729
Simply unhook the handles from the sides,
and you’ll instantly have a lot more clean

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.969
plastic at the top, when it’s time to tie
it off, and take it out.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:13.549
Well now you know how to dodge the frustrations
of garbage can gloom, by repurposing common

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.170
hanging hooks, into nifty, bag handle holders.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.340
And while you’re down there doing the dirty
work, why not try drilling a few holes into

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.619
the bottom of your garbage cans as well?

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.709
Little vents like these will prevent any suction
from building up between the bags and the

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:28.420
cans, so your trash sacks will pull out easily,
when you need them to.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.310
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this
video, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
