unemployment rate has come down by
 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.370
unemployment rate has come down by
almost five percentage points and the

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380
almost five percentage points and the

almost five percentage points and the
economy has only grown at below two and

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460
economy has only grown at below two and
 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.800
economy has only grown at below two and
a half percent so it has to be the case

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810
a half percent so it has to be the case
 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.050
a half percent so it has to be the case
that much or most of that growth is

that much or most of that growth is
 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.219
that much or most of that growth is

cyclical coming with the five percentage
 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.950
cyclical coming with the five percentage
point reduction in unemployment and so

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960
point reduction in unemployment and so
 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.590
point reduction in unemployment and so
if the growth is two and a half percent

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600
if the growth is two and a half percent
 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.400
if the growth is two and a half percent
and even half of it is cyclical and one

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410
and even half of it is cyclical and one
 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.940
and even half of it is cyclical and one
can make a case that more of it is

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950
can make a case that more of it is
 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.540

slow economic growth going forward and
 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.900
slow economic growth going forward and
if that's right why didn't the economics

little bit harder to understand and you
 

00:19:08.659 --> 00:19:10.659
little bit harder to understand and you
know to some degree there anything that

fallen by falling from two-thirds to
 

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.910

at the very bottom um and look at
 

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.440

00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919
people don't think we've delivered for
 

00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:57.500
people don't think we've delivered for
the poor but they think we care about

the poor but they think we care about
 

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.950

fifty two hundred billion dollars you
can do important things for poverty and

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:44.110
can do important things for poverty and
 

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.169
can do important things for poverty and
we are and will do more of those things

00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:46.179
we are and will do more of those things
 

00:23:46.179 --> 00:23:49.710
we are and will do more of those things
but what about the inequality that is an

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:49.720
but what about the inequality that is an
 

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.769
but what about the inequality that is an
important part of why middle-class

so so having tried to narrow your
question down to poverty let me broaden

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:01.330
question down to poverty let me broaden
 

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.840
question down to poverty let me broaden
it to income as a whole because I think

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:03.850
it to income as a whole because I think
 

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:05.789
it to income as a whole because I think
it is really important to understand

00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:05.799
it is really important to understand
 

00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:09.450
it is really important to understand
that that's 0.4 percent growth isn't

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:09.460
that that's 0.4 percent growth isn't
 

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.049
that that's 0.4 percent growth isn't
just because of the rise in inequality

just because of the rise in inequality
 

00:24:13.059 --> 00:24:16.139
just because of the rise in inequality
oh that's an important part of it in the

00:24:16.139 --> 00:24:16.149
oh that's an important part of it in the
 

00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:17.880
oh that's an important part of it in the
last economic report of the president we

then after a decade or two that really

00:25:31.289 --> 00:25:31.299
then after a decade or two that really
 

00:25:31.299 --> 00:25:33.810

now which is that we have that high rate

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:30.530
now which is that we have that high rate

now which is that we have that high rate
we don't collect a lot of revenue

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:31.970
we don't collect a lot of revenue
 

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:33.940
we don't collect a lot of revenue
because we have a lot of loopholes our

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:33.950
because we have a lot of loopholes our

you heavily but it doesn't actually tax
 

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:40.480
you heavily but it doesn't actually tax
you at all so it's a combination of

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:40.490
you at all so it's a combination of
 

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:42.700
you at all so it's a combination of

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:42.710
distortion without what you'd normally
 

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:44.800
distortion without what you'd normally
get in exchange for distortion which is

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:44.810
get in exchange for distortion which is
 

00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:47.650
get in exchange for distortion which is
some revenue and so I think reforming

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:47.660
some revenue and so I think reforming
 

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.180
some revenue and so I think reforming
the business tax system to bring that

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:49.190
the business tax system to bring that
 

00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:51.280
the business tax system to bring that
rate down address some of those

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:51.290
rate down address some of those
 

00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:54.340
rate down address some of those
loopholes and have an international tax

00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:54.350
loopholes and have an international tax
 

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:55.630

00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:55.640
system that's more globally competitive
 

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:59.920
system that's more globally competitive
and better at a roading our tax base is

00:55:59.920 --> 00:55:59.930
and better at a roading our tax base is
 

00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:01.330
and better at a roading our tax base is
a step I think would be very important

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:01.340

01:08:57.510 --> 01:09:00.560
their views on what the consequences of
immigration are and I think the ability

immigration are and I think the ability
 

01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:03.080
immigration are and I think the ability
of American universities to have

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:03.090
of American universities to have
 

01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:05.540
of American universities to have
professors who do studies like that and

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:05.550
professors who do studies like that and
 

01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:09.590
professors who do studies like that and
the ability of our system to have

contributes to our having substantially

contributes to our having substantially
 

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:29.220
contributes to our having substantially
better economic policy and therefore

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:29.230
better economic policy and therefore
 

01:09:29.230 --> 01:09:32.669
better economic policy and therefore
substantially better outcomes than would

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:32.679
substantially better outcomes than would

thousand nine and ten we did a huge
amount and because of that I think we're

01:09:48.569 --> 01:09:48.579
amount and because of that I think we're
 

01:09:48.579 --> 01:09:50.910
amount and because of that I think we're
very much out of the crisis we're not

01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:50.920
very much out of the crisis we're not
 

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.439

further from being fully recovered we
 

01:10:03.909 --> 01:10:06.779
further from being fully recovered we
have more work to do on all of those but

01:10:06.779 --> 01:10:06.789
have more work to do on all of those but
 

01:10:06.789 --> 01:10:09.149
have more work to do on all of those but
we're way past on the crisis phase and

really well for a while now and figuring
 

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:41.880
really well for a while now and figuring
out how to translate that understanding
