picture given that he has felt annoyed
 

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.840
picture given that he has felt annoyed
with the Americans leaving him out of

incidents of involving American forces

00:23:11.779 --> 00:23:11.789
incidents of involving American forces
 

00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:13.909
incidents of involving American forces
the American soldiers urinating on the

00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919
the American soldiers urinating on the
 

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:16.190

the Koran and this recent incident Orton
 

00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:21.409
the Koran and this recent incident Orton

or each one of these incidents could
 

00:23:21.419 --> 00:23:23.299
or each one of these incidents could
have led to the Taliban suspending talks

00:23:23.299 --> 00:23:23.309
have led to the Taliban suspending talks
 

00:23:23.309 --> 00:23:25.610
have led to the Taliban suspending talks
but they didn't and I think that was a

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620
but they didn't and I think that was a
 

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.600
but they didn't and I think that was a
very you know it is a very pointed thing

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:29.610
very you know it is a very pointed thing
 

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:31.759
very you know it is a very pointed thing
that the Taliban did they kept the talks

00:23:31.759 --> 00:23:31.769
that the Taliban did they kept the talks
 

00:23:31.769 --> 00:23:33.889
that the Taliban did they kept the talks

00:23:33.889 --> 00:23:33.899
moving I mean even through this last
 

00:23:33.899 --> 00:23:35.269
moving I mean even through this last
couple of months of these incidents

00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:35.279
couple of months of these incidents
 

00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:37.430
couple of months of these incidents
happening they condemned the incidence

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440
happening they condemned the incidence
 

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.899
happening they condemned the incidence
of course and were very brutal and said

00:23:38.899 --> 00:23:38.909
of course and were very brutal and said
 

00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:40.789
of course and were very brutal and said
you know we behead the Americans and we

00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799
you know we behead the Americans and we
 

00:23:40.799 --> 00:23:42.470
you know we behead the Americans and we
will kill them if we see them in all the

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480
will kill them if we see them in all the
 

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.180
will kill them if we see them in all the
necessary but they did not suspend at

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:44.190
necessary but they did not suspend at
 

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.220
necessary but they did not suspend at
all now they have suspended the talks

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:46.230
all now they have suspended the talks
 

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.440
all now they have suspended the talks
and that has a lot to do with the

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:48.450
and that has a lot to do with the
 

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:51.529
and that has a lot to do with the
slowness of the Obama administration in

00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:51.539
slowness of the Obama administration in
 

00:23:51.539 --> 00:23:54.249
slowness of the Obama administration in
really responding to the first

00:23:54.249 --> 00:23:54.259
really responding to the first
 

00:23:54.259 --> 00:23:56.269
really responding to the first
confidence-building measure which has

00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:56.279
confidence-building measure which has
 

00:23:56.279 --> 00:23:58.940
confidence-building measure which has
been this exchange of prisoners

00:23:58.940 --> 00:23:58.950
been this exchange of prisoners
 

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.490
been this exchange of prisoners
essentially between the Taliban and the

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.500
essentially between the Taliban and the
 

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.249
essentially between the Taliban and the
Americans and this has been pending for

00:24:04.249 --> 00:24:04.259
Americans and this has been pending for
 

00:24:04.259 --> 00:24:05.720
Americans and this has been pending for
the last three or four months and there

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:05.730
the last three or four months and there
 

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.820
the last three or four months and there
doesn't seem to be very much progress i

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:07.830
doesn't seem to be very much progress i
 

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.710
doesn't seem to be very much progress i
hope that there will be progress on this

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720
hope that there will be progress on this
 

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.830
hope that there will be progress on this
in the next few weeks and I I do believe

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840
in the next few weeks and I I do believe
 

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.570
in the next few weeks and I I do believe
that the Taliban will then resume talks

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:14.580
that the Taliban will then resume talks
 

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.930
that the Taliban will then resume talks
again because you know the need to talk

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:17.940
again because you know the need to talk
 

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.240
again because you know the need to talk
the Americans obviously is they have to

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:20.250
the Americans obviously is they have to
 

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.889
the Americans obviously is they have to
deal with the military situation first

00:24:21.889 --> 00:24:21.899
deal with the military situation first
 

00:24:21.899 --> 00:24:24.080
deal with the military situation first
in Afghanistan and if there's no point

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:24.090
in Afghanistan and if there's no point
 

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.519
in Afghanistan and if there's no point
in talking to Karzai about the military

00:24:25.519 --> 00:24:25.529
in talking to Karzai about the military
 

00:24:25.529 --> 00:24:27.560
in talking to Karzai about the military
situation because he's not in control of

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:27.570
situation because he's not in control of
 

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.720
situation because he's not in control of
the military situation the Americans are

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:29.730
the military situation the Americans are
 

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.610
the military situation the Americans are
so Karzai comes in at a later stage

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620
so Karzai comes in at a later stage
 

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.600
so Karzai comes in at a later stage

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:59.470
the Afghan Taliban were to make peace
with Kabul and you know obviously the

00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480
with Kabul and you know obviously the
 

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.200

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:02.210
whole raison d'etre of job jihad would
 

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:04.960
whole raison d'etre of job jihad would
disappear and then you know the

disappear and then you know the
 

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:07.450

Pakistani Taliban what justification

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:07.460

would not have any kind of religious
 

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:17.320
would not have any kind of religious
justification at all and I think if

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:17.330
justification at all and I think if
 

00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:20.020
justification at all and I think if
