&gt;&gt;Prior to coming to Kipp, I tried

00:00:03.076 --> 00:00:05.356
to do a fishbowl discussion
and it failed.

00:00:06.626 --> 00:00:09.466
And I had the kind of
vague idea of how to do it,

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.686
but I didn't have the specific tools.

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:13.776
When I got to Kipp last year,

00:00:13.776 --> 00:00:18.126
we had a really good professional
development on Socratic seminars

00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:23.886
that really showed me kind of the
little tricks that made it work.

00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:30.846
My name is Kellan McNulty and I
teach tenth grade AP world history

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:34.916
and eleventh grade AP US
history at Kipp King Collegiate.

00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:36.566
&gt;&gt;I think the hardest
thing for teachers

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:40.066
in adopting a critical thinking
model is that it requires them

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.616
to kinda step back and let
the students do all the work.

00:00:43.286 --> 00:00:46.936
And I think for a teacher who's used
to being the agent of knowledge,

00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:49.356
it can be hard for them
to take a back seat

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:51.876
to the learning that's
happening in the classroom.

00:00:51.876 --> 00:00:54.706
My name is Katie Kirkpatrick
and I'm the dean of instruction

00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:56.256
at Kipp King Collegiate High School.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:58.556
I also teach ninth grade
speech and composition.

00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:03.186
&gt;&gt;Another thing that I
started doing at Kipp is using

00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:07.696
like very specific structures to
push students to critical thought.

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:12.256
And the biggest impact has been
the Socratic seminar rubric.

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:15.016
Last year, before I
started teaching at Kipp,

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:17.606
we went through a lotta
professional development,

00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:22.366
and one of the most useful sessions
was on the Socratic seminars.

00:01:22.546 --> 00:01:24.796
To set up my classroom
for the Socratic seminar,

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:29.476
I basically moved the desks into
a square in the middle of the room

00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:31.166
and twelve students sit there.

00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:35.626
And then outside of that square,
I had the desks surrounding it

00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:38.556
into a larger square
and twelve, you know,

00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:40.066
to fourteen students
sit on the outside.

00:01:41.176 --> 00:01:43.326
Many teachers know
this as a fishbowl,

00:01:43.626 --> 00:01:48.996
and the rubric asks the person on
the outer circle to grade them on,

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:52.526
did they use the text to
support their arguments?

00:01:52.996 --> 00:01:54.876
Did they use analytical language?

00:01:54.876 --> 00:01:57.276
And it gives examples
of analytical language.

00:01:57.686 --> 00:02:01.596
Did they make a connection to
what someone else was saying

00:02:01.596 --> 00:02:02.796
in the discussion, right?

00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:06.766
Did they agree or disagree
with someone else?

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:10.216
&gt;&gt;So if you wanna do this in your
classroom, like it's really important

00:02:10.216 --> 00:02:13.956
that you actually seat them in a way
that's conducive and you maybe sit

00:02:13.956 --> 00:02:18.166
down yourself, or you even take
yourself outta the discussion,

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.996
'cause if you're just
standing up there normally,

00:02:19.996 --> 00:02:22.606
like they might not be able to
have a discussion like you want.

00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:26.136
&gt;&gt;During PD last year, I learned
how to set up the room like that,

00:02:26.216 --> 00:02:28.746
and how to use that rubric,
and the different jobs

00:02:28.746 --> 00:02:32.776
that you can give people on
the outside to stay motivated

00:02:32.776 --> 00:02:34.326
and invested and paying attention.

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:39.856
&gt;&gt;To keep your kids engaged,
these kids who are in the center,

00:02:39.856 --> 00:02:43.596
or you who are in the center, you're
always gonna have a role, right?

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.546
If you're a student,
you're a participant,

00:02:46.476 --> 00:02:47.796
or you're a teacher-facilitator.

00:02:48.196 --> 00:02:51.226
Those are the only roles that
are available to the inside.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:54.906
But the outside, you don't
wanna just let them sit there.

00:02:55.156 --> 00:02:58.046
They need an active role
and they need a role

00:02:58.046 --> 00:03:01.686
that helps them really
follow what's going on.

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:04.406
So here are the roles
you might assign

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:05.876
to people who are on the outside.

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:10.246
You might tell, "Okay,
you're a reporter,"

00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:12.056
and you can have multiple reporters.

00:03:12.056 --> 00:03:15.216
In fact, it's really interesting
to have multiple reporters,

00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:17.466
'cause sometimes they
see things differently

00:03:17.466 --> 00:03:19.986
and they report out different things.

00:03:19.986 --> 00:03:23.196
Your silent contributor,
I really love this role.

00:03:23.196 --> 00:03:26.216
So like they follow
on as if they were

00:03:26.286 --> 00:03:28.336
in the conversation,
but they're not in it.

00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:31.956
And at the end, you get
the chance to say to them,

00:03:31.956 --> 00:03:33.276
"What would you have said?"

00:03:33.426 --> 00:03:34.666
And then the shadower.

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:37.656
And when you're a shadower,
you're directly assigned

00:03:37.656 --> 00:03:41.156
to a student in the inner circle.

00:03:41.156 --> 00:03:43.876
So your job is to say, did
she speak loudly and clearly?

00:03:43.906 --> 00:03:46.946
Did she give reasons and
evidence for her statements?

00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:49.786
Did she use the text?

00:03:49.786 --> 00:03:51.726
Did she paraphrase accurately?

00:03:51.726 --> 00:03:55.936
&gt;&gt;Typically, once students get used
to this, they do very well with it.

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:59.176
&gt;&gt;The thing that's compelling
about this specific model is

00:03:59.176 --> 00:04:02.286
that it shows up everywhere,
you know.

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:05.596
So how is it that you can convince
your mom to buy you a cell phone?

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:09.966
How are you going to convince
a college to accept you?

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:14.016
I mean, those situations
require critical thinking,

00:04:14.016 --> 00:04:16.856
and argumentation skills,
and we all use them

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:17.956
in our daily lives so frequently.
