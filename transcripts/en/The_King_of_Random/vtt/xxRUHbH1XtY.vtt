In this video I’m going to show you how
to make “Teddy Bear” toast. “Teddy Toast”

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.840
is fun and easy to make, and is a really cool
way to serve your hungry little cubs, a healthy snack.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.570
For this “mealtime munchie”, you’ll
need to forage the kitchen for a banana, a

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.400
handful of blueberries, a piece of toast,
and a jar of peanut of butter.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.150
Carve out a generous serving of peanut butter
and carefully smear it onto the toast, so

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.720
it leaves a nice creamy layer, just thick
and sticky enough, to hold some fruit.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.280
Now cut the tip off a banana and carefully
slice three thin, circular pieces off the end,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.320
and try to keep them all about the same
size if you can.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.780
Two of the slices get pressed in at the top
of the toast, so they overhang the edges a little.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.250
And the last piece goes right in the
middle.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.780
Now at this point, our toast looks a little
more like a pig, than it does a teddy bear,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.000
but all it takes to transform it is 3 little
blueberries.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.070
Press two of the berries into the peanut butter
right, above the nose, and make sure the bottoms

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.649
are facing upward, to make beady little eyes.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.040
Then simply stick the last berry right in
the middle, to finish it off.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.450
Just like that, you’ve got a fun piece of
“Teddy Bear” Toast, ready to be captured

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.010
and enjoyed, by all your little “snack-time”
warriors.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.780
So go make some with your kids.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.119
They hardly take any time to put together,
and they’re a great way to get your youngsters

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.289
interested and excited, about eating a healthy
treat.

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:14.740
Well now you know a fun and easy way, to make
breakfast even better, by turning your toast, into “Teddy Bears”.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.340
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this
video, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
