00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, the answer is that given this information, it's completely impossible to say.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Even though I explicitly said that astronaut 1 was at rest and astronaut 2 was moving

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
was moving towards astronaut 1,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but that situation could equally well be described as astronaut 1 going towards astronaut 2

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with astronaut 2 at rest, so what can we say about the motion of astronauts 1 and 2.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Well, one thing we can definitely say that both of these space explorers will agree on

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is that the astronauts are definitely getting closer,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but this is interesting that this argument can even show you at all.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Astronaut 1 thought that he was motionless.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Astronaut 2 thought she was motionless.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Yet, clearly, there is some relative motion between them.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This points to something funny going on between motion at a constant speed

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and this idea of being at rest.

00:00:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Why don't we go back to earth to probe this question a little more deeply?
