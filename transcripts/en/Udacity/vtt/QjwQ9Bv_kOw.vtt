00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.000
So we're about to run the newSaga function for a second time.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.250
And the important issue here is that we will create a brand new red context,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.200
which will be the home for a new foil variable and two new blue contexts.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.724
The other interesting thing here is that the sagas array is going to now have

00:00:16.724 --> 00:00:21.620
two different function objects in it as a result of the second call to .push.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.930
Let's examine the situation further by imagining that there were even more

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.960
calls to the two different saga functions here before the end of the program.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.670
Running the first saga function again should work just like it did

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.840
the other times we ran it even though we've created a second newSaga context.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.580
And as we can see as we run the code, running that inner sagas function creates

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.620
a new blue sagas context inside the first red newSaga context.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.750
That's because we're running the first of those saga functions.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.710
The first of the saga functions was created in the first of

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.410
the newSaga contexts.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.360
What do you expect the output to be this time?
