[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:09.700
KARISHMAH SHAH: So ladies, thank
you so much for being here.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.050
I'm excited to host this panel.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.770
You're going to hear from
some wonderful women.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.320
They'll share some
lessons with you

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.930
that they've learned across
some incredible journeys.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.380
And then we'll leave you with
a little bit of fun, too.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.104
So let's get started.

00:00:22.104 --> 00:00:24.270
Why don't you tell us a
little bit about yourselves?

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.530
We'll just go down the line.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.270
And in addition to telling us
a little bit about your story,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.280
tell us your proudest
accomplishment in the past 12

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.790
months.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.580
KATY EXLINE: Sure.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.390
So my name is Katy Exline.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.280
And just to clarify, I'm
a developer at Braintree.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.255
But thank you for the
promotion to director.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.670
I'm a back-end
developer at Braintree,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.280
but I am also the
co-leader of Girl

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.370
Develop It here in Chicago.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.350
My background is not
in computer science.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.300
I used to be a policy
researcher at a think tank

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.560
that studied tech and
manufacturing policy.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.220
And I had a really
terrible spreadsheet

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.202
that I had to work with every
day, as I'm sure many of us

00:01:05.202 --> 00:01:06.410
have encountered in our life.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.760
And I thought, man, I could
really use a database.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.490
I don't know how to make
one, but that sounds right.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.110
So I did some furious googling,
and I came across a Girl

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.430
Develop It class in Columbus,
Ohio where I'm from.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.730
And so I took it on a whim.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.124
And it was intro
to HTML and CSS,

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:24.790
which isn't databases,
but close enough.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.620
It was something technical.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.180
I thought it was close enough.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.930
And I had just an
amazing experience.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.730
It was a woman teacher
who was also a developer.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.200
And it was an experience where
I raised my hand in the class

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.357
and said, can you tell
me what a server is?

00:01:43.357 --> 00:01:45.940
I hear people talk about them,
but I don't totally understand.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.310
And rather than snickering
at me or giving me

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.290
the eye like, oh gosh,
not one of these,

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.990
she explained it to me with
so much empathy and love.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.110
And so I got into this group
of women in Girl Develop It,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.010
and it just kind of
snowballed from there.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.020
So I ended up attending
a coding bootcamp here,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.930
called Dev Bootcamp, in Chicago.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.160
And then I worked as another
developer at a company

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.889
called Fooda.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.960
And then from there, I am
now a back-end developer

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.110
at Braintree, so just a
whirlwind of snowballing

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.330
one position after another.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.560
But that's my story.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.070
KARISHMAH SHAH: Amazing.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.550
What's your proudest
accomplishment

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.450
in the past 12 months?

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.860
KATY EXLINE: So there's just
so many amazing women here

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.693
who have these really
great accomplishments,

00:02:27.693 --> 00:02:31.570
and my biggest accomplishment
is I racked a server.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.030
So going back full circle, I did
a rotation on our platform team

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.990
this year, and I
actually took a-- we call

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.520
them piggies, but popped
some more RAM in there,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.890
and then racked it and
wired up all the networks.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.530
And it was just like, I can't
believe three years later I'm

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.790
doing this thing that was
such a black box to me

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.590
a couple years ago.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.670
That's my proudest
accomplishment.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.045
KARISHMAH SHAH: Amazing, that's
still a black box for me.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.170
BRENDA WILKERSON: Hi,
I'm Brenda Wilkerson.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.170
I started out as a computer
science major accidentally.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.770
I was pre-med.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.870
And at my university
you had to choose

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.780
some sort of major
that satisfied all

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.610
of the that and something else.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.810
And so I chose
biomedical engineering.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.020
And the lucky thing for
me was that all engineers

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.900
had to take a couple
programming classes.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.910
So that's how I even found
out about computer science.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.900
And after much wracking of
brain and changing of mind,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.040
I changed to computer
science as a major

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.360
and actually worked in software
engineering for half my career.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.850
Very exciting work--
working for Fortune

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.360
500 companies, doing a
bunch of programming.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.680
I got into education sort
of accidentally as well.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.540
I was wearing that beeper
and up half the night

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.000
fixing problems
with whatever system

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.190
that I was responsible for.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.890
And my husband and I were
pregnant with our first child.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.816
And I thought, I'm going to be
up taking care of that baby.

00:03:58.816 --> 00:04:00.940
I don't want to be up taking
care of this software.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.930
So what else can I do?

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.560
And luckily, we met a friend who
was dean of a community college

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.130
who kept asking me, what
else do you want to do?

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.730
And I ended up being
an adjunct professor

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.839
there, teaching other people who
wanted to career change and get

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.720
into technology, to be sort
of that conduit for people

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.180
who never thought that
they could but wanted

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.680
to take a shot at it.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.700
And I did that for years.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.580
And at the same time
I was raising my kids,

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.180
doing software development,
consulting on the side.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.330
I was sharing with
a colleague here

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.050
about how in the
middle of the night

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.390
I'd be nursing my baby,
clicking before sending off

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.250
the software to my client.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.700
So yes, if you're in that
space, you can do it too.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.880
And then I got into my
current position a little bit

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.630
later on when the
opportunity presented itself

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.580
to sort of shepherd
Chicago public schools

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.320
from what they were
then calling IT

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.680
education to real IT education.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.560
It was about Microsoft Word
at the time-- really exciting

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.740
to be able to be right at
that point in our history

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.500
where the whole awareness around
computer science education

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.580
has increased.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.380
Most recently, I would say
the most exciting thing

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.930
I've gotten to do is to
bring computer science

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.010
core in Chicago public schools.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.640
We now have a
graduation requirement.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.336
Very exciting.

00:05:31.336 --> 00:05:33.585
We have kindergartners talking
about their algorithms.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.900
And then we had the White
House steal our name.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.500
We now have National
Computer Science

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.214
For All, which is very exciting.

00:05:42.214 --> 00:05:43.630
And I get to be
part of that group

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.619
to sort of shepherd
that conversation

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:46.410
across the country.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.087
So it's a really great time
to be a nerd, so come on.

00:05:50.087 --> 00:05:51.920
KARISHMAH SHAH: Amazing,
and we'll hear more

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.841
about that from Brenda soon.

00:05:53.841 --> 00:05:55.340
You may have switched
from medicine,

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.631
but I guess you can't get
away from being on call, huh?

00:05:57.631 --> 00:05:59.280
BRENDA WILKERSON:
No, that's right.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.612
Good one.

00:06:01.612 --> 00:06:03.570
RIANA LYNN: Hi everyone,
my name is Riana Lynn.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.980
I'm the founder of Food Trace.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.650
Also, as was
mentioned earlier, I

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.010
serve under Google
Ventures Google

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.650
for Entrepreneurs wing at
Google as an entrepreneur

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.490
in residence.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.187
So a lot of people
ask me what that is.

00:06:16.187 --> 00:06:17.520
Maybe I can get into that later.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.370
But I would have to say that
my track began pretty early.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.280
I was always interested in
impacting our health and food

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.980
systems from a very young age.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.110
I ended up going to college to
study biology and chemistry,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:37.400
and had a computer science
major within my dorm room.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.950
Before I registered
for any classes,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.100
my university was one
of the first schools

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.750
allowed to be on Facebook.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.710
And so I actually registered
for Facebook before any classes

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.410
when Facebook came
out that year in 2004,

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:57.560
and became very interested
in building websites.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.250
All of my buddies were
just young white men

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.810
that were building the
sites at that point in time.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.450
I wanted to build websites for
businesses and for business

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.030
owners that I was meeting
just because I've always

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.430
been entrepreneurial.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.770
And so I learned how to build
websites and content manager

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.350
systems in my dorm room.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.320
Outside of just doing
tracking and studying biology,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.990
I thought that I was going to
go into a lab, and work in labs,

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.170
and maybe travel throughout
the world finding

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.340
different problems to solve.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.740
But by the time I got
to graduate school,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.500
I felt very limited in that,
and approached a family member,

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.400
and wanted to start my first
venture into entrepreneurship,

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.080
and ended up launching a chain
of juice bars here in Chicago.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.710
And within that
endeavor, I really

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:56.780
learned how impactful e-commerce
would be on our food system,

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.460
and built a side that
allowed us to have

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.400
people purchase juice
and products from all

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.530
over the world.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.450
And I ended up meeting
business owners

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.050
that were inspired
by that story,

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.560
and asked me to help them
build out their e-commerce

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.050
and their supply chains
for their food businesses.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.970
And soon after I turned that
into a kind of consulting

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:20.470
house.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:25.750
And within a few months,
that was acquired,

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.040
and I started working
for national food

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.726
companies purchased under the
CNBC show called "The Profit."

00:08:31.726 --> 00:08:33.309
I don't know if you
guys watched that.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:37.049
But I worked very closely
with Marcus Lemonis,

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.520
who is the host of that, comes
on right after "Shark Tank."

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.950
So I had a really exciting time
building websites and logistics

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.860
systems for shows that were
going to come on in two weeks.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.650
So they would come to
me and say, we just

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.483
bought this company.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.030
Launch a new website, give
them all this e-commerce,

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.440
and their sales are going to
go up from probably $400 a day

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.210
to over $20,000 in
purchases per day.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.820
And so it's really exciting
being part of that experience.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.170
But I realized that a lot
of these food companies

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.830
had a lot of supply
chain issues.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.019
And no matter how
much marketing they

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:14.560
got, how good their
product was, they

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.600
were still going to have lots
of operational issues, lots

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.360
of loss of money within
their supply chain.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.070
And that's when I decided
to fully launch Food Trace.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.730
And at that time, it really
became empowering to me

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.140
to know that the
industries that I think

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.870
are the oldest and most
impactful in the world-- that

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.760
being agriculture and
technology-- I could finally

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.160
use what I was originally
passionate about as a young

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.430
kid, and technology,
which I became very

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.150
passionate about in
college, and turn that

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.160
into a software company.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.010
And so it's been very exciting
over the last couple of years

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:55.300
developing that, to
also be a young minority

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:02.880
woman working in two industries
that are very heavily male

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.470
dominated.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.190
The average tech leader
and the average farmer

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.950
do not look much like me,
and so inspiring women

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.620
to go into both of
those industries

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.260
and be a very impactful
I would say probably

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:21.290
rolls into what has been,
especially over the past 12

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.560
months, something that
has been one of my biggest

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.210
accomplishments.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:29.910
Being at the forefront of
"Forbes" and "Ag Tech,"

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.462
but also inspiring
young women in tech

00:10:32.462 --> 00:10:33.920
at the same time
over the past year

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.820
has been something that I
really value and look to develop

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.120
over the coming years as well.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.117
So happy to be here.

00:10:43.117 --> 00:10:43.950
JUSTINE REMBISZ: Hi.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.790
I'm Justine Rembisz, and I work
at X as a mechanical engineer.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.810
I got really lucky
at a young age

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.600
in that I went to magnet
school for math and science

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.500
in high school.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.680
And I got to take what
I call all the -ics,

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.420
so robotics,
electronics, photonics.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.900
And I fell in love with
robotics when I was there.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.770
So I knew that that is
what I wanted to do.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.650
So I went to Carnegie
Mellon, which

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.560
had one of the best robotics
programs in the country,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.290
and decided that mechanical
engineering was my path there.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:15.920
I know nothing
about software, so I

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.440
think I'm one of the few
people here in that realm.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.790
After graduating there, I
went and worked for iRobot

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.370
and did research for them.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.260
So this was soft
robotics, five to 10 year

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.570
outward looking stuff.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.770
How do we get something
to squish under a door

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.340
and then keep moving?

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.280
After that, I moved
to a company called

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.630
4moms, which was completely
opposite end of the industry

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:44.470
scale, where I was doing
mass manufacturing for baby

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.390
products.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.730
So these were like strollers
that fold themselves,

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.200
or baby seats that use
electromechanical motion

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.750
to soothe the babies
that are sitting in them.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.520
Again, worked there
for about three years,

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.110
and then I joined a startup
out in San Francisco

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.490
called Redwood
Robotics that were

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.340
doing low cost industrial arms.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.500
And so that, again, was
kind of somewhere different

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.310
in the industry.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.620
And we got bought by Google
six months after I joined,

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.890
and so that's how I came to X.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.820
I would say a theme
throughout my career

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.900
is that women are not
very present, especially

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.340
in the hardware
side of industry.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.530
It was six years into
my career before I

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.042
had a meeting with
another woman in it

00:12:26.042 --> 00:12:29.490
in a tech capacity,
which is horrible.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.800
And so I've been doing
a lot during my career

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.720
to try to change that.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.210
When I was at
4moms in Pittsburgh

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.490
I started a robotics
workshop for young kids.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.710
Personally, I feel
like middle school age

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.770
is about the age where
women start hearing, no, you

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:43.810
can't do this.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.650
Don't go on to math and science.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.130
That's more of a boy thing.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.750
It starts to get hard.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.010
So I really wanted
to tackle that area.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.120
And what I'm proud about
in the last 12 months

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.030
is that I'm starting
that program with X here,

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.770
and I'm working specifically
with underprivileged schools

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.140
in the Mountain View area.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.140
KARISHMAH SHAH: Amazing.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.430
Justine's other
proudest accomplishment

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.040
in the past 12 months
after this panel

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.998
might be converting some
of you to roboticists.

00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:11.920
NICOLE YEARY: Hello, everybody.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.140
First of all, I want to
thank Google Women Techmakers

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.400
for inviting me here today.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.660
It's really a pleasure to be
among so many incredible women

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.790
in one room.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.790
My name is Nicole Yeary.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.080
I'm the founder of Ms. Tech.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.320
We help business women with tech
and tech women with business.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.360
And really what that
means is that early,

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.300
early on, I discovered
some challenges

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.330
around venture
capital in wanting

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.000
to build a health website
and needing a HIPAA

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.130
certified developer.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.730
My journey through
this was really,

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.510
I started out wanting
to be a nurse,

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.489
because I thought they
just helped people.

00:13:47.489 --> 00:13:49.030
And then I found
out, you know, blood

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.420
and all that sort of thing.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:57.460
So I pursued first
being an attorney,

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.280
and then eventually
ended up going

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.370
into architectural
engineering at Purdue.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.344
But like you, in AutoCAD
classes, I was the only woman.

00:14:06.344 --> 00:14:07.510
That was OK with me, though.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.570
I didn't really have a
big problem with that.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.430
I eventually rolled
into insurance.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.530
Don't ask me how that happened.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:20.710
And I loved my job.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:25.230
And then in 2009 I was cut,
just like a lot of other people,

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:33.790
and found myself with a degree
of various different learnings

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.235
and skill sets in sales and
marketing and very soft skills,

00:14:37.235 --> 00:14:39.360
but nothing that was really
applicable to the world

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.540
that we had kind of
evolved into this Web 2.0.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.080
And yet I wanted
to continue working

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.710
on solving some problems
around health insurance.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.700
And as I mentioned
earlier, I found out

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.560
I needed a HIPAA
certified developer.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.893
If I had to do it over again,
I would have just built it

00:14:55.893 --> 00:14:57.450
and not did that.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.740
But to raise capital, I
didn't have the opportunity

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.790
to really get a
meeting with a VC.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.180
I didn't know how that worked.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.840
I didn't have the network.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.710
I ended up working for another
startup called Sprout Socials.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.168
Some of you may
have heard of that.

00:15:12.168 --> 00:15:13.770
I was their first hire.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.450
And after 90 days in
watching Justin build,

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.110
I was like, if he can
do it, I can do it.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.930
So I started to go out there.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.870
And it was really, really hard.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.140
And I started a Facebook
group with other women that

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.380
were like myself-- very
smart and laid off of work,

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.640
and building
WordPress sites, doing

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.500
whatever they could to
hustle to make money,

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.140
because there were no jobs.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.540
We eventually started
to have brunch together

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.360
and realized that, well,
if you're better at design,

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.270
then I'll do the SEO, and
you can put everything

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.250
on the back-end server.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.316
And we'll just work together
and hire each other.

00:15:52.316 --> 00:15:54.190
This Facebook group
started with eight women,

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.320
and it just blew up.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.822
We continued to
only invite women

00:15:58.822 --> 00:16:00.530
that were like ourselves,
who were really

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.860
serious about
helping one another,

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:07.120
and seeing women in tech really
grow and foster community.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.010
And I eventually ran out of
money and went back to Ohio,

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:15.080
and realized that there was
an opportunity for me to focus

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.060
what I saw myself
making the biggest

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.140
impact in my life, which was,
here's this group of women,

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.270
and what am I doing just
as a Facebook group?

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.320
We could do so much more.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.150
If I was struggling
with venture capital,

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.370
why don't I go focus
on changing that?

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.950
So we created a second
layer of Ms. Tech.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.330
And it's a first
class membership

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:38.810
where we believe women invest
in themselves-- $35 a month

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.290
so that we could create a
sustainability for this group

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.999
and actually create some
research that hasn't been done.

00:16:43.999 --> 00:16:46.540
We don't know how many women
are going out there and pitching

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.654
VCs, how many are
actually getting meetings,

00:16:48.654 --> 00:16:50.070
how much money
they're asking for,

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:51.780
how much money they're getting.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.349
We know how many female founders
there are, and that's great,

00:16:54.349 --> 00:16:56.390
but doesn't really tell
us what the conversion is

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.410
on a lot of that.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:01.220
So our goal and objective is to
really discover that and make

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.600
some changes around that.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.579
Chicago was named the world
capital of female founders,

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:08.016
because we have so many of them.

00:17:08.016 --> 00:17:09.640
So if that's the
case, I really believe

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.014
that we have a
lot of opportunity

00:17:11.014 --> 00:17:14.810
here to not only start
investing in each other,

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:19.329
but seeing our companies grow,
become the most profitable

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:21.319
companies in the world.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:25.480
So I would say my most
proud accomplishment,

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.839
if you will-- which
is always hard

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:34.010
for us, right-- was creating
a partnership with 1871.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.580
So my company is
a vendor company

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.510
for 1871, which is a tech
incubator here in the city.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.330
We provide the curriculum
and programming

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.960
for women-focused
accelerator program.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.210
And we sent the first
company from 1871

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.900
to go into Y
Combinator this year.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.634
So it was pretty
awesome to see that.

00:17:51.634 --> 00:17:53.050
We don't provide
them any capital,

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.510
but we provide
them the resources

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.950
to connect them to community,
capital just in terms

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.405
of network and
technology resources.

00:18:01.405 --> 00:18:02.780
Like Google for
Entrepreneurs has

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.220
been an amazing aspect of that.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.160
KARISHMAH SHAH: Cool.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:06.820
Thanks, Nicole.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.630
I told you they're incredible.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.460
So the common thread, I
think, across these five women

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.070
is they're clearly very
passionate about what they did,

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.070
and I think they took
initiative in driving

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.520
their careers forward.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.100
In doing that, sometimes
you face obstacles.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.510
So what's a challenge
that you faced?

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.820
What's the toughest
time in your career,

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.800
and how did you overcome that?

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.774
KATY EXLINE: Yeah, so the
biggest challenge for me

00:18:33.774 --> 00:18:37.930
was in that initial
class that I took then.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:42.290
I got that little spark
of, oh, this is cool.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.430
I don't know what to do now,
but this class was great.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.450
So the toughest challenge that
I faced-- which I'm lucky,

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.280
there are people who face
much worse than I did--

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.490
was just trying to
navigate the industry.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.450
Because there are
so many buzzwords,

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:00.280
like rails, Django, docker.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.280
Like, what?

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.210
And it was challenging
to try and figure out

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.515
some sort of path.

00:19:07.515 --> 00:19:08.890
I wasn't even
trying to pick what

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.300
I was going to do, just a path.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:15.650
And so what really helped me
overcome that obstacle was I

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:17.280
just jumped into something.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.820
And so that's when I ended up
jumping not just into the Girl

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.080
Develop It class, but
then in the group.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.710
And I met this network
of awesome women.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.490
And we would just sit at a
coffee shop, and we would talk.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.000
And it's amazing how those
little micro connections

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.520
start to snowball.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.680
And that was how I learned
about the coding bootcamp,

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.924
and I actually, within one
of those coffee meetings,

00:19:39.924 --> 00:19:41.590
had some validation
where somebody said,

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.400
yeah, you should do it.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.470
Those types of words
make all the difference.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.440
So really the toughest
challenge for me

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.330
was just figuring
these things out.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.020
And I have just been so lucky
to have an awesome network

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.250
of people that just
continues to grow and expand

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.640
to help navigate that.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.710
So that's my challenge.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.900
RIANA LYNN: I would say
probably until maybe even a year

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.330
and a half ago, it was
hard for a lot of us to--

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.590
or I can't speak for you guys.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.999
But I think there
might be a little bit

00:20:13.999 --> 00:20:15.040
of understanding in this.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.480
But my family and friends
really didn't understand a lot

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.580
about entrepreneurship, tech,
the pathway, as you said.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.100
And so I worked at
the White House.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:34.150
I was a researcher at Duke
since graduating in 2008

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:34.970
from undergrad.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:39.304
And they're like, why would
you leave those opportunities?

00:20:39.304 --> 00:20:40.720
My grandmother
still says today, I

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.300
would have still been over
at Duke or the White House.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:48.510
But she's so proud of
me and now understands

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:51.850
where I can go with my
passion and with everything

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:52.580
that I'm doing.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.630
And at first it was
really a challenge,

00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.590
because mothers,
grandmothers, friends

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.007
don't see us in these roles.

00:21:02.007 --> 00:21:03.590
They don't see a lot
of these stories.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:08.630
They don't understand what
we would do on a day to day,

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:12.650
or how entrepreneurship
is changing,

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:15.480
how new ideas are
really impacting

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.520
all of our industries.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:23.030
And so it took several years for
them to see that kind of payoff

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.500
and where it can go.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.120
And so I'm excited now that
we have all these stories,

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.890
and they're talking
about it more in media.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.735
But that was initially
the challenge.

00:21:34.121 --> 00:21:36.370
JUSTINE REMBISZ: I would say
is a big challenge that I

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.330
faced throughout my career
and am still challenged by

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.660
is something called
impostor syndrome.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.610
I'm sure a lot of
you have heard of it.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.960
I left school after getting
my bachelor's degree.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.450
And robotics is a
relatively new industry.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.460
And most people have
gone to grad school.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.240
Most have their PhDs, not
even just their master's.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.990
And so I constantly
felt like, oh my gosh,

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.735
I'm in a room with all these
super bright people who

00:22:00.735 --> 00:22:02.090
have done all this research.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.440
What am I doing here?

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.130
Another thread
throughout my career

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.410
has been that I've changed
jobs a couple times,

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:12.129
and each time it hasn't
been the same exact thing.

00:22:12.129 --> 00:22:14.170
I went from doing research,
to doing mass market,

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:15.710
to doing industrial work.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:20.430
And so while I have eight years
of professional experience,

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.590
it feels every like
I make that switch

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.230
like I'm a total newbie at it.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.390
And so just working
really, really hard

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:31.670
to get up to speed to be on
the same level as my peers

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.830
has-- I mean, I've
worked hard to do it,

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.870
and I feel like I belong.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.540
But there's definitely
the nagging gremlins,

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.390
I call them, in my mind that
say, do you belong here?

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:43.810
Are you as good as your peers?

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:44.620
Things like that.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.890
So I would ask anyone here who
has advice for how to get over

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.660
that to please see me after.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.540
NICOLE YEARY: I
would say for myself

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:59.800
was to pull away from
this-- through school,

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.080
we're always given a
path and direction.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.590
And we're told what
classes we need

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.660
to take to get to what
school we want to go to.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.950
And then we go through
all those classes.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:07.930
And then we graduate,
and we're told

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.760
we're going to get
a job in this area.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.590
And then when that
doesn't happen,

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.870
then you have to become
creative, and start

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.237
becoming innovative
with your own skills,

00:23:18.237 --> 00:23:20.820
and figuring out, how am I going
to actually make things work,

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.010
and not having a plan B.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:27.090
That was really challenging
when the market did crash

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.020
and there wasn't a clear
path for me to go down.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.310
And I even watched
this with my mom,

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.130
because I organized a women's
focus startup weekend,

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.850
and I invited her to join.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:39.770
And day two she cried.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:42.260
Because she's a
systems engineer,

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.970
so she's in technology,
always grew up

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:47.100
around servers and
her changing tapes.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.490
But for the first
time, she was forced

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:52.710
to kind of think for herself
and not given direction,

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.990
and be creative with
what she does know,

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.440
and be confident about that.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.740
And I think that the
greatest challenge for me

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.800
was really to learn how to
unwind what I had been taught

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.780
about following a path, a
direction that was the way we

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:10.050
were supposed to go, and to
develop a thought of my own,

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.904
and seeing a path that no one
else had highlighted for me.

00:24:13.904 --> 00:24:16.320
BRENDA WILKERSON: Yeah, and I
pick up on that thread, too.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.810
Because I think we all have
this sort of prescribed pathway

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.140
that starts out when
we're raised with parents.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:24.780
They love us.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.040
They're trying to help us.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.910
We absorb some of
that direction.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:30.660
But to really be able
to break out of it,

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.310
many times there's
those barriers

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.990
we always face where people
want you to kind of stay

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.440
in your place, whatever that is.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.860
And I feel like
one of the things

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.610
that I found-- because I
was always entrepreneurial

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.080
growing up.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.480
And being an entrepreneur and
thinking like an entrepreneur

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.050
has a very important
space in tech,

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:52.520
even if you aren't striking
out and creating your own.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.440
And so the challenge for
me was to really balance

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.990
my creative side with the
traditional technical side

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:03.700
and figure out-- and
also the medical side.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.100
Because I wanted to help
people to improve their lives.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.820
And so coming through the
various tech jobs that I had,

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.015
there was sort of this struggle
with, OK, I can do this,

00:25:14.015 --> 00:25:14.890
and I'm good at this.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.300
But really, is this
what I want to do?

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.240
Is this really the investment
in people that I want to make?

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.520
And so really getting
into education-- balance

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.910
all those things to really
be able to figure out

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.360
how to help first adults and
now kids to find their place,

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.480
and to really find their voice,
and to work on that muscle of,

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.910
I think I can know what I
can do with the knowledge

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:36.200
that I'm being given.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.880
And to learn to find their
own path to knowledge

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.320
is really where I found
that sweet spot for me.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.010
But even in there
was a challenge,

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:49.030
because with the work that I'm
doing, it's very common now.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:51.430
But in the beginning,
it was a vision.

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.060
And people laughed,
and people thought

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.710
it would never
happen, and to really

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:56.020
kind of go against the wind.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.180
And one of the
ways I describe it

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.370
is pushing the peanut up
the hill with my nose,

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.464
and really finding that
inner strength to say,

00:26:04.464 --> 00:26:06.130
even though people
don't agree with you,

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:07.630
or people don't
understand and don't

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.242
see your vision, that doesn't
mean that your vision is wrong.

00:26:10.242 --> 00:26:11.700
And I think especially
as women, we

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.370
have to find that
inner strength.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.070
And if you can find somebody
that believes in you,

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:17.010
that is great.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.760
If you can't, then if
you know that that's

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.270
what you're supposed
to be doing,

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.067
you have to put your
feet down and say,

00:26:22.067 --> 00:26:23.150
I know that this is right.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.250
I believe this is what
I should be doing.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.270
And when it breaks,
oh, it's great,

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:30.441
but to have the strength
to just kind of persevere.

00:26:30.441 --> 00:26:32.690
KARISHMAH SHAH: That's a
nugget of wisdom-- confidence

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:36.710
in your vision and the
grit to make it a reality.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.200
In navigating these
challenges, how important

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.040
do you think it is to
have one or many sponsors,

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.720
role models, mentors?

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.540
Have you gotten any amazing
career advice from one?

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.890
KATY EXLINE: I think
it's really interesting.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.020
I have a lot of women
through Girl Develop It

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.180
who approach me and say,
I'm looking for a mentor.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.160
And sometimes I just
want to say, look around.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.380
And I think it is, traditionally
speaking, and speaking

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.630
along the lines, again,
of what should be done,

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.340
or what is traditionally
talked about,

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.762
is having a formal mentor.

00:27:08.762 --> 00:27:10.720
And I think that environment
has changed a lot.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.720
And I really found a lot of
value in the Ms. Tech group.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.950
There's a resource
of women there.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:18.441
And peers of mine
have been-- there

00:27:18.441 --> 00:27:19.940
are some in the
crowd here that have

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.249
been wonderful mentors
to me, some that are

00:27:22.249 --> 00:27:23.540
further along in their careers.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:28.320
So I can't say that I've had one
particular person, because it's

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.660
doing a disservice to so many
of the people that have really

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.459
helped me.

00:27:32.459 --> 00:27:33.500
And that's worked for me.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.340
Some people may like to have
maybe one person that they

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.590
can kind of go to and lean on.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.420
But don't feel
like you've failed

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.500
at finding a mentor if
you're leaning on a network.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.960
Because it's worked.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.190
BRENDA WILKERSON: And I think
that all across the range,

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:51.580
it's great to have that person
or those people to talk to.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.975
Very rarely did I get that.

00:27:54.975 --> 00:27:56.600
Early in tech, it
was kind of isolated.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:02.310
There weren't a lot of women,
and sometimes even the culture

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:05.100
of being able to help
each other wasn't there.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.630
But understand that there
are mentoring experiences.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.040
This is a mentoring experience.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.760
For me sitting here listening
to these wonderful stories,

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.400
I'm being mentored
by their pathway.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.950
And so you find just
getting into conversations--

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:18.410
we need to talk.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.010
We need to talk to each other.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.590
We'll learn from each other.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:25.310
But seeking out a mentor-- I
recently finally got a mentor.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:28.350
I had been seeking her for
years when I thought, OK, it

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.620
wasn't happening naturally.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.920
I found a woman within
CPS, and thought,

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.090
I'm really proud of her.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:37.080
I know she's paved a lot of
the way for this type of work

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:37.772
that I'm doing.

00:28:37.772 --> 00:28:39.230
And I started
knocking on her door.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.610
And it took a year before
she had time to talk to me.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:42.515
But I didn't give up.

00:28:42.515 --> 00:28:44.270
I kept calling her.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:46.890
I didn't bug her,
but I was persistent.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.390
And finally we got there.

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:54.710
So be as persistent in seeking
out the things that you know

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:58.140
that you need, as
well as-- as women

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.100
we're always helping others.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.450
And it will be amazing
how you will find help

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:06.220
in all different
types of experiences.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.040
RIANA LYNN: Yeah, I
would agree that there

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.720
are great communities now.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.400
I love the kind of
group interaction

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.900
I get from Ms. Tech
and other groups

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.120
here in Chicago and
across the country.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.620
I'd be happy to share some
of these wonderful groups,

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.380
especially that are
highly active on Facebook.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.300
But I tell people
this story a lot.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.070
Early on, just right
after undergrad,

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:32.570
I was very passionate
and very confident

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.150
with seeking out my mentors.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:38.030
And I think that you have
to just make that step

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.420
and do what you can to
get access to the people

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.860
that you think are
untouchable or unreachable.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.970
I remember learning Photoshop
and the full Adobe suite,

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:51.680
building a website,
building out a media company

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.550
just to get press passes to
Obama's first inauguration, all

00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:01.650
of these events that had
people that were leaders

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:02.910
from all over the world.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:06.110
And I ended up at
this award ceremony

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:09.100
with some of the top
researchers and entrepreneurs

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.250
in the country.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:14.540
And I walked up to
this guy who was just

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.850
featured on "60 Minutes"
as a top researcher

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:20.390
at the University of Chicago,
and also an entrepreneur,

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:24.430
and said, I want to
intern for you the summer.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:25.220
Give me your card.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.980
Let's make it happen.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.780
And he never knew I was there
under this fake press pass.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:35.090
But I told him later on, and
a great mentor to this day.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:39.480
But I tell people, find a
way to work with the people

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.300
that you want to work with to
learn from them in whatever

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.730
capacity.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:46.880
Do not be scared to go up
to them and get their card.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.140
Don't give them your card.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:51.600
Make sure you get their
card, because they probably

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.690
won't email you back, or they
will lose it in the shuffle.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.390
And sometimes LinkedIn and
stuff is not that effective.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:02.160
But no matter how
young you are, people

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.430
appreciate someone that's
passionate that can help them

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:06.560
even for free.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.730
Luckily, he got a budget
for me to work for him.

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:14.920
But you even have to
seek the opportunity

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.250
to work on a night or weekend
to learn from these folks

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.390
and get right there
in the grit with them.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:24.470
And it's just been
exciting to share that

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:27.210
with other folks that are
looking for mentorship,

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:29.305
and now also be a mentor myself.

00:31:29.305 --> 00:31:30.680
JUSTINE REMBISZ:
I totally agree.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.600
Advocating for
yourself is really

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.650
the key to getting mentorship.

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:37.600
I think it's great,
like some of you

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.000
were saying earlier,
finding groups of your peers

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.060
in the community
that you can talk to.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.686
But then finding someone that
has a bit more experience

00:31:44.686 --> 00:31:46.980
is also really, really valuable.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.740
And something that
someone told me

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.820
when I was younger in my
career and looking for mentors

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.820
is, the worst they
can do is say no.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.460
And that's really it.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.180
It's not like they're going
to hate you for asking them

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:01.070
for some of their time.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.970
You're going to be
denied a job at Google

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:07.390
because you asked me to mentor
you on how to do robotics.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:10.470
So I'd really encourage everyone
to just put yourself out there

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.970
and just ask the question.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:15.880
The worst that can
happen is they'll say no.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.690
NICOLE YEARY: I think that using
every possible tool that you

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:22.860
have out there to
engage with people,

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.270
and also just with yourself
to tap into what you already

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.664
know-- books.

00:32:28.664 --> 00:32:30.330
You can learn so much
from books, right?

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:32.370
Just one I will
share with you that I

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:35.140
find with the wisdom
group is called

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.410
"Monday Morning Leadership."

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:38.130
And it's eight
mentoring sessions,

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:40.290
and they're captured
in a very short read.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.730
But doing that
together, the very first

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:46.070
lesson it talks about is being
a driver versus a passenger.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.080
And as Riana mentioned,
you have to be that driver

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.530
and take ownership
for everything

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:51.870
that happens in your life.

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:55.810
So be it good or
bad, it's my fault,

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.300
and I take ownership for that.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.590
So if I'm hungry enough,
I will go after it.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.880
And I think that that's what
you see with others, too,

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.590
is if they're hungry, you
want to help them as well.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:11.400
And just really tapping
into what Katy mentioned,

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.420
knowledge sharing,
for me, I think

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:16.620
is the most powerful
way of learning.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.349
There is nothing better than
connecting with someone who's

00:33:19.349 --> 00:33:21.390
going through the same
thing you're going through

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:24.570
and can tell you what they
know, save you some time,

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:27.730
and/or provide you just
really an ear to listen,

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.540
or even for you to
be the listener.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:34.710
And that presence makes
such a huge difference

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:38.982
in your confidence
and your clarity.

00:33:38.982 --> 00:33:39.940
KARISHMAH SHAH: Thanks.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.060
Justine, I saw some bright
eyes when you mentioned

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:46.659
that no one would get denied a
job at Google if they asked you

00:33:46.659 --> 00:33:47.950
about how to get into robotics.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:52.260
So if they were to ask you,
how would you advise them?

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:53.720
JUSTINE REMBISZ: Sure.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:34:00.230
So I would say at the young
college level, the three

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.010
industries that get
you into robotics

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.320
are software engineering,
mechanical engineering,

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.650
and electrical engineering.

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:10.290
Studying those in
school is important.

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:12.230
Beyond school, I
think there's ways

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.730
to get into robotics
through the maker community.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:17.600
So Katy actually
introduced me to Adafruit

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.290
just a couple days ago.

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:20.460
But get an Arduino.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.960
There's a ton of support
groups online for that.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.050
In terms of mechanical and
electrical engineering,

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:30.760
a lot of the barrier to
entry is the design software.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.840
But for mechanical
engineering, there's

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.699
something called
Onshape, which will let

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:37.370
you do mechanical CAD for free.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:38.590
It's a cloud-based service.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:40.350
And then for
electrical engineering,

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:43.530
Eagle is something that will
allow you to do schematics

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:45.120
and board design.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:49.820
Instructables.com is great at
breaking down maker projects.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.830
Go to maker fairs near you.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:53.580
Get involved in that community.

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.590
Get in touch with those people.

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:58.050
Hackaday is another
great resource,

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:01.310
and I have a few more if you
want to talk to me after.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:03.390
RIANA LYNN: And locally,
Catalyze Chicago

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:07.910
will soon be launching mHUB,
100,000 square feet of space

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:08.660
for makers.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.670
They're looking to diversify
the space as much as possible.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:16.890
It will be the 1871 of
manufacturing and makers,

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.668
so look out for those
announcements coming soon.

00:35:19.668 --> 00:35:20.970
KARISHMAH SHAH: Cool.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.000
So in designing a
career that you love,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.020
designing a life that
you love around that,

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.355
do you ever burn out?

00:35:26.355 --> 00:35:27.730
What do you do
when you burn out?

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:32.912
How do you balance living your
life and pursuing this passion?

00:35:32.912 --> 00:35:34.120
Brenda, let's start with you.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:38.960
BRENDA WILKERSON:
Burnout is a real thing.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.710
It's a real thing.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:41.800
And it's one of those
things that if you're

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.690
really passionate and you
really dig yourself in

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:48.520
and you start to work really
hard, it's hard to not at least

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.340
taste it a little bit.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:54.000
I think one of the
things that I do

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.540
to balance burnout is to make
sure I remember my core belief

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:00.710
systems.

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:03.460
I am creative, so I find
something else to create.

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.080
I actually spent a
portion of my background

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:10.210
in creating knitted
outerwear, believe it or not.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.630
And so I got back into knitting.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.700
And as I'm knitting,
it's creative.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.360
I'm able to sort of take
a break from the grind,

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.110
but then also work through
some of those things that

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:24.200
are on the back burner that
I want to work on next.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.200
We're always multitasking.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.470
We always have other ideas.

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:28.924
Some take the
forefront at a time,

00:36:28.924 --> 00:36:30.340
but there's all
these other things

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.230
that are still being processed.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:35.012
So I think when you approach
burnout, you back off

00:36:35.012 --> 00:36:36.720
and you think about
some of those things,

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.830
and you give them
their attention.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:40.510
I think as women,
it's very key for us

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.820
to remember to take
care of ourselves.

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:47.060
I think we inherently
are the caregivers,

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:50.690
the lovers of other
people and other things.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:52.700
But it's amazing that
when you give yourself

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.820
a break-- my staff, I gave
myself 10 days around Christmas

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.820
where I just sat around.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.160
And I didn't check my email.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:36:59.993
I didn't do a thing.

00:36:59.993 --> 00:37:02.090
I was shocked that I did that.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:03.940
But when I came
back, I was on fire,

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:07.100
because I had powered down
the system for a minute.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:11.520
So it's great to be successful
in what you're trying to do.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.490
But give yourself a break.

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:16.160
And it will actually be the
fuel to help you be better

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.320
at what it is that you do.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.890
KATY EXLINE: I was going to
say that exact same thing.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:25.330
Take care of yourself.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.016
I've come across it as a
Girl Develop It leader.

00:37:28.016 --> 00:37:30.640
We actually, the Girl Develop It
chapter leaders across the US,

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.982
have a shared Slack channel.

00:37:31.982 --> 00:37:33.690
And we have a channel
called Just Say No.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.799
It's so hard, too, when you
have all these great ideas.

00:37:40.799 --> 00:37:42.590
Oh, wouldn't it be
great to do a hackathon?

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:45.160
Or oh, I'd love to do
a robotics workshop.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.870
And at some point
you have to say no.

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:49.170
Like no, I need a
Netflix and nails day.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:58.620
So it's very hard, because
sometimes I felt the guilt of,

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.890
I should be doing this,
or I could be doing this,

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:02.790
or should be doing
this for my career.

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.800
And you have to
strip away all the

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.240
should haves, all what
you could be doing.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.800
Just look at where
you are right now.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.680
Take care of yourself mentally,
physically, professionally.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:18.090
Take care of you, because you
are your biggest advocate.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:22.760
So if you take care of
yourself, you will succeed.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.487
Things will work out for
you, and just say no.

00:38:25.487 --> 00:38:27.320
KARISHMAH SHAH: This
is like my recent steer

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.950
towards JOMO instead of FOMO.

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:31.080
So FOMO is Fear Of Missing Out.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.520
But now I'm loving JOMO,
which is Joy Of Missing Out.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.670
It's really just taking
that time for yourself.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:38.360
Riana?

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.030
RIANA LYNN: I love the JOMO.

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:45.310
I would say sometimes
I try to take

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:51.530
little chunks of my day or week
to work on my mental health.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:55.850
Because I can work for long
stretches of time, and even

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:57.740
at really crazy hours.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.220
There's been times I've
posted on Ms. Tech group

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.820
at like 2:00 AM.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:06.196
Nicole is also-- she'll
accept it at 3:00 AM.

00:39:06.196 --> 00:39:07.650
Her schedule's
pretty crazy, too.

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:11.780
But I have a goal
of being-- I don't

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.450
know who holds this
title right now,

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:19.480
but I really want to be one
of the world's foremost fruit

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.070
experts.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:23.160
So I just try to
discover as many fruits

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.962
around the world as possible
and just learn as much

00:39:25.962 --> 00:39:26.920
about them as possible.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:33.600
So travel is something that I
try to build into my career.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:37.830
I have brought my MacBook
to so many crazy places,

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:40.030
and it kind of
scares me sometimes.

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:44.325
So we'll see how we can
work on some new safety

00:39:44.325 --> 00:39:45.510
innovations around that.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:52.290
But definitely travel, and
just finding a good hobby

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.830
that can give you that
mental break, maybe

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:58.930
something on the more
physical side to keep that up.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:02.310
And what you learn,
too, is if you're

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:04.860
taking care of your mental
and physical health,

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.920
you're that much further
ahead of your competitors,

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:12.860
just because you are able to
come back with this energy

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:17.961
and really kind of push things
forward at an accelerated pace.

00:40:17.961 --> 00:40:19.710
JUSTINE REMBISZ: Kind
of a weird response,

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:23.340
probably, but I got a dog.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.350
And just the
responsibility of having

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:28.640
to be home at a certain time to
take care of my dog every day

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:32.890
actually allows me to shut
off and say, OK, now this

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:36.500
is the time that I need to
take care of this living thing

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.050
and put some energy into it.

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:40.550
And that gives me enough of a
mental break that usually then

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:44.630
I can continue with my own
self support type stuff,

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:46.780
like working out, or
cooking dinner for myself,

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.970
or something like that.

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:50.740
But a bit more
seriously, too, I'm

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.780
pretty fiercely protective
of my weekends as well.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.560
I try not to email anyone
on my team on the weekends,

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.440
because then that gets
them into the mode of,

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.240
oh my god, she's expecting
me to respond back,

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.405
or anything like that.

00:41:03.405 --> 00:41:04.280
So I try to shut off.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.600
I mean, obviously
I kind of check

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.120
to make sure there's
no emergencies.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.620
But I set it as
a goal for myself

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.160
to not send any email
out over the weekend.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.950
KARISHMAH SHAH: Keep
it in that draft box.

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:15.241
JUSTINE REMBISZ: Yeah, exactly.

00:41:15.241 --> 00:41:18.120
NICOLE YEARY: I've been
thinking about a puppy

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.290
for that same reason.

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:21.680
It will force me to go home.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.570
I think that the most important
thing that I've reminded myself

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:27.570
is that you're the
only one who can

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:29.410
define what your balance is.

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:32.400
So if I'm up at 3:00 in the
morning, and I'm OK with that,

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:37.810
and I'm still being mindful
of my sleep, my nutrition,

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:42.530
and making sure that I take
care and balance in my own way,

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:43.640
I do what I have to do.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.780
Because at the end
of the day, I'm

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.200
the only one who's
going to do everything

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.600
that I need to do
by the deadlines

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.725
I need to get them done by.

00:41:48.725 --> 00:41:54.370
So be your own
definition of balance.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:59.060
And for me, that is every day
I know I need to walk home,

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.760
and I need to have
my music in my ears,

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:01.900
and I need to be alone.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.060
I don't want anybody
else walking with me.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.860
I have a 17 minute
walk, and I love it.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.100
I look forward to it every day.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.710
The other things I do is I will
shut all the lights off, put

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:14.220
candles on, aroma therapy,
take a hot bubble bath.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.690
Whatever I can do
to just really--

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:20.030
I'm aware of what helps
me unwind mentally.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.820
And so as long as you know
what that is for yourself,

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.320
I think that's the
most important.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.530
KARISHMAH SHAH: I love it.

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:30.799
So we had some great discussions
about the future of technology.

00:42:30.799 --> 00:42:32.090
So talk to us about the future.

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:34.600
What are you most looking
forward to in technology?

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:39.040
Brenda, go ahead and share.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.720
BRENDA WILKERSON: I'm really
looking forward to the world

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.730
that we're creating
where little kids get

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:47.590
to learn to think and create.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:50.920
And we're giving people--
at a very young age,

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.430
it's going to be normal for
them to be able to solve

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:54.370
their own problems.

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:56.410
They have the tools.

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:59.930
That just really turns me on.

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:03.679
And normally I have
this great imagination.

00:43:03.679 --> 00:43:05.720
I can say, here's what
that's going to look like.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.636
I have no idea what
that's going to look like.

00:43:07.636 --> 00:43:10.470
Because it's so new for people
to get that kind of power.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.310
But I'm so excited
for it, people

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:16.630
to be able to solve problems
and have the confidence that it

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:19.220
takes to do whatever they
want to do in their lives

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.400
because they know how
to do these things.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.205
So I'm really turned on by that.

00:43:24.205 --> 00:43:25.580
KARISHMAH SHAH:
Empowering people

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.038
with the skill of
computer science.

00:43:27.038 --> 00:43:29.090
BRENDA WILKERSON:
Yes, that's right.

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:30.940
KATY EXLINE: It's
just so cool, I'm

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:36.040
so excited about where education
is going at all levels-- what

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.380
you're doing with children.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.320
And you know what,
I think Girl Develop

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.490
It, RailsBridge, [INAUDIBLE],
Women Who Code, these groups

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:46.410
are breaking down barriers
to learning about technology,

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.290
speaking about technology,
and that type of thing.

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:50.840
There's just so many pathways.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.750
And we spoke about this earlier.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:54.700
There was traditionally
this one path,

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.350
that you took computer science
and you got your master's

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:57.130
degree and whatnot.

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:59.460
And that is still an OK path,
but that's not the only path

00:43:59.460 --> 00:43:59.960
anymore.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.600
And that's particularly good
for women, or people of color,

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.544
or people who maybe
don't have the resources

00:44:05.544 --> 00:44:07.960
or the privilege to be able
to take that traditional path.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.860
So I'm just so excited about
where education is going

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:14.460
and how you can really
make education work for you

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:18.637
and your abilities and for
the resources you have.

00:44:18.637 --> 00:44:19.720
RIANA LYNN: I would agree.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.530
I always think to
myself that for me,

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:25.800
one of the most impactful things
of my past has been exposure.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:29.560
And from that, I always
said that exposure is

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.080
the world's greatest professor.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.120
And so when I think
of times that I've

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.760
traveled to other
countries, when

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:39.150
I think about the capacity
in learning that things

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:43.270
like Facebook have brought to
people, the digital exposure,

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:45.770
it's really great
to see how there

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:50.160
is a woman tech summit,
the Google Summit in Lagos

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.240
right now.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:57.325
And so it's so exciting to
see how 10, 20 years ago,

00:44:57.325 --> 00:45:00.680
a lot of people were talking
about illiteracy and reading.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:06.820
But I feel like technology
has accelerated that problem

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.350
and brought so many
kids across the world

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:13.900
to more equality, more parity.

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.720
And I think technology and
the future of education

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.580
and technology is so promising.

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.210
And also just for
the future of tech,

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:25.420
I'm really excited about virtual
reality and augmented reality.

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:29.920
I think, from a summit I went
to at South by Southwest,

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.880
there's so much that we can
do, not just with gaming

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.350
or virtual reality
headset and sports,

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:38.300
but bringing people to
places they never thought

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.540
they would see in the world.

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.260
And so I'm excited for
the future of that.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:45.420
KARISHMAH SHAH: What's the
future of agritech look like?

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.780
What's the future of agritech
look like, food and tech?

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.650
RIANA LYNN: You know,
there are many countries

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:59.950
that 80% of their economy
is based on agriculture,

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:03.440
and a lot of small
sustaining farmers

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.110
that are just working to grow
things just for their family.

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:11.430
And I think we've had so much
waste within food in agritech.

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:15.000
We have a world full
of hungry people,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.840
but we grow enough food to
feed everybody in this world.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:25.150
And I think we will see hunger
eradicated in our lifetime

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:28.420
if we just execute some of the
things in food and agritech

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:32.230
right, things that we didn't
really think we could solve 10,

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:33.720
15 years ago.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:38.280
But to know that the average
American wastes 30% to 45%

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:42.660
of every food item
that they either touch

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:45.220
or that is grown in
their local area,

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:49.200
and to know that we can
reroute that in many ways--

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.210
not from growing better things
or creating new technology that

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:57.580
can grow more sustainably,
but creating tech systems that

00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:00.150
can make sure that the
food gets to the right

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:02.080
places in the right time.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.410
It's really exciting
to see that those two

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:06.855
worlds can come together
and solve those issues.

00:47:06.855 --> 00:47:09.105
KARISHMAH SHAH: Absolutely--
big operations challenge.

00:47:11.262 --> 00:47:13.220
JUSTINE REMBISZ: From
the robotics and hardware

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:18.395
perspective, I'm really excited
about ubiquitous robots in day

00:47:18.395 --> 00:47:19.410
to day life.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:23.200
I feel like we're really on
the cusp of mobile robotics

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.990
being a service to
people day to day.

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.870
We have the Roomba.

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:32.060
We have washing machines right
now, which I consider robots.

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:34.059
But I think really within
the next five years,

00:47:34.059 --> 00:47:35.850
we're going to be seeing
self-driving cars.

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:38.610
We're going to be seeing drones
that are delivering things.

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:40.800
We're going to be
seeing robots that

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:46.680
do agriculture, just a lot more
service from that industry.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.130
And I also think we're going
to see a lot more platforms

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:52.830
developed through these robots
that'll allow the children that

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:54.700
are learning about
computer science

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.870
right now to have
things to develop on.

00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:00.780
And so I'm really excited
about both of those things.

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.030
NICOLE YEARY: I would say
there's a couple things that

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:04.530
keep me up at night,
and one of them

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:07.040
is that we need to help the
women here in this country

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.430
first to reach gender parity
before we can actually

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:12.040
go out and make changes
in other countries.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.640
We are not at gender parity now.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.310
And so now that
we have platforms

00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:18.410
for funding and the
ability to make investments

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:21.660
in other women-founded
companies or products,

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.420
we should be doing
that more, and being

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.920
cognizant of where we're
actually putting our dollars.

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.920
I'm excited for the
future and opportunities

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.580
that I hope to build
with other people

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:35.300
and to create in terms
of funds for women.

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.890
There can't be enough right now
in terms of high growth tech

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:39.640
startups.

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.400
We don't have enough women.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.900
I mean, how many
unicorns are there?

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.460
I think Danielle Morrill is
one of my favorites in terms

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.600
of just women that are
really killing it out there.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:52.480
But we have a great
opportunity with college women.

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.620
And one thing that
we're doing at Ms. Tech

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.930
is we're creating
college collectives.

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:59.480
And it was thanks to
one of the interns

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.520
that we had-- the very
first intern I had.

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:05.440
Her name was Sanam Chakraborty,
and Oswin Chackochan, the two

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.240
women, they became
co-presidents down at Purdue.

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.640
And their bringing together
the worlds of business school

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.265
and technology.

00:49:13.265 --> 00:49:15.390
Because those two schools
don't really communicate.

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:17.681
So how does innovation happen,
and how do they actually

00:49:17.681 --> 00:49:19.500
build and create companies?

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:23.030
And they're working on a
startup right now called

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:26.850
Skaled, which has got "kale" in
it, because they're aquaponics

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:30.130
and vertical farming, and
getting rid of the whole food

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:31.250
desert idea.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:35.040
So I think that if we look at
college women and being mentors

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.720
to them, or at least
encouraging them to not leave

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:41.176
the Midwest-- is
the big thing, too.

00:49:41.176 --> 00:49:42.550
Two of the seniors
in the group--

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:43.760
right now we have 16 women.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.230
And two of them, they're
both going to San Francisco.

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:49.740
So I'd really like to see
that we help really seed start

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:52.990
companies here and encourage
them to find careers here

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:54.154
in the Midwest, as well.

00:49:54.154 --> 00:49:55.820
KARISHMAH SHAH: Love
it-- encouragement.

00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:57.177
Let's all encourage each other.

00:49:57.177 --> 00:49:58.010
We're right on time.

00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:59.801
We're going to wrap
with one last question.

00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:04.590
Rapid fire round-- what is
the single word that you think

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:06.760
characterizes the
attitude that you've

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.620
taken towards your career?

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:10.984
And whoever's got
it first can start.

00:50:10.984 --> 00:50:11.955
NICOLE YEARY: Share.

00:50:11.955 --> 00:50:13.080
KARISHMAH SHAH: What is it?

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:13.913
NICOLE YEARY: Share.

00:50:13.913 --> 00:50:15.090
KARISHMAH SHAH: Share.

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:16.350
JUSTINE REMBISZ: Grow.

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:17.740
KARISHMAH SHAH: Grow.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:18.550
RIANA LYNN: Evolve.

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:19.200
KARISHMAH SHAH: Evolve.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.086
BRENDA WILKERSON: Vision.

00:50:20.086 --> 00:50:21.044
KARISHMAH SHAH: Vision.

00:50:21.044 --> 00:50:21.850
KATY EXLINE: Joy.

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:22.950
KARISHMAH SHAH: Joy.

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:26.260
And with that, can we thank
this fabulous panel of women?

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:28.220
