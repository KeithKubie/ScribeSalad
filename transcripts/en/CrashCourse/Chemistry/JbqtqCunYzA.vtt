00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
Imagine, if you will, a state dinner at the White House. These are not small intimate affairs.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.749
300 or so adults mingle in close quarters,

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:13.029
yet somehow it's a quiet gathering where people
behave gently, move around slowly,

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.829
and almost never run into a wall.

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:21.480
However, as a group they do take up a lot of space, they give off a lot of heat, and lots of things get moved around.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.180
In these ways the room is changed by their
very presence.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.820
Now picture a five-year old's birthday party;
a very different situation.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.580
You would not call that quiet or formal.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.680
But that is not enough. Imagine the most popular
five-year old in the world.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.970
His birthday party; 300 kindergartners in
one room for several hours,

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.780
shoving each other, running like crazy, and
definitely banging into walls.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.760
Their bodies are smaller but because of their
faster motion,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.860
they collectively take up just as much of the room and give off just as much heat as the slow moving adults do.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.340
And things get shoved around just as much.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.740
Now imagine we have a surprise for those 300 adults at the state dinner all very formal and tucked in.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:06.340
There are 300 5-year-olds in the next room, bouncing off the walls and suddenly we drop the wall. Excellent.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.480
First of all those kids are going to run all around the room, squeezing in between the more sedate adults,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.920
that will cause the adults to move apart a little, maybe even bumping in a wall now and again.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.840
But because the adults are moving more slowly, they'll get in the way of the kids running and slow them down some,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.979
and that might even cause the kids to run
into the walls a little less often.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.520
The most important thing here is that the
overall bouncing against walls,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.340
will be equal to the bouncing of the adults plus the bouncing of the kids when they were in separate rooms.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.760
And you will not be shocked to find that we are currently in and amongst an elaborate analogy to do with gases.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:48.340
[Theme Music]

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.360
It shouldn't surprise you to learn that this
particular party was started by John Dalton,

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.020
the English teacher, the science teacher from
England.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.150
He wasn't an English teacher, he was English,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.369
who in 1803 was the first person to use real science to figure out what atoms are and how they behave.

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.580
His theory included a few misconceptions,
but it contained enough facts to be super useful.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.480
Daltons's atomic theory began when he expanded French chemist's Joseph Louis Proust's Law of Definite Proportions,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.200
to develop the Law of Multiple Proportions,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.730
which says elements combine in simple, whole
number ratios of their masses.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.610
But here's the cool part: That exact same
research also led to an important gas law.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.780
Dalton studied gases basically by mixing them
together.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.640
He was measuring how much of one element would
react with a given amount of another.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.430
But as he mixed those gases he noticed something
else.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.010
The total internal pressure of his container
was always equal to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.680
the sum of the individual pressures of the
gases that he had added.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.980
Upon recognizing that this happened every
single time no matter what gasses were used

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.340
or what amounts were added, Dalton stated
his discovery as the Law of Partial Pressures.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.140
As long as the gases don't react chemically,
the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.780
is equal to the sum of the pressures that the
individual gases would exert if they were alone.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.760
Here's an example; scuba tanks often contain
a mixture of oxygen for breathing, obviously,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.599
and helium which helps prevent decompression
sickness

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.239
because it's released from the blood more
readily than nitrogen in air.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.140
That allows divers to return to the surface more quickly with less risk of gas bubbles forming in their blood.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.700
We're going to use some approximations here so don't yell at me if you know exactly how big this tank is.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.060
But we're gonna say that it's 10 liters, and we'll to say that it contains 4 moles of helium and 1.1 moles of oxygen gas.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.860
The temperature in this room is about 22 degrees
Celsius or 295 Kelvin.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.069
So what's the total pressure inside the tank?

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.620
In order to solve that we need to know the
pressure exerted by each gas individually,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.780
and we can find that with the Ideal Gas Law.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.860
Starting with the helium, we don't know the
pressure so we're solving for P.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.900
The volume is 10 liters, and we have 4 moles
of helium.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.160
R is always the same, and the temperature
is 295 K.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.320
The calculations should show that the helium would have a pressure of 980 kilopascals, if it were alone.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.019
Now for the oxygen, all the numbers are the same except for the moles which is 1.1 for the oxygen.

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.899
According to the calculations, the oxygen
alone would have a pressure of 270 kilopascals.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.900
The Law of Partial Pressures says that the total pressure is equal to the sum of the individual pressures,

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:27.610
so in this case 980 plus 270 equals 1250 kilopascals,
or 1.25 megapascals.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.240
Eaaasy peasy.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.000
This additive property of pressures is closely related to the fact that mixing gases combines their particles,

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.430
thus increasing the total moles of gas present.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.819
The ratio of moles of the individual gases in a mixture to the total number of moles is called the mole fraction.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.120
And of course, mole fraction gets to have
its own little esoteric symbol to represent it,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.379
the lower case Greek letter, chi.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.559
Chi sub 1, the mole fraction of an individual gas
equals n sub 1, the number of moles of that gas,

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:58.789
divided by n sub total, the total number of
moles in the mixture.

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.099
And because the total number of moles is the
sum of the moles of all the gases,

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.669
we can also say that chi sub 1 equals the
moles of any one gas

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.349
divided by the sum of the moles of all the
individual gases.

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.609
You see how that last formula looks a lot
like the one for partial pressures?

00:05:14.609 --> 00:05:17.220
That's because they're basically the same
thing.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.120
Through the ideal gas law, the number of moles is directly related to the pressure of gas it exerts,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.700
as long as the volume and temperature remain
constant.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.419
So you may have figured this out already,

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.920
rather than having to calculate individual pressures first every time as we did with the scuba tank,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.919
or calculate the individual moles in the opposite
situation,

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.439
we can often calculate what we need directly
from what we already know.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.100
Let's give it a try. The air that we breathe is about 21% oxygen or 21 parts oxygen, and 100 parts air.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:50.920
What is the partial pressure of O2 in air
at a total atmospheric pressure of 97.8 kPa?

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.740
We can substitute moles for parts and use
the mole fraction formula to solve this problem.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.270
Plug in 21 moles of oxygen for the individual
gas and 100 moles for air for the total amount,

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.759
and then put in the total atmospheric pressure,
97.8 kPa and do the equation.

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.479
With correct rounding, that will give you
a partial pressure of 21 kilopascals for oxygen.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.300
Sometimes however, gases mix together in ways
that aren't so predictable.

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:18.520
For instance, one way to collect a gas is
by bubbling it through a column of water to

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.800
trap the gas at the end of the column.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.439
This is called collecting a gas over water.

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:28.270
The only problem is liquid water constantly
is giving off a small amount of water vapor.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.950
That's why if you leave a glass on a desk for long enough, there will eventually be no water in it.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.619
There's always going to be a few molecules
with enough kinetic energy to escape the liquid.

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:40.899
The amount of vapor that's released depends
on the temperature of the water.

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:43.839
The more heat energy it has, the more vapor
we get.

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:46.839
Like all gases, the water molecules move around
a lot,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.220
sometimes bump into the sides of the container,
thus creating pressure.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.179
This is called the water's vapor pressure.

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:56.080
The water molecules mix with the gas that
is being collected and when that happens,

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.169
as good ol' John Dalton taught us,

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:03.689
total pressure in the column equals the pressure of the collected gas plus the vapor pressure of the water.

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:06.599
So to know how much gas we really collected,

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:10.539
we have to subtract the vapor pressure of
the water from the total pressure.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:16.240
This gives us the pressure exerted from the collected gas and from that, we can calculate the moles of gas present.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.399
Here's how it's done.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.880
Here I have a tub of water and a graduated cylinder that I have put into the water and then filled with water,

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:26.300
so now you can see, it's got no gas in it,
just water.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.800
And we are going to capture gas in here and
see how much gas we can capture.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.600
Here I have a bottle and it's sealed with
this little tube.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.759
This is the only way for gas to get out of
here and in here right now I have vinegar,

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:40.550
an aqueous solution of acetic acid.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:46.420
This is baking soda; more properly sodium
hydrogen carbonate, or sodium bicarbonate.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.080
I think we all know what will happen when
this comes in contact with vinegar.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.480
Now to prevent that from happening before I want it to happen, I made it a little boat for it.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:03.320
And the boat is theoretically, I hope, going
to sit on top of the level of the vinegar,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:09.480
and float there without spilling.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I did it.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.860
Before the big action scene, let's talk about
what's actually happening chemically speaking

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.089
because as you know, I love to speak chemically.

00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:25.280
The acetic acid and sodium bicarbonate combine to form sodium acetate, carbon dioxide and water.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.580
The sodium acetate dissolves readily in water
and will stay that way.

00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:32.219
The carbon dioxide, on the other hand, is
the source of all our fun.

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:35.659
It's a gas and it forms so many little bubbles
in the surrounding liquid

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.919
that it's almost a foam expanding quickly
and dramatically.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.490
As the carbon dioxide escapes through the
foam,

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:46.589
it goes through the tubing and bubbles through the column of water so we get double the bubbles; double the fun.

00:08:46.589 --> 00:08:52.109
And don't forget, at the end we will be able to calculate how many moles of CO2 are produced by this reaction.

00:08:52.109 --> 00:08:53.100
Let's get to it.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.100
It going to take more than two hands to do
this so I have a lab assistant with me today.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.560
This is Michael Aranda.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.840
All right Michael put the tube into the cylinder
there, and I get to do the fun part,

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.990
which is to shake this and make bubbles.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:15.879
Bubbles!
Little more, little more.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:30.000
So we have collected exactly, about 9, almost exactly 90 milliliters, like 90.5 milliliters of carbon dioxide.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.380
You can go away now.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:38.180
We also know because I know that the atmospheric
pressure is 101.8 kilopascals.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.920
Remember we also need to know what the vapor pressure of the water was that we have to subtract.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.960
The amount of vapor pressure that the water
gives off depends on its temperature,

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.459
and there's a table we can look at.

00:09:48.459 --> 00:09:50.560
The water is at 19 degrees Celsius.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.910
According to the table, the vapor pressure
is 2.2 kilopascals.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.839
So now finding the pressure of the carbon
dioxide alone is easy.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:04.320
We simply subtract 2.2 kilopascals from 101.8 to give us a pressure of 99.6 kilopascals for the carbon dioxide.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.720
Finally we have to make sure the pressure inside the graduated cylinder is the same as the atmospheric pressure

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.960
and to do that, we just have to make sure that the levels of both of the liquids are the same.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:21.300
In doing that I can see that it is almost exactly 90 milliliters of carbon dioxide in the cylinder.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.880
Now we plug everything into the Ideal Gas
Law.

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:30.389
P is 99.6 kilopascals, V is 0.090 liters,
n is what we are trying to find,

00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:34.189
R is always the same, and the temperature
is 292 Kelvin.

00:10:34.189 --> 00:10:40.260
One quick calculation and we find that we
have collected 0.0037 moles of CO2.

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:45.360
At a molar mass of 44 grams per mole that's
0.16 grams of carbon dioxide.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.519
I am excited by our success here! That might
not sound like a lot,

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.420
but collecting a fairly substantial amount of gases and being able to make accurate measurements of them

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.810
with a simple apparatus like that is pretty
impressive.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.930
For me, it sounds like time for party.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.750
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:07.980
If you weren't late to the party, you learned
that John Dalton built both his theory of the atom

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.689
and his Law of Partial Pressures on the foundation
laid by Joseph Louis Proust

00:11:12.689 --> 00:11:16.829
and that you can add up the pressures of mixed
gases just as you can do with their amounts.

00:11:16.829 --> 00:11:20.220
You also learned that the chemical reaction
that occurs with vinegar and baking soda,

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.939
how to collect a gas over water,

00:11:21.939 --> 00:11:26.079
and how to use that technique to figure out
exactly how much of the gas you have.

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:28.480
