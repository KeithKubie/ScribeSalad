00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.320
In the last video, we
learned that 380,000 years

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.580
after the Big Bang,
which is still

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.910
roughly 13.7 billion years
ago, every point-- I shouldn't

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.270
say every point--
every atom in space

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.670
that was kind of at this
roughly 3,000 Kelvin temperature

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.250
was emitting this
electromagnetic radiation.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.680
Since every point in space was,
there were points in space,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.560
or there was points
in the universe,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.360
that that radiation is
only just now reaching us.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.172
It has been traveling
for 13.7 billion years.

00:00:33.172 --> 00:00:34.630
So when we look at
radiation that's

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.230
been traveling for that long,
we can look at any direction

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.980
and we'll see this
uniform radiation.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.620
And that radiation has been
red-shifted into the microwave

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.080
range from the
higher frequencies

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.000
that it was actually emitted at.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.390
Now, a question that
might pop in your brain

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.050
is, well, what happens if
we wait a billion years?

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.990
Because if we wait
a billion years,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.480
if we have 1,000,380,000
years after the beginning

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.730
of the universe, this stuff
won't just be atoms anymore.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.480
It will have started to
condense into actual stars.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.350
The universe at
every point in space

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.700
will no longer be this uniform.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.040
We'll actually start having
condensation into stars.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.880
So if we move forward a little
bit, the universe will expand.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.230
Maybe I'll just draw a half
of it since it's expanded.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.900
It's obviously
expanded much more.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.670
But now all of a sudden,
we actually have stars.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.614
These are no longer
just uniform atoms

00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:33.780
spread through the universe.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.700
We actually have
condensation into stars.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.290
And so if you look at
what is being emitted

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.360
from the points in space from
which we're only now getting

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.010
this cosmic background
radiation, if we wait

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.000
a billion years,
the light that we

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.230
see from those points
in space will not

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.560
look like this
uniform radiation.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.410
It'll start to look
a little bit more

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.657
like the more mature
parts of the universe.

00:01:58.657 --> 00:02:00.490
We'll essentially be
looking at the universe

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.530
a billion years after the Big
Bang, when stars have formed,

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.440
other structures have formed.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.410
So the question is
in a billion years,

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.494
will this cosmic microwave
background radiation disappear.

00:02:10.494 --> 00:02:15.560
And I'm using billion just
to arbitrarily use a number.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.460
But will it
eventually disappear?

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.250
And the answer to
that is yes and no.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.630
So to think about it, it is
true that this point in space

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.050
will mature.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.180
It will mature in
a billion years.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.190
It will no longer
be this uniform--

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.252
I guess this uniform haze
of hot hydrogen atoms.

00:02:35.252 --> 00:02:36.710
But what you have
to think about is

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.460
there were further
points in the universe.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.610
 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.060
At that same time, there
were further points

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.030
that were also emitting
this radiation.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.700
And the original photons
from those original points

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.636
still haven't gotten to us.

00:02:54.636 --> 00:02:56.510
So from those further
out points-- right now,

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.880
the observable universe
is-- we can only

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.700
see electromagnetic
radiation that's

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.167
been traveling for
13.7 billion years.

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:05.750
In another billion
years, the universe

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.139
will be a billion years older.

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.680
And then there will
be radiation that

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.650
has been traveling for
14.7 billion years.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.830
And so we will start
to observe that.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.882
And we'll start to observe that
radiation from the same time

00:03:16.882 --> 00:03:17.840
period in the universe.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.820
It'll just be from further out.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.390
Now, what I want
to make clear is,

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.121
is that since those points
were even further out, where

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:27.120
that radiation was emitted,
the stuff that we'll

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.860
see in a billion years, it
will be even more red-shifted.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:37.460
 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.700
So at that point, the cosmic
background radiation we see

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.540
will have longer wavelengths
than the radio spectrum.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.850
It will be redder

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.820
And I should say redder
because we're already more--

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.360
would "redder" have two Ds?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.020
I've never written "redder."

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.260
Well, it would be more red
than the microwave radiation.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.760
And, of course,
that's a funny thing

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.370
because microwave
radiation is already

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.690
more red than actual
visible red light.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.656
It has a longer wavelength.

00:04:05.656 --> 00:04:06.905
Now, this will keep happening.

00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:10.600
And it'll keep happening.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.054
We'll keep getting radiation
as we go further and further

00:04:13.054 --> 00:04:13.720
into the future.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.160
We'll keep getting
radiation from further out

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.269
points in space.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.970
And it'll get more
and more red-shifted.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.770
The actual wave lengths of
that electromagnetic light

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.000
will be bigger, and
bigger, and bigger.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.067
Until we really aren't
able to even see it

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:28.650
as electromagnetic
light because it'll

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.380
be red-shifted to infinity.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.280
It'll have an
infinite wavelength.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.210
And to make that
point clear, I want

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.750
to show you that at
some point, there

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.000
will be kind of a threshold
where we can't even

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.170
get radiation from further out.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.800
And let me draw a
diagram of that.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.150
So let's say that
this is the universe.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.200
Let's say that this is the
universe 13.7 billion years

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.300
ago, right when that
radiation, what we

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.840
now see as cosmic microwave
background radiation,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.541
right when it started
to be admitted.

00:04:56.541 --> 00:04:58.040
And let's say that
this is the point

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.670
in the universe
where we are now.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.380
So this is us.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.720
Let's say that this is the point
in the universe where we now

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.430
observe the background
radiation-- or this is

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.180
one of the points.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.170
We obviously could form
a circle around us.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.700
It could be any of
these points over here,

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.240
where the photons, the
electromagnetic radiation that

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.261
were emitted from this
point, 380,000 years

00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:26.760
after the beginning
of the universe,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.140
is only just now reaching us.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.330
So this is the point in
the universe from which we

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.710
are observing the cosmic
background radiation.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.970
And let me be very clear.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.420
That point in the
universe has now

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.820
matured into things that
look-- into stars and galaxies

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.700
and planets.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.680
And if they were to look
at our point in space,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.941
they are also going to see
cosmic background radiation

00:05:47.941 --> 00:05:48.440
from us.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.600
It's not like some type
of permanently old place.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.140
It's just the light we're
getting from them right now is

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.060
old light, light that
that point in space

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.460
emitted way before
it was able to mature

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.960
into actual structures.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.340
So this is the point
in space from which

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.110
we are receiving cosmic
background radiation right now.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.760
I don't want to write all that.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.750
It'll take me forever.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.100
Now, let's take
another point in space

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.910
that's whatever
this distance is.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.100
Well, it's actually
estimated to be about-- now,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.840
it's estimated to be about
46 billion light years.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.850
At that time, when things were
just beginning to be emitted,

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.570
this was only about 36
million light years.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.240
And this is a very
rough estimate.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.531
I shouldn't even write it down.

00:06:34.531 --> 00:06:37.139
Because that's really based on
how fast we assume the universe

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.930
is expanding and all
of that type of thing.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.410
But it was just a lot smaller
than 46 billion light years.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.760
Now let's go that same distance
again from this point in space.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.760
So let me make it clear.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.870
This is 380,000 years ago.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.910
Now let's fast forward.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.540
Let's fast forward-- sorry,
not 380,000 years ago,

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.540
380,000 years
after the Big Bang,

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:07.070
which is approximately-- it's
still 13.7 billion years ago.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.310
So that's then.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.820
Now let's look at now.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.910
And now I'll just draw
it a little bit bigger.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.350
It's actually going to
be much, much bigger now.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.920
Now, if we do it a little
bit bigger-- so when

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.680
I draw it like this,
this is where we are now.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.790
This point in space from which
we are only now receiving

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.920
that cosmic background
radiation is over here.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.430
And then this other point in
space is going to be over here.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.690
And we saw in the video on the
actual size of the observable

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.800
universe, not just what it
appears to be based on how long

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.910
the light's been travelling,
this is now on the order of 46

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.850
or 47 billion light years.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.174
 

00:07:47.174 --> 00:07:48.590
And so this distance
is also going

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.330
to be 46 billion light years.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.950
 

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.530
Now, every point in
space, back then,

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.900
was emitting this radiation.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.690
We have this uniform radiation.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.120
It was just hydrogen atoms
everywhere, these hot hydrogen

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.767
atoms.

00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:09.100
Maybe I should just do it in
the color of the radiation.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.760
So this guy's
receiving-- I'm just

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.350
showing it's coming
from this guy.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.030
We're only now, 13.7 billion
years in the future, receiving

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.790
photons from this guy, only
now are we receiving it.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.240
And frankly, this
green guy, only

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.630
now is going to be
receiving photons.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.900
When he looks at the point
in space, or the things

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.050
that he thinks are points
in space out there,

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.309
he will see that
uniform radiation.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.480
And likewise, this guy
over here will only now

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.549
be receiving photons
from the point

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:40.750
in space for where we are now.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.020
He'll see the universe
where we are now

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.230
as it was 380,000 years
after the Big Bang.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.880
And same thing from that
point in space, the photons

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.707
will only just now reach.

00:08:50.707 --> 00:08:51.790
Now, let's think about it.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:57.960
It took this guy's photons--
let me make it clear.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.290
It took him 13.7 billion
years to reach this point

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.920
over here, which is now 46
billion light years away

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.080
from us.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.990
And the universe
continues to expand.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.650
Depending on if the universe
expands fast enough,

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.580
there's no way that that
photon that got to this guy,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.000
will eventually get to this.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.920
The universe is expanding
faster than the light can never

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.870
even catch up to us.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.180
And this light will never,
ever, ever get to us.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.430
And so there is some
threshold, some distance,

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.980
from which we will never get
light during this time period

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.490
or actually from which
we will never, ever get

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.380
any electromagnetic radiation.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.400
So the simple answer is the
cosmic background radiation

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.430
from this-- or the cosmic
background radiation

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.460
from this point, yes,
it will start to mature.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.480
It won't be as uniform if we go
fast forward 400 million years

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.500
or a billion years.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.120
But we will get uniform
radiation from further out.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.720
But it will be even
more red-shifted.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.807
And the further forward
we get into the future,

00:09:55.807 --> 00:09:57.640
the background radiation
we get will be from

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.390
further and further
out and it will

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.854
be more and more and
more red-shifted.

00:10:01.854 --> 00:10:03.270
Until some point,
where it's going

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.380
to be so red-shifted that
we won't even observe it

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.060
as electromagnetic radiation.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.740
And there's some threshold where
we won't even observe anything

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.150
anymore because beyond
that, the light wasn't

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.090
able to actually get to us.
