00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.150
Real machines have memory hierarchies.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.350
That means, that between a processor and

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.720
a primary storage device like a disk,
there are layers of memory in between.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.190
And as you get closer to the processor,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.500
those memories get faster but
also smaller.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.550
Now the difference in all of the size,
latency, and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.700
bandwidth between successive levels,
might be an order of magnitude.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.810
Unfortunately, our usual model of
an algorithm doesn't distinguish

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.560
between the size and
speed of these different memories.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.380
Yet, if you want to achieve high
performance, and you know you do, then

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.410
you need to design your algorithms to
take advantage of the memory hierarchy.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.540
Now, sometimes the hardware or operating
system can manage these memories for

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.230
you, automatically.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.190
But using these memories
optimally is hard.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.760
So try as they might,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.800
these automatic schemes can't
completely solve the problem for you.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.120
And that means the onus is on you
to work your algorithmic magic.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.250
This lesson is designed
to help you get started.
