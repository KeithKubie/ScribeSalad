00:00:06.783 --> 00:00:08.988
You know how sometimes
you go to bake a cake

00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:10.959
but your bananas have all gone rotten,

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:12.437
your utensils have rusted,

00:00:12.437 --> 00:00:15.968
you trip and pour all of your baking soda
into the vinegar jug,

00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:18.019
and then your oven explodes?

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.873
My friend, you and your chemical reactions
have fallen victim to enthalpy and entropy

00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:26.379
and, boy, are they forces 
to be reckoned with.

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:28.656
Now, your reactants are all products.

00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:33.066
So, what are these "E" words,
and what's their big idea?

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.585
Let's start with enthalpy,

00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:39.360
an increase or decrease of energy
during a chemical reaction.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.834
Every molecule has a certain amount
of chemical potential energy

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.627
stored within the bonds between its atoms.

00:00:45.627 --> 00:00:49.036
Chemicals with more energy 
are less stable,

00:00:49.036 --> 00:00:52.311
and thus, more likely to react.

00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:55.043
Let's visualize the energy flow 
in a reaction,

00:00:55.043 --> 00:01:00.896
the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen,
by playing a round of crazy golf.

00:01:00.896 --> 00:01:04.943
Our goal is to get a ball, the reactant,
up a small rise

00:01:04.943 --> 00:01:08.016
and down the other much steeper slope.

00:01:08.016 --> 00:01:11.439
Where the hill goes up,
we need to add energy to the ball,

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.220
and where it goes down, the ball releases
energy into its surroundings.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.400
The hole represents the product,
or result of the reaction.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.126
When the reaction period ends,
the ball is inside the hole,

00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:26.573
and we have our product: water.

00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:30.587
This, like when our oven exploded,
is an exothermic reaction,

00:01:30.587 --> 00:01:35.307
meaning that the chemical's final energy
is less than its starting energy,

00:01:35.307 --> 00:01:38.325
and the difference has been added
to the surrounding environment

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:40.514
as light and heat.

00:01:40.514 --> 00:01:43.116
We can also play out
the opposite type of reaction,

00:01:43.116 --> 00:01:44.851
an endothermic reaction,

00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:48.483
where the final energy is greater 
than the starting energy.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.632
That's what we were trying 
to achieve by baking our cake.

00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:54.752
The added heat from the oven would 
change the chemical structure

00:01:54.752 --> 00:01:59.119
of the proteins in the eggs
and various compounds in the butter.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.235
So that's enthalpy.

00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:02.498
As you might suspect,

00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:06.866
exothermic reactions are more likely 
to happen than endothermic ones

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:10.429
because they require less energy to occur.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.647
But there's another independent factor
that can make reactions happen:

00:02:13.647 --> 00:02:15.250
entropy.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.652
Entropy measures a chemical's randomness.

00:02:18.652 --> 00:02:21.514
Here's an enormous pyramid of golf balls.

00:02:21.514 --> 00:02:24.533
Its ordered structure 
means it has low entropy.

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:28.228
However, when it collapses, 
we have chaos everywhere,

00:02:28.228 --> 00:02:30.351
balls bouncing high and wide.

00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:34.202
So much so that some 
even go over the hill.

00:02:34.202 --> 00:02:37.332
This shift to instability, 
or higher entropy,

00:02:37.332 --> 00:02:40.046
can allow reactions to happen.

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:42.745
As with the golf balls, 
in actual chemicals

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:48.239
this transition from structure to disorder
gets some reactants past the hump

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.723
and lets them start a reaction.

00:02:50.723 --> 00:02:53.671
You can see both enthalpy
and entropy at play

00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:56.784
when you go to light 
a campfire to cook dinner.

00:02:56.784 --> 00:02:58.433
Your match adds enough energy

00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:01.930
to activate the exothermic reaction
of combustion,

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.616
converting the high-energy 
combustible material in the wood

00:03:05.616 --> 00:03:09.377
to lower energy carbon dioxide and water.

00:03:09.377 --> 00:03:13.780
Entropy also increases
and helps the reaction along

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.484
because the neat, organized log of wood

00:03:16.484 --> 00:03:21.589
is now converted into randomly moving
water vapor and carbon dioxide.

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:24.012
The energy shed by this 
exothermic reaction

00:03:24.012 --> 00:03:27.889
powers the endothermic reaction
of cooking your dinner.

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.557
Bon app√©tit!
