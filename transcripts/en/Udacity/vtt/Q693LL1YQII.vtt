00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.130
It's time to take a deep breath.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.560
We've covered a lot of
territory in this lesson.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.440
We've learned about the core rationales
for HIT adoption, and we deepened

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.000
our understanding of the link between it
and success in managing chronic disease.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.990
And how that link led to new federal
policies to encourage adoption.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.785
We've learned that those polices
are divided into three interrelated

00:00:26.785 --> 00:00:31.780
efforts to assure that EHRs
have key capabilities.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.650
That they're used in a manner
that is believed will lead to

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.730
improved care coordination and
ultimately to improved outcomes.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.470
And that financial incentives are there
to reimburse providers and hospitals for

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.540
the cost of these systems and to provide
ongoing incentives to use them properly.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.340
We've seen that adoption levels
are quite high, but that survey data

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.880
reveals some dissatisfaction
with current EHR systems.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.930
We'll look more deeply into why
that is the case in lesson six,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.790
as we begin to look at real-world
applications of health IT in

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.470
the second half of the course.
