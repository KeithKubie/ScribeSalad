00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.330
A, B and C are
collinear, and B is

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:11.470
between A and C. The ratio
of AB to AC is 2 to 5.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.310
If is A is at negative 6 comma
9, and B is at negative 2 comma

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.780
3, what are the
coordinates of point C?

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.760
And I encourage you to
now pause this video

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.130
and try this on your own.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.510
So let's try to visualize this.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.910
So A is at negative 6 comma 9.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.430
B, let's see, it's less negative
in the horizontal direction,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.660
it's lower in the
vertical direction.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.150
So we could put B
right over here.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.530
B is at the point
negative 2 comma 3.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.182
And that C, it's
going to be collinear,

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:49.890
so we're going to go
along the same line,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.390
let me draw that line right now.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:59.815
So it's going to be
collinear and they tell us

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:05.450
that the ratio of
AB to AC is 2 to 5.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.940
So B is going to
be 2/5 of the way.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.490
So let's say C is--
I'm just trying

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.880
to eyeball it right now--
let's put C right over here.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.260
And we don't know
C's coordinates.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.790
Well the way we
could think about it

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.010
is to break it up into
horizontal change in coordinate

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.110
and vertical change
in coordinate,

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.400
and apply the same ratio.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.360
So for example, what is
the horizontal change

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.740
in coordinates
going from A to B?

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.150
Well let's draw that.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.000
Going from A to B, so
this is A's x-coordinate,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.380
it's at negative 6.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.190
B's x-coordinate
is at negative 2.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.250
So it's this change
right over here.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.020
This is the horizontal
change that we care about.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.070
Now what is that?

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.970
Well if you start at negative
6 and you go to negative 2,

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.890
you have increased by 4.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.150
Another way of thinking about it
is negative 2 minus negative 6

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.539
is the same thing as negative 2
plus 6, which is going to be 4.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.130
Now the ratio between
this change and the change

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.620
of the x-coordinate between A
and C is going to be 2 to 5.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.890
So let's call that change,
this entire change,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.210
let's call this x.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.480
So we could say that the ratio
between 4 and x is equal to--

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.360
and notice this is the
horizontal change from A to B

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.470
just if you look on
the horizontal axis--

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.030
so the ratio of
that, which is 4,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.250
to the horizontal
change between A and C,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.580
well that's going to have
to be the same ratio.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.930
So it's going to be 2/5.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.540
Now to solve for x,
a fun thing might

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.810
be to just take the
reciprocal of both sides.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.640
So x/4 is equal to 5/2.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.470
We can multiply
both sides times 4

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.630
and we are left with x is equal
to 5 times 4 divided by 2,

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.350
which is equal to 10.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.320
So the change in x from
A to C is going to be 10.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.000
So what does that tell us
about C's x-coordinate?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.800
So we could start with
A's x-coordinate, which

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.912
is negative 6, add 10 to
it, negative 6 plus 10 is 4.

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.370
So we figured out
the x-coordinate,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.130
now we just have to do
the same thing for the y.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.910
So what is the change
in y going from A to B?

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.130
Well here, we go from 9
to 3, we've gone down 6.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.130
Another way you could say it
is, 3 minus 9 is negative 6.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.630
To find the change,
you could think,

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.170
I'm just taking the end
point and subtracting

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.330
from that the starting point.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.060
Negative 2 minus negative
6 was positive 4.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.422
3 minus 9 is negative 6.

00:04:00.422 --> 00:04:01.630
Or you could just look at it.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.980
We've gone down 6, so we
can write negative 6 here.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.570
Now our change in y,
we're going to have

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.790
to have that same ratio.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.690
So our change in
y between A and C,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.839
let's just call that distance y.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.640
So our change in y is,
that's our change in y.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.640
And we're going to have
to have the same ratios.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.610
So we could write that the
ratio between our change in y

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.590
from A to B, which
is negative 6,

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.310
to the ratio between
our change in y

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.160
from A to C, negative
6 to y, is once again

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.070
going to be equal to 2 to 5.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.730
Once again, we could take
the reciprocal of both sides,

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.890
y over negative 6 is
equal to 5 over 2,

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.170
multiply both sides
times negative 6,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.150
and we are left with y is
equal to 5 times negative 6

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.240
is negative 30, divided
by 2 is negative 15.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.140
So our change in y,
or I guess our change

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.030
in our vertical axis, which
we're calling y in this case,

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.010
is negative 15.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.020
So here, if our y
value is 9 and if we

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.230
were to subtract 15 from
that, where does that put us?

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.642
Well 9 minus 15 is
going to put us at 6.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.040
So the coordinates for point C
are at-- oh, sorry 9 minus 15

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.780
is going put us at negative 6.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.600
I almost made a
careless mistake.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.860
9 minus 15 is negative 6.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.270
I was wondering, this seems
very low to be at 0.6.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.395
So 4 comma negative 6 is
the coordinates of point C.
