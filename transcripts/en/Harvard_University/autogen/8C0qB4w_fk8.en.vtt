00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.640
patient describing your symptoms and the
person can make the diagnosis that's

person can make the diagnosis that's
 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.960

kind of classically how we think about

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970
kind of classically how we think about
 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.000
kind of classically how we think about
it but there's a lot of asynchronous use

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010
it but there's a lot of asynchronous use
 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.340
it but there's a lot of asynchronous use
so asynchronous would be something like

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350
so asynchronous would be something like
 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.430
so asynchronous would be something like
a physician takes a photograph of a skin

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440
a physician takes a photograph of a skin
 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.830

day might review it and give his or her
 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.820
day might review it and give his or her
assessment of what's going on and then a

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830
assessment of what's going on and then a
 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.010
assessment of what's going on and then a
major use of telehealth is around remote

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020
major use of telehealth is around remote
 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.029
major use of telehealth is around remote
monitoring and here the idea is an e I

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039
monitoring and here the idea is an e I
 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.500

see you by the way sort of probably the

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510
see you by the way sort of probably the
 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.540
see you by the way sort of probably the
most widely used and well-known of this

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550
most widely used and well-known of this
 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.330
most widely used and well-known of this
which is you have a physician sitting

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340
which is you have a physician sitting
 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.159

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169
somewhere far away monitoring ICU
 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.930

patients in a hospital maybe hundreds or

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940
patients in a hospital maybe hundreds or
 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.790
patients in a hospital maybe hundreds or
thousands of miles away but there are

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800
thousands of miles away but there are
 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.260
thousands of miles away but there are
lots of ways in which you can use remote

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270
lots of ways in which you can use remote
 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.659
lots of ways in which you can use remote
monitoring the fundamental notion of

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669
monitoring the fundamental notion of
 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.520
monitoring the fundamental notion of
telehealth is that it is platform

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530
telehealth is that it is platform
 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.430
telehealth is that it is platform
agnostic and what I mean by that is you

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440
agnostic and what I mean by that is you
 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.140

can be doing this using a PC you can be

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150
can be doing this using a PC you can be
 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.240
can be doing this using a PC you can be
doing this on it on a tablet you can be

doing this on it on a tablet you can be
 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.460
doing this on it on a tablet you can be
doing this on a mobile phone so how

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470
doing this on a mobile phone so how
 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.950
doing this on a mobile phone so how
widespread is the use of of telehealth

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960
widespread is the use of of telehealth
 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.300
widespread is the use of of telehealth
well I would argue that

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310
well I would argue that
 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.120
well I would argue that
we don't really have a great a great

precise number but share a few data

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710
precise number but share a few data
 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.400
precise number but share a few data
points with you guys so form a survey

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410
points with you guys so form a survey
 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.840
points with you guys so form a survey
about two years ago of American

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850
about two years ago of American
 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.390
about two years ago of American
hospitals about half of all American

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400
hospitals about half of all American
 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.620
hospitals about half of all American
hospitals said they were using

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630
hospitals said they were using
 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.160
hospitals said they were using
telehealth on a regular basis that

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170
telehealth on a regular basis that
 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.630
telehealth on a regular basis that
number in the last couple years has

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640
number in the last couple years has
 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.580
number in the last couple years has
probably grown and I would say that that

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590
probably grown and I would say that that
 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.890
probably grown and I would say that that
probably was an underestimate and so if

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900
probably was an underestimate and so if
 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.230
probably was an underestimate and so if
you just look at the US you would assume

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240
you just look at the US you would assume
 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.270
you just look at the US you would assume
that a vast majority of hospitals now

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280
that a vast majority of hospitals now
 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.010
that a vast majority of hospitals now
are using telehealth in one form or

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020
are using telehealth in one form or
 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.960
are using telehealth in one form or
another and obviously this is not just

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970
another and obviously this is not just
 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.640

all kinds are using it internationally
we don't have comparable data so I can't

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150
we don't have comparable data so I can't

we don't have comparable data so I can't
tell you what that number looks like in

tell you what that number looks like in
 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.980
tell you what that number looks like in
England or Denmark or Germany but if you

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990
England or Denmark or Germany but if you
 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.960

investments happening and telehealth

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800
investments happening and telehealth
 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.630

countries around the world are using

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640
countries around the world are using
 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.440

an incredible program that's trying to
figure out how to keep rural older

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910
figure out how to keep rural older

than they would have otherwise using
 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.860
than they would have otherwise using
telehealth so a lot of creative uses

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870
telehealth so a lot of creative uses
 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.000
telehealth so a lot of creative uses
across the globe and you'll hear about a

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010
across the globe and you'll hear about a
 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.160
across the globe and you'll hear about a
bunch more of those so the big question

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.170
bunch more of those so the big question
 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.480
bunch more of those so the big question
of course is does it work

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490
of course is does it work
 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.970
of course is does it work
and what do we mean by does it work well

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980
and what do we mean by does it work well
 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.400
and what do we mean by does it work well
does it improve access does it improve

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410
does it improve access does it improve
 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.730
does it improve access does it improve
quality does it lower cost I would argue

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740
quality does it lower cost I would argue
 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.950
quality does it lower cost I would argue
that the evidence here is still pretty

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960
that the evidence here is still pretty
 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.230
that the evidence here is still pretty
early it's not very strong but it is

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.750
early it's not very strong but it is
growing rapidly

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:45.760
growing rapidly

growing rapidly
where the evidence is best as it

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020
where the evidence is best as it
 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.600
where the evidence is best as it
improves access especially for people

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610
improves access especially for people
 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.160
improves access especially for people
who don't have access to physicians and

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.170
who don't have access to physicians and
 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.830
who don't have access to physicians and
nurses there is some evidence that it

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840
nurses there is some evidence that it
 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.170
nurses there is some evidence that it
leads to better care where the evidence

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180
leads to better care where the evidence
 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.420
leads to better care where the evidence
is the weakest is around cost savings

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430
is the weakest is around cost savings
 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.310

it's been chattered catted about a lot

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320
it's been chattered catted about a lot
 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.660
it's been chattered catted about a lot
that somehow this is a technology that's

that somehow this is a technology that's
 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.100
that somehow this is a technology that's
going to save us a lot of money

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110
going to save us a lot of money
 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.740
going to save us a lot of money
I am deeply skeptical I have not seen

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750
I am deeply skeptical I have not seen
 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.990
I am deeply skeptical I have not seen
the evidence that it is a big cost

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000
the evidence that it is a big cost
 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.750
the evidence that it is a big cost
saving my take is it is worth doing for

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:10.760
saving my take is it is worth doing for
 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.000
saving my take is it is worth doing for
the quality and access alone if there

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.010
the quality and access alone if there
 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.500
the quality and access alone if there
are cost savings to be had we have not

ago in the New York Times there was a

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550
ago in the New York Times there was a
 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.670
ago in the New York Times there was a
piece about that how the Texas Medical

the growth of telehealth across Texas

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:31.310
the growth of telehealth across Texas

the growth of telehealth across Texas
their argument

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240
their argument
 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.969
their argument
is that patients should have established

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979
is that patients should have established
 

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:36.830
is that patients should have established
relationships with physicians before

do it but with telemedicine that
 

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.620

incredible to care to get inside of a

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.610
that began in 2003 over 40,000 of them
were veterans that we helped to live in

applications now why do you think now

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:38.030
applications now why do you think now
 

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:40.300
applications now why do you think now
and and what has been the holdup and

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:40.310
and and what has been the holdup and
 

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.180
and and what has been the holdup and
then let's address maybe you know what

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:43.190
then let's address maybe you know what

doesn't mean the ACL concept is wrong

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:51.460
doesn't mean the ACL concept is wrong

patient-centered care I think one of the

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:13.810
patient-centered care I think one of the
 

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:17.640
patient-centered care I think one of the
problems is that we're trying to do many

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:17.650
problems is that we're trying to do many
 

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:22.080
problems is that we're trying to do many
things because in fact creating new ways

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:22.090
things because in fact creating new ways

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.090
improves access improves quality I think
there is as she's mentioned evidence for

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:30.100
there is as she's mentioned evidence for
 

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.000
there is as she's mentioned evidence for
that the problem is that when you

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:33.010
that the problem is that when you
 

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:35.040
that the problem is that when you
measure the cost of those things you

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:35.050
measure the cost of those things you
 

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:38.850
measure the cost of those things you
measure in costs of more people being

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:38.860
measure in costs of more people being
 

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.950
measure in costs of more people being
involved in the system and who are

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960
involved in the system and who are
 

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.770
involved in the system and who are
getting better care and so it may be

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:43.780
getting better care and so it may be
 

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.380
getting better care and so it may be
that the cost is going up or it may be

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:46.390
that the cost is going up or it may be
 

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:48.390
that the cost is going up or it may be
going up for one piece and coming down

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400
going up for one piece and coming down
 

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.850
going up for one piece and coming down
as you mentioned for another piece but

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:50.860
as you mentioned for another piece but
 

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:54.300
as you mentioned for another piece but
few people are looking at the whole

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:54.310
few people are looking at the whole
 

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.460
few people are looking at the whole
system and saying what is the net change

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:56.470
system and saying what is the net change
 

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:59.820
system and saying what is the net change
in total costs to the system because

00:40:59.820 --> 00:40:59.830
in total costs to the system because
 

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.110
in total costs to the system because
certainly in this country there is no

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:01.120
certainly in this country there is no
 

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.690
certainly in this country there is no
system and in most other places there

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:03.700
system and in most other places there
 

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.330
system and in most other places there
are just a multitude of players each of

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:06.340
are just a multitude of players each of
 

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.430
are just a multitude of players each of
whom only has a particular lens on the

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:08.440
whom only has a particular lens on the
 

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.300
whom only has a particular lens on the
problem so I think that kind of

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:11.310
problem so I think that kind of
 

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:15.150
problem so I think that kind of

system-wide looking at what's changing
 

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.130
system-wide looking at what's changing
and how are we going to measure costs in

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:17.140
and how are we going to measure costs in
 

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:20.029
and how are we going to measure costs in
a more rigorous way is really need

00:41:20.029 --> 00:41:20.039
a more rigorous way is really need
 

00:41:20.039 --> 00:41:23.700
a more rigorous way is really need

certainly well smarter than me talk
 

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.849
certainly well smarter than me talk
about this all the time but you know

00:41:35.849 --> 00:41:35.859
about this all the time but you know
 

00:41:35.859 --> 00:41:37.349
about this all the time but you know
when you think about a system that it's

00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359
when you think about a system that it's
 

00:41:37.359 --> 00:41:40.289
when you think about a system that it's

provocative question to this panel

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:22.500
provocative question to this panel
 

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.800
provocative question to this panel
should these people these primary care

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:25.810
should these people these primary care

should they be compensated for this in
 

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:34.099
should they be compensated for this in
some modest way I think they should

00:44:34.099 --> 00:44:34.109
some modest way I think they should
 

00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:36.839
some modest way I think they should
because I think that not only are they

00:44:36.839 --> 00:44:36.849
because I think that not only are they
 

00:44:36.849 --> 00:44:40.770
because I think that not only are they
having time their time utilization but

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:40.780
having time their time utilization but
 

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.190
having time their time utilization but
there's also medical malpractice

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200
there's also medical malpractice
 

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.120

implication here as well and I just

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:45.130
implication here as well and I just
 

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:48.589

wanted if the panel could adjust that I

00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599

think they should be compensated in a
 

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.849
think they should be compensated in a
new regulatory way which I think would

00:44:53.849 --> 00:44:53.859
new regulatory way which I think would
 

00:44:53.859 --> 00:44:56.490
new regulatory way which I think would
decrease hundreds of thousands of

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:56.500

said 99% good medicine but I think this
 

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:06.180
said 99% good medicine but I think this
should be compensated and so I could I

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:06.190
should be compensated and so I could I
 

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:09.690
should be compensated and so I could I
have the panel answer that question so I

need to carefully study this stuff and

00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:09.610
need to carefully study this stuff and
 

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:11.280
need to carefully study this stuff and
understand what's the optimal way to pay

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:11.290
understand what's the optimal way to pay
 

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:13.920
understand what's the optimal way to pay
for these services so we use just the

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:13.930
for these services so we use just the
 

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:16.260
for these services so we use just the
right amount to get the right care thank

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:16.270
right amount to get the right care thank

away what is one thing that you can

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:28.690
away what is one thing that you can

think of what one impediment that could

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880
think of what one impediment that could
 

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.670

would that would help to improve access

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:35.530
would that would help to improve access
 

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:39.090
would that would help to improve access
to telemedicine so mine would be to kind

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:39.100
to telemedicine so mine would be to kind
 

00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:41.130
to telemedicine so mine would be to kind
of go back to the concern that I raised

00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:41.140
of go back to the concern that I raised
 

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:42.780

initially where we are starting to see

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:42.790
initially where we are starting to see
 

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:44.670
initially where we are starting to see
some amount of pushback we have states

00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:44.680
some amount of pushback we have states
 

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.880
some amount of pushback we have states
that are worried about this technology

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:46.890
that are worried about this technology
 

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:49.860
that are worried about this technology
look this is still in the early days I

00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:49.870
look this is still in the early days I
 

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:52.020
look this is still in the early days I
think the potential benefit of this

00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:52.030
think the potential benefit of this
 

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:53.910
think the potential benefit of this
technology is massive in terms of both

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920
technology is massive in terms of both
 

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.520
technology is massive in terms of both
improving access quality and ultimately

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:56.530
improving access quality and ultimately
 

00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:59.730
improving access quality and ultimately
lowering costs we have to give it some

00:55:59.730 --> 00:55:59.740
lowering costs we have to give it some
 

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:01.350
lowering costs we have to give it some
Running Room we have to look try out

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:01.360
Running Room we have to look try out
 

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.900
Running Room we have to look try out
different models and not all of it will

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:03.910
different models and not all of it will
 

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:07.590
different models and not all of it will
work but and particularly for states

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:07.600
work but and particularly for states
 

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:08.610
work but and particularly for states
we've seen states that are very

00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:08.620
we've seen states that are very
 

00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:10.500
we've seen states that are very
restrictive have much lower levels of

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:10.510
restrictive have much lower levels of
 

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:12.000
restrictive have much lower levels of
adoption of these technologies the

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:12.010
adoption of these technologies the
 

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:14.430
adoption of these technologies the
people who lose in that context are the

00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:14.440
people who lose in that context are the
 

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.990
people who lose in that context are the
patients who can't access high-quality

00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000
patients who can't access high-quality
 

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.960
patients who can't access high-quality
care and so my general takeaway is we've

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:18.970
care and so my general takeaway is we've
 

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:21.710
care and so my general takeaway is we've
got to give this technology a chance

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720
got to give this technology a chance
 

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:25.620
got to give this technology a chance
mine would be similar that the changes

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:25.630
mine would be similar that the changes
 

00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:29.040
mine would be similar that the changes
that are underway based on technology

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:29.050
that are underway based on technology
 

00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:31.380
that are underway based on technology
are not going away

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:31.390
are not going away
 

00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:34.350
are not going away
you know everybody will have mobile

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:34.360
you know everybody will have mobile
 

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.880
you know everybody will have mobile
phones and we'll use them

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:35.890
phones and we'll use them
 

00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:38.240
phones and we'll use them
maybe we'll lose landlines and

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:38.250
maybe we'll lose landlines and
 

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:40.500
maybe we'll lose landlines and
healthcare will be delivered in

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:40.510
healthcare will be delivered in
 

00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:42.870
healthcare will be delivered in
different ways in different places in

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880
different ways in different places in
 

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.210
different ways in different places in
very poor countries it will use mobiles

00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:45.220
very poor countries it will use mobiles
 

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:46.630
very poor countries it will use mobiles
that will do

00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640
that will do
 

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:49.930
that will do
use more non-physician providers in this

00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:49.940
use more non-physician providers in this
 

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:52.780
use more non-physician providers in this
country will still have probably many

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:52.790
country will still have probably many
 

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:55.450
country will still have probably many
doctors but maybe other kinds of

doctors but maybe other kinds of
 

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:57.550

as I said earlier to embrace the
 

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.560
as I said earlier to embrace the
technology and the changes rather than

to try to avoid it we'll come back to
 

00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:12.910
to try to avoid it we'll come back to
our need to align incentives and to
