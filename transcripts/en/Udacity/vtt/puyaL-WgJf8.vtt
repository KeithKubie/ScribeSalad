Let's see if you can write that function.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I've left you with the missionary and cannibals problem

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
as sort of a template, but I want you to generalize that to write shortestpathsearch,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which takes a start state, a successor function, and a is_goal function

00:00:14.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and returns the shortest path.
