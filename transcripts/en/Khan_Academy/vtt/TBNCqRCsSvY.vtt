00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:02.091
- [Instructor] We've been
told throughout out lives

00:00:02.091 --> 00:00:06.115
to eat certain foods because
they contain vitamins

00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:08.436
or sometimes people might
say they also contain

00:00:08.436 --> 00:00:10.637
some minerals that you need,

00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:13.749
and so the obvious question
is, well what are vitamins?

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.942
And what are these minerals
that folks are talking about?

00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:19.474
Well the big picture idea is,
that there's certain things

00:00:19.474 --> 00:00:21.969
that your body needs and
we'll talk in a second

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:24.605
about why your body needs these things,

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:26.516
but also, there are things
that your body needs

00:00:26.516 --> 00:00:28.536
and your body does not produce them.

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:30.369
Body does not produce.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.068
There's a lot of things
your body needs that

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.311
your body is capable of producing
but there's certain things

00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:39.941
that it needs that it
cannot produce itself.

00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:42.058
Now if these things that they need,

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:44.334
that the body needs and it cannot produce,

00:00:44.334 --> 00:00:46.001
if they are organic,

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:49.673
and organic is just a very fancy way

00:00:49.673 --> 00:00:51.439
of saying if there are compounds

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:53.274
that involve carbons in them,

00:00:53.274 --> 00:00:56.981
and most molecules in life
involve a lot of carbons,

00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:59.211
that's why they're
called organic molecules.

00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:00.905
There's a whole field of chemistry,

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:04.014
of organic chemistry which
is studying the chemistry

00:01:04.014 --> 00:01:06.319
of life for the most part.

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:09.273
If these molecules, if these
things that the body needs

00:01:09.273 --> 00:01:11.263
that it does not produce,
itself are organic,

00:01:11.263 --> 00:01:13.763
we call these things vitamins.

00:01:15.286 --> 00:01:18.441
And some of the common vitamins
that you'll hear people

00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:22.405
talk about are things
like Vitamin A, Vitamin D,

00:01:22.405 --> 00:01:26.572
Vitamin E, Vitamin K, Vitamin
C, and you can further divide

00:01:28.593 --> 00:01:31.861
these vitamins based on
whether they are soluble

00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:33.367
in fat or not.

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:37.486
So, for example, Vitamins A, D, E and K,

00:01:37.486 --> 00:01:40.885
and this is by no means an
exhaustive list of vitamins,

00:01:40.885 --> 00:01:43.337
these are fat soluble.

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:44.375
What does that mean?

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:46.044
Well, to be soluble means you could be

00:01:46.044 --> 00:01:47.146
dissolved in that thing.

00:01:47.146 --> 00:01:49.108
So it can be dissolved in fat.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.691
And Vitamin C is water soluble.

00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:57.429
Now the reason why this
might be relevant for you,

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.617
living as an individual,
trying to keep your health

00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:03.054
in good shape, is that you do
need all of these vitamins,

00:02:03.054 --> 00:02:05.440
and we'll talk in a little
bit about why you need them,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.039
but fat soluble vitamins,
they're actually easier

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.656
to overdose on, because
they're soluble in fat,

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:12.548
they can stay in your system a lot longer,

00:02:12.548 --> 00:02:15.007
while water soluble vitamins are easier

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:17.532
to flush out of your system.

00:02:17.532 --> 00:02:19.270
Now, with that out of the
way, let's think about some

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.271
of these common foods you might see,

00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:24.990
and some of the vitamins
that they are known for.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.306
For example, right over
here you have carrots,

00:02:27.306 --> 00:02:28.634
and you might have had people tell you,

00:02:28.634 --> 00:02:29.574
"Hey, eat carrots.

00:02:29.574 --> 00:02:31.066
"It's good for your eyes."

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:32.887
And that is true, but the reason why

00:02:32.887 --> 00:02:33.834
it's good for your eyes,

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:38.409
is that carrots contain
something known as betacarotene,

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.534
and the carotene part of
betacarotene is not a coincidence.

00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:45.157
It literally comes from Latin for carrot,

00:02:45.157 --> 00:02:47.754
and carotenes are these pigment molecules.

00:02:47.754 --> 00:02:50.489
It gives the carrot this
orange color right over here,

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.826
and betacarotene, once
it's consumed by your body,

00:02:53.826 --> 00:02:56.409
it's a precursor for Vitamin A,

00:02:58.003 --> 00:02:59.584
which is essential for your eyes

00:02:59.584 --> 00:03:02.021
and many, many other things in your body.

00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:04.517
And a precursor's just a
very fancy way of saying

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:08.263
that if you consume
betacarotene, you're body can

00:03:08.263 --> 00:03:11.690
turn it into the Vitamin A that it needs.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.108
Oranges, famous for
Vitamin C, and this isn't

00:03:15.108 --> 00:03:17.921
an exhaustive list of things
that these foods contain,

00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:20.538
but this is some of the things
that they're most famous for,

00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:24.330
and Vitamin C as we talked about
is a water soluble vitamin.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.878
It's very valuable for immune system,

00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:29.591
and in a situation where
you have a severe deficiency

00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:34.430
of Vitamin C, you could get
a disease known as scurvy.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.148
And scurvy is not too common
anymore, but several hundred

00:03:37.148 --> 00:03:40.020
years ago, sailors would
often get scurvy because

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.483
they had very limited diets.

00:03:41.483 --> 00:03:43.470
They did not get fruits and vegetables,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.792
and because of that Vitamin C deficiency,

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:48.412
their collagen, their connective
tissue would break down.

00:03:48.412 --> 00:03:52.841
So it was a very horrible
and painful disease.

00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:54.472
But what if there's
something your body needs

00:03:54.472 --> 00:03:57.220
that it does not produce
that is not organic?

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.508
Well those are the things
that we call minerals.

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:03.392
And, of course, the term
minerals, it's also used

00:04:03.392 --> 00:04:05.399
in a geological sense, but
if were talking in terms

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:07.426
of biology, that's what we mean.

00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:10.978
And most of the typical
minerals are really elements

00:04:10.978 --> 00:04:13.660
that you will see on the periodic table.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.302
They will be things like phosphorous,

00:04:16.302 --> 00:04:19.023
and I'm just gonna write
their element symbol.

00:04:19.023 --> 00:04:23.106
Phosphorous, calcium,
potassium, magnesium, iron,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.987
and again, this is not an exhaustive list,

00:04:27.987 --> 00:04:30.886
but these are all essential for your body.

00:04:30.886 --> 00:04:33.776
As we go further in our study of biology,

00:04:33.776 --> 00:04:36.207
you will see how phosphorous is useful

00:04:36.207 --> 00:04:39.658
in molecules like ATP, the energy store.

00:04:39.658 --> 00:04:43.829
It's even in the backbone of DNA and RNA.

00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:47.836
We'll see how calcium is
useful, not just for your bones,

00:04:47.836 --> 00:04:50.365
but even for things like
muscle contractions.

00:04:50.365 --> 00:04:53.308
To send signals down
neurons, you're going to need

00:04:53.308 --> 00:04:55.598
your potassium and also sodium.

00:04:55.598 --> 00:04:59.257
Magnesium, also important
for muscle contraction.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:02.840
Iron, this is in your
hemoglobin, bonds to the oxygen,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.429
allows you to transport
oxygen in your bloodstream

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:06.875
and red blood cells.

00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:09.001
So these are all very valuable.

00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:11.126
And a lot of those foods
that we just talked about

00:05:11.126 --> 00:05:14.400
that contain vitamins,
they'll also contain minerals.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.970
For example, not only do
carrots contain betacarotene,

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.627
they also contain potassium,
which we mentioned

00:05:22.627 --> 00:05:27.079
is essential for things
like nerve function.

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:30.340
Things like milk, it has
vitamins, like Vitamin D,

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.288
but it also has minerals like calcium,

00:05:33.288 --> 00:05:35.581
which we talked about as
essential for your bones

00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:37.729
and for muscle function.

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.200
And so the big picture here is,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.761
is that vitamins and
minerals are both things

00:05:41.761 --> 00:05:44.661
that your body needs, that
it does not produce itself,

00:05:44.661 --> 00:05:47.245
and we're going to see them
over and over again in biology.

00:05:47.245 --> 00:05:48.887
So keep a lookout for them.

00:05:48.887 --> 00:05:51.394
The vitamins as we go further
in our study of biology,

00:05:51.394 --> 00:05:53.494
we're going to see them as co-enzymes,

00:05:53.494 --> 00:05:56.330
things that help facilitate
functions of the cell,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.825
help facilitate reactions and the minerals

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:01.442
you're going to see in
everything from the powerhouse

00:06:01.442 --> 00:06:03.949
of the cell, the backbone of DNA,

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:05.936
you're going to see it
in muscle contraction

00:06:05.936 --> 00:06:07.183
and how bones are formed.

00:06:07.183 --> 00:06:08.787
You're gonna see it in hemoglobin.

00:06:08.787 --> 00:06:10.610
You're gonna see it in nerve function.
