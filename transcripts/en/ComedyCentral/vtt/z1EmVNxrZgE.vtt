FIRST THINGS FIRST, THOUGH.

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:08.775 align:start position:0% line:91%
HEAVY IN OUR HEARTS AND MINDS 
ARE THE EVENTS OF SOUTH 

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.210 align:start position:0% line:91%
CAROLINA, BUT THERE WAS 
HOPEFUL NEWS.

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:13.813 line:91%
GOV. NIKKI HALEY FINALLY CAME 
FORWARD AND ADDRESSED THE FACT 

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:18.651 line:91%
THAT THE CONFEDERATE FLAG IS 
STILL HANGING IN FRONT OF THE 

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:20.219 line:85%
SOUTH CAROLINA STATE CAPITAL.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:23.923 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; TODAY WE'RE HERE AT A 
MOMENT OF UNITY IN OUR STATE 

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:31.197 line:91%
WITHOUT ILL WILL TO SAY IT'S 
TIME TO MOVE THE FLAG FROM THE 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.664 align:start position:0% line:85%
CAPITAL GROUNDS.

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:32.131 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:36.702 align:start position:0% line:91%
[
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:38.538 line:85%
THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:46.979 align:start position:0% line:91%
GOOD FOR YOU, SOUTH CAROLINA. UP
HERE, NIKKI!

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:51.284 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT SERIOUSLY, I MEAN, WHO 
COULD HAVE BEEN AGAINST THIS, 

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:54.454 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT?

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:57.723 line:91%
ESPECIALLY IN THE LIGHT OF THE 
INCIDENT THAT JUST HAPPENED, 

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:01.094 size:78% position:39% line:85%
AND PARTICULARLY IN 2015.

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:04.297 align:start position:0% line:91%
ANYBODY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT 
TRYING TO GET REPUBLICAN 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.265 align:start position:0% line:85%
VOTES?

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:06.566 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID 
THIS WEEKEND.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.936 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I STILL FEEL IT'S NOT AN 
ISSUE FOR A PERSON RUNNING FOR 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.170 align:start position:0% line:85%
PRESIDENT.

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:14.707 line:91%
&gt;&gt; MARCO RUBIO TELLING REPORTERS
 THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.343 align:start position:0% line:91%
WILL MAKE THE DECISION
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A DECISION FOR THE 

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:18.444 size:78% position:39% line:85%
PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA.

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:26.219 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A DECISION THAT 
NEEDS TO BE MADE IN SOUTH 

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.453 align:start position:0% line:85%
CAROLINA.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:31.190 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; STATES RIGHTS IS A CLASSIC
PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE COP OUT.

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:34.760 line:91%
WHEN YOU ASK ME IF THE SKY IS 
BLUE, THAT'S A QUESTION BEST 

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:36.662 align:start position:0% line:85%
LEFT TO THE STATE.

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:39.966 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HOW DO I KNOW WHAT YOU 
WOULD DO WITH THE FLAG?

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:43.269 size:78% position:39% line:85%
I'M NOT A FLAG SCIENTIST.

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:47.006 line:91%
I WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES, NOT PRESIDENT 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.376 align:start position:0% line:85%
OF FLAGS.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.379 align:start position:0% line:85%
I REJECT YOUR QUESTION.

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:57.350 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO KNOW, ARE YOU
TAKING 

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:58.284 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS DOWN TOMORROW.

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:00.520 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE YOU TAKING IT DOWN 
TONIGHT?

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:04.857 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE I CAN COME OVER WITH A 
FLASHLIGHT.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.295 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THE U.S. FLAG WAS HALF
STAFF, BUT THE  REBEL FLAG
 

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:12.165 align:start position:0% line:91%
REMAINED HIGH,
PADLOCKED AND UNTOUCHABLE

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:18.171 align:start position:0% line:91%
WITHOUT AN  OVERRIDE BY 2/3 OF
THE  STATE LEGISLATURE.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:20.306 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; PADLOCKED? WELL, OKAY, NO
PROBLEM.

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:24.810 line:91%
YOU GET THAT TWO THIRDS, BLAH, 
BLAH, BLAH, AND I'LL GET THE 

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:25.310 align:start position:0% line:85%
KEY.

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:26.512 align:start position:0% line:85%
I HAVE ONE OF THOSE.

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:31.250 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT HERE.

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:37.590 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS WILL OPEN ANY PAD LOCK OR 
NON-PAD LOCK OR MAXIMUM 

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:40.159 align:start position:0% line:91%
SECURITY PRISON IN UPSTATE NEW 
YORK.

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:40.726 align:start position:0% line:85%
OOPS.

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:42.862 align:start position:0% line:85%
PERHAPS I SAID TOO MUCH

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:46.832 line:91%
ANYHOW, THE POINT IS, YOU'RE 
TAKING THAT FLAG DOWN, RIGHT?

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:49.902 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AS GOVERNOR, I HAVE THE 
AUTHORITY TO CALL THEM BACK 

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:53.039 align:start position:0% line:91%
INTO SESSION UNDER 
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:55.841 line:91%
I'VE INDICATED TO THE HOUSE 
AND THE SENATE, THAT IF THEY 

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:59.145 size:81% position:41% line:91%
DO NOT TAKE MEASURES THIS 
SUMMER, I WILL USE THAT 

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:01.647 line:91%
AUTHORITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
THE LEGISLATURE REMOVING THE 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.585 align:start position:0% line:91%
FLAG FROM THE STATEHOUSE 
GROUNDS:

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:09.088 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO YOU WANT THEM TO COME 
BACK TO DEBATE TAKING IT DOWN, 

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:12.124 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THEY 
WON'T.

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:15.895 size:81% position:41% line:91%
SO YOU SAY HEY, GUYS, YOU 
BETTER COME BACK AND TALK 

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:18.731 align:start position:0% line:85%
ABOUT THIS.

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:25.972 size:81% position:41% line:91%
SOUTH CAROLINA -- (BLEEP)
I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE TO 

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:32.044 align:start position:0% line:85%
RETRACT MY UP HERE.

00:03:32.077 --> 00:03:36.249 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET ME GIVE YOU UNSOLICITED 
ADVICE.

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:38.985 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW ABOUT JUST TAKE THE DAMN 
FLAG DOWN RIGHT NOW

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:41.587 align:start position:0% line:91%
[ APPLAUSE ]
HEAR ME OUT.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.991 align:start position:0% line:91%
[ APPLAUSE ]
AND THEN YOU CAN DEBATE PUTTING 

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:45.658 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT BACK UP.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:49.629 align:start position:0% line:91%
[ APPLAUSE ]
HOW ABOUT THAT?

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:54.233 line:91%
NOW I KNOW AS GOVERNOR, YOU 
HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RULES, BUT 

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:57.303 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE A SOUTH CAROLINA 
GOVERNOR.

00:03:57.336 --> 00:03:59.639 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE WERE NO RULES FOR YOU 
GUYS.

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:06.379 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN THE LAST GOVERNOR TOOK 
THE APPALACHIA TRAIL TO 

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:09.915 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARGENTINA ON A MISSION FOR 
SECRET POON

00:04:09.948 --> 00:04:17.290 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHICH, BY THE WAY IS AGAINST 
SOUTH CAROLINA LAW.

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:19.959 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DEBATE IS
ABOUT  ANYWAY.

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:21.294 size:81% position:41% line:85%
IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL FLAG.

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:24.363 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S A RELIC WITH NO PURPOSE 
ANYMORE.

00:04:24.396 --> 00:04:25.898 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S DECORATIVE.

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:30.269 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU DON'T NEED A DECLARATION 
TO REMOVE A DECORATION.

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:31.003 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:40.279 align:start position:0% line:91%
[
LOOK, IT'S TIME FOR A SEGMENT 

00:04:40.312 --> 00:04:41.947 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE CALL FOR THE RECORD.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.217 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOR THE RECORD, THE 
CONFEDERATE FLAG SENT A 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.087 size:75% position:38% line:85%
TRADITIONAL OF HERITAGE.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.621 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S INTIMIDATION.

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:49.622 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S NOT MY OPINION.

00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:51.190 size:78% position:39% line:85%
THAT'S AN OBJECTIVE FACT.

00:04:51.223 --> 00:04:56.195 line:91%
ON MARCH 21st, 1861, THE VICE 
PRESIDENT OF THE CONFEDERACY, 

00:04:56.228 --> 00:05:00.166 size:88% position:44% line:91%
STATED THAT THE CONFEDERATE 
GOVERNMENT WAS BASED ON THE 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.302 align:start position:0% line:91%
GREAT TRUTH THAT THE NEGRO IS 
NOT EQUAL TO THE WHITE MAN.

00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:06.605 line:91%
THAT SPEECH IS NOW CALLED THE 
CORNER STONE SPEECH, BECAUSE 

00:05:06.638 --> 00:05:10.343 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT IDEA IS THE CORNER STONE 
OF THE CONFEDERACY.

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:14.313 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU DON'T GET CLEARER THAN 
THAT.

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:17.583 align:start position:0% line:91%
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT SOUTHERN 
STATES SHOULD FLY THE 

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:20.853 line:91%
CONFEDERATE FLAG BECAUSE OF 
HERITAGE, BUT IF WE FLEW EVERY 

00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:27.693 line:91%
FLAG FROM THE PAST, WHY NOT 
FLY THE UNION JACK IN FRONT OF 

00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:33.165 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE WHITE HOUSE. AND FOR THE
RECORD, SOUTH CAROLINA,

00:05:33.198 --> 00:05:39.405 size:78% position:39% line:91%
YOU DON'T GET TO MAKE THE
HERITAGE ARGUMENT BECAUSE

00:05:39.438 --> 00:05:40.973 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE STARS AND BARS HASN'T
BEEN IN PLACE SINCE THE CIVIL

00:05:41.006 --> 00:05:48.714 line:91%
WAR, IT WENT UP IN 1961 TO MARK
THE CENTENNIAL OF THE CIVIL WAR 

00:05:48.747 --> 00:05:52.218 line:91%
COINCIDENTALLY WHEN THE BLACK 
STARTED  WANTING CIVIL RIGHTS 

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:55.321 line:91%
1961, IT WAS A REMINDER TO
BLACK PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD

00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:56.622 align:start position:0% line:85%
KNOW THEIR PLACE.

00:05:56.655 --> 00:06:02.495 line:91%
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN USED AS A 
SYMBOL OF INTIMIDATION AND 

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:03.629 align:start position:0% line:85%
TERROR.

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:09.168 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND IN FACT, THE NEO NAZIS 
OFTEN ADOPT THE CONFEDERATE 

00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:11.370 align:start position:0% line:85%
FLAG IN IT'S PLACE.

00:06:11.403 --> 00:06:16.008 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S SUCH A RACIST SYMBOL THAT 
IS DOES DOUBLE DUTY AS THE 

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:19.011 size:78% position:39% line:91%
BACKUP RACIST SYMBOL FOR 
ANOTHER RACIST SYMBOL.

00:06:19.044 --> 00:06:24.049 align:start position:0% line:91%
[ APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; IT'S CRAZY.

00:06:24.082 --> 00:06:26.118 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:29.822 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO FOR THE RECORD, I GET IT 
THAT PLENTY OF HONORABLE 

00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:32.892 size:88% position:44% line:91%
PEOPLE HAVE FUZZY FEELINGS 
ABOUT THE CONFEDERATE FLAG, 

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:35.294 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT THAT'S IRRELEVANT.

00:06:35.327 --> 00:06:38.164 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEIR NOSTALGIA WILL NEVER 
TRUMP THE PEOPLE WHO SEE IT AS 

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:39.365 align:start position:0% line:85%
A SYMBOL OF HATE.

00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:44.103 line:91%
AND FOR A STATE TO FLY THIS 
FLAG, THAT HATE IS THE MESSAGE 

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:46.972 size:81% position:41% line:85%
THEY SEND TO THEIR PEOPLE.

00:06:47.005 --> 00:06:51.343 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOR THE RECORD, DOES THERE 
REALLY NEED TO BE A DEBATE ON 

00:06:51.376 --> 00:06:55.147 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHETHER OR NOT TO YOU SHOULD 
TAKE IT DOWN.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.846 align:start position:0% line:91%
JUST DO IT. SERIOUSLY, TAKE IT 
DOWN NOW.
