- Hi, I'm Patti Harrison

00:00:04.803 --> 00:00:06.806 line:0%
- No one likes you, and
I'm Joel Kim Booster.

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:07.740 line:0%
- Is that true?

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.209
And you're watching Unsend,

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:11.010 align:start size:94% position:6%
where we celebrate the
best and worst of the web,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.245
But mostly, the worst.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:14.247 align:start size:81% position:19%
- So let's jump
right into Unsend.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.714 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Come on everybody,
the water's fine.

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:17.984
(shooting noise)
- I'm already damp.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:21.187 align:start size:81% position:19%
- You're nasty,
watch your volume.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.690
(party music)

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.597
(cheering)

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:34.166
Our social media profiles really

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.102
define and brand who we are,

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.037
and what we want to
say to the world.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:39.972
- And I got to say, you and
I are really differing on

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:42.575
queer, all body con
asian, egg roll.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.677 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Futuristic,
ravishing, demonic,

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:48.514 align:start size:94% position:6%
laugh out loud piss,
shit, cum squirty squirty.

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:51.283
Yes, today our brand is
tight but was it always?

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:53.352 align:start size:94% position:6%
- That's why we're digging
into vintage socials

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:54.687
and asking the question:

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.789
- [Hosts] Defend or Delete?

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.558
(futuristic music)

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.860 align:start size:94% position:6%
- So first I'd like to
just start with this tweet

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.897
that you shot off
in 2015, "Sorry

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.365 align:start size:84% position:16%
"I only do butt stuff
with verifieds."

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:09.436 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like why did you
think this was okay?

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:10.603
- It was 2015.

00:01:12.504 --> 00:01:14.940
I was a different person then.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.775
I think I have a different point

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:19.845 align:start size:84% position:16%
of view now, I
wasn't verified then.

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:21.247
- Oh.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:24.216 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I didn't know what
verified people were like. I

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:26.485
made a mistake I deeply regret

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:27.953
saying that, anything like that.

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:29.455
- 'Cause I guess my question is,

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:32.325 align:start size:97% position:3%
what did you think verified
people were like then?

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:35.161
'Cause you do know that you
can have like 400 followers

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:38.464
and write one article for
Huff. Post Queer Voices

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:39.932 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you can get
verified these days,

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:42.568
you know it's super easy.

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:47.107
- I thought verified people
were better and I still do.

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:50.310
- What's going on?

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:54.980 align:start size:81% position:19%
Is your Latisse
******* you up again?

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.515
- Yeah.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:58.685
I can only say I'm

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:00.252
really sorry.

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:02.521
- So you would delete?

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:03.923
- I would delete.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:08.728 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, Joel, we have
this first post here.

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:10.896
The caption says,
"It's not delivery,

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:12.531
"it's the $7 Digiorno

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:14.467
"that they put in
a microwave for me

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.035
"because we're all
trapped on this train

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:17.737
"and have no other options

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:19.906
"hashtag train life."

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:21.473 align:start size:84% position:16%
- There's a broader
context here,

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:22.975
I was trapped on an Amtrak train

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:26.079 align:start size:84% position:16%
from New York to
Chicago for 27 hours

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:29.015
and I didn't have any
other food options,

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:30.783
so I had to buy the
food on the train,

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:35.487
and so this is a comment on
capitalism and train life.

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:36.556
Again, it's funny.

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:37.990 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Joel.
- It's funny, I'm funny!

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.425
- Joel!

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.093
I don't think you
should delete it.

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:42.027
- Oh wow.

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:42.761
- [Patti] I agree with you.

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:44.030
- Thank you.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.698
- And one thing that you
didn't actually talk on

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:48.301
that I thought was
pretty cool was that

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.635
you took this

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:50.503
this iconic

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:53.873
slogan from Digiorno,

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:55.441 align:start size:81% position:19%
it's not delivery,
it's Digiorno,

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:59.078
and you spun it in this
kind of academic way

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:00.779 align:start size:97% position:3%
where everyone was like,
- No, okay, I thought you were

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:02.214 align:start size:97% position:3%
on my side,
- [Patti] Reading it, and they

00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:03.483 align:start size:97% position:3%
were like, it's not delivery,
- and now it's clear,

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.750
you're making fun of me.
- They think they know.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.253 align:start size:97% position:3%
And look at this absolute fire
- And listen,

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:09.955 align:start size:97% position:3%
this was four years ago.
- Yes, it's the $7, oh my God,

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:12.292
and you're, oh my God, Joel.

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:15.428 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I know what
you're doing and I'm

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:17.930 align:start size:88% position:13%
gonna accept all of
that that you just said

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.431
at face value, because,

00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:23.435
I am smart, and I'm good, and
I'm funny, and I'm worth it.

00:03:23.435 --> 00:03:26.605
(electronic music)

00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:27.440
- Death.

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:32.645 align:start size:94% position:6%
Stop, it's my own
personal religious belief

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:34.647
that dying is so bad.

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:36.849
But you know what's
the best, very good?

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.084 align:start size:94% position:6%
Seeing random celebrities
insert themselves

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:40.787
into a memorial of the deceased.

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:41.754
- That is fun.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:42.922
- It's very good.

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:44.590 align:start size:84% position:16%
So let's take a
moment to comb through

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.693 align:start size:88% position:13%
social media condolences
and memorials

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:47.994
in a segment I call,

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:50.563 align:start size:81% position:19%
I Know Dead People
- Oh, my God.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.665
(laughs)

00:03:57.436 --> 00:03:58.805
That is so funny.

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:00.906
- Here we go.

00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:02.541
Gonna start off with
my girl Kirstie Alley,

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:04.844 align:start size:94% position:6%
who gave us this
absolutely heart-wrenching

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:07.046
tribute to Stephen Hawking,

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:08.481
"You had a good go at it,

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:10.116
"thanks for your input."

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:11.784
- "Thanks for your input"?

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:13.118
Hawking is a world renowned

00:04:13.118 --> 00:04:14.520
British theoretical physicist

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.355 align:start size:97% position:3%
known for his
contributions to the fields

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:19.925 align:start position:0%
of cosmology, general
relativity, and quantum gravity!

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:21.293 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, and
Kirstie's acting like

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:22.794
Stephen is her old nutritionist

00:04:22.794 --> 00:04:24.864
who gently suggested
cutting back on dairy.

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:27.299 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Not a chance, bitch,
I love sour cream!

00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:29.702 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Also, I'm going
absolutely wild crazy cuckoo

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:32.538 align:start size:97% position:3%
for this emoji-riddled
tweet from Cher to Stephen.

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:37.043 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Dear Stephen, will remember
our luncheon forever.

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:38.510
"It was amazing.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.380
"I know we argued about
the value of history.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.749 align:start size:84% position:16%
"'Cher, when time
travel is perfected,

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.218
"'history will obsolete.'"

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:47.052
- Then we get into the
latter part of the tweet,

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:48.320
which is rhymes and riddles

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.589
and a potpourri of punctuation.

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.458
History is like a friend, comma,

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:55.227
and new quotations,
hashtags are like

00:04:55.227 --> 00:04:57.229
chicken emoji scratches to me,

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.166
shocked face emoji,
capitalized dyslexia,

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:04.137 align:start size:94% position:6%
RIP dear, cap the D, heart
emoji, no end quotes.

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:07.773
- Girl, pass me some of
what you are smoking,

00:05:07.773 --> 00:05:09.142
this tweet is lit.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.310
- Gross, okay?

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.045
Disgusting, it's too much.

00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:14.447
- It is too much,
it's all too much.

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:16.249
So I'd like to call for
an end to this behavior.

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.217 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh, you mean,
tasteless posts about

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:19.451
celebrity deaths, or-

00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:21.754
- No, death in general.

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:22.789
I'm against it.

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:23.756
It should be banned.

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.024
- Oh my God, Patti.

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:26.058
No, we can't,

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:27.192
we talked about this,

00:05:27.192 --> 00:05:28.794 align:start size:84% position:16%
this is not a
political show, okay?

00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:30.963 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Call your senators,
vote them out.

00:05:30.963 --> 00:05:32.598
- Vote who out, the dead?

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:35.634 align:start size:94% position:6%
- We're here, we're queer,
and we'll never die.

00:05:35.634 --> 00:05:38.537 align:start size:88% position:13%
We're here, we're queer,
and we'll never die.

00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:42.275 align:start size:88% position:13%
We're here, we're queer,
and we'll never die.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.881 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Let's talk movies,
because here's the thing.

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:50.082
We're millennials.

00:05:50.082 --> 00:05:51.317
- We're young as ****.

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:53.819 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm so young my
skin is like a baby.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.054 align:start size:94% position:6%
So we don't have 90
minutes to spare to watch

00:05:56.054 --> 00:05:58.257
any old full ass feature film,

00:05:58.257 --> 00:05:59.858
heck, we don't even have
time to watch a trailer.

00:05:59.858 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I don't even have
time to let you

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.995
finish your sentence, Joel.

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:04.496
- I got most of it out.

00:06:04.496 --> 00:06:06.398 align:start size:94% position:6%
So let's review the
latest streaming releases

00:06:06.398 --> 00:06:10.302 align:start size:97% position:3%
using a method of criticism
we can understand: our phones,

00:06:10.302 --> 00:06:12.338
without doing any research.

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:13.773
- Okay, to be clear,

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:15.874
we're gonna review
movies based solely

00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:18.644
on the thumbnail posters
of what's streaming online?

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:20.412
- Okay!
- Movies!

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:21.414
- Yeah!
- Movies!

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:22.682
- Yeah, movies!

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:25.918
- Movies.

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:26.753
- Yeah.

00:06:28.353 --> 00:06:30.790
Okay, here we have Alright Now

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.826 align:start size:84% position:16%
with I believe that's
Cobie Smothers.

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:34.660
That's her name, right?

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.594
- Can't read it.

00:06:35.594 --> 00:06:37.095
But what I can see is Miss Cobie

00:06:37.095 --> 00:06:41.366 align:start size:84% position:16%
looking at me with her
smothering smolder.

00:06:41.366 --> 00:06:43.536 align:start size:88% position:13%
And she's got a leather
jacket on, baby.

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:45.337
That can only mean
one thing, baby.

00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:47.473
This lady stays unplain
and yells cuss words

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:49.441 align:start size:97% position:3%
and tells authority figures
to kiss her butt, baby.

00:06:49.441 --> 00:06:52.178
I am frankly scared to death
of this maniac bitch, baby.

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:55.081
- No, thank you, she's got
a guitar in the background?

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.349
Swiping away!

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.984
Irrational Man, looks
like Joaquin Pheonix,

00:06:58.984 --> 00:07:01.053 align:start size:94% position:6%
which, I gotta be honest,
I'm always surprised

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:02.321
when I remember he's alive,

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:04.924
not that I have anything
against Joaquin Pheonix,

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.292 align:start size:97% position:3%
it's just when I think
about him, I want him dead.

00:07:07.292 --> 00:07:08.527
- True.

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:10.863 align:start size:84% position:16%
And Emma Stone, with
her eyes and rasp

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:12.631
and whimsy and wonder.

00:07:12.631 --> 00:07:14.833 align:start size:84% position:16%
I like those qualities
in a leading gal.

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:16.068
- Same!

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:17.870
Okay, maybe we'll
give this one a-

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.704
oh shit.

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:19.772
Oh no.

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:22.507
Oh, dang it, Patti, dang it!

00:07:22.507 --> 00:07:23.976
You see that font?

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:25.845
That old timey, jazzy font?

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:29.915
The signature font of an
accused child molester?

00:07:29.915 --> 00:07:31.117 align:start size:88% position:13%
They just about tricked
us into watching

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.385
a Woody Allen joint!

00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:34.653
- No thank you, no more
pedophile movie for me.

00:07:34.653 --> 00:07:36.054 align:start size:81% position:19%
Okay, I'll have
nothing to do with

00:07:36.054 --> 00:07:38.090
this trash titty movie, next.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.793
- And now we've got
My Friend Dahmer.

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:43.061 align:start size:97% position:3%
Now, you know they've
already tickled my interests

00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:45.331
because you know how
I love a movie poster

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:47.333
with one big head
looking this way

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:48.834 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then a little
head looking this way,

00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:50.903 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then another head
looking this way.

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:52.304
- It's very powerful.

00:07:52.304 --> 00:07:53.572
Plus they've got pinkish hues,

00:07:53.572 --> 00:07:55.640 align:start size:84% position:16%
and a guy who looks
sad and misunderstood.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.210
There's a sweetness to
this Jeffery Dahmer,

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.477
and I like that.

00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:00.346
Also, his glasses
are chic as hell.

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:02.381 align:start size:88% position:13%
Who is that lady staring
at us underneath?

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:04.683 align:start size:84% position:16%
Guessing she's playing
his mother his-

00:08:04.683 --> 00:08:05.784
- Oh my God, it's Anne Heche

00:08:05.784 --> 00:08:07.186
I need this new series!

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:08.587
Stream this, rent
this, buy this,

00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:10.690
put it in a sandwich
and put it in my mouth!

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.524
- You know I have a
gymnastics injury.

00:08:12.524 --> 00:08:14.427
- I'm so sorry, forgot.

00:08:17.863 --> 00:08:18.864
- Well, we did it.

00:08:18.864 --> 00:08:20.065
- We sure did done do it.

00:08:20.065 --> 00:08:21.500
- We did the ding daddy.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.968
- Yup, that's the
end of our show.

00:08:22.968 --> 00:08:24.202
- And it's the end of your life.

00:08:24.202 --> 00:08:25.471
- Wait, uh, what?

00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Nothing, thanks
for watching Unsend.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.509
- Yeah, bye, can we-

00:08:31.977 --> 00:08:34.013
- Oh no, I immediately
feel bad for doing that.
