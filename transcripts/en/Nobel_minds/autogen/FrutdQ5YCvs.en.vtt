measured those gravitational waves

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480
measured those gravitational waves
 

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.749

what if you can speculate in a hundred

00:20:11.749 --> 00:20:11.759
what if you can speculate in a hundred
 

00:20:11.759 --> 00:20:13.489
what if you can speculate in a hundred
years what do you think your discovery

00:20:13.489 --> 00:20:13.499
years what do you think your discovery
 

00:20:13.499 --> 00:20:16.879
years what do you think your discovery
will be used for yeah that's an

00:20:16.879 --> 00:20:16.889
will be used for yeah that's an
 

00:20:16.889 --> 00:20:18.349
will be used for yeah that's an
interesting question I have what much

00:20:18.349 --> 00:20:18.359
interesting question I have what much
 

00:20:18.359 --> 00:20:24.049
interesting question I have what much
about the when we think about the future

00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059
about the when we think about the future
 

00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:29.830
about the when we think about the future
for this view you think of proving that

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840
 
 

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.989
 
so that we can look deeper and deeper if

00:20:32.989 --> 00:20:32.999
so that we can look deeper and deeper if
 

00:20:32.999 --> 00:20:38.029
so that we can look deeper and deeper if
the and in particular at some point but

00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039
the and in particular at some point but
 

00:20:38.039 --> 00:20:40.820
the and in particular at some point but
not the detectors have now because

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:40.830
not the detectors have now because
 

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.849
not the detectors have now because
they're not they're not they're not hope

00:20:43.849 --> 00:20:43.859
they're not they're not they're not hope
 

00:20:43.859 --> 00:20:47.419
they're not they're not they're not hope
to be able to look at the beginnings of

00:20:47.419 --> 00:20:47.429
to be able to look at the beginnings of
 

00:20:47.429 --> 00:20:50.629
to be able to look at the beginnings of
the universe for example we hope at some

00:20:50.629 --> 00:20:50.639
the universe for example we hope at some
 

00:20:50.639 --> 00:20:52.269
the universe for example we hope at some
point to have detectors that are

00:20:52.269 --> 00:20:52.279
point to have detectors that are
 

00:20:52.279 --> 00:20:55.399
point to have detectors that are
sensitive enough so that you spot black

00:20:55.399 --> 00:20:55.409
sensitive enough so that you spot black
 

00:20:55.409 --> 00:20:58.849
sensitive enough so that you spot black
holes over the entire unit so that you

00:20:58.849 --> 00:20:58.859
holes over the entire unit so that you
 

00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:00.889
holes over the entire unit so that you
can see the evolution of that particular

00:21:00.889 --> 00:21:00.899
can see the evolution of that particular
 

00:21:00.899 --> 00:21:06.200
can see the evolution of that particular
time sort and as time goes on we hope to

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:06.210
time sort and as time goes on we hope to
 

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.419
time sort and as time goes on we hope to
detect get more if I don't think they'll

00:21:08.419 --> 00:21:08.429
detect get more if I don't think they'll
 

00:21:08.429 --> 00:21:10.999
detect get more if I don't think they'll
get necessary oh yeah that's my guess

00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:11.009
get necessary oh yeah that's my guess
 

00:21:11.009 --> 00:21:12.979
get necessary oh yeah that's my guess
they will probably get more and more

00:21:12.979 --> 00:21:12.989
they will probably get more and more
 

00:21:12.989 --> 00:21:17.690
they will probably get more and more

of events from blackballed and it makes
 

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:02.789
of events from blackballed and it makes
it far more likely and I now very much

00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799
it far more likely and I now very much
 

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:03.840

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:45.600
in that case if there are no further
questions we'll close this session and I

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:45.610
questions we'll close this session and I
 

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.280
questions we'll close this session and I
know that several of you have requested

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:47.290
know that several of you have requested
 

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.770
know that several of you have requested
individual interviews that will commence

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:49.780
individual interviews that will commence
 

00:24:49.780 --> 00:27:09.770

four hundred mega parsec away we don't
 

00:29:46.219 --> 00:29:50.799
four hundred mega parsec away we don't
know which galaxy it was exactly but we

00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:50.809
know which galaxy it was exactly but we
 

00:29:50.809 --> 00:29:53.949
know which galaxy it was exactly but we
know that it was 1.3 billion light-years

00:29:53.949 --> 00:29:53.959
know that it was 1.3 billion light-years
 

00:29:53.959 --> 00:29:59.679
know that it was 1.3 billion light-years
away which is quite far away but it's

00:29:59.679 --> 00:29:59.689
away which is quite far away but it's
 

00:29:59.689 --> 00:30:01.929
away which is quite far away but it's
very difficult to pinpoint the location

00:30:01.929 --> 00:30:01.939
very difficult to pinpoint the location
 

00:30:01.939 --> 00:30:04.689
very difficult to pinpoint the location
exactly because the detectors we have

00:30:04.689 --> 00:30:04.699
exactly because the detectors we have
 

00:30:04.699 --> 00:30:08.859
exactly because the detectors we have
are not very sensitive directional so

00:30:08.859 --> 00:30:08.869
are not very sensitive directional so
 

00:30:08.869 --> 00:30:11.529
are not very sensitive directional so
they can point to an arc on the sky we

they can point to an arc on the sky we
might have happened but cannot say

exactly that this was where

00:30:22.419 --> 00:30:25.799
 
it might happen closer to us in in the

it might happen closer to us in in the
 

00:30:25.809 --> 00:30:28.619
it might happen closer to us in in the
near future but we are getting so few

00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:28.629

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:31.950
gravitation away and this at this time
 

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:35.070
gravitation away and this at this time
but I cannot tell you when we'll see

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080
but I cannot tell you when we'll see
 

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.019
but I cannot tell you when we'll see
something which is even closer dangerous

00:30:40.019 --> 00:30:40.029
something which is even closer dangerous
 

00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:44.279
something which is even closer dangerous
for us this will probably not be

00:30:44.279 --> 00:30:44.289
for us this will probably not be
 

00:30:44.289 --> 00:30:46.859
for us this will probably not be
dangerous for us unless earth would

00:30:46.859 --> 00:30:46.869
dangerous for us unless earth would
 

00:30:46.869 --> 00:30:49.619
dangerous for us unless earth would
collide with a black hole which which is

00:30:49.619 --> 00:30:49.629
collide with a black hole which which is
 

00:30:49.629 --> 00:30:53.009
collide with a black hole which which is
not going to happen anytime soon but the

00:30:53.009 --> 00:30:53.019
not going to happen anytime soon but the
 

00:30:53.019 --> 00:30:56.369
not going to happen anytime soon but the
effect is so tremendously small and here

00:30:56.369 --> 00:30:56.379
effect is so tremendously small and here
 

00:30:56.379 --> 00:30:58.619
effect is so tremendously small and here
we're talking about trillions of a

00:30:58.619 --> 00:30:58.629
we're talking about trillions of a
 

00:30:58.629 --> 00:31:01.919
we're talking about trillions of a
millimeter on a length which is the size

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:01.929
millimeter on a length which is the size
 

00:31:01.929 --> 00:31:05.820
millimeter on a length which is the size
of the diameter of the earth but this is

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:05.830
of the diameter of the earth but this is
 

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.859
of the diameter of the earth but this is
not something which an ordinary human

00:31:07.859 --> 00:31:07.869
not something which an ordinary human
 

00:31:07.869 --> 00:31:10.289
not something which an ordinary human
which would even feel this is why we

00:31:10.289 --> 00:31:10.299
which would even feel this is why we
 

00:31:10.299 --> 00:31:12.769
which would even feel this is why we
need is extremely sensitive instrument

00:31:12.769 --> 00:31:12.779
need is extremely sensitive instrument
 

00:31:12.779 --> 00:31:15.629
need is extremely sensitive instrument
so even when they arrived at Earth

00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639
so even when they arrived at Earth
 

00:31:15.639 --> 00:31:20.460
so even when they arrived at Earth
nobody could just feel it just true us

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:20.470
nobody could just feel it just true us
 

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.499
nobody could just feel it just true us
so we believe that there are

00:31:22.499 --> 00:31:22.509
so we believe that there are
 

00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:25.019
so we believe that there are
gravitational waves sweeping through the

00:31:25.019 --> 00:31:25.029
gravitational waves sweeping through the
 

00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:30.450
gravitational waves sweeping through the
earth all the time now now if we're

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:30.460
earth all the time now now if we're
 

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.119
earth all the time now now if we're
lucky and the amplitude is slightly

00:31:33.119 --> 00:31:33.129
lucky and the amplitude is slightly
 

00:31:33.129 --> 00:31:35.489
lucky and the amplitude is slightly
larger then we are able to detect them

00:31:35.489 --> 00:31:35.499
larger then we are able to detect them
 

00:31:35.499 --> 00:31:38.129
larger then we are able to detect them
but mostly we are not even able to see

00:31:38.129 --> 00:31:38.139
but mostly we are not even able to see
 

00:31:38.139 --> 00:31:41.330
but mostly we are not even able to see
them what was this sound of the

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340
them what was this sound of the
 

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.830
them what was this sound of the
gravitational wave like

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840

also the point is and I want to stress

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:48.090
also the point is and I want to stress
 

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.090
also the point is and I want to stress
that that gravitational waves are not

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100
that that gravitational waves are not
 

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:55.039
that that gravitational waves are not
sound but the waveform has Wiggles in

00:31:55.039 --> 00:31:55.049
sound but the waveform has Wiggles in
 

00:31:55.049 --> 00:31:58.310
sound but the waveform has Wiggles in
them and if you look at these Wiggles

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320
them and if you look at these Wiggles
 

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.940
them and if you look at these Wiggles
and how they vary over time you can

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:01.950
and how they vary over time you can
 

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.310
and how they vary over time you can
represent what you see in terms of an

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320
represent what you see in terms of an
 

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.310
represent what you see in terms of an
audible signal and this was the chair of

we're saying that the gravitational

00:32:18.649 --> 00:32:18.659
we're saying that the gravitational
 

00:32:18.659 --> 00:32:22.460

middle of the 1960's he built the first
prototype detectors in 1967 and then he

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:54.750
prototype detectors in 1967 and then he
 

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:59.330
prototype detectors in 1967 and then he
demonstrated the principle he charted

00:32:59.330 --> 00:32:59.340
demonstrated the principle he charted
 

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.570
demonstrated the principle he charted
the various noise sources which would

influence the performance of the
 

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:07.460
influence the performance of the
detector and as I I've been trying to

mention the detect is incredibly

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360
mention the detect is incredibly
 

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.080
mention the detect is incredibly

so you have to know very very well what

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:25.980
so you have to know very very well what
 

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.820
so you have to know very very well what
kind of sources can give you signals

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:28.830
kind of sources can give you signals
 

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.789
kind of sources can give you signals
which simulates gravitational wave to be
