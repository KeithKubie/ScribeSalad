IAN LAKE: Remember back when
dinosaurs ruled the earth,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.090
and Android notifications
looked like this?

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.460
Oh my.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.660
Thankfully, I've seen
fewer dinosaurs around.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.330
And Android notifications
have gotten a lot better.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.270
Ever-evolving APIs don't
always make for the easiest

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.540
development experience.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.240
And that's why there's
NotificationCompat.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.400
It gives you a single interface
across all API levels,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.980
so you can concentrate
on building

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.500
the best notifications you can.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.340
I'm Ian Lake.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.060
And I'll show you how you can
build awesome notifications

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.280
with the help of
NotificationCompat,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.650
helping reengage users whether
they're on their phone, watch,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.875
or in their car.

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:37.640
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.910
Let's start at the beginning.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.440
Every notification has a few
required parts-- a small icon,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.820
title, and text.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.300
To build a notification, use
a NotificationCompat builder.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.920
Then build and send
the notification.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.040
Done.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.330
One fatal flaw.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.260
Tapping on this
notification does nothing.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.340
Nothing!

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.690
We need a content
intent that points

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.820
to the activity we
want to launch when

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.380
the user taps the notification.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.920
But we can do so much
more with notifications.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.770
Set a color, to make
the notification

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.950
recognizable as from your app.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.180
Set a large icon, and
now we actually know

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.885
who the notification is from.

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:15.760
Already you have something
you might actually

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.030
want to click on.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.200
This compact title and
text format is the basic.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.720
And all of it's available
on older platforms.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.870
But basic shouldn't
be where you stop.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.000
Let's make this good.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.320
Like, really good.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.680
On Android 4.1 and
higher devices,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.080
notifications can
expand, giving you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.030
more space to work with,
going beyond the title and one

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.420
line of text.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.110
NotificationCompat
provides four styles.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.480
Which you can use to
improve your notifications,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.490
particularly when expanded.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.050
You'll find BigTextStyle for
showing multiple lines of text,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.610
such as a long message,
perfect to actually see

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.400
the full message.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.880
InboxStyle, for showing a
list of single line strings.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.890
BigPictureStyle
for showing a-- you

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.440
guessed it-- a big
picture when expanded.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.480
And MediaStyle, for adding
media controls directly

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.470
to your notification.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.770
Well, now our notification
has some room to breathe

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.370
and gives users a
lot of information,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.900
pulling them back into your app.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.410
Good.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.990
But we're busy people.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.860
Adding actions to
your notification

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.160
gives users quick access to
the most important actions,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.740
without breaking their groove.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.330
Not that I'd ever mute Joanna.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.730
But notifications aren't just
on your mobile device anymore.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.720
They're also on your
wrist, with Android Wear.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.810
Any actions you've added
to your notification

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.450
are automatically mirrored
over to Android Wear devices,

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.270
enabling users to handle
tasks without even pulling out

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.340
their phone or opening the app.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.960
But mirroring your phone
experience over to Android Wear

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.940
can only get you so far.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.240
To really make things great,
you can use NotificationCompat's

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.660
WearableExtender.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.150
Here's where all the
Wear-specific magic happens.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.765
We've talked about
mirroring actions.

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:56.760
With WearableExtender,
you can build

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.630
the perfect set of actions
that makes sense for the watch.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.040
Including voice replies.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.030
Again, rich actions that
increase engagement, even when

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.370
the user can't open your app.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.780
Another example is adding a
high resolution background

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.430
image, the easy way to offer
a literally crisp experience.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.290
There's a lot more
NotificationCompat's

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.960
WearableExtender
gives you though,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.420
including adding additional
pages of information

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.290
to the notification for
extra content and the ability

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.370
to group notifications
together into a stack,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.950
giving you all the
details on the watch,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.360
but a summary
notification on the phone.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.760
OK, so there's a lot you
can do on your wrist.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.460
What about an Android
Auto equipped car?

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.970
Here, messaging apps can
use NotificationCompat's

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.990
CarExtender to send a message,
or a whole set of messages,

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.640
in a conversation to
Android Auto, where

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.410
they can be read aloud and
the user can voice reply,

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.580
all while keeping
their eyes on the road.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.670
So, using
NotificationCompat, you

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.540
get a single API for all
Android versions, support

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.850
for progressive
enhancements through adding

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.560
styles and actions,
and even the tools

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.320
to bring great notifications to
Android Wear and Android Auto.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.440
That's a lot of opportunity to
make beautiful notifications

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.820
everywhere.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.579
Get started with
NotificationCompat

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.220
by adding the support
library to your project.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.910
You'll need App Compat for
media style notifications,

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.010
or just support
v4 for everything

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.970
else NotificationCompat
has to offer.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.130
With the tools you need to
build great notifications

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.610
on a phone, tablet, watch, and
car, you can't help but build

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.220
better apps.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.270
