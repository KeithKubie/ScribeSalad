00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.144
Voiceover:A translation
acting on the coordinate plane

00:00:03.144 --> 00:00:07.472
takes a point negative 169 comma 434

00:00:07.472 --> 00:00:10.772
to point negative 203 comma negative 68.

00:00:10.772 --> 00:00:13.355
What are the coordinates of the image

00:00:13.355 --> 00:00:19.271
of point 31 comma negative
529 under this translation?

00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:20.604
I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:22.408
and try to think about it on your own.

00:00:22.408 --> 00:00:25.469
Let's think about what the change in x

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:26.947
that this translation does

00:00:26.947 --> 00:00:29.273
and the change in y that
this translation does.

00:00:29.273 --> 00:00:37.087
Our change in x is going
to be our ending point,

00:00:38.136 --> 00:00:42.939
so negative 203 minus our starting point.

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:47.725
Minus negative 169.

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:50.266
This is the same thing as,

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.465
I'll just write it in yellow,

00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:55.869
negative 203 plus 169

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:59.372
which is the same thing as 169 minus 203

00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:00.375
I'm just writing it this way

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:02.351
for put my brain to process it,

00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:04.322
which is the same thing as the negative

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:07.980
of 203 minus 169.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.182
Let's see this one is the easiest

00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:11.605
for my brain to process

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:13.645
this is going to be 34.

00:01:13.645 --> 00:01:15.782
This is going to be negative 34

00:01:15.782 --> 00:01:17.052
that's our change in x.

00:01:17.052 --> 00:01:18.915
I was thinking about our change in y.

00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:23.312
Our change in y is our ending point

00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:27.397
is negative 68,

00:01:27.397 --> 00:01:30.810
and our starting point is 434.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.891
Our ending point minus our starting point,

00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:38.651
minus 434 is going to be equal to,

00:01:38.651 --> 00:01:40.512
so this is just going to be the same thing

00:01:40.512 --> 00:01:46.915
as the negative of 68 plus 434

00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:52.113
and let's see 430 plus 60 is 490,

00:01:52.113 --> 00:01:55.309
plus another eight plus
four, plus another 12

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:57.611
so that's going to get us to 502.

00:01:57.611 --> 00:02:01.387
This is going to be negative 502.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:04.864
This translation, what it does is

00:02:04.864 --> 00:02:08.714
it shifts us in the x
direction by negative 34

00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:12.612
and it shifts us in the y
direction by negative 502.

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:16.446
If we're starting at
31 comma negative 529,

00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:19.864
we're going to end up at,

00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:21.005
let me write it this way,

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:22.313
if we're starting at this point,

00:02:22.313 --> 00:02:26.677
we're starting at 31 comma negative 529

00:02:26.677 --> 00:02:31.950
we're going to end up at 31 minus 34

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.369
that's how much we're going to shift it

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:39.091
and negative 529,

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:45.927
so negative 529 minus 502.

00:02:45.927 --> 00:02:47.334
What's this going to be?

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:50.565
31 minus 34 is negative 3

00:02:50.565 --> 00:02:54.998
and then if we have negative 529 minus 502

00:02:54.998 --> 00:02:59.566
that's going to be negative 1031.

00:02:59.566 --> 00:03:02.146
That is where we end up,

00:03:02.146 --> 00:03:05.002
we end up at the point negative 3 comma

00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:07.563
negative 1031,

00:03:07.563 --> 00:03:09.732
under this point gets mapped to this point

00:03:09.732 --> 00:03:11.664
under this translation.
