00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.170
What do you get when you combine water with
a homemade electrolyzer and power from a car battery?

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.650
In a previous project, I built a generator
that uses electricity to convert water into

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.470
a very powerful fuel. The amount of electricity
available determines how much gas can be produced.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.110
And using a couple of car batteries I've been able to produce over 5 liters a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.540
minute. I've even tried powering it with a
makeshift hand-crank generator like this one,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.490
but obviously the gas production is slower.
So just how powerful is the gas? To find out,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.320
I've rounded up some plastic cups, some liquid
dish soap, and water because we're going to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.980
make some bubbles. I'm pouring just a little
bit of water into this cup, followed by a

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.700
quick shot of soap .. and even that's probably
more than I need. Agitating the cup like this, will mix

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.780
the two together, and while I'm here I may
as well fill up the rest of these cups as

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.100
well. Now it's time to put in some ear plugs
and safety glasses because this next part

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.380
could be dangerous. Using jumper cables, I've
connected to my car battery to get the system

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.350
warmed up. When the gas makes its way through the
lines, you can see it pushing up through the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.300
bubbler. Now I can take the end of the tubing,
and place it inside of the soap solution to start

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.900
collecting some gas. The gas is just a mixture
of the H2O molecules broken down into their

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.240
gaseous elements of two parts Hydrogen and
one part Oxygen. This is sometimes called

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.460
HHO, or Hydroxy gas. Alright, the bubbles have reached the top of the cup, so I'll gently remove

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.210
the tubing trying not to disturb the bubbles
too much, then use a bbq ignitor to see if

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.050
the bubbles will pop. That's crazy. Even without
a lid, the cup is completely torn to shreds.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.980
Well, that's why I've got more cups, so I can do
it again. This one looks ready, so let's add

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.479
some fire. When the bubbles explode, the gas
burns clean, and turn back into water vapor.

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.440
There's something elementally exciting about using fire to make water, and I've just done

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.619
it again with cups 4 and cup 5. Funny enough, did you also know you can use water to make

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.209
a fire? Look for that in a different project.
Ok these cups are completely destroyed, so

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.380
I'm trying something a little different with
this last one. I've filled it all the way

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.090
to the top and stirred in a little more soap.
and  this time when the bubbles are pouring over

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.560
the top, they light off with just as much
power, but the cup stays intact. This allows

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.200
me to use the same cup again and again. Some
people might ask what the purpose of the bubbler

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.300
is. Well, it helps clean the gas, but more
importantly, it acts as a flame arrestor in

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.360
the event of a flashback like this. If that
flame were to get back inside your generator

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.500
it would probably do some damage. The bubbler
cap is just pressed on, so if there's a tiny

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.849
flashback explosion, the worst thing that
happens is the cap pops off. If the bubbler is

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.980
a little low on fluid then be careful, because
now the gas has a place to build up, and if

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.270
you were to get a flashback in this situation,
it could be a little more dramatic. It's helpful

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.090
to keep the bubbler full, so I made it detachable
for ease of use. Ok, my next test is to fill

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.959
a plastic soda bottle, and I'll show you how
to do that in a minute. With the cap off the

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.910
gas is slowly leaking out, and when touched
to a flame it takes off with quite a bit of

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.300
energy. Small bottles are fairly safe to play
with, but anything bigger than this needs

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.349
to be lit from a distance. I just made this
remote detonator pad to I can ignite larger

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.660
bottles from over 20 feet away. I have these
bottles filled with water, and to charge them

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.900
with gas, I hold them upside down in a bucket
of water. The lid gets removed below the water

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.900
line so I can insert the tube up inside the
bottle. And when the electrical connection

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.720
is made, the gas bubbles up inside, forcing
the water down and out. After all the water

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.340
has been pushed out, the tube gets removed
and the cap screwed back on, and now this

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.019
bottle is full of hydroxy gas, ready for ignition. Igniting it this way is pretty risky, but I felt like I had to

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.769
try it. This here is the safer way. The bottle
is placed carefully on the detonator pad,

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.019
and then from a distance I can fire it off
at will. Soda bottles have pressure rated

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.650
plastic that can withstand the explosive power,
turning these into makeshift rockets. And

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.239
rather than exploding, they can be re-used
over again. In contrast, the plastic on a

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.090
water bottle is weak, and doesn't survive
the blast. I'm filling up a milk jug using

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.879
the same technique as the bottles, and now
we've got 1 gallon of gas ready to go. Man,

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:18.690
that is powerful. I'm probably gonna to have to do that again. Wooo, nice! Nothing but shrapnel. And

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.930
that's really cool. This juice jug has thicker
plastic, and explodes with incredible force.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.860
When I set this jug off, my neighbor told me he felt the floor in his house shake. Well,

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.860
the generator's getting hot, so it's time
to shut it down and put everything away for

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.070
the day. That's it for this project. If you
