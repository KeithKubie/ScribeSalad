00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:03.200
Ragusa: All right, thanks
a lot for coming, folks.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.167
Thanks for skipping lunch
for this.

00:00:05.167 --> 00:00:08.133
My name is Jeff Ragusa.
I'm with the Google Apps team.

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.868
I'm a channel manager.

00:00:09.868 --> 00:00:12.400
We are going to talk today
about cloud computing,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.801
about Google Apps
in particular.

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.033
We're gonna talk about
how it relates

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:17.300
to those of you
in the business

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.334
of providing
services and solutions

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:22.467
to business customers.

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:24.934
So our Google Apps
partnership program,

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:26.834
our reseller program,
is kind of the backdrop here.

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:28.367
So we're gonna talk
a little bit about that.

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:31.400
And then I want to get into
addressing the issue

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.534
that I think is top of mind

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:34.067
for a lot of folks
in the IT industry

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.300
when they think about
cloud computing

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.567
or softwares and service,

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:37.834
and that
is the question of:

00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:39.400
How do I make money
on this stuff?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.167
Or even flipping it
the other way around:

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:42.434
How do I avoid
losing the money

00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.801
that my clients
may be currently paying me

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:49.167
as the world
kind of shifts away

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:51.033
from high margins
of on-premise software

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:53.567
and on-premise hardware
and installed software

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:55.667
and shifts
from product-based revenue

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:57.200
to services-based revenue.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.801
So we're gonna
talk about that.

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:00.267
And then we've
got Daniel Jefferies,

00:01:00.267 --> 00:01:01.601
who's from Newmind,

00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:03.501
who's one of our great
early partners,

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:05.367
and he's gonna come up and share
some of his experiences

00:01:05.367 --> 00:01:06.667
with our reseller program

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:09.133
and bringing this business
to business customers

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.400
and growing his business,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.534
and I think you'll be able
to relate well

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:13.100
to the things
he has to say.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.334
So we look forward to that.

00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:20.534
So, cloud computing,
all the rage.

00:01:20.534 --> 00:01:22.901
Cloud computing
for businesses

00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:25.033
means that your data
and applications

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:26.501
reside in the network.

00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:28.300
At Google,
we run the largest

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.367
cloud computing applications
in the world.

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:31.801
There's not much doubt
about that.

00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.834
From Google Search,
Google.com,

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:36.501
Google Maps, Google Earth,
YouTube,

00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:38.200
Gmail, Google Apps.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.234
We maintain worldwide
availability and up time

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:43.434
that's unparalleled
in the software world.

00:01:43.434 --> 00:01:44.567
And then we're
doing all of this

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:46.734
with millions of users
using it.

00:01:46.734 --> 00:01:48.968
So all those things together
make us a global leader

00:01:48.968 --> 00:01:50.133
in cloud computing.

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.968
I think that's probably
a common theme

00:01:51.968 --> 00:01:55.701
that you hear throughout
the sessions here at I/O.

00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:57.100
So how do we do that?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.434
Well, first of all,

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:00.868
we've built a large number
of massive data centers

00:02:00.868 --> 00:02:02.133
around the world.

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:04.234
And then we build
our own hardware.

00:02:04.234 --> 00:02:05.868
We fill those data centers
with custom-built hardware

00:02:05.868 --> 00:02:07.300
that's meant
to be cost effective

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.467
and energy efficient

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:09.901
and, really,
designed from scratch

00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:12.801
to host an Internet-scale
software platform

00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:14.467
where we're able to have
applications

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:15.901
that scale
to millions of users,

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:19.267
while at the same time
providing near-constant up time.

00:02:19.267 --> 00:02:20.934
And they have the ability

00:02:20.934 --> 00:02:23.367
to accept frequent
feature updates.

00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:25.267
So it's kind of
a nice hat trick.

00:02:25.267 --> 00:02:28.300
And this is--this is why
businesses come to Google.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.834
This is why we have
an enterprise group

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:31.100
that I'm a part of

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.534
and that the Google Apps team
is a part of.

00:02:32.534 --> 00:02:36.501
And this is why
that group is thriving.

00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:38.100
So drilling down on that,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.267
in terms of what it means
for businesses,

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:42.601
what are some
of the benefits?

00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:44.934
So this is just a few.
First of all is cost.

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:46.100
So computing at this scale

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.567
allows us to radically
lower costs.

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:50.701
And our costs
in computing effectively,

00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:52.467
in order of magnitude,
are more lower

00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:55.267
than on-premise solutions.

00:02:55.267 --> 00:02:57.467
The other thing that we're able
to do with cloud computing

00:02:57.467 --> 00:03:00.133
is roll out features
into the software platform

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:01.467
at a much faster rate
than you could

00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:04.100
with traditional--
with traditional software.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.934
I'm gonna talk about
our Google Apps suite,

00:03:05.934 --> 00:03:08.467
where just, as an example,
we've rolled out

00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:11.200
over 150 new features
into the suite

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.501
in the two years
since its launch.

00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:15.033
And those
are seamlessly picked up

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:17.267
and deployed to users.

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:19.100
So speaking of users,
happier end users--

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.133
how do you get
happier end users?

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:22.934
Well, again, for example,
in the Google Apps suite,

00:03:22.934 --> 00:03:25.234
what we're able to do
is to watch, you know,

00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:26.567
at scale, watch users,

00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:27.734
how they're using
the applications

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:29.000
and then make modifications
and adjustments

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.100
to the applications

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.000
based on
the empirical evidence of--

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.734
of how they're
interacting with it.

00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:36.400
And so--and we're able
to do that at scale.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.934
And again, that's just something
that you can't get

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:39.701
with traditional
software applications--

00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:42.067
that feedback loop.

00:03:42.067 --> 00:03:44.601
So I want you to--
you know, this is why

00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:46.067
business are coming
to Google for this

00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:47.601
and why they're
coming to--

00:03:47.601 --> 00:03:49.601
why they're moving
their businesses to the cloud.

00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:51.701
But for those of you,

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:53.400
if you're in the IT services
business,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.601
you know, the message here,
which we'll talk about more,

00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:57.701
is that--is that
this pertains to you.

00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:59.501
You've got to have a cloud
strategy of your own

00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:01.300
of some sort, be it
with Google or somebody else,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.734
because this stuff
is undeniable.

00:04:03.734 --> 00:04:06.167
So we'll talk more about--
we'll talk more about that.

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:08.767
But at Google, our cloud
really takes the form of--

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:12.767
it take two forms
as it relates to businesses

00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:14.234
and business applications.

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:17.133
Very simply, there's our apps
and there's your apps.

00:04:17.133 --> 00:04:18.501
And when I say your apps,

00:04:18.501 --> 00:04:19.801
I'm assuming I'm talking
to folks at Google I/O,

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.300
developers, solution providers,
and folks.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.100
It's--it's you being able
to create applications

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.300
on our cloud,

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.734
and what happens is our apps
and your apps

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:27.801
sit next to each other

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:30.234
on our scalable
serving architecture,

00:04:30.234 --> 00:04:34.267
and they're able to integrate
well with one another.

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:36.167
So on the "your apps" side,

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:38.200
we talked about
Google App Engine.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.400
There are a number of sessions
here at I/O

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.834
that go into depth
on Google App Engine.

00:04:40.834 --> 00:04:42.667
I'm gonna touch on them
a little bit.

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:44.567
But then I'm gonna also
talk about Google Apps,

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:47.167
which is the form of--

00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:50.167
which is the form that our apps
take in the cloud.

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:51.734
And this is our business
application suite,

00:04:51.734 --> 00:04:54.334
which I'm gonna drill down
into more.

00:04:54.334 --> 00:04:57.567
So there's our apps
and your apps.

00:04:57.567 --> 00:04:59.334
So Google Apps, so again,

00:04:59.334 --> 00:05:00.901
this is our business
application suite,

00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:02.934
Google Apps Premiere Edition.

00:05:02.934 --> 00:05:05.868
Effectively,
this is a suite of tools

00:05:05.868 --> 00:05:08.334
for making messaging
and collaboration easier

00:05:08.334 --> 00:05:10.767
within the context
of businesses or teams.

00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:12.534
And it's a suite of services.

00:05:12.534 --> 00:05:14.400
It's constantly growing,
which is kind of exciting.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.934
But currently
consists of Gmail

00:05:15.934 --> 00:05:17.334
with embedded
instant messaging

00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:18.467
and video chat;

00:05:18.467 --> 00:05:20.801
Google Talk,
for real-time communication;

00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:22.968
Google Calendar;
Google Docs;

00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:24.400
spreadsheets
and presentations.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.567
This is in
Google Presentations.

00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:29.934
Google Sites,
which is a service

00:05:29.934 --> 00:05:32.000
for building collaborative
team websites.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.701
And Google Video, for private
video sharing and hosting.

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:36.934
So it's all these things,
again,

00:05:36.934 --> 00:05:38.267
hosted on the Google cloud.

00:05:38.267 --> 00:05:41.167
But--and accessible
to users through a web browser--

00:05:41.167 --> 00:05:42.567
anywhere, anytime access--

00:05:42.567 --> 00:05:44.300
or through mobile devices.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.801
But then it's branded
by the--

00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:49.200
branded for the end customer,
right?

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.667
So meaning that the most
obvious example there

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:53.667
is when you talk about
having email addresses,

00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:54.934
and if a business has

00:05:54.934 --> 00:05:57.200
"@mybusiness.com"
email addresses,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.467
Google App suite,

00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:00.000
they're able to maintain
those email addresses--

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.133
"mybusiness.com"--

00:06:01.133 --> 00:06:02.567
but just have Google
on the back end

00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:05.901
powering the mail servers.

00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:08.767
There's an administrative
interface to all of this.

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:10.868
And then their administrative
API has to be able

00:06:10.868 --> 00:06:12.868
to integrate in
with existing systems,

00:06:12.868 --> 00:06:13.968
either other
cloud-based systems

00:06:13.968 --> 00:06:15.868
or systems
inside the firewall.

00:06:15.868 --> 00:06:17.267
And it's meant to be
highly interoperable.

00:06:17.267 --> 00:06:18.434
You can have some of these
services turned on,

00:06:18.434 --> 00:06:19.734
some turned off.

00:06:19.734 --> 00:06:21.901
You can have some users
using the Google App system

00:06:21.901 --> 00:06:23.434
and other users
using a different system,

00:06:23.434 --> 00:06:26.167
and have them be able
to work well together.

00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:29.367
So I'm gonna--I can
go into a demo,

00:06:29.367 --> 00:06:31.133
but I don't--
I feel like, generally,

00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:33.734
the crowd at these
Google I/O conferences

00:06:33.734 --> 00:06:35.701
have a good idea
of Google Apps

00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:38.634
as far as how it relates
to business users,

00:06:38.634 --> 00:06:39.834
and so
I'm not gonna do that.

00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:41.801
I could also talk about
the business viability

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.667
in terms of, you know,
trying to prove security

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:47.300
or the interoperability
or, uh, reliability.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.167
Instead, I'm gonna talk
about that within the context

00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:51.067
of what you
as a solution provider

00:06:51.067 --> 00:06:52.567
can do with your clients.

00:06:52.567 --> 00:06:54.167
So we'll get into that
a little bit later.

00:06:54.167 --> 00:06:56.434
But I will say two things:
one, it's not free.

00:06:56.434 --> 00:06:58.100
You can see at the top there

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.267
this is a product that we're
selling to businesses

00:07:00.267 --> 00:07:02.067
at $50 per user per year.

00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:03.434
It's a subscription.

00:07:03.434 --> 00:07:05.133
And the second thing
is around--

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.267
is around traction.

00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:11.234
So the--
so we launched this

00:07:11.234 --> 00:07:13.334
a little over two years ago
in aggregate.

00:07:13.334 --> 00:07:15.033
We got over 10 million
active users.

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:16.501
Well over that,
at this point.

00:07:16.501 --> 00:07:18.167
And then
we're at a run rate

00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:19.634
of over
3,000 organizations a day

00:07:19.634 --> 00:07:21.067
that are signing up
for this.

00:07:21.067 --> 00:07:24.133
So traction across the board
with companies of all sizes.

00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:26.234
We just--you may have
seen in the news,

00:07:26.234 --> 00:07:29.033
we just rolled out,
or completed the rollout,

00:07:29.033 --> 00:07:31.334
of 30,000 users at Valeo,

00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:33.834
which is a French automotive
components manufacturer,

00:07:33.834 --> 00:07:35.033
just a couple weeks ago.

00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:36.467
We're excited about that.

00:07:36.467 --> 00:07:38.300
And then on the other,
opposite end of the spectrum,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.167
thousands and thousands and
thousands of small businesses

00:07:40.167 --> 00:07:42.234
are picking up on this.

00:07:42.234 --> 00:07:43.334
In fact, over the past year,

00:07:43.334 --> 00:07:45.467
we've seen over 300% growth

00:07:45.467 --> 00:07:48.167
in terms of the number
of small business

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:50.634
that are using this
as paid product.

00:07:50.634 --> 00:07:53.334
Not just in spite of,
but in large part

00:07:53.334 --> 00:07:56.968
it's because of
the economic conditions.

00:07:56.968 --> 00:07:58.567
Okay, so here's
a kind of interesting part.

00:07:58.567 --> 00:07:59.767
And this is kind of
where you come in.

00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:02.934
This is
an interesting time.

00:08:02.934 --> 00:08:05.200
We saw--we see that there
are a lot of companies

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.067
that are interested
in the benefits here.

00:08:07.067 --> 00:08:08.300
What we found,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.200
particularly with small
and mid-sized businesses,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.968
is that they don't
have the time, the staff,

00:08:11.968 --> 00:08:14.934
or the expertise to be able
to fully adopt these services

00:08:14.934 --> 00:08:18.000
into the businesses
themselves.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And so, for that reason,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.033
what we did was we launched
a reseller program

00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:25.133
just as that adoption curve
was starting to spike.

00:08:25.133 --> 00:08:26.734
Now, the point that I want
to make here--

00:08:26.734 --> 00:08:27.968
we'll talk about the reseller
program specifics

00:08:27.968 --> 00:08:29.501
in a second, but I want
to make this point--

00:08:29.501 --> 00:08:30.701
that this is a new program,

00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:33.634
as in we just started
transactions en masse

00:08:33.634 --> 00:08:35.934
with resellers
in mid-April.

00:08:35.934 --> 00:08:37.234
So a little
over a month ago.

00:08:37.234 --> 00:08:39.834
We launched this program
back in January,

00:08:39.834 --> 00:08:42.000
got a ton of interest,
applications from--

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.167
thousands of applications
from all over the world.

00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:45.601
We basically
put the brakes on folks

00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:47.501
while we got
our operations in order.

00:08:47.501 --> 00:08:49.634
And, like, I said,
we really,

00:08:49.634 --> 00:08:50.801
with the vast majority,

00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:52.701
just started operations
last month.

00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:55.667
So if you're here--
you know, the point being

00:08:55.667 --> 00:08:57.567
that this is definitely
a new opportunity.

00:08:57.567 --> 00:09:00.033
You're not behind if you
haven't gotten started yet.

00:09:00.033 --> 00:09:02.400
But that's one thing
I wanted to say.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.701
The other thing is around
the opportunity

00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:08.067
for leapfrogging
established VARs

00:09:08.067 --> 00:09:10.033
and solution providers here.

00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:12.133
So I've been at Google
for a little over three years,

00:09:12.133 --> 00:09:13.501
working with partners,

00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:16.067
and a couple of things that
have kind of come clear...

00:09:16.067 --> 00:09:17.534
one is that
there are a lot of folks

00:09:17.534 --> 00:09:18.934
who get this stuff.

00:09:18.934 --> 00:09:20.267
All this stuff I just talked
about with cloud computing,

00:09:20.267 --> 00:09:21.434
a lot of our partners,
some of them

00:09:21.434 --> 00:09:22.567
I can actually see--

00:09:22.567 --> 00:09:24.400
recognize some faces
in the crowd here.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.434
And we're gonna hear
from Daniel in a little bit.

00:09:26.434 --> 00:09:27.667
People get this.

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:28.767
But the other thing
I recognize,

00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:30.133
there's a lot of folks,
particularly--

00:09:30.133 --> 00:09:32.234
there's a lot of folks
in the IT services industry

00:09:32.234 --> 00:09:34.167
who, they may
get it as well,

00:09:34.167 --> 00:09:35.901
but they're either
unwilling or unable

00:09:35.901 --> 00:09:39.067
to adjust their business models
or their strategic approach

00:09:39.067 --> 00:09:40.400
to take advantage
of the paradigm shifts

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.868
that we're
talking about here.

00:09:43.868 --> 00:09:46.601
So there's a real
opportunity

00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:49.534
for--for--for you,

00:09:49.534 --> 00:09:51.334
for early mover
advantage here, basically.

00:09:51.334 --> 00:09:52.767
Because we have,
especially in this economy,

00:09:52.767 --> 00:09:54.601
we have a situation where,
from small business owners

00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:56.968
to Fortune 500 CFOs,

00:09:56.968 --> 00:09:58.534
everybody's basically
looking to find ways

00:09:58.534 --> 00:10:00.467
to creatively
get more for less.

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:03.300
And you, as a reseller
or small business reseller

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.567
or a reseller targeting
larger customers,

00:10:04.567 --> 00:10:06.634
if--if--

00:10:06.634 --> 00:10:08.601
there's tremendous value
in you being the hero

00:10:08.601 --> 00:10:11.167
and bringing a technology
solution to bear on this.

00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:13.467
So anyway,
that's kind of the backdrop.

00:10:13.467 --> 00:10:14.634
There's a URL at the bottom

00:10:14.634 --> 00:10:15.834
that you probably
want to jot down,

00:10:15.834 --> 00:10:18.133
Google.com/apps/resellers,

00:10:18.133 --> 00:10:20.200
which just has more
information on the program,

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.367
including a simple
application form.

00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:25.000
It walks you through
the qualification process.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.434
And the program is free.

00:10:26.434 --> 00:10:28.467
I'll leave that up.

00:10:28.467 --> 00:10:31.767
Just real briefly talk about
the basics of the program

00:10:31.767 --> 00:10:32.868
in pictures.

00:10:32.868 --> 00:10:34.100
So this is you.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.601
You know, you were
a frog in the last slide,

00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:38.334
so now you're
a little foosball guy.

00:10:38.334 --> 00:10:40.267
So this is--
you become a reseller.

00:10:40.267 --> 00:10:42.400
You get this little
authorized reseller badge.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.901
And then what you're doing

00:10:43.901 --> 00:10:45.601
is you're gonna bring
Google Apps Premiere Edition,

00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:47.133
the suite that we
just talked about,

00:10:47.133 --> 00:10:49.634
to your business customers.

00:10:49.634 --> 00:10:51.934
So these would be new
or existing clients.

00:10:51.934 --> 00:10:53.634
And you can--
the key thing here

00:10:53.634 --> 00:10:54.868
is that you can take it
and bundle it in

00:10:54.868 --> 00:10:56.400
with existing
solutions offerings

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.000
or existing
services contracts.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.367
And then you're gonna
help those clients

00:11:00.367 --> 00:11:02.067
deploy and roll out
the product.

00:11:02.067 --> 00:11:05.067
And you're gonna handle
billing with them

00:11:05.067 --> 00:11:07.434
as commensurate
with the agreements

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:09.000
that you have in place
with them.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.501
And then you're gonna provide
additional services,

00:11:11.501 --> 00:11:12.901
including consulting,
support,

00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:15.200
custom integration,
and so forth.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.701
And we'll talk more about this
in a minute.

00:11:19.701 --> 00:11:22.167
Okay, now backing up a second
as you kind of zoom out,

00:11:22.167 --> 00:11:23.534
Google is in the background.

00:11:23.534 --> 00:11:25.100
And basically,
what we're doing

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.567
is we're providing you
the product

00:11:26.567 --> 00:11:28.100
at 20% off the list price.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.367
And this, as I mentioned,

00:11:29.367 --> 00:11:32.100
the product is a subscription
fee product,

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.100
so this is a recurring
discount.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.334
And then
we're providing you--

00:11:35.334 --> 00:11:37.000
we're basically
helping you to sell, market,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.033
deploy, and support

00:11:38.033 --> 00:11:40.734
by providing
online community

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:42.501
and partner support
resources.

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:45.300
And then we also provide you
a super user-like console

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:50.601
for managing and supporting
your Google Apps clients.

00:11:50.601 --> 00:11:52.467
So before I move away
from this slide,

00:11:52.467 --> 00:11:56.000
a big tenet of the program
is that, as we look at this,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.267
you, the reseller,
is in the middle of this.

00:11:58.267 --> 00:12:00.501
And that's very intentional.

00:12:00.501 --> 00:12:03.901
If you've built trusted
relationships with your clients,

00:12:03.901 --> 00:12:06.300
and they trust you for
technology advice or support,

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.667
we don't want to get
in the middle of that.

00:12:07.667 --> 00:12:09.801
SaaS or no SaaS,
cloud or no cloud,

00:12:09.801 --> 00:12:11.868
these are your customers,

00:12:11.868 --> 00:12:13.801
and you're going to control
the relationship.

00:12:13.801 --> 00:12:15.434
And so you're definitely

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:16.601
at the centerpiece
of this program,

00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:18.501
and our communications,
any communications,

00:12:18.501 --> 00:12:25.133
go through you.

00:12:25.133 --> 00:12:27.667
So, as you might imagine,
I mentioned online resources.

00:12:27.667 --> 00:12:28.701
We got a partner portal.

00:12:28.701 --> 00:12:30.200
This was actually built
in Google Sites,

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.267
which is one of the services
that I mentioned.

00:12:32.267 --> 00:12:35.167
Lots of marketing
and sales materials and tools.

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:39.501
Product training
materials as well.

00:12:39.501 --> 00:12:41.968
On the sales side,
just an example,

00:12:41.968 --> 00:12:43.501
we'll give you presentations
and data sheets

00:12:43.501 --> 00:12:46.133
that you can take,
internalize, and customize

00:12:46.133 --> 00:12:48.334
when speaking
to your clients.

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:50.467
Demo scripts, where you can
walk through the product.

00:12:50.467 --> 00:12:52.601
Tips and tricks,
things that we do

00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:54.300
when we're selling
in the field.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.534
On the marketing side,

00:12:56.534 --> 00:12:58.634
one of the things we found
to be really effective

00:12:58.634 --> 00:13:00.601
is working, especially
for small business folks,

00:13:00.601 --> 00:13:02.334
working with the local
chamber of commerce.

00:13:02.334 --> 00:13:04.234
Set up, do a seminar,

00:13:04.234 --> 00:13:07.100
and we'll provide
the support for you on that,

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.067
as well as partner branding
and such.

00:13:10.067 --> 00:13:12.033
Technical training,

00:13:12.033 --> 00:13:13.400
comprehensive
technical training

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.367
that's really targeted
at IT professionals.

00:13:15.367 --> 00:13:16.701
This is not
the kind of thing

00:13:16.701 --> 00:13:19.667
that you'd find on our
Google Apps website,

00:13:19.667 --> 00:13:22.434
where we're really
trying to target the users.

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:25.767
And it really
centers on, you know,

00:13:25.767 --> 00:13:27.334
generally on the deployment
side of things,

00:13:27.334 --> 00:13:28.968
where things can get
really complex,

00:13:28.968 --> 00:13:33.834
and on the custom integration
side of things.

00:13:33.834 --> 00:13:36.934
And there's a discussion forum,
which is lively,

00:13:36.934 --> 00:13:39.334
and you'll find
Googler folks in there

00:13:39.334 --> 00:13:40.534
as well as a number
of resellers.

00:13:40.534 --> 00:13:41.968
This is partner-specific,

00:13:41.968 --> 00:13:44.467
and, you know, discussion
across a range of topics.

00:13:44.467 --> 00:13:46.334
It's technical as well as

00:13:46.334 --> 00:13:48.000
sales and marketing
business topics.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.601
Okay, I mentioned
the client management console.

00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:52.000
This actually is just,
if you haven't seen it,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.667
this is just a standard
Google Apps control panel.

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.734
But as a reseller,
what you get built in

00:13:56.734 --> 00:13:58.934
is this link to your
reseller tools.

00:13:58.934 --> 00:14:01.434
Clicking on that brings up
essentially

00:14:01.434 --> 00:14:03.434
a super user control panel,

00:14:03.434 --> 00:14:04.901
where you can drill down
through a list of customers.

00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:06.067
You can drill down into

00:14:06.067 --> 00:14:07.567
any of your client's
control panels

00:14:07.567 --> 00:14:10.434
and do configuration settings,
service settings,

00:14:10.434 --> 00:14:13.200
and support, problem diagnosis,
things like that.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.033
You can also provision
and order new customers

00:14:16.033 --> 00:14:18.100
directly from here
with Google,

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.501
and you can manage
your invoices with Google,

00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:23.434
and--and set up
a support flow,

00:14:23.434 --> 00:14:25.467
so that customers know
how to contact you

00:14:25.467 --> 00:14:26.901
so that, you know,
if you have--

00:14:26.901 --> 00:14:28.901
we're gonna have in
the customer's admin console:

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:30.067
"Contact Google."

00:14:30.067 --> 00:14:31.601
You can basically
fill that out with a,

00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:33.467
you know, "Contact us
with much more information."

00:14:33.467 --> 00:14:36.367
A customized help center,
things like that.

00:14:36.367 --> 00:14:39.734
Okay, so...

00:14:39.734 --> 00:14:42.400
If you've been paying attention
to the financials so far,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.801
we talked about Google Apps,

00:14:43.801 --> 00:14:45.801
$50 per user per year,
ongoing.

00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:48.234
We talked about the reseller
program at 20%.

00:14:48.234 --> 00:14:50.501
So as a reseller,
if you were to just

00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:52.033
sell the product
at list price,

00:14:52.033 --> 00:14:54.467
you're gonna walk away
with $10 per user per year,

00:14:54.467 --> 00:14:57.400
which, for the majority
of folks,

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.601
is not gonna make
a viable business model

00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:00.634
in and of itself.

00:15:00.634 --> 00:15:01.834
And so you really
need to focus

00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:03.501
on these
value-added services,

00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:04.968
which we're
going to talk about.

00:15:04.968 --> 00:15:07.033
And this is, you know,
not Google specific.

00:15:07.033 --> 00:15:08.567
'Cause we look at,
as you might imagine,

00:15:08.567 --> 00:15:11.601
we look at cloud-based
solutions in general.

00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:13.634
Because the costs
are coming down,

00:15:13.634 --> 00:15:15.000
the product margins
themselves

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.367
are gonna be squeezed,

00:15:16.367 --> 00:15:19.334
and you're gonna need
to focus on services.

00:15:19.334 --> 00:15:21.100
But one of the things--
I'd counter that

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.501
one of the things
that we find

00:15:23.501 --> 00:15:26.300
is that in this
cloud-based world,

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.801
there tends to be
a lot more budget room

00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:29.534
open for you to provide
valuable business services.

00:15:29.534 --> 00:15:31.434
And we're gonna
drill down in that.

00:15:31.434 --> 00:15:32.868
So you can actually,
if you play your cards right

00:15:32.868 --> 00:15:35.400
and you approach it
in the correct way,

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.601
you can actually make
more money in this world,

00:15:37.601 --> 00:15:38.901
rather than less.

00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:41.133
So let's take a closer look
at that.

00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:42.901
So in a typical,
on-premise solution,

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:45.334
kind of a traditional
messaging solution, we'll say,

00:15:45.334 --> 00:15:46.934
where does the customer's
money go?

00:15:46.934 --> 00:15:48.767
So first off,
they're spending--

00:15:48.767 --> 00:15:50.834
there's gonna be a lot of--
a good chunk of change

00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:52.234
that goes to the hardware
manufacturer,

00:15:52.234 --> 00:15:53.601
and a good chunk
that goes to the--

00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:56.634
goes on software licenses
and software manufacturer.

00:15:56.634 --> 00:15:57.868
And as a reseller of that,

00:15:57.868 --> 00:15:59.934
you're gonna make
a hefty margin on that.

00:15:59.934 --> 00:16:03.501
This green area
is the part that you get.

00:16:03.501 --> 00:16:05.467
And of course
the proportions here

00:16:05.467 --> 00:16:07.100
are gonna depend
on the market segment

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.267
and on the products.

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.334
But I think you get
the idea.

00:16:10.334 --> 00:16:13.033
There's also a set of services
that you can provide,

00:16:13.033 --> 00:16:14.968
everything from training
users on upgrades

00:16:14.968 --> 00:16:17.200
to fixing problems
and so forth.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.601
So this is--
I'm generalizing,

00:16:19.601 --> 00:16:22.234
but this is a--
you can make a good living

00:16:22.234 --> 00:16:24.701
in today's world
by doing this,

00:16:24.701 --> 00:16:26.133
by playing in this world.

00:16:26.133 --> 00:16:28.000
Now, in the Google Apps
world,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.601
as we talked about,
the product itself

00:16:29.601 --> 00:16:31.200
is much more affordable
for customers.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.367
And so that piece of the pie
is smaller.

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:35.334
As a reseller,
you still get your margin,

00:16:35.334 --> 00:16:36.968
but again, it's a margin
of a smaller pie,

00:16:36.968 --> 00:16:38.968
so you're gonna be
making less on margin.

00:16:38.968 --> 00:16:40.968
But what this does, again,
is it opens up

00:16:40.968 --> 00:16:43.033
tremendous budget room
for you to provide--

00:16:43.033 --> 00:16:44.934
for you to provide
additional services,

00:16:44.934 --> 00:16:46.901
specifically services
that are driving business value.

00:16:46.901 --> 00:16:49.334
So this is your part now.

00:16:49.334 --> 00:16:51.033
And what's left, well,
effectively,

00:16:51.033 --> 00:16:53.167
the pie itself
has gotten a lot smaller.

00:16:53.167 --> 00:16:55.601
And so what's left actually
goes back to the customers

00:16:55.601 --> 00:16:58.701
in terms of--
in terms of cost savings.

00:16:58.701 --> 00:17:00.501
So you think about that,
and you look at this picture,

00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:01.734
this is a win-win.

00:17:01.734 --> 00:17:04.701
The customer is saving money
than they were--

00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:06.767
over what they were
in the last picture.

00:17:06.767 --> 00:17:08.601
You're actually
making more money.

00:17:08.601 --> 00:17:09.734
The green part of this
is bigger

00:17:09.734 --> 00:17:11.434
than it was
in the last slot.

00:17:11.434 --> 00:17:13.334
And the reason for that
is because the technology itself

00:17:13.334 --> 00:17:15.234
is kind of enabling
these economics.

00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:16.300
So it's a win-win.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.367
And the other thing,

00:17:17.367 --> 00:17:18.601
going back to what
I had said earlier

00:17:18.601 --> 00:17:19.701
around, you know,

00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:21.567
everybody from
small businesses to CFOs

00:17:21.567 --> 00:17:24.100
looking to try and get
more for less--

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.167
that's exactly the picture
that we've got here,

00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:28.033
where, as a customer, right,

00:17:28.033 --> 00:17:29.300
they look at this
and they're like,

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.634
"Well, I'm getting
a great product.

00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:34.133
"I'm getting additional
value from the reseller,

00:17:34.133 --> 00:17:36.868
and I'm saving money
while we're at it."

00:17:36.868 --> 00:17:39.534
So this is a really
compelling picture.

00:17:39.534 --> 00:17:41.000
And this is what
we want to get to.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.234
This is what I want to get
all of my resellers to.

00:17:44.234 --> 00:17:46.567
Okay, so lastly,
bringing up the end,

00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:47.701
the last thing
we're gonna talk about,

00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:48.901
the services
that our partners

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:50.667
are having success
providing.

00:17:50.667 --> 00:17:53.033
And I've organized them
into these four buckets,

00:17:53.033 --> 00:17:54.267
just to kind of help us
think about

00:17:54.267 --> 00:17:55.367
and talk about them.

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:57.200
But, you know,

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.534
this is by no means
an exhaustive list.

00:17:59.534 --> 00:18:01.667
So deployment planning,
presales deployment planning,

00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:03.934
this is--particularly
relates to--

00:18:03.934 --> 00:18:06.701
to midsize
and larger deployments,

00:18:06.701 --> 00:18:08.400
where you've got a fit test

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.834
and you've got
a proof of concept

00:18:10.834 --> 00:18:12.334
and architecture assessments,

00:18:12.334 --> 00:18:16.133
and perhaps
a managed pilot.

00:18:16.133 --> 00:18:17.701
What we do is we've got
a set of--

00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:18.901
we've got an entire site

00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:21.634
devoted to deployment
planning materials

00:18:21.634 --> 00:18:23.267
that's partner facing
and that you can go into.

00:18:23.267 --> 00:18:24.601
And we've built--including,

00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:28.000
we've built a detailed
enterprise pilot guide

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.667
that you can use
and walk through,

00:18:29.667 --> 00:18:32.334
and--and it's
really meant to--

00:18:32.334 --> 00:18:35.467
really meant to address
this piece of the pie.

00:18:35.467 --> 00:18:38.334
Deployment setup,
data migration,

00:18:38.334 --> 00:18:39.667
change management
and training--

00:18:39.667 --> 00:18:41.567
we're gonna step into
each of these in a minute.

00:18:41.567 --> 00:18:43.801
Managed services
for generating recurring revenue

00:18:43.801 --> 00:18:45.300
for various
types of support.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.300
Customization
systems integration

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.567
and custom
application development.

00:18:49.567 --> 00:18:51.868
So again,
you know, not--

00:18:51.868 --> 00:18:53.734
actually, I would say
that this is not exhaustive.

00:18:53.734 --> 00:18:56.734
But if you look at this,
and, you know,

00:18:56.734 --> 00:18:58.801
there's really not,
like, all of these services,

00:18:58.801 --> 00:19:01.334
all these buckets
fit just as well

00:19:01.334 --> 00:19:02.367
into the on-premise world.

00:19:02.367 --> 00:19:03.734
And that makes sense, right?

00:19:03.734 --> 00:19:05.300
It's like, at some level
you've got technology,

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.334
whether it
lives in the cloud

00:19:06.334 --> 00:19:08.133
or it lives
inside a firewall,

00:19:08.133 --> 00:19:10.267
you know, you've got technology
and you've got users,

00:19:10.267 --> 00:19:11.767
and you've got to bring
those two together.

00:19:11.767 --> 00:19:13.000
And so there's
a set of services

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.200
that make sense
in that space.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.267
So in many ways,

00:19:17.267 --> 00:19:19.267
there's not much difference
between the two

00:19:19.267 --> 00:19:20.834
when we're talking
about services.

00:19:24.701 --> 00:19:27.434
Okay, so a couple of things.

00:19:27.434 --> 00:19:28.901
Once a customer decides
to move to Google Apps,

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:30.434
a couple of things
that need to be done

00:19:30.434 --> 00:19:33.534
and then a bunch more things
that can be done.

00:19:33.534 --> 00:19:34.801
DNS records management.

00:19:34.801 --> 00:19:36.334
In order to activate
the services,

00:19:36.334 --> 00:19:38.467
everybody's got to have DNS,
you know,

00:19:38.467 --> 00:19:39.968
every size customer's
got to--

00:19:39.968 --> 00:19:41.601
their DNS records
need to be manipulated

00:19:41.601 --> 00:19:43.033
to be routing mail
and so forth.

00:19:43.033 --> 00:19:44.367
You look at that.

00:19:44.367 --> 00:19:46.167
User account creation
and setup, you can do this.

00:19:46.167 --> 00:19:48.834
We've got bulk ema--
bulk creation tools.

00:19:48.834 --> 00:19:51.534
We've also got synchronization
tools for LDAP,

00:19:51.534 --> 00:19:54.200
Active Directory Domino,
things like that.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.734
For mail routing,
this is a big one,

00:19:55.734 --> 00:19:57.067
because, in general,

00:19:57.067 --> 00:19:58.300
most of the deployments
you're gonna be working on

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.667
are gonna have
some existing mail solution.

00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:02.167
And so we what we do
is we've got a way

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:04.267
for you to set up
dual delivery,

00:20:04.267 --> 00:20:06.100
where you can take email
for a period of time

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.334
and route it to both
Google Apps

00:20:07.334 --> 00:20:10.267
and an existing solution

00:20:10.267 --> 00:20:13.167
during a rollout period
for backup purposes

00:20:13.167 --> 00:20:15.133
or for the sake of allowing
users to kind of

00:20:15.133 --> 00:20:16.667
migrate over
at their own pace.

00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:18.267
The other thing that you can do
is split routing,

00:20:18.267 --> 00:20:19.334
where you can have
some users,

00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:20.434
as I mentioned earlier,

00:20:20.434 --> 00:20:21.434
some users
on the Google Apps system,

00:20:21.434 --> 00:20:22.634
some users
on another system.

00:20:22.634 --> 00:20:24.000
They're on the same domain

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.300
and email
gets routed appropriately.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.901
Data migration,

00:20:27.901 --> 00:20:29.501
particularly for mail
and contacts,

00:20:29.501 --> 00:20:32.067
is a big thing that you're
likely going to need to tackle.

00:20:32.067 --> 00:20:34.767
We've got tools for doing this
on the server side

00:20:34.767 --> 00:20:36.567
or at the admin level

00:20:36.567 --> 00:20:40.334
where--
where you can, um...

00:20:40.334 --> 00:20:44.334
migrate over either entire org
at a time, remotely,

00:20:44.334 --> 00:20:45.934
and we've also got tools
that you can provide

00:20:45.934 --> 00:20:47.334
to end users--

00:20:47.334 --> 00:20:49.267
you're online--

00:20:49.267 --> 00:20:51.300
to be able
to migrate themselves.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.734
And that's across
mail and contacts.

00:20:52.734 --> 00:20:55.167
There's also tools available
for calendar migration

00:20:55.167 --> 00:20:57.067
and docs migration.

00:20:57.067 --> 00:20:58.701
Some of these tools,
Google has built.

00:20:58.701 --> 00:20:59.801
Some,
third parties have built.

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.000
We've got a solutions
marketplace

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.067
that you can dive into

00:21:02.067 --> 00:21:04.834
and find a lot of great
tools in there.

00:21:04.834 --> 00:21:07.434
Next thing
is mobile access.

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:10.133
This is a huge thing,
mobile and desktop access.

00:21:10.133 --> 00:21:12.701
There's a whole set
of mobile devices

00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:14.234
and...

00:21:14.234 --> 00:21:16.934
they're basically options
for accessing

00:21:16.934 --> 00:21:19.133
and using
Google App services--

00:21:19.133 --> 00:21:21.200
each of the services across
each of these devices

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.901
in a couple
of different ways.

00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:24.634
So it's kind of
a three-dimensional matrix.

00:21:24.634 --> 00:21:28.067
But you can think of being able
to sync the applications

00:21:28.067 --> 00:21:30.534
with native applications
on the device.

00:21:30.534 --> 00:21:33.567
So, for example, being able
to use IMAP to pull in

00:21:33.567 --> 00:21:35.567
email into a native
mail application.

00:21:35.567 --> 00:21:36.934
Or use--we've got
a Google Sync tool

00:21:36.934 --> 00:21:38.434
that uses active syncs
to be able to pull in

00:21:38.434 --> 00:21:40.033
calendar and contacts,
likewise.

00:21:40.033 --> 00:21:42.601
The other thing is
we've got J2ME applications,

00:21:42.601 --> 00:21:44.734
Gmail for mobile being
one of the most popular ones,

00:21:44.734 --> 00:21:47.234
where you can install that
onto certain smartphones

00:21:47.234 --> 00:21:49.133
to get a Gmail interface.

00:21:49.133 --> 00:21:50.534
We've also built
applications

00:21:50.534 --> 00:21:51.968
that are preloaded
into Android--

00:21:51.968 --> 00:21:53.400
into Android devices.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.667
And then there's a set
of browser-based apps.

00:21:55.667 --> 00:21:56.934
So, for example,
in the iPhone case,

00:21:56.934 --> 00:21:58.300
we built an integrated suite

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.400
that runs
in the Safari browser,

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.701
specifically built
for the iPhone.

00:22:02.701 --> 00:22:05.167
Last thing I'll mention here
is the--

00:22:05.167 --> 00:22:07.267
we announced
a little while ago

00:22:07.267 --> 00:22:10.000
that a Google Apps connector

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.234
for BlackBerry
Enterprise Server.

00:22:11.234 --> 00:22:12.467
So coming in July,

00:22:12.467 --> 00:22:13.701
what you'll be able to do
is do PushMail

00:22:13.701 --> 00:22:15.267
out to BlackBerry devices

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:18.467
using this--
this plug-in.

00:22:18.467 --> 00:22:19.868
Like I said,

00:22:19.868 --> 00:22:21.868
there's a ton of third-party
tools here as well

00:22:21.868 --> 00:22:23.334
that are on
the solutions marketplace

00:22:23.334 --> 00:22:25.834
for both synchronization
and migration.

00:22:25.834 --> 00:22:27.234
Interop,

00:22:27.234 --> 00:22:28.968
particularly as it relates
to Calendar, is really big.

00:22:28.968 --> 00:22:30.501
If you've got
Exchange clients

00:22:30.501 --> 00:22:31.934
and you've got
some Exchange expertise,

00:22:31.934 --> 00:22:33.834
what you can do
is you can basically set it up

00:22:33.834 --> 00:22:35.234
so that you share
free busy information

00:22:35.234 --> 00:22:38.634
between Exchange
and Google Apps

00:22:38.634 --> 00:22:40.200
such that you can have
some users on one system,

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.734
some users on the other,

00:22:41.734 --> 00:22:43.434
and they'd be able to schedule
meetings with one another.

00:22:43.434 --> 00:22:44.534
So that's really useful.

00:22:44.534 --> 00:22:46.067
And then user training

00:22:46.067 --> 00:22:48.100
is a big part
of change management.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.434
Again, we've got
an entire site.

00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:52.400
Lots of materials
to help you with this.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.667
And, in many ways,
this goes beyond

00:22:53.667 --> 00:22:55.801
kind of teaching users
how to send an email,

00:22:55.801 --> 00:22:57.968
but it's really,
how do you map

00:22:57.968 --> 00:22:59.734
the Google Apps world
and functionality

00:22:59.734 --> 00:23:01.601
into the language,
the terminology,

00:23:01.601 --> 00:23:03.300
that they're used to using
in a previous system.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.467
That's kind of where
the art of that comes in.

00:23:10.934 --> 00:23:12.968
So if you ap--

00:23:12.968 --> 00:23:14.767
submit an application
to the reseller program,

00:23:14.767 --> 00:23:16.133
you'll get an email back
right away

00:23:16.133 --> 00:23:18.167
that'll point you directly
to that site.

00:23:18.167 --> 00:23:21.567
It'd be easier than me
rattling off the URL.

00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:25.434
So managed services
and support.

00:23:25.434 --> 00:23:27.033
So become a managed
service provider.

00:23:27.033 --> 00:23:29.067
So what I mean by this is

00:23:29.067 --> 00:23:30.767
embrace the efficiency
that I'm talking about

00:23:30.767 --> 00:23:32.067
that the cloud provides.

00:23:32.067 --> 00:23:34.601
As an example, if you've
got clients, you know,

00:23:34.601 --> 00:23:36.801
as much as possible,
don't provide--

00:23:36.801 --> 00:23:39.267
don't charge your clients
an hourly rate.

00:23:39.267 --> 00:23:40.701
Right? Charge them
based on the business value

00:23:40.701 --> 00:23:42.067
that you're providing.

00:23:42.067 --> 00:23:43.300
So, for example,
one example is

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.400
you can go to the client
and say,

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.534
"Look, for $10,000,

00:23:45.534 --> 00:23:46.667
"I'm gonna bring you
a rock-solid,

00:23:46.667 --> 00:23:49.067
"innovative, fast,
secure email system,

00:23:49.067 --> 00:23:50.868
"and I'm gonna manage and
support it for you for a year,

00:23:50.868 --> 00:23:53.234
and you don't have
to worry about a thing."

00:23:53.234 --> 00:23:54.601
Right?
And then you can take that,

00:23:54.601 --> 00:23:57.400
and you can not only just
provide software insula--

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.767
insulation services,

00:23:58.767 --> 00:24:02.033
but actually provide
those technology services

00:24:02.033 --> 00:24:05.567
wrapped within
this business focused guidance.

00:24:05.567 --> 00:24:08.467
So become the--the...

00:24:08.467 --> 00:24:11.100
trusted technology adviser,
is really what I'm getting at.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.701
So some examples...

00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:15.701
I mentioned earlier
we have 150-plus new features

00:24:15.701 --> 00:24:17.834
rolled into Google Apps
in the last two years.

00:24:17.834 --> 00:24:19.300
Customers can't
keep up with that.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.934
But you can,
and we have a feed

00:24:20.934 --> 00:24:22.133
that you can subscribe to,

00:24:22.133 --> 00:24:23.767
and as new features
come across the wire,

00:24:23.767 --> 00:24:25.601
you can dig into them
and really figure out,

00:24:25.601 --> 00:24:28.200
determine which features
make sense for your customers,

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.200
and then bring those
to your clients' attention.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.834
There's tremendous
value in that.

00:24:31.834 --> 00:24:33.901
Monitoring, if you're
a managed service provider.

00:24:33.901 --> 00:24:35.334
This is not the kind
of monitoring

00:24:35.334 --> 00:24:36.701
that they may be used to,

00:24:36.701 --> 00:24:38.033
but it's kind of
a cloud-based version.

00:24:38.033 --> 00:24:41.267
We launched a status dashboard
for Google Apps

00:24:41.267 --> 00:24:42.767
a couple
of months ago.

00:24:42.767 --> 00:24:44.934
And what you can do here
is you can not only monitor

00:24:44.934 --> 00:24:46.634
if there's issues
that come up

00:24:46.634 --> 00:24:48.067
with one of the services,

00:24:48.067 --> 00:24:49.968
and you can proactively
notify your clients,

00:24:49.968 --> 00:24:53.567
but also, if those result
in SLA violations,

00:24:53.567 --> 00:24:54.968
what you can do is you can
notify clients

00:24:54.968 --> 00:24:57.901
and you can actually wind up
getting service refunds

00:24:57.901 --> 00:24:59.634
from Google for that.

00:24:59.634 --> 00:25:01.567
Usage activity reports.

00:25:01.567 --> 00:25:03.033
There's a ton of these
in the--

00:25:03.033 --> 00:25:04.067
or there's
a growing number of these

00:25:04.067 --> 00:25:06.033
in the Google Apps
control panel.

00:25:06.033 --> 00:25:07.934
Vast majority of customers
are not gonna make use of them.

00:25:07.934 --> 00:25:10.067
But if you dive into them,
there's a lot of value

00:25:10.067 --> 00:25:11.601
that can be created there.

00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:13.634
Not sure if you know
that you can actually

00:25:13.634 --> 00:25:15.834
integrate Google Analytics
with Google Sites

00:25:15.834 --> 00:25:17.501
and Google Docs,
and you can do things like

00:25:17.501 --> 00:25:19.567
you can generate reports
for clients

00:25:19.567 --> 00:25:21.467
that allow you to see

00:25:21.467 --> 00:25:24.000
which sites or which docs
are the most popular

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.701
and kind of gauge
relative traffic there.

00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:26.968
So that's a really
interesting thing

00:25:26.968 --> 00:25:28.467
that I think a lot of folks
aren't aware of.

00:25:28.467 --> 00:25:30.234
Comprehensive
help desk support.

00:25:30.234 --> 00:25:31.701
I mentioned earlier,
you know,

00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:33.267
contact Google,
contact the reseller,

00:25:33.267 --> 00:25:35.534
and you can do things like
plug in your own help center,

00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:36.701
your own
contact information.

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:38.000
And what
we're seeing is that

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.767
just by the very nature
of the tighter relationship

00:25:40.767 --> 00:25:42.400
that the resellers have
is that

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.701
a lot of customers,
when faced with that,

00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:45.033
they would rather
contact the reseller,

00:25:45.033 --> 00:25:47.167
'cause they're gonna get
somebody on the phone

00:25:47.167 --> 00:25:49.067
and they're gonna get much
more personalized experience.

00:25:49.067 --> 00:25:50.267
Somebody that knows
their business.

00:25:50.267 --> 00:25:51.701
Make use of that.

00:25:51.701 --> 00:25:53.767
We looked
at the control panel before,

00:25:53.767 --> 00:25:55.234
where you can
dive into

00:25:55.234 --> 00:25:58.467
and--and help, uh...

00:25:58.467 --> 00:26:00.467
support and manage
and diagnose issues

00:26:00.467 --> 00:26:01.868
for your clients.

00:26:01.868 --> 00:26:03.601
There's a lot of areas
in which you can

00:26:03.601 --> 00:26:07.033
provide value
and be proactive about it,

00:26:07.033 --> 00:26:09.033
and generate, you know,
garner recurring revenue

00:26:09.033 --> 00:26:12.534
based on that.

00:26:12.534 --> 00:26:14.367
Last thing that--
that I wanted to address

00:26:14.367 --> 00:26:15.834
is--is application
development,

00:26:15.834 --> 00:26:17.167
custom integration.

00:26:17.167 --> 00:26:18.634
So this is one thing that--
one area that I think

00:26:18.634 --> 00:26:19.701
a lot of resellers

00:26:19.701 --> 00:26:20.801
traditionally
have shied away from,

00:26:20.801 --> 00:26:22.534
primarily because

00:26:22.534 --> 00:26:23.968
it's just too heavyweight.

00:26:23.968 --> 00:26:25.367
The infrastructure management
and so forth

00:26:25.367 --> 00:26:26.634
is just too heavyweight.

00:26:26.634 --> 00:26:27.901
Now, the value in doing it

00:26:27.901 --> 00:26:29.167
is that, you know,
I mentioned before,

00:26:29.167 --> 00:26:31.067
we've got our apps
and your apps.

00:26:31.067 --> 00:26:32.367
A lot of times, customers
will look at Google Apps

00:26:32.367 --> 00:26:33.634
and be like,
"That's great,

00:26:33.634 --> 00:26:35.200
but it would be great
if it did that plus this,"

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.167
if it did this little thing
or this little thing.

00:26:37.167 --> 00:26:41.501
And that's where resellers
with development expertise,

00:26:41.501 --> 00:26:45.000
or resellers working with
developers here...

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.200
could take advantage of that

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.100
if they can get over
the infrastructure cost.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.534
And so that's where
Google App Engine

00:26:49.534 --> 00:26:51.400
really is targeting
the core of that,

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.167
which is to make those
infrastructure costs

00:26:54.167 --> 00:26:55.934
extremely lightweight.

00:26:55.934 --> 00:26:57.067
We also, as of now,

00:26:57.067 --> 00:26:58.634
have a complete
Java development stack.

00:26:58.634 --> 00:27:00.434
You can build things in Java
on the server side,

00:27:00.434 --> 00:27:02.934
and you can also do Java
development for the browser,

00:27:02.934 --> 00:27:06.000
where Google Web Toolkit
will allow that Java

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.467
to be compiled
down to JavaScript,

00:27:07.467 --> 00:27:09.968
which is cross-platform
compliant

00:27:09.968 --> 00:27:11.300
and really fast.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.567
If you've done
any web development

00:27:12.567 --> 00:27:14.067
and you haven't used
Google Web Toolkit,

00:27:14.067 --> 00:27:15.267
you should check it out.

00:27:15.267 --> 00:27:17.267
It's really--
it's really amazing.

00:27:17.267 --> 00:27:19.200
Speaking as someone
who struggled with this

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.400
back in '98,
of building--1998,

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.234
building web applications
across browser

00:27:23.234 --> 00:27:25.701
and struggling
with JavaScript.

00:27:25.701 --> 00:27:27.834
There is a--
there's a ton of things

00:27:27.834 --> 00:27:29.167
that we've added
into this platform

00:27:29.167 --> 00:27:31.133
to make it more business,
more enterprise viable

00:27:31.133 --> 00:27:32.501
over the past year.

00:27:32.501 --> 00:27:36.534
A couple of things--
we've just now actually

00:27:36.534 --> 00:27:37.934
provided the ability
to integrate

00:27:37.934 --> 00:27:39.868
with on-premise data
via the secure data connector.

00:27:39.868 --> 00:27:41.400
There's a transparent
deprecation policy

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.601
on Google App Engine

00:27:42.601 --> 00:27:44.534
and on a number
of these APIs that people

00:27:44.534 --> 00:27:46.467
are not--
not everyone's aware of.

00:27:46.467 --> 00:27:48.934
And then integration with
a Google Apps control panel,

00:27:48.934 --> 00:27:51.067
which we'll actually
take a look at in a second.

00:27:51.067 --> 00:27:53.634
And then, lastly,
there are APIs open,

00:27:53.634 --> 00:27:55.467
APIs for reading and writing
business objects

00:27:55.467 --> 00:27:56.968
to each of these services.

00:27:56.968 --> 00:28:00.234
And a UI customization
framework

00:28:00.234 --> 00:28:02.033
around the Google Gadgets
framework

00:28:02.033 --> 00:28:03.501
that you can dive into

00:28:03.501 --> 00:28:05.267
if you're doing
any web development.

00:28:05.267 --> 00:28:07.400
And then there are a set of--
a plethora of--

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.567
of administrative interfaces
and APIs

00:28:09.567 --> 00:28:12.033
for sinking users
in groups,

00:28:12.033 --> 00:28:13.701
for--for setting up

00:28:13.701 --> 00:28:15.000
a custom authentication
experience

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.234
for programmatically
manipulating Gmail settings

00:28:17.234 --> 00:28:19.100
and more.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.033
Okay, and then, actually,

00:28:21.033 --> 00:28:23.067
just to kind of
tie together the visual

00:28:23.067 --> 00:28:24.400
on the your apps
and our apps,

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.734
this is, again, a Google Apps
standard control panel,

00:28:26.734 --> 00:28:29.367
where you can actually install
an App Engine-based app

00:28:29.367 --> 00:28:30.667
directly into
the control panel

00:28:30.667 --> 00:28:33.467
and manage and deploy that
for your users--

00:28:33.467 --> 00:28:35.434
to your users,
directly alongside email

00:28:35.434 --> 00:28:38.467
and calendar and sites
and so forth.

00:28:38.467 --> 00:28:40.701
So...that is it for me.

00:28:40.701 --> 00:28:42.767
We're gonna hold off
on questions.

00:28:42.767 --> 00:28:44.801
I'm gonna pass it over
to Daniel,

00:28:44.801 --> 00:28:46.300
again from Newmind group,

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.000
who was one of our early
resellers.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.868
He's gonna talk about how
he's using this in his business.

00:28:49.868 --> 00:28:53.100
And so...
thanks for that.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.934
Jefferies: Great.
Thanks, Jeff.

00:28:55.934 --> 00:28:57.467
Great to be here.

00:28:57.467 --> 00:29:00.200
I just want to thank
Jeff and Scott.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.901
There's great people
working at Google,

00:29:01.901 --> 00:29:04.267
and I've been a part
of a lot of different

00:29:04.267 --> 00:29:05.634
reseller programs,

00:29:05.634 --> 00:29:08.133
and it's great
when there's good people

00:29:08.133 --> 00:29:09.834
behind the program.

00:29:09.834 --> 00:29:11.968
And that's
the case here.

00:29:11.968 --> 00:29:16.868
All right.

00:29:16.868 --> 00:29:18.200
Look at time here.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.767
I'm just gonna
set a couple levels here.

00:29:21.767 --> 00:29:24.200
First we'll talk about
sort of

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.868
for you and for me,

00:29:25.868 --> 00:29:27.734
what I intend
to cover here.

00:29:27.734 --> 00:29:29.167
Kind of remind myself.

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:33.033
Set a little context
with who we are

00:29:33.033 --> 00:29:35.934
and where we're
coming from as a company.

00:29:35.934 --> 00:29:37.567
Talk a little bit
about the business,

00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:39.334
how we're selling it,
you know.

00:29:39.334 --> 00:29:41.033
Really, kind of our story,

00:29:41.033 --> 00:29:42.501
something that we're
iterating on.

00:29:42.501 --> 00:29:45.968
Even now, we're evolving
this business model.

00:29:45.968 --> 00:29:48.868
And then,
deployment topics and stories,

00:29:48.868 --> 00:29:50.834
little kind of tales
from the trenches.

00:29:50.834 --> 00:29:53.701
And then we'll
briefly touch on,

00:29:53.701 --> 00:29:55.567
since this is a developers'
conference,

00:29:55.567 --> 00:29:57.801
kind of a relationship

00:29:57.801 --> 00:29:59.200
between resellers
and developers

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:05.033
and how we think we can
really help each other out.

00:30:05.033 --> 00:30:06.467
So a little bit about us.

00:30:06.467 --> 00:30:09.767
We're a small consulting
and managed services company.

00:30:09.767 --> 00:30:11.567
We're based
in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

00:30:11.567 --> 00:30:14.400
We do have experience,
you know,

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.667
kind of in the enterprise,

00:30:15.667 --> 00:30:18.801
but we've
really kind of chosen

00:30:18.801 --> 00:30:20.033
over the last several years

00:30:20.033 --> 00:30:21.901
to kind of diversify
away from that

00:30:21.901 --> 00:30:23.267
and work with companies

00:30:23.267 --> 00:30:25.234
where the decision making
is simple,

00:30:25.234 --> 00:30:28.067
where we can work directly
with decision makers

00:30:28.067 --> 00:30:31.067
rather than the kind of
enterprise business

00:30:31.067 --> 00:30:32.634
we've seen kind of
come and go.

00:30:32.634 --> 00:30:34.734
So that's just a way
we've chosen to go

00:30:34.734 --> 00:30:35.934
in our company.

00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:37.934
We still do work
with enterprise clients,

00:30:37.934 --> 00:30:40.167
but we haven't chosen
to focus on enterprise

00:30:40.167 --> 00:30:41.534
in quite a while.

00:30:41.534 --> 00:30:44.167
So we're coming very much
from that perspective,

00:30:44.167 --> 00:30:46.167
and you'll see that
throughout these slides.

00:30:46.167 --> 00:30:49.434
Small
and mid-market clients,

00:30:49.434 --> 00:30:52.133
you know, we--
we've pretty much,

00:30:52.133 --> 00:30:54.400
after a kind of period
of evaluation,

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.801
we've pretty much
drank the Kool-Aid

00:30:56.801 --> 00:31:01.133
on the cloud
and SaaS platforms.

00:31:01.133 --> 00:31:03.200
You know,
like Jeff was saying,

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.067
we see it as disruptive.

00:31:05.067 --> 00:31:07.000
Whenever there's
something disruptive

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.133
that favors, you know,
the up-and-comers,

00:31:10.133 --> 00:31:11.400
it doesn't favor
the incumbents--

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.267
usually the incumbents
are favored.

00:31:13.267 --> 00:31:17.801
But when there's a cost--
specifically,

00:31:17.801 --> 00:31:19.601
cost disruption like this

00:31:19.601 --> 00:31:21.133
really favors
the up-and-comers,

00:31:21.133 --> 00:31:23.167
which we certainly
are one.

00:31:23.167 --> 00:31:26.601
Um, so...and there's
lots of other folks.

00:31:26.601 --> 00:31:29.701
We're pretty active
on the reseller forums.

00:31:29.701 --> 00:31:32.501
And Jeff's
very active there too.

00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:34.567
There's lots of folks
out there doing this,

00:31:34.567 --> 00:31:35.934
having success with it.

00:31:35.934 --> 00:31:37.534
And we're really pleased

00:31:37.534 --> 00:31:40.033
to be a part
of that community.

00:31:40.033 --> 00:31:43.367
Let's talk a little bit about
business topics.

00:31:43.367 --> 00:31:45.367
Just to kind of help me
understand--

00:31:45.367 --> 00:31:47.033
you've heard a little bit
about me.

00:31:47.033 --> 00:31:50.234
How many--do we have
Google Apps authorized resellers

00:31:50.234 --> 00:31:52.300
that are currently operating?

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.934
Raise--raise hands.
Okay, we have some.

00:31:53.934 --> 00:31:55.200
That's great.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.234
Hopefully,
I'll get to meet

00:31:56.234 --> 00:31:59.400
some of you guys
afterwards, um...

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.467
so yeah, just want
to kind of get a feel

00:32:01.467 --> 00:32:03.400
for who I'm talking to.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.901
So yeah,
the business model.

00:32:06.901 --> 00:32:09.100
Where'd we start?
How'd we get here?

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.601
It's really
a pretty simple story.

00:32:11.601 --> 00:32:16.400
In 2007, we were seeing
some real issues

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.634
surrounding email with,
specifically,

00:32:19.634 --> 00:32:21.133
our small clients.

00:32:21.133 --> 00:32:26.000
And these are clients
that are small head count,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.767
so they don't have large
dollars in the budget,

00:32:28.767 --> 00:32:30.968
but very, very dependent
on their email.

00:32:30.968 --> 00:32:34.367
Real estate industry,

00:32:34.367 --> 00:32:40.133
in particular,
is one that is in that boat.

00:32:40.133 --> 00:32:42.968
So we started moving clients
to Apps, really,

00:32:42.968 --> 00:32:46.901
because, for spam
and stability issues,

00:32:46.901 --> 00:32:49.300
small clients'
platforms,

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.567
that was really the way to go
for us that we saw.

00:32:52.567 --> 00:32:55.901
2008, we moved
our own messaging.

00:32:55.901 --> 00:32:58.834
Really began to get
more familiar with the program.

00:32:58.834 --> 00:33:01.767
And really saw that,

00:33:01.767 --> 00:33:05.200
you know, there was a strength
there in the program,

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.200
specifically around,
really, around spam.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.534
That was kind of
how we got into it.

00:33:08.534 --> 00:33:10.400
But then we started to see
the productivity tools,

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.367
Docs and Sites,
before we moved our messaging.

00:33:13.367 --> 00:33:16.501
You know, I--I'd honestly
never used Docs or Sites before.

00:33:16.501 --> 00:33:19.200
I didn't know, really,
what all was there,

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.834
and began to see
even more strength there.

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:25.000
So again,
later in 2008,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.200
we selected Apps as our
preferred messaging program

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.634
for our new
and existing clients.

00:33:28.634 --> 00:33:30.434
So that just meant,
you know,

00:33:30.434 --> 00:33:31.567
new clients come to us.

00:33:31.567 --> 00:33:33.067
This is what
we're gonna recommend.

00:33:33.067 --> 00:33:35.901
Existing clients
are having email pain.

00:33:35.901 --> 00:33:37.400
We're gonna migrate them.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.701
And we also learned
that the reseller program

00:33:40.701 --> 00:33:42.734
was planned,
basically,

00:33:42.734 --> 00:33:44.133
through this event.

00:33:44.133 --> 00:33:46.734
Saw this event rebroadcasted
on YouTube from last year,

00:33:46.734 --> 00:33:48.934
and Jeff was talking about
we've got this in the works.

00:33:48.934 --> 00:33:51.000
And--and so that
was great for us.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.267
We're already doing it.

00:33:52.267 --> 00:33:53.534
We're already
using it with clients.

00:33:53.534 --> 00:33:54.701
We're basically
going to get help for nothing,

00:33:54.701 --> 00:33:55.834
help for free.

00:33:55.834 --> 00:33:57.067
That's great.

00:33:57.067 --> 00:34:01.567
So we were a pretty easy
sell for Jeff.

00:34:01.567 --> 00:34:02.767
[laughs]

00:34:02.767 --> 00:34:06.567
All right.

00:34:06.567 --> 00:34:08.834
So then 2008,

00:34:08.834 --> 00:34:10.467
you know, we began to see,

00:34:10.467 --> 00:34:13.868
really, as we'd been using it
for a little while then,

00:34:13.868 --> 00:34:18.133
began to really see that
the biggest uptake here

00:34:18.133 --> 00:34:20.667
and the biggest pain
that we were seeing

00:34:20.667 --> 00:34:22.667
was really in what
I would call

00:34:22.667 --> 00:34:24.467
very small
business market.

00:34:24.467 --> 00:34:25.968
So less than ten accounts

00:34:25.968 --> 00:34:29.200
and, really,
in terms of...

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.367
the burden
on email servers,

00:34:31.367 --> 00:34:33.267
these people are just using
straight POP and IMAP.

00:34:33.267 --> 00:34:35.734
There's very,
very simple systems.

00:34:35.734 --> 00:34:39.234
But as far as
the burden on those users

00:34:39.234 --> 00:34:40.901
and the burden
on the systems,

00:34:40.901 --> 00:34:43.200
you know, they haven't
scaled with needs.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.200
Email usage is--
has far exceed--

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.334
has gone way up.

00:34:47.334 --> 00:34:50.501
You know, spam intake
has gone way up.

00:34:50.501 --> 00:34:53.133
And these systems
that these people are using

00:34:53.133 --> 00:34:54.267
haven't scaled.

00:34:54.267 --> 00:34:56.467
And so now
they're pretty...

00:34:56.467 --> 00:34:59.868
you know, they're
feeling a lot of pain.

00:34:59.868 --> 00:35:03.367
So 2009, we're accepted
into the reseller program,

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:06.300
immediately launched
local PR campaign

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.467
and that, you know,
really was great for us.

00:35:09.467 --> 00:35:11.801
That--using the Google brand
and leveraging that,

00:35:11.801 --> 00:35:14.634
not only helped us,
you know,

00:35:14.634 --> 00:35:15.968
to sell Google Apps,

00:35:15.968 --> 00:35:18.634
but in our local market
helped us,

00:35:18.634 --> 00:35:21.100
incredibly,
just to raise our profile

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.767
and to get looks on all
of our other services.

00:35:23.767 --> 00:35:26.400
We're traditionally
an on-site,

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.567
you know, managing systems
with clients

00:35:30.567 --> 00:35:31.767
over the long term.

00:35:31.767 --> 00:35:34.334
We're not kind of
project by project.

00:35:34.334 --> 00:35:35.834
There's some consulting
companies that are like that,

00:35:35.834 --> 00:35:37.267
where they kind of jump
from project to project.

00:35:37.267 --> 00:35:39.100
We have--our clients
are our clients.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.868
We sign annual
contracts with them.

00:35:40.868 --> 00:35:42.267
So that's kind of
our traditional--

00:35:42.267 --> 00:35:44.734
So--so that worked
very well for us

00:35:44.734 --> 00:35:48.334
and also helped
to promote apps as a product

00:35:48.334 --> 00:35:50.133
in our market.

00:35:50.133 --> 00:35:51.901
But what we really saw

00:35:51.901 --> 00:35:55.934
was for this,
for small business,

00:35:55.934 --> 00:35:57.100
there's a lot of pain,

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.601
and we need to kind of...

00:35:59.601 --> 00:36:01.701
kind of change
how we're doing things.

00:36:01.701 --> 00:36:04.300
Rather than this
on-site focus,

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.234
we need to diversify
and we need to have a team

00:36:06.234 --> 00:36:10.300
that can deliver
apps services remotely,

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.167
can do set-up
and migration

00:36:12.167 --> 00:36:15.234
so we can widen our market
nationally.

00:36:15.234 --> 00:36:16.968
Because that small--

00:36:16.968 --> 00:36:19.400
this is really a long-tail
proposition, right?

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.567
There's that--

00:36:21.567 --> 00:36:24.000
so that's really kind of
an opportunity that we see.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.300
There's lots
of opportunities.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.133
There's--there's
lots of resellers

00:36:27.133 --> 00:36:28.467
that are focusing
on enterprise.

00:36:28.467 --> 00:36:30.000
There's opportunities there.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.868
We have mid-market
capabilities,

00:36:32.868 --> 00:36:34.734
and we're certainly
going to use those.

00:36:34.734 --> 00:36:38.934
But we see a lot of pain
in the long tail,

00:36:38.934 --> 00:36:41.467
and we think that there's a bit
of missed opportunity there.

00:36:41.467 --> 00:36:44.801
So,
and our existing team,

00:36:44.801 --> 00:36:47.200
you know, we want to launch
this small business team,

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.534
and our existing team is going
to serve larger projects

00:36:49.534 --> 00:36:50.734
like Jeff
was talking about,

00:36:50.734 --> 00:36:52.367
where fit tests
are necessary,

00:36:52.367 --> 00:36:53.701
deployment training
is necessary.

00:36:53.701 --> 00:36:55.567
These are all things
that we're used to doing

00:36:55.567 --> 00:36:59.167
from on-site assignments
with more, you know,

00:36:59.167 --> 00:37:04.567
kind of mid-market
companies.

00:37:04.567 --> 00:37:06.133
All right, how do we--

00:37:06.133 --> 00:37:08.367
how have we gone about
marketing and selling Apps?

00:37:08.367 --> 00:37:11.033
You know, we've--

00:37:11.033 --> 00:37:13.701
certainly using PR

00:37:13.701 --> 00:37:16.033
to leverage
the Google brand locally--

00:37:16.033 --> 00:37:18.000
you know,
our little company

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.634
becomes part of the reseller,
you know, program.

00:37:20.634 --> 00:37:21.901
It's not gonna make
national news.

00:37:21.901 --> 00:37:23.601
It's not gonna
hit the blogosphere.

00:37:23.601 --> 00:37:25.467
None of that's gonna happen.
I realize this.

00:37:25.467 --> 00:37:28.801
But locally,
with local TV news,

00:37:28.801 --> 00:37:30.834
you know, radio, papers--

00:37:30.834 --> 00:37:33.467
all of that stuff
in our area

00:37:33.467 --> 00:37:35.634
where we're really focused,

00:37:35.634 --> 00:37:37.501
it makes an impact,
and it has made an impact.

00:37:37.501 --> 00:37:38.868
There's been coverage.

00:37:38.868 --> 00:37:41.501
There's been
new clients because of that,

00:37:41.501 --> 00:37:44.400
in areas--
in apps and in other areas.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.200
So that's really
been a benefit to us.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.968
So that's really
PR and media awareness--

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:53.334
you know, doing workshops
and webinars

00:37:53.334 --> 00:37:54.567
and things like that.

00:37:54.567 --> 00:37:57.434
It's really what has been

00:37:57.434 --> 00:37:59.267
our kind of
attention grabber

00:37:59.267 --> 00:38:00.968
to bring clients in.

00:38:00.968 --> 00:38:03.601
And then, you know,
once--

00:38:03.601 --> 00:38:05.400
once--once we're
in front of them,

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.767
how do we sell them?

00:38:06.767 --> 00:38:08.467
Well, we sell
the cost savings,

00:38:08.467 --> 00:38:12.400
and it's usually
a pretty easy sale.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.934
In fact, with
a certain number of clients,

00:38:15.934 --> 00:38:17.501
we get a what I call

00:38:17.501 --> 00:38:19.067
a "too good to be true"
objection.

00:38:19.067 --> 00:38:21.467
Especially if they're moving
from on-prem exchange,

00:38:21.467 --> 00:38:22.701
they're like,

00:38:22.701 --> 00:38:24.033
"You mean, I don't have
to maintain this stuff

00:38:24.033 --> 00:38:25.033
"or anything?

00:38:25.033 --> 00:38:26.300
"This has got to be
a terrible--

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.601
"this has got to be
an awful system,

00:38:27.601 --> 00:38:29.534
"'cause it's way too cheap
to be comparable

00:38:29.534 --> 00:38:31.434
to what I have now."

00:38:31.434 --> 00:38:33.934
And so then we've got
to sell the product quality

00:38:33.934 --> 00:38:37.033
to kind of overcome
that objection.

00:38:37.033 --> 00:38:39.634
And we explain to them
that no, actually,

00:38:39.634 --> 00:38:41.734
this is really
a paradigm shift.

00:38:41.734 --> 00:38:43.567
This is a, you know,

00:38:43.567 --> 00:38:45.501
particularly
with Docs and Sites,

00:38:45.501 --> 00:38:48.267
this is being able
to share in ways

00:38:48.267 --> 00:38:49.934
that you've never
been able to share before.

00:38:49.934 --> 00:38:52.400
This is breaking out of,
you know,

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.267
breaking out
of attachment hell,

00:38:54.267 --> 00:38:56.501
which, those of you that
have been in attachment hell,

00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:58.033
you understand
what I'm talking about.

00:38:58.033 --> 00:38:59.400
I've certainly been there.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.734
And then we also
talk about the simplicity,

00:39:03.734 --> 00:39:05.868
particularly of the web--

00:39:05.868 --> 00:39:08.100
the--the web client

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:12.334
versus kind of what
you're used to in your email,

00:39:12.334 --> 00:39:15.501
which is featured below
lots and lots of features,

00:39:15.501 --> 00:39:17.367
all competing
for your attention.

00:39:17.367 --> 00:39:18.868
Lots of security
vulnerabilities

00:39:18.868 --> 00:39:20.100
built into those features.

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.000
Lots of, you know,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.834
lots of updates
and all kinds of things.

00:39:24.834 --> 00:39:27.133
Users understand this.
Users see that pain.

00:39:27.133 --> 00:39:29.868
And so when you talk
to them about simplicity,

00:39:29.868 --> 00:39:31.167
you talk to them
about that.

00:39:31.167 --> 00:39:34.367
And maybe they have
to give up a pet feature.

00:39:34.367 --> 00:39:36.367
But...

00:39:36.367 --> 00:39:37.901
but what they're gaining
is much more.

00:39:37.901 --> 00:39:40.434
They're gaining something
that does the core features

00:39:40.434 --> 00:39:41.634
very, very well.

00:39:41.634 --> 00:39:44.300
Just to speak
to product quality also,

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.634
we've had to overcome
an objection

00:39:45.634 --> 00:39:49.968
about, um...I guess
the way to put it

00:39:49.968 --> 00:39:51.601
would be just web--

00:39:51.601 --> 00:39:52.834
just using a web-based
interface.

00:39:52.834 --> 00:39:54.234
And you can use
Outlook with it.

00:39:54.234 --> 00:39:58.601
We really found clients see
much more productivity gains

00:39:58.601 --> 00:40:00.200
if they use
the web-based interface.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.467
But there's a cultural thing
right now

00:40:02.467 --> 00:40:04.868
that has, you know,
been traditional.

00:40:04.868 --> 00:40:08.834
That is: web-based is kind of
second-class citizen.

00:40:08.834 --> 00:40:10.667
And that comes from,
you know,

00:40:10.667 --> 00:40:12.434
things like
Outlook Web Access,

00:40:12.434 --> 00:40:14.400
that comes from lots
of different things

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.734
that people have used

00:40:15.734 --> 00:40:18.100
where you really have
been a second-class citizen

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.100
if you're using web
versus if you're using,

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:24.000
you know, Outlook
or some other client of choice.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.400
But we really feel like,

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.067
certainly in our
personal practice

00:40:27.067 --> 00:40:28.367
and what we've seen
with clients,

00:40:28.367 --> 00:40:31.467
that...
that's not the case anymore.

00:40:31.467 --> 00:40:33.868
That there really is,
you know, doing it on the web

00:40:33.868 --> 00:40:35.734
is really great.

00:40:35.734 --> 00:40:38.434
We sell the security.

00:40:38.434 --> 00:40:39.567
Clients are gonna
bring it up.

00:40:39.567 --> 00:40:41.667
This is really
a trust issue.

00:40:41.667 --> 00:40:42.968
It's a new thing.

00:40:42.968 --> 00:40:45.067
People are scared
of new things, anything new.

00:40:45.067 --> 00:40:48.801
And we basically frame it
as, you know,

00:40:48.801 --> 00:40:50.267
who are you gonna trust?

00:40:50.267 --> 00:40:52.934
Are you gonna trust,
you know,

00:40:52.934 --> 00:40:55.801
your server
in the back room?

00:40:55.801 --> 00:40:57.968
And as trustworthy as I am,

00:40:57.968 --> 00:40:59.634
you know, in some cases,
these clients--

00:40:59.634 --> 00:41:01.234
I'm the one that's
administrating this service.

00:41:01.234 --> 00:41:03.200
But I tell them
straight out, you know,

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.400
"Are you gonna trust me
to keep up

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.734
"on all the security
vulnerabilities,

00:41:05.734 --> 00:41:08.267
"all of this stuff
that needs to be kept up on,

00:41:08.267 --> 00:41:10.701
"or are you gonna trust,
you know,

00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:12.767
"arguably the best
data centers in the world,

00:41:12.767 --> 00:41:15.467
arguably the best security
engineers in the world?"

00:41:15.467 --> 00:41:17.601
Um, uh, and--

00:41:17.601 --> 00:41:20.501
and that's sort of
how we frame it for people.

00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:22.100
And it goes
more in depth than that,

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.200
but that's the, you know,
the basic gist of it.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.601
I'm gonna--
I want to make sure

00:41:27.601 --> 00:41:29.501
we get to questions here.

00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:31.567
So I'm gonna breeze through
a couple of these things,

00:41:31.567 --> 00:41:36.000
and go on to some
deployment kind of stories

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.267
so you can see sort of
what it's like for us

00:41:38.267 --> 00:41:41.234
when we work with a client,
move them to Apps,

00:41:41.234 --> 00:41:44.801
and the relationship
there.

00:41:44.801 --> 00:41:47.801
Um...

00:41:47.801 --> 00:41:50.534
Okay, so here's a story
that happened.

00:41:50.534 --> 00:41:54.200
I call this
"Old Dogs vs. New Dogs."

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.200
A lot of these stories
are gonna--

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.434
are really gonna touch on
what I think

00:41:58.434 --> 00:42:00.634
is the main issue
for for us

00:42:00.634 --> 00:42:01.968
in implementing Apps
in that,

00:42:01.968 --> 00:42:04.701
because of the paradigm shift
of how it works,

00:42:04.701 --> 00:42:06.601
because it's web-based
rather than client,

00:42:06.601 --> 00:42:08.133
because it's, you know,

00:42:08.133 --> 00:42:10.400
sharing documents and sites

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.567
rather than emailing them
all around,

00:42:13.567 --> 00:42:15.400
really,
the hardest part of our job

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.801
isn't the technology.

00:42:16.801 --> 00:42:19.000
The hardest part of our job
is the changed management,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.334
no matter how big
or small the client is.

00:42:21.334 --> 00:42:25.501
A successful deployment
means they understand

00:42:25.501 --> 00:42:26.667
how things are changing,

00:42:26.667 --> 00:42:28.567
and they understand
how to leverage,

00:42:28.567 --> 00:42:31.701
and their people
understand how to leverage

00:42:31.701 --> 00:42:33.567
that new paradigm.

00:42:33.567 --> 00:42:35.300
So old dogs versus new dogs.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.934
This is a--a story.

00:42:36.934 --> 00:42:39.067
There's a real estate
company.

00:42:39.067 --> 00:42:40.367
They had Outlook clients,

00:42:40.367 --> 00:42:41.734
BlackBerry handhelds.

00:42:41.734 --> 00:42:44.467
They had some,
you know,

00:42:44.467 --> 00:42:47.667
their pain was they had
some serious spam issues.

00:42:47.667 --> 00:42:51.501
We had one box
that was 30,000 spams a day

00:42:51.501 --> 00:42:53.534
coming into one box...

00:42:53.534 --> 00:42:55.501
that I measured two days.

00:42:55.501 --> 00:42:57.734
It could have been
more than that on other days.

00:42:57.734 --> 00:42:59.934
And that
was a situation

00:42:59.934 --> 00:43:02.968
where their current
spam solution was--

00:43:02.968 --> 00:43:04.734
was getting hammered
to a level

00:43:04.734 --> 00:43:06.300
that it, you know,

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.901
it would basically
lock up, fail.

00:43:09.901 --> 00:43:11.901
It was basically
a denial of service attack

00:43:11.901 --> 00:43:14.534
on their--
on their spam solution.

00:43:14.534 --> 00:43:18.000
That was 30,000 spams
getting through

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.400
the spam solution,
by the way,

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.834
not hitting
the spam solution.

00:43:21.834 --> 00:43:23.033
Pardon me.

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:26.133
So--so that was
where their pain was.

00:43:26.133 --> 00:43:28.200
Reliability issues,
spam issues.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.300
Um, and, uh...

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.667
the nice thing about Apps

00:43:33.667 --> 00:43:37.934
was that pain came upon them
very quickly.

00:43:37.934 --> 00:43:39.901
We're--and because
of the way Apps works,

00:43:39.901 --> 00:43:42.567
we were able to roll out
for them in a weekend.

00:43:42.567 --> 00:43:45.767
Never could have done that
with an on-prem solution.

00:43:45.767 --> 00:43:47.100
We'd have had
to order hardware,

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.167
we'd have had
to get it all installed,

00:43:49.167 --> 00:43:51.200
patched up, make sure
everything's good,

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.567
plan it all out.

00:43:52.567 --> 00:43:55.067
We could deploy this
very, very quickly for them,

00:43:55.067 --> 00:43:58.534
and the spam handling
was much better.

00:43:58.534 --> 00:44:00.467
The reliability,
you know--

00:44:00.467 --> 00:44:01.667
this is Google scale.

00:44:01.667 --> 00:44:04.434
So, you know,
the reliability was--

00:44:04.434 --> 00:44:05.567
was great.

00:44:05.567 --> 00:44:06.834
Everyone's happy.

00:44:06.834 --> 00:44:08.868
Some users stay on Outlook.

00:44:08.868 --> 00:44:11.400
The change-averse users
stay on Outlook.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.934
You know, uh...
the, uh...

00:44:13.934 --> 00:44:16.567
And there were people there
that are like,

00:44:16.567 --> 00:44:18.934
"Man, this is awesome.
I want to use it.

00:44:18.934 --> 00:44:20.067
Excellent."

00:44:20.067 --> 00:44:21.834
So that was definitely
a win for us.

00:44:21.834 --> 00:44:24.534
And it would
have been harder to do

00:44:24.534 --> 00:44:30.801
migrating them
with on-prem.

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:34.734
This story kind of--

00:44:34.734 --> 00:44:38.100
kind of highlights something
that I like to call,

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.100
you know,
sort of an organic--

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:43.067
an organic discovery
that happens

00:44:43.067 --> 00:44:44.667
in our Apps deployments,
usually.

00:44:44.667 --> 00:44:48.467
And this was a client.

00:44:48.467 --> 00:44:50.167
They're a commercial
laundry.

00:44:50.167 --> 00:44:52.634
Very price sensitive.

00:44:52.634 --> 00:44:54.234
Very, very price sensitive.

00:44:54.234 --> 00:44:56.601
Kind of a manufacturer's
profile,

00:44:56.601 --> 00:44:58.567
for those of you that have
worked in different industries.

00:44:58.567 --> 00:45:02.901
And...so they're experiencing
email pain.

00:45:02.901 --> 00:45:05.334
Boxes too small,
reliability issues,

00:45:05.334 --> 00:45:06.901
spam issues, et cetera.

00:45:06.901 --> 00:45:08.834
But because they're
price sensitive,

00:45:08.834 --> 00:45:10.868
the 50 bucks,
"Man, this looks big.

00:45:10.868 --> 00:45:12.534
"Man, 50 bucks per user.

00:45:12.534 --> 00:45:13.534
That's too much."

00:45:13.534 --> 00:45:15.567
Um...
[laughing]

00:45:15.567 --> 00:45:17.901
They're--they were
running real slim.

00:45:17.901 --> 00:45:18.968
Pop boxes, you know.

00:45:18.968 --> 00:45:20.334
Larger, you know,
larger company.

00:45:20.334 --> 00:45:21.734
Hundreds of employees.

00:45:21.734 --> 00:45:24.701
But running it real slim.
Very price sensitive.

00:45:24.701 --> 00:45:27.133
Um, and so, uh...

00:45:27.133 --> 00:45:28.801
you know,
basically what happened

00:45:28.801 --> 00:45:31.767
was we implemented
for a subset of users.

00:45:31.767 --> 00:45:34.334
We did split delivery,
like Jeff was talking about.

00:45:34.334 --> 00:45:36.067
Some users
are second-class citizens,

00:45:36.067 --> 00:45:37.701
they go to the old system.

00:45:37.701 --> 00:45:39.801
Really critical,
you know, sales

00:45:39.801 --> 00:45:41.834
and executives
and different people

00:45:41.834 --> 00:45:43.534
that really, you know,

00:45:43.534 --> 00:45:45.100
will annoy
the operations people

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.267
if their email goes down.

00:45:46.267 --> 00:45:48.601
Those guys all
go on Apps.

00:45:48.601 --> 00:45:52.667
What we found was,
uh, that...

00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:54.601
because Apps was available,

00:45:54.601 --> 00:45:56.601
people started to see
what they had.

00:45:56.601 --> 00:45:58.501
People started
to not use Outlook

00:45:58.501 --> 00:46:00.133
and use the web interface
for, you know,

00:46:00.133 --> 00:46:01.534
some stuff.

00:46:01.534 --> 00:46:03.267
We had all the functions
turned on.

00:46:03.267 --> 00:46:05.267
And we get this
organic discovery happening,

00:46:05.267 --> 00:46:07.300
where people just...

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.767
"Oh, here's some--
here's some features.

00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:10.834
Oh, what do these do?"

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:12.033
And they start
playing with it

00:46:12.033 --> 00:46:14.133
and they
leave Outlook behind.

00:46:14.133 --> 00:46:15.167
And then they're saying,

00:46:15.167 --> 00:46:16.267
"Well, I want to you,
you know,

00:46:16.267 --> 00:46:17.367
"I want
to use these functions

00:46:17.367 --> 00:46:18.767
with these other people
in the company."

00:46:18.767 --> 00:46:20.667
And so now
we've got to deploy.

00:46:20.667 --> 00:46:22.534
This is why I call it
the longest deployment,

00:46:22.534 --> 00:46:25.334
because, first,
it's a little subset.

00:46:25.334 --> 00:46:27.834
Eventually, this company's
gonna be completely on Apps

00:46:27.834 --> 00:46:30.267
because they just keep on
asking for more and more people

00:46:30.267 --> 00:46:31.901
because different departments
and different people

00:46:31.901 --> 00:46:34.901
want that functionality
to work for their department.

00:46:34.901 --> 00:46:37.234
So that's easy for us.
That's an easy sell.

00:46:37.234 --> 00:46:39.834
It's good for them.

00:46:39.834 --> 00:46:41.934
One quote that came
out of that experience

00:46:41.934 --> 00:46:44.434
was a fellow
found Google Sites,

00:46:44.434 --> 00:46:47.000
a sales--
somebody in sales,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.868
and he kind of came
and found me,

00:46:48.868 --> 00:46:50.367
and he's like,

00:46:50.367 --> 00:46:52.200
"'A,' why didn't you
tell me about this before?

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.667
"And, 'B,'
I'm gonna save hours.

00:46:54.667 --> 00:46:56.868
You just blew my mind.
My mind is blown."

00:46:56.868 --> 00:46:58.067
That was the quote.

00:46:58.067 --> 00:47:00.133
So when you get
quotes like that from clients,

00:47:00.133 --> 00:47:01.667
you know, that's exciting.

00:47:01.667 --> 00:47:03.734
That means something's
going well.

00:47:03.734 --> 00:47:04.901
Something's going right.

00:47:04.901 --> 00:47:06.934
Usually, they call me
when things break.

00:47:09.634 --> 00:47:12.167
All right,
breeze through here.

00:47:12.167 --> 00:47:13.834
Another great example,

00:47:13.834 --> 00:47:15.100
which dovetails into

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:16.467
the last thing
I'm going to talk about,

00:47:16.467 --> 00:47:20.067
which is reseller
and, um...

00:47:20.067 --> 00:47:22.000
and developer relationships.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.467
This is an example
that actually was sent to me

00:47:24.467 --> 00:47:25.667
by Cloud Sherpas,

00:47:25.667 --> 00:47:27.100
who are another
Google App software

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:28.200
authorized reseller.

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.400
And they had a client who--

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.968
who wanted to move
Exchange Shared folders

00:47:35.968 --> 00:47:37.334
to Google Sites.

00:47:37.334 --> 00:47:39.667
And--and what they did,

00:47:39.667 --> 00:47:41.267
they found that, you know,

00:47:41.267 --> 00:47:44.400
there's not--there's not
a smooth way to do this.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.167
So that--
here's an opportunity

00:47:46.167 --> 00:47:48.000
where the market
is essentially telling them,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.033
we need a tool for this,

00:47:50.033 --> 00:47:51.334
an actual client
telling them.

00:47:51.334 --> 00:47:52.434
So what did they do?

00:47:52.434 --> 00:47:53.701
They built a tool called

00:47:53.701 --> 00:47:56.300
Google Sites
Bulk File Uploader.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.400
They've made
their client happy

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.501
and had a successful
migration.

00:48:01.501 --> 00:48:04.567
And--and training
associated with that.

00:48:04.567 --> 00:48:07.133
But they also now
have an asset

00:48:07.133 --> 00:48:08.601
that they have
available for sale

00:48:08.601 --> 00:48:10.033
on their website.

00:48:10.033 --> 00:48:12.701
And so they've created
multiple streams of income

00:48:12.701 --> 00:48:14.200
out of that.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.801
So that's something
I certainly hope to do

00:48:16.801 --> 00:48:18.000
in our business.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.267
We haven't done it yet.

00:48:19.267 --> 00:48:21.167
And I think there's
lots of opportunities

00:48:21.167 --> 00:48:25.000
surrounding those sorts
of tools.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.567
All right, so, "Resellers,
a developer's best friend."

00:48:27.567 --> 00:48:28.767
I'm gonna quickly
touch on this,

00:48:28.767 --> 00:48:30.334
and I definitely want
to get to questions.

00:48:30.334 --> 00:48:33.868
Um, uh...

00:48:33.868 --> 00:48:37.267
I am...I'm basically
working from

00:48:37.267 --> 00:48:38.734
where I'm at.

00:48:38.734 --> 00:48:41.067
And I want to make
connections with developers,

00:48:41.067 --> 00:48:42.767
because there are
so many opportunities

00:48:42.767 --> 00:48:45.234
for tools out there
in this platform

00:48:45.234 --> 00:48:47.367
that's, you know,
fairly young,

00:48:47.367 --> 00:48:49.033
that's vibrant,

00:48:49.033 --> 00:48:51.434
that's--a lot
of innovation happening.

00:48:51.434 --> 00:48:52.801
And I want to be
a part of that.

00:48:52.801 --> 00:48:54.701
And so this
is an open call.

00:48:54.701 --> 00:48:56.367
If you're a developer
and you're developing tools,

00:48:56.367 --> 00:48:57.434
I want to hear about it.

00:48:57.434 --> 00:48:58.834
We're building our tool set,

00:48:58.834 --> 00:49:00.467
both for our small team,

00:49:00.467 --> 00:49:03.300
for remote delivery
of these services,

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:06.601
and also for our--
for our existing team.

00:49:06.601 --> 00:49:10.234
But resellers
make excellent beta testers.

00:49:10.234 --> 00:49:13.067
We live and breathe
with the users,

00:49:13.067 --> 00:49:14.100
right next to them.

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:15.300
They breathe on our necks.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.634
We know exactly
what they want.

00:49:16.634 --> 00:49:17.868
We know their pain.

00:49:17.868 --> 00:49:19.667
We're very close.

00:49:19.667 --> 00:49:22.100
We're very close to them,

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.968
and so we make
excellent beta testers.

00:49:23.968 --> 00:49:25.934
And we want these products,

00:49:25.934 --> 00:49:27.868
so we're easier
to get involved.

00:49:27.868 --> 00:49:30.601
Sometimes your beta programs,
you know,

00:49:30.601 --> 00:49:31.901
it's hard
to get users involved.

00:49:31.901 --> 00:49:34.767
Um, uh, resellers know

00:49:34.767 --> 00:49:36.400
what clients need.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.901
You know,

00:49:37.901 --> 00:49:39.934
I have a lot of clients
that are kind of clamoring

00:49:39.934 --> 00:49:42.000
for more flexible
contact management.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.734
I'd love to see a day
when either a third party

00:49:44.734 --> 00:49:46.467
or Google or somebody

00:49:46.467 --> 00:49:49.100
has made contacts sharable,

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:50.334
just like a doc
is sharable.

00:49:50.334 --> 00:49:52.000
So you could share it
with individual people,

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.501
inside,
outside your domain.

00:49:53.501 --> 00:49:55.701
You can add
custom fields to it,

00:49:55.701 --> 00:49:57.133
and it's very flexible.

00:49:57.133 --> 00:49:58.467
I hope that day comes.

00:49:58.467 --> 00:50:00.834
These are all just things
that, you know,

00:50:00.834 --> 00:50:02.734
clients have talked about.

00:50:02.734 --> 00:50:04.601
I'd love to see
development for

00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:06.667
deployment
and provisioning tools.

00:50:06.667 --> 00:50:07.701
You know, that's really--

00:50:07.701 --> 00:50:10.067
resellers would buy that.

00:50:10.067 --> 00:50:12.434
You know, just to make
deployment and provisioning,

00:50:12.434 --> 00:50:15.033
to further automate
that system.

00:50:15.033 --> 00:50:17.234
There are tools within
Google Apps already

00:50:17.234 --> 00:50:18.434
to do some of that.

00:50:18.434 --> 00:50:21.467
But the more automation
we can get, the better.

00:50:21.467 --> 00:50:22.868
It makes our jobs easier.

00:50:22.868 --> 00:50:24.267
Logging and accountability,

00:50:24.267 --> 00:50:26.400
really kind of pulling out
some metrics

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.133
out of the--
out of the APIs

00:50:29.133 --> 00:50:31.200
and out of how people
are using the system

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.400
better than there is today.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.534
So these are all things--

00:50:33.534 --> 00:50:35.167
there's APIs
for all these things.

00:50:35.167 --> 00:50:38.367
And there's, you know,
there's great opportunities,

00:50:38.367 --> 00:50:40.934
and we want
to work with people

00:50:40.934 --> 00:50:42.834
and help with that.

00:50:42.834 --> 00:50:44.367
And then there's
the obvious things...

00:50:44.367 --> 00:50:48.534
App Engine projects,
custom gadgets

00:50:48.534 --> 00:50:51.133
that resellers
without development expertise

00:50:51.133 --> 00:50:53.501
can really use
in a developer--

00:50:53.501 --> 00:50:55.334
a relationship
with a developer.

00:50:55.334 --> 00:50:57.234
So, you know, that--

00:50:57.234 --> 00:51:00.033
that--I want to wrap up
by just saying,

00:51:00.033 --> 00:51:02.234
you know, again,
in tech,

00:51:02.234 --> 00:51:04.567
I know for me,
I get talked to a lot

00:51:04.567 --> 00:51:06.000
when things are broken.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.367
But I want to, I guess,
just thank everybody

00:51:08.367 --> 00:51:10.267
on the, you know,
the Google Apps team,

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:12.901
both product
and the enterprise group,

00:51:12.901 --> 00:51:14.400
for making a great product.

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.701
I don't know if Rajen Sheth
is in here.

00:51:16.701 --> 00:51:17.934
I saw him
walking around earlier,

00:51:17.934 --> 00:51:19.400
but to his team
and everybody,

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.300
you know, from my clients
for sure,

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:22.767
thank you
for a great product.

00:51:22.767 --> 00:51:24.601
And, uh, uh...

00:51:24.601 --> 00:51:26.367
I think we're opening it up
for questions.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.067
Ragusa: Could we turn on--

00:51:33.067 --> 00:51:34.234
Oh, we got them both on.

00:51:34.234 --> 00:51:35.400
Thanks.

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.834
So any questions?

00:51:36.834 --> 00:51:38.767
I think we have
eight minutes or so

00:51:38.767 --> 00:51:40.033
of questions.

00:51:40.033 --> 00:51:42.000
man: Sure...question one.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.133
As a reseller,
I'm sure my customers

00:51:45.133 --> 00:51:47.501
trust Google
to a certain extent,

00:51:47.501 --> 00:51:49.667
but they want to have
the data in their hands

00:51:49.667 --> 00:51:51.000
at some point.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.067
Is there some facilitated,
local backup

00:51:54.067 --> 00:51:56.334
people can do
of all their Google docs?

00:51:56.334 --> 00:51:58.167
Or some other way

00:51:58.167 --> 00:52:00.100
in which they can
fetch that locally?

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:01.400
So that's one question.

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.701
Another question is,

00:52:02.701 --> 00:52:06.067
as a Google App Engine
developer using Google Docs,

00:52:06.067 --> 00:52:08.701
can I make certain documents
read-only

00:52:08.701 --> 00:52:10.767
or not touchable
by the end customer,

00:52:10.767 --> 00:52:13.000
so it becomes a permanent
part of a record

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.100
of a work flow?

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.133
For example, an invoice

00:52:15.133 --> 00:52:16.734
or some other thing.

00:52:16.734 --> 00:52:19.567
Are there security
mechanisms in place

00:52:19.567 --> 00:52:21.300
for things like that?

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.167
Ragusa: Yeah, good--
good question.

00:52:23.167 --> 00:52:25.667
So I guess in, uh,
in that order of questions,

00:52:25.667 --> 00:52:28.167
around--initial question
around--

00:52:28.167 --> 00:52:30.100
around maintaining
the data locally

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:32.067
and kind of feeling kind of
that under the mattress,

00:52:32.067 --> 00:52:33.601
in the mattress syndrome,

00:52:33.601 --> 00:52:35.267
where you want to be able
to have--

00:52:35.267 --> 00:52:36.734
have control
of your own data.

00:52:36.734 --> 00:52:38.300
I guess there's a couple
different facets to that,

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.400
and it really, I think--
I think you really--it's--

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.300
you can kind of dig deeper
and figure out,

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:43.400
like, why customers
are asking that.

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.133
Is it a privacy question?

00:52:45.133 --> 00:52:46.734
Is it a reliability
question?

00:52:46.734 --> 00:52:47.968
That sort of thing.

00:52:47.968 --> 00:52:49.334
So each of our--

00:52:49.334 --> 00:52:51.000
you know, from
a privacy perspective,

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.267
our, you know, our policies,
certainly across the board,

00:52:53.267 --> 00:52:56.067
are that the customers,
the users own their own data.

00:52:56.067 --> 00:52:58.133
And so what we do
is we make it really easy

00:52:58.133 --> 00:52:59.234
for you to pull
that data out,

00:52:59.234 --> 00:53:01.567
either via APIs
or via, you know,

00:53:01.567 --> 00:53:03.033
I mentioned
some standard protocols

00:53:03.033 --> 00:53:05.501
like IMAP and LDAP
and things like that.

00:53:05.501 --> 00:53:06.968
In the case of Docs,
there isn't really

00:53:06.968 --> 00:53:08.033
standard protocols.

00:53:08.033 --> 00:53:09.767
What we do is we've got
an API

00:53:09.767 --> 00:53:12.801
that's actually based on
the Atom standard,

00:53:12.801 --> 00:53:15.801
uh, uh, feed protocol.

00:53:15.801 --> 00:53:16.934
And we basically
extended that

00:53:16.934 --> 00:53:20.033
with specific--
specific data structures

00:53:20.033 --> 00:53:23.033
around spreadsheet sales
and documents and so forth.

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:24.667
And so--and then on top
of that API,

00:53:24.667 --> 00:53:26.567
folks have actually
built tools.

00:53:26.567 --> 00:53:28.367
It's kind of--I think
the demand is kind of--

00:53:28.367 --> 00:53:29.968
it's more people kind of
talk about,

00:53:29.968 --> 00:53:31.033
"This would be
nice to have."

00:53:31.033 --> 00:53:32.601
I haven't seen
the market demand

00:53:32.601 --> 00:53:33.734
where we've
had a whole lot of

00:53:33.734 --> 00:53:35.000
third parties
building tools.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.400
But I know there's a--

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.601
there's a tool that one
of our partners built recently

00:53:38.601 --> 00:53:40.701
that does sync between
Google Docs

00:53:40.701 --> 00:53:42.601
and Microsoft Office Docs,

00:53:42.601 --> 00:53:44.501
where you can be working
either in Microsoft Office

00:53:44.501 --> 00:53:46.334
and have it be
synced up to Google Docs,

00:53:46.334 --> 00:53:47.934
and vice versa.

00:53:47.934 --> 00:53:49.267
It's a little plug-in
for Office.

00:53:49.267 --> 00:53:51.701
Jefferies: My experience
with that particular question

00:53:51.701 --> 00:53:55.400
is usually it's a security,
you know,

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.300
type of a--or a, just,

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:01.100
"I want to be more like
my existing on-prem solution

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:02.367
"and have it, you know,

00:54:02.367 --> 00:54:04.434
in my nice little closet,
wherever."

00:54:04.434 --> 00:54:07.601
And what we've done is say,
"Yes, that's possible."

00:54:07.601 --> 00:54:09.601
And we budget to, you know,

00:54:09.601 --> 00:54:12.367
build something from
the APIs to do that for them.

00:54:12.367 --> 00:54:13.534
And then they see the price,
and they say,

00:54:13.534 --> 00:54:14.701
"Nah, I don't want it
that bad."

00:54:14.701 --> 00:54:16.067
[laughs]

00:54:16.067 --> 00:54:18.100
So that's, you know,

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:22.267
it's usually an objection
that is handleable

00:54:22.267 --> 00:54:24.167
without actually having
to implement anything,

00:54:24.167 --> 00:54:26.300
in our experience,
at least.

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:28.934
Ragusa: The second part
of the question was around--

00:54:28.934 --> 00:54:30.200
around access to documents,

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.834
and can documents
be made read-only.

00:54:31.834 --> 00:54:34.000
This is kind of built into the--
not even just the APIs,

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.234
but built into
the product itself,

00:54:35.234 --> 00:54:36.701
is that, essentially,
the security layer,

00:54:36.701 --> 00:54:38.067
at the application layer,

00:54:38.067 --> 00:54:39.634
authentication
or authorization

00:54:39.634 --> 00:54:42.801
is handled on a per-user,
per-document level.

00:54:42.801 --> 00:54:44.267
So you can basically
share a document.

00:54:44.267 --> 00:54:45.534
I could share a document
with Daniel,

00:54:45.534 --> 00:54:46.968
and I can share it with him
in such a way

00:54:46.968 --> 00:54:48.100
that it's read-only,

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.200
or I can share it with him
in such a way

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.234
that it's read/write.

00:54:50.234 --> 00:54:51.767
And then I, as the owner,

00:54:51.767 --> 00:54:53.701
can pull that away
at any time.

00:54:53.701 --> 00:54:55.534
And then--and so you
can programmatically--

00:54:55.534 --> 00:54:57.200
I believe the Docs API
at this point

00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.400
has the ability
to programmatically

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:03.467
manipulate that ACL
as well.

00:55:03.467 --> 00:55:06.000
Okay. Yes?

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.100
man: Thank you
for a good presentation.

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:12.033
Um...we understand
the business model

00:55:12.033 --> 00:55:16.667
for small businesses--
10 users, 20 users, 50 users.

00:55:16.667 --> 00:55:21.300
Curious about
any Fortune 50

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.200
or Fortune 100 corporations

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:26.000
that may have decided
to move away, say,

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.033
from a Microsoft platform

00:55:28.033 --> 00:55:31.367
to a Google Apps platform.

00:55:31.367 --> 00:55:33.067
If you could share with us
any names,

00:55:33.067 --> 00:55:35.367
and we would like to know--
have some idea

00:55:35.367 --> 00:55:37.367
how far along they are
or how successful,

00:55:37.367 --> 00:55:40.133
given that there may be,
for instance,

00:55:40.133 --> 00:55:41.300
existing applications

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:43.801
which are written
in .net, for instance,

00:55:43.801 --> 00:55:46.701
that may need remediation

00:55:46.701 --> 00:55:50.000
or written in
other legacy languages

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.701
or older architectures

00:55:51.701 --> 00:55:55.234
which may need remedy--
remediation.

00:55:55.234 --> 00:55:56.634
Number one question.

00:55:56.634 --> 00:55:58.000
Number two,

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.467
is there--can we find anywhere
a compatibility guide,

00:56:00.467 --> 00:56:02.400
for instance,
between the features offered

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.200
by the Google Apps suite

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.100
and, for instance,
the Microsoft suites,

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:09.934
so enterprises of greater
than 50 users

00:56:09.934 --> 00:56:12.501
can make an educated choice

00:56:12.501 --> 00:56:14.501
and an educated,
informed decision?

00:56:14.501 --> 00:56:17.033
And also,
the third question is:

00:56:17.033 --> 00:56:18.300
Is there a roadmap?

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.267
For instance,
of the Google Apps platform,

00:56:21.267 --> 00:56:22.400
published anywhere,

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.834
that Google
can share with us

00:56:23.834 --> 00:56:26.033
as whether what they're
currently offering

00:56:26.033 --> 00:56:28.334
as what they're visioning
six months, a year,

00:56:28.334 --> 00:56:29.400
two years down the road.

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.234
For instance,
enterprises like ours

00:56:31.234 --> 00:56:34.100
can go to the Microsoft site
and pull down product--

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:35.701
how long the product's
going to live,

00:56:35.701 --> 00:56:37.200
when is the next release,

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.100
how long will
that release be supported.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:42.133
I mean, there are a lot of
questions from an enterprise--

00:56:42.133 --> 00:56:44.400
a larger enterprise
than 10, 20 users

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.534
that we need to ask

00:56:45.534 --> 00:56:48.567
before being able
to go down such a path.

00:56:48.567 --> 00:56:51.067
Ragusa: Okay, you may need to--
I may have you remind me

00:56:51.067 --> 00:56:52.100
of some of the earlier
questions

00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:53.167
that are part of that.

00:56:53.167 --> 00:56:54.367
But I guess,
just in reverse order,

00:56:54.367 --> 00:56:56.000
on roadmap,

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.167
a lot of the things
that I talked about

00:56:57.167 --> 00:56:59.400
in terms of innovation
and our ability to adapt

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:03.334
with the market and to--
and adapt with how users

00:57:03.334 --> 00:57:04.767
are interacting with
the product and so forth,

00:57:04.767 --> 00:57:06.901
a lot of that dictates
that we're not able to--

00:57:06.901 --> 00:57:09.267
to provide even internally

00:57:09.267 --> 00:57:11.300
a 12-month
or 36-month roadmap

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:13.100
for some of the things that
you're talking about.

00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:15.901
And so--so that's
not feasible.

00:57:15.901 --> 00:57:19.534
We do, if we're working
with a partner,

00:57:19.534 --> 00:57:20.834
and we know that they're
building something

00:57:20.834 --> 00:57:22.534
that we're gonna
launch next week,

00:57:22.534 --> 00:57:25.000
there's certain ways
in which we can work with them

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.467
to kind of steer them
in one direction or another.

00:57:27.467 --> 00:57:30.734
But generally--generally
providing roadmap

00:57:30.734 --> 00:57:32.133
and that kind of thing
is just not--

00:57:32.133 --> 00:57:34.801
it conflicts largely
with what we're trying to do

00:57:34.801 --> 00:57:37.234
in terms of trying to provide
the best value for the customer

00:57:37.234 --> 00:57:38.901
and trying
to remain agile there.

00:57:38.901 --> 00:57:41.267
I think the other--
your initial question

00:57:41.267 --> 00:57:44.000
was around Microsoft
deployment.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.901
I mean, as you might imagine
within the enterprise world,

00:57:45.901 --> 00:57:48.033
you mentioned midsize
and larger deployments.

00:57:48.033 --> 00:57:51.100
You know, Microsoft
to one degree or another,

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:53.200
with Office or with Exchange
or SharePoint,

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.400
is into all these accounts.

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.067
So all of the customers
that I showed

00:57:56.067 --> 00:57:57.100
in the adoption slide...

00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:00.033
We talked about Valeo,
which was--

00:58:00.033 --> 00:58:01.534
which certainly fit
into the category

00:58:01.534 --> 00:58:02.601
of a large customer--

00:58:02.601 --> 00:58:04.234
30,000 users distributed.

00:58:04.234 --> 00:58:07.901
They actually worked
with one of our partners,

00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:09.801
one of our reseller partners,
Capgemini,

00:58:09.801 --> 00:58:11.300
over in Europe.

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:15.033
Certainly, I mean, that
was a long deployment cycle,

00:58:15.033 --> 00:58:16.968
long sale cycle
before that.

00:58:16.968 --> 00:58:19.033
But certainly
there's a ton of ways

00:58:19.033 --> 00:58:21.200
in which they've had
to find ways

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.501
not just to replace--

00:58:22.501 --> 00:58:24.400
We're really not about
replacing, you know--

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.868
how do we replace this
Office functionality

00:58:25.868 --> 00:58:27.000
with Google Apps?

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.100
That's really not the game.

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:29.234
What we're trying to do
is to replace--

00:58:29.234 --> 00:58:30.834
we're trying to get down
to the core of--

00:58:30.834 --> 00:58:32.067
What is the actual
requirements?

00:58:32.067 --> 00:58:33.400
What are
the user requirements?

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.601
What are the business
requirements?

00:58:34.601 --> 00:58:36.501
And then how do we solve that
in a more--

00:58:36.501 --> 00:58:38.067
in a more effective way

00:58:38.067 --> 00:58:39.434
and a more
cost-efficient way?

00:58:39.434 --> 00:58:41.767
And so there are--
and I can go down the line.

00:58:41.767 --> 00:58:43.300
We talked about some of them,
like, different ways

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:45.133
in which products
interoperate.

00:58:45.133 --> 00:58:47.667
We talked about exchange
calendar interoperability.

00:58:47.667 --> 00:58:50.100
We talked about email.

00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.701
And, you know, just
the previous question,

00:58:51.701 --> 00:58:53.934
we talked about docs
and Microsoft Office.

00:58:53.934 --> 00:58:56.634
We--between the tools
that we create,

00:58:56.634 --> 00:58:58.767
which is built on market
demand--based on market demand,

00:58:58.767 --> 00:59:01.267
and the tools
that our partners are creating

00:59:01.267 --> 00:59:03.100
and putting into
our solutions marketplace,

00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:04.400
based on our open APIs,

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.634
there's a lot of these
kinds of things

00:59:05.634 --> 00:59:07.000
that you can play with.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.067
But it's not--it's
certainly not a, you know,

00:59:09.067 --> 00:59:11.000
it's not
a one-size-fits-all thing.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.834
It's certainly
a case-by-case decision--

00:59:13.834 --> 00:59:17.267
discussion that's based around
the business requirements.

00:59:17.267 --> 00:59:19.901
Hope that answered
some of the questions.

00:59:19.901 --> 00:59:22.667
I think that we
are just about out of time.

00:59:22.667 --> 00:59:24.167
We're getting some cues
from the folks in the back.

00:59:24.167 --> 00:59:25.901
But I want to thank
everybody for coming,

00:59:25.901 --> 00:59:28.100
especially folks who took
the time out of their lunch,

00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:31.133
and--and thank
Daniel as well.

00:59:31.133 --> 00:59:32.667
Have a good day.

00:59:32.667 --> 00:59:34.934
[applause]

00:59:34.934 --> 00:59:36.400
Jefferies: Thanks.
