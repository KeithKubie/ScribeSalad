00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.480
This lesson has illustrated some uses of OCL to provide

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.630
precise specifications for simple library information system. Even so

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.490
there are many more things we need to do to complete this exercise.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.781
We haven't even mentioned some of the other requirements like numbers one,

00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:21.380
three, eight, ten, 11 which we would need to specify. We haven't of course at

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.532
all in this whole exercise mention anything having to do with non functional.

00:00:24.532 --> 00:00:30.540
Requirements. Along the way we invented some axillary operations like

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.150
is available, and is available is actually pretty complicated itself and

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.410
we'd have, we'd have to white that out. We'd have to handle some

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.930
situations implicit in the requirements such as returning a loanable item,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.420
as returning a book we checked out. Paying a fine, cancelling a request, and so

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.330
on. And, we might have to consider some new

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.870
some new issues that arise during the course of doing this. For example,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.520
if one item in a title is a best seller, need all of them be best sellers,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.580
okay? It would make sense in a library if you have some. Designated a book as

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.810
a best seller that all the items in that title, are a best seller. But

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.700
we haven't stated anything explicitly that would require that. We would also

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.530
need to op, add in some specifications for operations for classes date. And

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.470
money. Money had to do with paying fines. Although in those situations we could

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.230
presumably reuse those specification in other systems that we're building.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.420
Likewise, for the operating system operations. We also haven't said

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.070
anything about constructing instances of loanable items and patrons. Although,

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.690
we did construct instances of associations and we can use similar techniques for

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.040
constructing h, the instances of the other two classes.
