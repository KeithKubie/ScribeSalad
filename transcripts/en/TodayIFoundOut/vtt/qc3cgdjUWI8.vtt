00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.740
The Truth About the Split Infinitive

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.790
the majority of modern English grammar guides
list split infinitives as being perfectly

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.790
acceptable.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.609
This has also been the case, not just in modern
usage, but throughout most of the history

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.869
of the English language (since those split
infinitives first popped up around the 13th

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:30.869
century).

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.010
Indeed, Oxford Dictionaries states: “People
have been splitting infinitives for centuries,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.590
especially in spoken English, and avoiding
a split infinitive can sound clumsy.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.330
It can also change the emphasis of what’s
being said.”

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.470
For example: “Jamie decided to slowly remove
his hat.”

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.900
Obviously, aside from completely re-writing
the sentence, there are three ways you could

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.500
make a small modification to remove the split
infinitive:

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.840
The first way is as such: “Jamie decided
slowly to remove his hat.”

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.590
That changes the meaning of the sentence,
so that option is out.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.600
The second way would be: “Jamie decided
to remove slowly his hat.”

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.600
That’s just awkward.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.600
(And I should know, I’m apparently a professional
at creating awkwardly worded sentences, if

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.780
you follow my work here) 😉
The third way would be: “Jamie decided to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.590
remove his hat slowly.”

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.969
That’s much better, but is somewhat ambiguous
as it isn’t completely clear whether he

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.170
decided slowly or removed the hat slowly.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.979
One could just completely re-write the sentence,
of course, but why go to the effort when a

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.650
split infinitive works perfectly well and
is clear in terms of its meaning?

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.869
The idea that split infinitives should not
be acceptable in proper English grammar didn’t

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.889
come about until the 19th century, though
it was a matter of much debate even then and

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:40.210
into the 20th century.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.719
For instance, in the 1907 The King’s English,
they had this to say about the split infinitive:

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.789
The ‘split’ infinitive has taken such
hold upon the consciences of journalists that,

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.759
instead of warning the novice against splitting
his infinitives, we must warn him against

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.369
the curious superstition that the splitting
or not splitting makes the difference between

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.469
a good and a bad writer.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.549
In the 20th century, the idea that split infinitives
were bad and should never be used became firmly

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.160
entrenched in many, but not all, grammar guides.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.180
This didn’t last long and by the late 20th
century split infinitives were again almost

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.739
universally accepted.

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.180
That being said, some among the older generations
still vehemently condemn their usage.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.760
This is the case is simply because that this
was what they were taught when they were young.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.849
For instance, it was noted on a BBC special
on English grammar in 1983:

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.129
One reason why the older generation feels
so strongly about English grammar is that

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.540
we were severely punished if we didn’t obey
the rules!

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.739
One split infinitive, one whack; two split
infinitives, two whacks; and so on.

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.420
Surely that can’t be the only reason, you
say?

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.980
There must be some logical reason that split
infinitives were for a time considered improper.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.660
On the contrary, Merriam Webster’s Dictionary
goes as far as to state: “there has never

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.799
been a rational basis for objecting to the
split infinitive.”

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.700
So why do so many Grammar Nazis lament the
use of split infinitives, even though they

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.990
are grammatically correct?

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.050
Further, if there was never any “rational”
basis, who first thought up the irrational

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.769
basis for why split infinitives were bad?

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.799
The most popular theory is that it came about
simply because, in academic circles, Latin

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.120
has long been the language of choice, particularly
in the late 19th century when split infinitives

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.209
started to become taboo in some circles.

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.870
Thus, it is thought that split infinitives
were perceived to be improper because you

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.519
can’t split an infinitive in Latin…

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.260
Seriously, that’s the reason most linguists
think split infinitives were originally thought

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.829
to be taboo in English.

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.409
Everything since has just been tradition.

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.750
The other leading argument put forth in the
anti-split infinitive camp tends to be because

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.680
that’s not how people use English or speak,
the “common usage” argument.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.900
One of the first who helped popularize the
anti-split infinitive movement, Henry Alford,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.269
Dean of Canterbury, used both arguments, though
leaned more heavily on the “common usage”

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.269
argument.

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.670
In The Queen’s English (1864), he stated:

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.459
A correspondent states as his own usage, and
defends, the insertion of an adverb between

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.920
the sign of the infinitive mood and the verb.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.870
He gives the instance ‘to scientifically
illustrate.’

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.510
But surely this practice is entirely unknown
to English speakers and writers.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.049
It seems to me that we ever regard the ‘to’
of the infinitive as inseparable from its

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.049
verb.

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.750
And when we have the choice between the two
forms of expression ‘to scientifically illustrate’

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.370
and ‘to illustrate scientifically,’ there
seems no good reason for flying in the face

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.430
of common usage.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.270
However, that argument doesn’t hold water,
given that people used split infinitives before

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.949
they were widely objected to.

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.470
Further, there certainly is a good reason
for using split infinitives when it makes

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.120
the statement clearer, as using split infinitives
often does.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.880
As stated in Curme’s Grammar of the English
Language: “[split infinitive usage] should

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.810
be furthered rather than censured, for it
makes for clearer expression.”

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.139
I’ll close on this topic by including a
fantastic quote from author Raymond Chandler

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.090
to his editor at The Atlantic Monthly.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.370
Chandler didn’t appreciate the removal of
split infinitives from his work and had this

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.590
to say about it:

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.590
By the way, would you convey my compliments
to the purist who reads your proofs and tell

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.970
him or her that I write in a sort of broken-down
patois which is something like the way a Swiss-waiter

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.460
talks, and that when I split an infinitive,
God damn it, I split it so it will remain

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.050
split, and when I interrupt the velvety smoothness
of my more or less literate syntax with a

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.370
few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this
is done with the eyes wide open and the mind

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.960
relaxed and attentive.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:36.650
The method may not be perfect, but it is all
I have.
