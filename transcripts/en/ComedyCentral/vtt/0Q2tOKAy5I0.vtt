00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:03.403
NOW IT'S TIME TO PLAY "SCARE
B.N.B."

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.309
AIRBNB.COM IS A GREAT RESOURCE
FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT ALL THE

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:10.911
DISCOMFORT OF NOT STAYING IN A
HOTEL,

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:15.749
COMBINED WITH ALL OF THE FEAR
OF SLEEPING NEAR STRANGERS.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.850
PEOPLE LIST THEIR ACTUAL HOMES
AND THEN PEOPLE THEY

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.486
DON'T KNOW COME AND STAY THERE.

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:21.655
IT'S LIKE GOLDILOCKS WITH
PAYPAL.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.358
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A PICTURE
FROM AN AIR B.N.B. LISTING

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:26.860
AND I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A LINE
FROM YOUR REVIEW AFTER

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.897
STAYING THERE. HERE'S THE FIRST
ONE.

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:33.400
THIS COZY SUITE THAT SHARES
GROUND WITH A FOX NAMED RABIES

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.371
AND SOME CREEPY ART
INSTALLATIONS.

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.507
&gt;&gt; HARD TO ( BLEEP ) WHEN
OMINOUS CHILDDEN'S LAUGHTER

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:44.244
BEGINS AT MIDNIGHT.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:48.715
POINT!

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:53.420
THIS ONE IS IN SEOUL, AND IT
LOOKS LIKE A PRISON CAMP.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.756
NATASHA.

00:00:55.856 --> 00:01:02.062
&gt;&gt; EASILY THE NICEST SHOERACK
I'VE EVER SLEPT IN.

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.835
ALSO, I HEART THE SMELL OF
KIMCHI FARTS.

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:12.539
&gt;&gt; THIS IS FINE BUT THE MAIDS
WORE WHITE LAB COATS AND THE

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:16.977
FREE BREAKFAST WAS AT THE END OF
A MAZE.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:20.480
POINTS.

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:25.252
THIS CREEPY ROOM RENTED BY THIS
NOT-AT-ALL-CREEPY GUY.

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:28.789
&gt;&gt; HA-HA-- GOT YOU PREGNANT.

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.357
&gt;&gt; MARC.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:35.596
&gt;&gt; REASONABLE RATES BUT I GOT
TIRED OF PUTTING THE LOTION IN

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:37.364
THE BASKET.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:44.004
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; POINTS.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:48.842
&gt;&gt; HE CALLS IT A DETACHED
SHACK-TEAU.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:52.646
THE ROOM IS VERY SPACIOUS WHICH
IS NICE, BECUASE THE SMILING

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:54.181
LUNATIC NEVER LEAVES THE ROOM.

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:56.550
&gt;&gt; HE JUST HANGS OUT WITH YOU.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.586
&gt;&gt; "YOU WANT ME TO WAKE YOU UP
AT ANY TIME."

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:04.358
THE OTHER PART OF THAT PICTURE
IS HIS HALF OF THE BED

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:08.195
IT LOOKS LIKE A SMALL BED, BUT
THAT'S LITERALLY--

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:11.632
&gt;&gt; HAD A GREAT STAY UNTIL MY
UNBORN CHILD WAS RIPPED FROM MY

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:14.668
WOMB AS I SLEPT

00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:18.272
&gt;&gt; CLOSE TO SUBWAY.
&gt;&gt; POINTS.
