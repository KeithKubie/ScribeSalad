I grew up with a pencil and I suppose my
 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.560
I grew up with a pencil and I suppose my
computer at the time and and so drawing

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
computer at the time and and so drawing
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.930
computer at the time and and so drawing
drawing drawing and the tools of drawing

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940

well you know the usual ones you and

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519
well you know the usual ones you and
 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.240
well you know the usual ones you and
eventually then you graduate from the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250
eventually then you graduate from the
 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.520
eventually then you graduate from the
tools when the work increases and you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
tools when the work increases and you
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.700
tools when the work increases and you
start to drop by freehand as precise as

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710
start to drop by freehand as precise as
 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.320
start to drop by freehand as precise as
possible and as accurate as possible and

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330
possible and as accurate as possible and
 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.000

I was pretty good so for me one inch was

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010
I was pretty good so for me one inch was
 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.910
I was pretty good so for me one inch was
a particular length you know but in

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
a particular length you know but in
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.050
a particular length you know but in
centimeters or inches and which is kind

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060
centimeters or inches and which is kind
 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.270
centimeters or inches and which is kind
of important too because it gives you a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280
of important too because it gives you a
 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.700
of important too because it gives you a
very good sense of dimension and

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
very good sense of dimension and
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.069
very good sense of dimension and
therefore a good sense of scale you know

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079
therefore a good sense of scale you know
 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.200
therefore a good sense of scale you know
scale is extremely important you know

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
scale is extremely important you know
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.469
scale is extremely important you know
and skill is not dimensions dimensions

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479
and skill is not dimensions dimensions
 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.319
and skill is not dimensions dimensions
are physical and scales are mental and

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
are physical and scales are mental and
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.929
are physical and scales are mental and
so without the knowledge of one you

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939
so without the knowledge of one you
 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.700
so without the knowledge of one you
can't get to the knowledge of the second

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
can't get to the knowledge of the second
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.990
can't get to the knowledge of the second
one you know in a sense then you know

computer is really like a pencil you

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180
computer is really like a pencil you
 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.640
computer is really like a pencil you
know it used to be you know the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650
know it used to be you know the

but you have to do it you know and the
 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.080
but you have to do it you know and the
signals better computer you can do

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090
signals better computer you can do
 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.059
signals better computer you can do
anything you want but you have to do it

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069
anything you want but you have to do it
 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.839
anything you want but you have to do it
you know it's a tool you know even when

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849
you know it's a tool you know even when
 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.200
you know it's a tool you know even when
it goes by itself it's a disaster

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210
it goes by itself it's a disaster
 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.020
it goes by itself it's a disaster
