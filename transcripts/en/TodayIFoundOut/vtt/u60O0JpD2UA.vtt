00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:11.800
How does the Witness Protection Program Work?

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.410
Born of the Organized Crime Control Act of
1970, and the brainchild of longtime Department

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.810
of Justice attorney, Gerald Shur, the U.S.
Marshall Service Witness Security Program

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.789
(WITSEC) has successfully protected more than
18,000 people since it first began operations

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.570
in 1971.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.000
Membership in the witness protection program
is typically for life, and usually begins

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.820
with a visit from U.S. marshals, whether anticipated
or not.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.910
While many of the witnesses and their family
members have time to make the decision and

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.600
prepare for their new lives, others are forced
to choose rather quickly.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.350
Even occasionally having to leave within moments
of the marshals arriving.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.450
Family members also join, and typically this
includes a spouse and children, although sometimes

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.170
even mistresses have been protected.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.550
And, since the program requires that all participants
leave everything behind – including parents,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.450
siblings, assets and identity – innocent
family members and informants alike are faced

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.859
with an impossible decision: join the program
and lose your “life,” or stay and potentially

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:13.979
lose your life.

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.200
Relocation sites are chosen by WITSEC marshals,
although families are allowed to choose from

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.469
several options.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:24.329
The location ultimately chosen is then disclosed
to only a few people within the program.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.390
Before beginning their new lives, family members
are given new identities.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.399
One woman, Jackee Taylor (née Jacqueline
Crouch), who was 7 when her family entered

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.999
the program in 1981, later remembered spending
hours practicing writing her new name while

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:39.209
waiting to be placed.

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.789
Once a witness has finished testifying, the
family is transported to the new location

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.539
where they are often put up in a hotel until
a suitable home is chosen.

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.179
Relocated families receive a monthly stipend,
along with money for housing and other expenses

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.750
that are eventually phased out after the adults
have had enough time to find new means of

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.869
supporting themselves.

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.319
Early on when the program was being developed,
many things fell through the cracks.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.290
WITSEC marshals often either had to forge
documents or simply failed to provide them

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.290
for everyone; for example, Jackee Taylor was
never given a birth certificate nor, obviously,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.780
is she able to get one from anywhere.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.530
So when she was little, she couldn’t play
softball, and later in life, she had a difficult

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.409
time enrolling in college and getting married.

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.640
In addition, although today there are set
limits for expenses, that policy only came

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.810
about after some serious growing pains.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.060
For example, after the acting head of the
Los Angeles crime syndicate, Aladena Jimmy

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.540
“The Weasel” Fratianno, turned informant
in 1978, he was paid nearly $1,000,000 over

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.670
the next 10 years while in the program.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.079
Perhaps worth it, Fratianno’s testimony
ultimately helped to convict more than 2 dozen

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.290
gangsters; on the other hand, in addition
to paying for food, housing, living expenses

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.530
and health care, WITSEC was also paying for
unnecessary expenses including Fratianno’s

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.459
wife’s plastic surgery and even a monthly
stipend for her mother.

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.709
So, in 1987 when Fratianno’s information
dried up, so did the government’s patience,

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.019
and WITSEC cut off his income and stopped
providing 24/7 protection.

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.079
Although Fratianno claimed to fear for his
life afterward, he lived for another 6 years

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.730
and died in his sleep in 1993.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.180
Today most of the bugs have been worked out,
and legally sealed name changes, new social

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.659
security cards, birth certificates and drivers’
licenses are all routinely issued; in addition,

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.849
medical and school records are quickly transferred
and fake credit histories are created.

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:35.719
In sum, since 1971, about 8,500 witnesses
and 9,900 family members have been protected

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:40.860
by WITSEC, and no one who has followed the
program’s guidelines has ever been killed.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.790
However, not everyone successfully transitions
into the program.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.200
In 1980, Henry Hill testified against his
former associates in the Lucchese crime family,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.589
and was placed in witness protection along
with his wife and two kids.

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:57.890
Having difficulty adjusting, the Henry Hill’s
(changed to the Martin Lewis’s and later

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.779
the Peter Haines’s) had to be relocated
10 times from places including Independence,

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:05.579
Kentucky; Redmond, Washington; and Omaha,
Nebraska.

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:10.469
Bored to tears, Henry (or Martin or Peter)
continued with his criminal activities and

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:15.680
during the 1980s was arrested for crimes ranging
from assault to drunk driving to burglary.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.000
In 1985, he outed himself a bit when he worked
with Nicholas Pileggi to write his memoir,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.830
Wiseguy, which became the 1990s Goodfellas.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.889
Shortly thereafter, in 1987, Henry/Martin/Peter
was arrested for trying to sell a pound of

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:34.160
cocaine to two DEA agents, which ultimately
resulted in his expulsion from the program.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.520
Apparently, however, exile didn’t cause
him too many problems with those he’d testified

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:56.620
against, since Henry lived to 2012, dying
of 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:08.260
a heart attack.
