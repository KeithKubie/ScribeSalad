specific issue like if you working fine
on a bunch of her devices and I'd say

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:57.110
on a bunch of her devices and I'd say
 

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:59.750
on a bunch of her devices and I'd say
for now I would blacklist the device in

00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760
for now I would blacklist the device in
 

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.120
for now I would blacklist the device in

the supported device section of the
 

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:05.870
the supported device section of the
place of console and then I will try and

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880
place of console and then I will try and
 

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.400
place of console and then I will try and
even get hold of device or perhaps use a

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:07.410
even get hold of device or perhaps use a
 

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:09.800
even get hold of device or perhaps use a
service like testdroid calm to try and

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:09.810
service like testdroid calm to try and
 

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:12.020

think the presentation API I've never

00:44:55.099 --> 00:44:55.109
think the presentation API I've never
 

00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:57.470
think the presentation API I've never
played with me yet but I think the power

00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480
played with me yet but I think the power
 

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:06.980
played with me yet but I think the power
of it and what you can do with it this

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:06.990
of it and what you can do with it this
 

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:09.140
of it and what you can do with it this
example in their API demo and this

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:09.150
example in their API demo and this
 

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:12.140
example in their API demo and this
example yeah I like the presentation as

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:12.150
example yeah I like the presentation as
 

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:20.120
example yeah I like the presentation as
