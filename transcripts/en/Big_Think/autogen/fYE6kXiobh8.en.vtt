going to do it sure it's better to give
 

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.300
going to do it sure it's better to give
some incentives and let the private

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:31.310
some incentives and let the private
 

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.670
some incentives and let the private
sector go nuts doing it because it's

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:33.680
sector go nuts doing it because it's
 

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.510
sector go nuts doing it because it's
messy it creates losses but the benefits

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:37.520
messy it creates losses but the benefits
 

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.640
messy it creates losses but the benefits
get pretty widely distributed yeah you

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:39.650
get pretty widely distributed yeah you
 

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:41.230
get pretty widely distributed yeah you
know it's interesting to contrast those

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:41.240
know it's interesting to contrast those
 

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.150
know it's interesting to contrast those
two bubble periods you know and you were

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:43.160
two bubble periods you know and you were
 

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.190
two bubble periods you know and you were
saying earlier you know who could fault

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200
saying earlier you know who could fault
 

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:45.880
saying earlier you know who could fault
the young kid

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:45.890
the young kid
 

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.560
the young kid
and flip flops who built the dot-com

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:47.570
and flip flops who built the dot-com
 

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:48.670
and flip flops who built the dot-com
economy they didn't know what they were

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:48.680
economy they didn't know what they were
 

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.260
economy they didn't know what they were
doing and I would say I mean actually

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:50.270
doing and I would say I mean actually
 

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.150
doing and I would say I mean actually
they're the they're the great people in

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:52.160
they're the they're the great people in
 

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.520
they're the they're the great people in
the story you know they were the

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:54.530
the story you know they were the
 

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.380
the story you know they were the
innovators and they built a lot of these

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:56.390
innovators and they built a lot of these
 

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:59.140
innovators and they built a lot of these
new companies and it I would argue it

00:28:59.140 --> 00:28:59.150
new companies and it I would argue it
 

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:02.530
new companies and it I would argue it
was really the same group of people who

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:02.540
was really the same group of people who
 

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.000
was really the same group of people who
caused the bubble because you needed the

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:04.010
caused the bubble because you needed the
 

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:06.430
caused the bubble because you needed the
investment community to buy in and then

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:06.440
investment community to buy in and then
 

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.530
investment community to buy in and then
somehow collectively overvalue these

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:08.540
somehow collectively overvalue these
 

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.450
somehow collectively overvalue these
companies I mean the kids running the

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:10.460
companies I mean the kids running the
 

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.820
companies I mean the kids running the
company weren't in a position to create

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:12.830
company weren't in a position to create
 

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.380
company weren't in a position to create
the bubble they didn't have the money to

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:14.390
the bubble they didn't have the money to
 

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:16.420
the bubble they didn't have the money to
drive the share prices up the way they

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:16.430
drive the share prices up the way they
 

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:19.180
drive the share prices up the way they
went up so i would say that bubble was

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:19.190
went up so i would say that bubble was
 

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:22.450
went up so i would say that bubble was
in a different sort of way again just a

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:22.460
in a different sort of way again just a
 

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.120
in a different sort of way again just a
huge wealth transfer from one set of

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:25.130
huge wealth transfer from one set of
 

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.640
huge wealth transfer from one set of
investors to insiders who were smart

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:27.650
investors to insiders who were smart
 

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:29.410
investors to insiders who were smart
enough to get out early enough and we

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:29.420
enough to get out early enough and we
 

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.020
enough to get out early enough and we
probably both know plenty who did and it

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:32.030
probably both know plenty who did and it
 

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.810
probably both know plenty who did and it
is kind of interesting you know the

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:34.820
is kind of interesting you know the
 

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.520
is kind of interesting you know the
people that I've known that made a lot

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:36.530
people that I've known that made a lot
 

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.380
people that I've known that made a lot
of money on companies that later on

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:38.390
of money on companies that later on
 

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:41.050
of money on companies that later on
proved not to be worth very much you

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:41.060
proved not to be worth very much you
 

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.780
proved not to be worth very much you
know yeah they feel good about what they

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:43.790
know yeah they feel good about what they
 

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.490
know yeah they feel good about what they
have but they also feel like they still

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:45.500
have but they also feel like they still
 

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.810
have but they also feel like they still
have something to prove because I hope

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:46.820
have something to prove because I hope
 

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.730
have something to prove because I hope
they know sure they sort of got a

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:48.740
they know sure they sort of got a
 

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.310
they know sure they sort of got a
windfall that really they didn't deserve

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:51.320
windfall that really they didn't deserve
 

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.780
windfall that really they didn't deserve
because the company now there's no

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:52.790
because the company now there's no
 

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.660
because the company now there's no
question the it takes Wall Street to

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:55.670
question the it takes Wall Street to
 

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.700
question the it takes Wall Street to
create a bubble that's right and so in

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:57.710
create a bubble that's right and so in
 

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:00.610
create a bubble that's right and so in
in the more recent case you know again

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:00.620
in the more recent case you know again
 

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.680

it's it's the investment community that

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:02.690
it's it's the investment community that
 

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.120
it's it's the investment community that
drove up the value of a lot of these

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:04.130
drove up the value of a lot of these
 

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:06.310
drove up the value of a lot of these

there was I would argue there will be

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:09.770
there was I would argue there will be
 

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:11.770
there was I would argue there will be
some lasting benefits so what's the

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:11.780
some lasting benefits so what's the
 

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.690
some lasting benefits so what's the
thing that we built too much of housing

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:13.700
thing that we built too much of housing
 

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:14.890
thing that we built too much of housing
and you know house prices are going to

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:14.900
and you know house prices are going to
 

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.050
and you know house prices are going to
come down now if you're a pre-existing

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:17.060
come down now if you're a pre-existing
 

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.910
come down now if you're a pre-existing
homeowner you may not like that but if

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:18.920
homeowner you may not like that but if

there's the lasting innovation from this

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:24.350
there's the lasting innovation from this
 

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:27.040
there's the lasting innovation from this
episode or one of them is there anything

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:27.050
episode or one of them is there anything
 

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.660

in the financial innovation that you

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:28.670
in the financial innovation that you
 

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.370

that isn't value-added because you can't
touch it or but really you know we've

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520
touch it or but really you know we've
 

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.310
touch it or but really you know we've
come a long way obviously over history

out of this as the innovation that you

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:51.920
out of this as the innovation that you
 

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.310
out of this as the innovation that you
know has durable value well you look a

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320
know has durable value well you look a
 

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.810
know has durable value well you look a
few things you look at some of the

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:55.820
few things you look at some of the
 

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.630

so close to shell right you know the

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:11.710
so close to shell right you know the
 

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.020
so close to shell right you know the

at a party then you can go and figure
 

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.440
at a party then you can go and figure
out how much they paid and if you want

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:26.450
out how much they paid and if you want
 

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.350
out how much they paid and if you want
you can go in town hall and see how much

that's enormously I didn't know that you
 

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.430
that's enormously I didn't know that you
can go down to town well maybe you can't

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:36.440
can go down to town well maybe you can't
 

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.500
can go down to town well maybe you can't
hear but I think generally in there's a

and when you think about housing of this

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:03.380
and when you think about housing of this
 

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.810
and when you think about housing of this
market it's the biggest thing anybody

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:04.820
market it's the biggest thing anybody
 

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.270

ever buys and a lot of inefficiencies

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:07.280
ever buys and a lot of inefficiencies
 

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.430
ever buys and a lot of inefficiencies
built in and a lot of lack of

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440
built in and a lot of lack of
 

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.180
built in and a lot of lack of
information flow in theory empowering

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:13.190

people with more information will make

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480
people with more information will make
 

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.120
people with more information will make
them better and smarter consumer so I

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:16.130
them better and smarter consumer so I
 

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.070
them better and smarter consumer so I
don't think that goes away and also I

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080
don't think that goes away and also I
 

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.240

thousands of dollars over and that's
 

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:39.700
thousands of dollars over and that's
enormously beneficial that's a big

it was like a wrench I was a little more

00:33:59.300 --> 00:33:59.310
it was like a wrench I was a little more
 

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:01.400
it was like a wrench I was a little more
complicated than a wrench but admittedly

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:01.410
complicated than a wrench but admittedly
 

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.890

skilled craftsperson who was careful
with their handiwork it's a great tool

00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000
with their handiwork it's a great tool
 

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.090

in the hands of a reckless person you

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:11.100
in the hands of a reckless person you
 

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.040
in the hands of a reckless person you
could destroy a lot of things with it

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:13.050
could destroy a lot of things with it
 

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.530
could destroy a lot of things with it
and so I think that's what I don't think

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:15.540
and so I think that's what I don't think
 

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.970
and so I think that's what I don't think
the the fact that a lot of bombs that

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980
the the fact that a lot of bombs that
 

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:24.139
the the fact that a lot of bombs that
were issued defaulted is a is it means

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:24.149
were issued defaulted is a is it means
 

00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:26.149
were issued defaulted is a is it means
securitization doesn't work or is a bad

00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159
securitization doesn't work or is a bad
 

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.680
securitization doesn't work or is a bad
idea I still think it's a great idea you

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:27.690
idea I still think it's a great idea you
 

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:30.380
idea I still think it's a great idea you
just have to do it a little better right

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:30.390
just have to do it a little better right
 

00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:32.960
just have to do it a little better right
you have to do it maybe maybe the person

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:32.970
you have to do it maybe maybe the person
 

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:34.370
you have to do it maybe maybe the person
who's doing the issuing and the

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:34.380
who's doing the issuing and the
 

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:37.909
who's doing the issuing and the
underwriting you know keep some skin in

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919
underwriting you know keep some skin in
 

00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:39.620
underwriting you know keep some skin in
the game maybe I start doing covered

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:39.630
the game maybe I start doing covered
 

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:41.149
the game maybe I start doing covered
bonds like they do in Europe and that

00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159
bonds like they do in Europe and that
 

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:43.490

that's securitization that works quite

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:43.500
that's securitization that works quite
 

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.550
that's securitization that works quite
well so i think we are people if they

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560
well so i think we are people if they
 

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.830
well so i think we are people if they
have been wanting to write it off are

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:48.840
have been wanting to write it off are
 

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.480

default swaps again great idea but when

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399
default swaps again great idea but when
 

00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:58.160
default swaps again great idea but when
you the biggest rider credit default

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:58.170
you the biggest rider credit default
 

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:01.940

hedge fund right yeah one of the
 

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:37.950
hedge fund right yeah one of the
interesting things in this you know I

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:37.960
interesting things in this you know I
 

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.110
interesting things in this you know I
think it was really the misalignment of

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:40.120
think it was really the misalignment of
 

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.910
think it was really the misalignment of
incentives that you're getting at where

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920
incentives that you're getting at where
 

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.470
incentives that you're getting at where
people are making money simply on the

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.480
people are making money simply on the
 

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.870
people are making money simply on the
deal flow the transactions and they

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:45.880
deal flow the transactions and they
 

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.370
deal flow the transactions and they
don't have any skin in the game and I

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:47.380
don't have any skin in the game and I
 

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.290
don't have any skin in the game and I
guess what shocked me at the end of it

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:49.300
guess what shocked me at the end of it
 

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.690
guess what shocked me at the end of it
all I was kind of figuring that the

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:51.700
all I was kind of figuring that the
 

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.280
all I was kind of figuring that the
investment banks that were bundling

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:53.290
investment banks that were bundling
 

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:55.110
investment banks that were bundling
stuff up and selling it we're really

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:55.120
stuff up and selling it we're really
 

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.820
stuff up and selling it we're really
selling at all and of course they were

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:56.830
selling at all and of course they were
 

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:58.710
selling at all and of course they were
holding thirty or thirty-five percent of

00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720
holding thirty or thirty-five percent of
 

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.630
holding thirty or thirty-five percent of
a lot of the the material they created

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640
a lot of the the material they created
 

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.460
a lot of the the material they created
so they actually did have skin in the

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:02.470
so they actually did have skin in the
 

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.630
so they actually did have skin in the
game which is I think a bigger

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:03.640
game which is I think a bigger
 

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.060
game which is I think a bigger
indictment their ability someone that

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:06.070
indictment their ability someone that
 

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:07.890
indictment their ability someone that
was reluctant they they had amassed a

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:07.900
was reluctant they they had amassed a
 

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.000
was reluctant they they had amassed a
certain amount of stuff and then the

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.010
certain amount of stuff and then the
 

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:11.340
certain amount of stuff and then the
wheel yeah that's true stop to make I

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:11.350

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:18.030
calls should we do X or Y and there are
some that are generally difficult and

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:18.040
some that are generally difficult and
 

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.010
some that are generally difficult and
challenging calls and I think we've got

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:20.020
challenging calls and I think we've got
 

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:23.550
challenging calls and I think we've got
five or six of those right now so doing

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:23.560
five or six of those right now so doing
 

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.920
five or six of those right now so doing
the best they can but I would like them

that I think a lot of people don't
 

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:01.530
that I think a lot of people don't
appreciate and that is we really don't

situation me now I look at my picture of
 

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.280
situation me now I look at my picture of
job loss in this current recession at

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:22.290
job loss in this current recession at
 

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:24.200
job loss in this current recession at
least once a month when I updated and

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:24.210

it's a pretty scary picture right now I

it's a pretty scary picture right now I
mean the pace a job destruction is still

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:28.010
mean the pace a job destruction is still
 

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:31.430
mean the pace a job destruction is still
probably as high as it's been since this

probably as high as it's been since this
 

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.620
probably as high as it's been since this
recession started and do you see a

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:33.630
recession started and do you see a
 

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:36.260
recession started and do you see a
catalyst for recovery here and you know

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:36.270

to think that the worst is over and by
 

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:48.650
to think that the worst is over and by
that I mean not not no more quarters of

go another 30 25 to 30 percent down I

00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:01.020
go another 30 25 to 30 percent down I
 

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:04.700
go another 30 25 to 30 percent down I
don't think so but all that means is

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:04.710
don't think so but all that means is
 

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:08.829
don't think so but all that means is
that the pace of contraction decreases

00:53:08.829 --> 00:53:08.839
that the pace of contraction decreases
 

00:53:08.839 --> 00:53:11.089
that the pace of contraction decreases
not that we're going to have

00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099
not that we're going to have
 

00:53:11.099 --> 00:53:14.479
not that we're going to have
job creation anytime soon I think the

they are seeking Cass Sunstein and
 

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:22.290
they are seeking Cass Sunstein and
they're much more versed in this and so

01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:22.300
they're much more versed in this and so
 

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.470
they're much more versed in this and so
we're going to have an experiment as to

01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480
we're going to have an experiment as to
 

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.390
we're going to have an experiment as to
whether there's going to be some

01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400
whether there's going to be some

applications of this right this is sort

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:28.570
applications of this right this is sort
 

01:11:28.570 --> 01:11:29.820
applications of this right this is sort
of the next wave and that'll be

of the next wave and that'll be
 

01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:35.240
of the next wave and that'll be
interesting to watch question yeah

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:35.250

started measuring that I believe in the
80s so we don't have it going all the

01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:35.260
80s so we don't have it going all the
 

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:36.930
80s so we don't have it going all the
way back but I think the most recent

way back but I think the most recent
 

01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:39.680

it's an analogy but I don't think it's

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:23.170
it's an analogy but I don't think it's
 

01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:25.140
it's an analogy but I don't think it's
anything like you know the dow fell

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:47.770
capabilities so I think for a variety of
 

01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:50.990
capabilities so I think for a variety of
reasons the the analogy only goes so far

01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000
reasons the the analogy only goes so far
 

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.310
