00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850
hi my name is Nick and I'm studying

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860
hi my name is Nick and I'm studying
 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.329
hi my name is Nick and I'm studying
physics for GCSE and I was just

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339
physics for GCSE and I was just
 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.340
physics for GCSE and I was just
wondering how large would we be if we

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350
wondering how large would we be if we
 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.190
wondering how large would we be if we
were made up of just our nuclei and not

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200
were made up of just our nuclei and not
 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.879
were made up of just our nuclei and not
the rest of our earth so Luke wants to

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889
the rest of our earth so Luke wants to
 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.310
the rest of our earth so Luke wants to
know how large would we be if we were

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
know how large would we be if we were
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.340
know how large would we be if we were
made up of our atomic nuclei without the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350
made up of our atomic nuclei without the
 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.650
made up of our atomic nuclei without the
need for space for a whole atoms well

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
need for space for a whole atoms well
 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.720
need for space for a whole atoms well
Adam is about a hundred thousand times

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
Adam is about a hundred thousand times
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.290
Adam is about a hundred thousand times
larger than an atomic nuclei so that

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300
larger than an atomic nuclei so that
 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.330
larger than an atomic nuclei so that
means if you take my size I'm about two

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340
means if you take my size I'm about two
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.970
means if you take my size I'm about two
meters tall and / a hundred thousand

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
meters tall and / a hundred thousand
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.330
meters tall and / a hundred thousand
then I would be about 20 micrometers

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340
then I would be about 20 micrometers
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.389
then I would be about 20 micrometers
tall if I were just made out of atomic

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
tall if I were just made out of atomic
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.000
tall if I were just made out of atomic
nuclei touching each other so how big is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010
nuclei touching each other so how big is
 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.920
nuclei touching each other so how big is
20 micrometers it's about the thickness

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
20 micrometers it's about the thickness
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.139
20 micrometers it's about the thickness
of a human hair so just imagine me

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149
of a human hair so just imagine me
 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.520
of a human hair so just imagine me
sticking my arms out in a circle like

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530
sticking my arms out in a circle like
 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.410
sticking my arms out in a circle like
Leonardo da Vinci's man and draw a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420
Leonardo da Vinci's man and draw a
 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360
Leonardo da Vinci's man and draw a
circle around that that's about the size

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
circle around that that's about the size
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.500
circle around that that's about the size
of a human hair so it's a lot smaller
