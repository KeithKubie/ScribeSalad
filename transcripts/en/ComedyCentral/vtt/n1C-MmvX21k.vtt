NOW, OF COURSE, TONIGHT WE HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT THE G.O.P. DEBATE.

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.105 align:start position:0% line:85%
MAN!

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:10.443 size:75% position:38% line:85%
DID YOU GUYS WATCH THAT?

00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:11.978 size:88% position:44% line:85%
THAT THING WAS WAY TOO LONG.

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:13.613 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:14.647 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.918 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
JEB, STOP IT!

00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:22.088 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'LL GET TO YOU IN A MINUTE,
MR. EXCLAMATION POINT.

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:23.122 align:start position:0% line:85%
GO ON!

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:24.223 align:start position:0% line:85%
GET AWAY!

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:26.392 align:start position:0% line:85%
THERE YOU GO.

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:29.095 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW ONE OF THE COOL THINGS ABOUT
HAVING A DEBATE IN THE REAGAN

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:31.664 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIBRARY IS THE FORMER
PRESIDENT'S AIR FORCE ONE.

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:34.133 line:85%
IT'S A VERY IMPRESSIVE PLANE.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.001 align:start position:0% line:85%
WAIT A SECOND.

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:36.335 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOLD ON.

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:40.573 size:84% position:42% line:85%
CAN WE ZOOM IN ON SEAT 34B.

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:42.508 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.511 align:start position:0% line:91%
TOP-SECRET PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE BOBBY JINDAL!

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:46.045 align:start position:0% line:85%
IS THAT YOU?

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:47.380 align:start position:0% line:85%
GET OUT OF THERE, MAN!

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:48.314 align:start position:0% line:85%
GET OUT OF THERE!

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.284 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU HAD YOUR TIME EARLIER IN THE
BABY DEBATE

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:52.185 align:start position:0% line:85%
GET, GET!

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.453 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:57.056 line:91%
BUT ACTUALLY THERE WERE A LOT OF
FUN MOMENTS FOR CNN'S 23 MILLION

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.257 align:start position:0% line:85%
VIEWERS.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.064 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONE OF MY FAVORITES WAS THE
AWKWARD WHITE GUY MIDDLE EASTERN

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:06.165 align:start position:0% line:85%
NAME PRONUNCIATION.

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:09.535 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS DEAL ON ITS FACE WILL
SEND OVER $1 BILLION TO

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:11.771 align:start position:0% line:85%
AYATOLLAH KHAMENEI.

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:19.579 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:25.885 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: KHA-ME-NEI.

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:27.987 size:75% position:38% line:91%
CALM DOWN, YOU'RE IN THE
PRESIDENTIAL DE-BA-TAY

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.621 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE GET IT.

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:30.990 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE GET IT.

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:33.926 size:81% position:41% line:91%
WE KNOW THAT'S THE NERDY,
CORRECT WAY TO SAY IT, ALL

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.795 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT?

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:44.604 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THE AMERICAN PE-O-PLEY DON'T
CAR-AY

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:48.941 align:start position:0% line:85%
AM I RIGHT, SHARDAY?

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:50.476 line:85%
THAT NAME MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.014 line:91%
WHEN IT WASN'T AWKWARD WHITE GUY
PRONUNCIATIONS, IT WAS AWKWARD

00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:56.482 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHITE GUY LOW-FIVES.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:02:01.487 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I SUGGESTED TO PRESIDENT BUSH
THAT HE NOT GO TO WAR, OKAY, SO

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.058 line:85%
I JUST WANT THAT ON THE RECORD.

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:11.531 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; EVER READY, IT'S VERY HIGH
ENERGY, DONALD.

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:14.634 align:start position:0% line:85%
<i> ( APPLAUSE ).</i>

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:18.404 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S IT, OLD WHITE
DUDES JUST RUINED LOW-FIVES FOR

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:19.505 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE REST OF US.

00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:24.143 size:78% position:39% line:85%
ADD IT TO THE LIST, BOYS.

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:29.649 align:start position:0% line:91%
PUT IT RIGHT UNDER SHAKING YOUR
THANG.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:30.817 align:start position:0% line:85%
GONE NOW, GONE.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.220 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS SURPRISING HOW
MUCH THEY FOCUSED ON RACE.

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:34.587 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; RACE.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.021 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; RACE.

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:35.621 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; RACE.

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:37.623 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; RACE.

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:41.160 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Larry: I'M JUST ( BLEEP ).

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:42.228 align:start position:0% line:85%
PLAY THAT AGAIN, DRE.

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:43.129 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IN THIS RACE.

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:43.663 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THIS RACE.

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:44.330 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THIS RACE.

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:44.931 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IN THE RACE.

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:45.798 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; A LONG RACE.

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:48.601 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THE SPACE RACE.

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:51.304 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S JUST RUBBING
IT IN, BEN CARSON.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.472 line:85%
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE SPACE.

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:56.275 align:start position:0% line:91%
ACTUALLY, THERE WAS ZERO MENTION
OF RACE.

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:57.243 align:start position:0% line:85%
PRETTY MUCH ZERO.

00:02:57.276 --> 00:03:01.380 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK RAND PAUL SAID SOMETHING
TO...

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:03.216 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
I MEAN, THE CLOSEST THING WE GOT

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.587 line:91%
TO BLACK LIVES MATTERING WAS AN
HOUR AND A HALF IN WHEN THEY

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.591 align:start position:0% line:91%
WERE DISCUSSING MEXICANS BOOING
ABLE TO CLAIM BIRTH RIGHTS

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:12.725 align:start position:0% line:85%
CITIZENSHIPS.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.895 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THE
14th AMENDMENT SAID ON THE

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:18.965 align:start position:0% line:91%
SENATE FLOOR THAT THIS WAS
APPLYING TO SLAVES AND DID NOT

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:21.500 line:85%
SPECIFICALLY APPLY TO OTHERS.

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:22.568 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SLAVES, NICE.

00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:25.471 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE GOT RIGHT IN THERE!

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:28.374 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
SO IN OTHER WORDS ONE OF THE

00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:31.110 size:81% position:41% line:91%
ONLY MENTIONS DURING THIS
THREE-HOUR DEBATE OF BROWN

00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:34.113 size:88% position:44% line:91%
PEOPLE IN AMERICA WAS IN THE
CONTEXT OF KEEPING THEM OUT.

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.315 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
COME ON, G.O.P.

00:03:36.348 --> 00:03:47.059 align:start position:0% line:85%
GIVE ME A LOW-FIVE.

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:48.527 align:start position:0% line:85%
MAN.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.395 align:start position:0% line:85%
DAMN, JEB.

00:03:49.428 --> 00:03:51.430 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT SO
HARD?

00:03:51.463 --> 00:03:52.565 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:53.733 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ALL RIGHT, STOP IT.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:54.900 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE WON'T STOP.

00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:56.435 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE'S OUT OF CONTROL.

00:03:56.468 --> 00:03:57.603 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

00:03:57.636 --> 00:04:03.976 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT DONALD
TRUMP.

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.713 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE'S GOT LIKE A RESTING SMUG
FACE, DOESN'T HE?

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:13.586 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S LIKE HE'S EVEN THINKING
EVERYBODY'S A LOSER.

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:14.820 align:start position:0% line:85%
LOSER.

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:18.257 line:91%
YOU CAN FREEZE FRAME ALMOST ANY
IMAGE AND HE HAS THAT LOOK HIS

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.158 align:start position:0% line:85%
FACE.

00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:21.160 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE CRUS AS
PRESIDENT.

00:04:21.193 --> 00:04:24.797 line:91%
HE SAID HE WOULDN'T WANT SUCH A
HOT HEAD WITH HIS FINGER ON THE

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.065 align:start position:0% line:85%
NUCLEAR CODE.

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:35.374 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU KNOW WHO HE
REMINDS ME OF?

00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:40.313 line:85%
&gt;&gt; THE ALLIED POWERS ARE LOSERS.

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:44.417 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY, LOOK, FOR EVERYBODY OUT
THERE WHO IS SAYING, "LARRY, ARE

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.186 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU REALLY COMPARING TRUMP TO
MUSSOLINI?"

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:48.888 align:start position:0% line:91%
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I JUST
DID.

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:49.555 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DID THAT.

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:51.090 line:85%
IT WAS KIND OF FUN, ACTUALLY.

00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:53.893 size:84% position:42% line:85%
BUT TRUMP IS AMAZING TO ME.

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:57.096 align:start position:0% line:91%
TRUMP DOESN'T WASTE ANY TIME IN
BEING A DICK.

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.566 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN THE VERY FIRST QUESTION WHEN
HE WAS ASKED TO RESPOND TO

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.869 size:88% position:44% line:91%
SOMETHING CARLY FIORINA SAID
ABOUT TRUMP HAVING TO ACCESS

00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:07.173 align:start position:0% line:91%
NUCLEAR CODES, THIS IS HOW HE
ARE ANSWERED.

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:11.277 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; RAND PAUL SHOULDN'T EVEN BE
ON THIS STAGE.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.111 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE'S NUMBER 11.

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:14.814 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHAT!

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:16.482 line:85%
UM, LITTLE SUGGESTION, IF I MAY.

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:19.185 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN SOMEONE ASKS YOU IF YOU'RE
RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO HAVE

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:24.857 size:88% position:44% line:91%
ACCESS TO THE BUTTONS OF OUR
NUCLEAR ARSENAL, YOUR ANSWER

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.227 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHOULD NOT BE TO RANDOMLY ATTACK
SOMEONE.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:36.802 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MOVES LIKE THAT SORT OF MADE ME

00:05:36.835 --> 00:05:38.971 align:start position:0% line:91%
SUSPICIOUS THAT TRUMP MIGHT SLIP
OUT OF THE LEAD.

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:40.139 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DON'T KNOW.

00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:43.242 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND I FELT LIKE THE OVERALL
TAKEAWAY WAS IN SOMEONE ELSE'S

00:05:43.275 --> 00:05:44.510 align:start position:0% line:85%
FAVOR.

00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:46.412 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE POLITICAL ANALYSTS SEEMED
TO AGREE THAT CARLY FIORINA WON

00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:47.413 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE DEBATE.

00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:48.881 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY, CARLY FIORINA WAS
THE BIG WINNER.

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:52.485 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS CARLY FIORINA WHO RAN
AWAY WITH THE HEADLINES.

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.286 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; GRETCHEN, WHO WON?

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:54.787 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; CARLY FIORINA.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.788 align:start position:0% line:85%

LADY TAKING DOWN ALL THOSE MEN

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:07.032 align:start position:0% line:85%
IN THE GRAND OLD PARTY.

00:06:07.065 --> 00:06:07.799 align:start position:0% line:85%
WOW!

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:11.237 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT WAS A GREAT MOMENT FOR
WOMEN.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.371 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT?

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:15.007 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'D LIKE TO LINK THESE TWO
ISSUES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.246 align:start position:0% line:91%
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT-- IRAN AND
PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

&gt;&gt; Larry: I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:30.189 align:start position:0% line:91%
LINK TWO ISSUES ( BLEEP ) AND
YOUR AGENDA.

CARLY, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GET
BEHIND YOU.

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:41.667 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU DID SAY YOU WANTED YOUR
SECRET SERVICE CODE NAME TO BE

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.535 align:start position:0% line:85%
SECRETARIAT.

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:43.769 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT?

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:45.805 line:91%
I ASSUMED YOU'D TAKE US TO THE
FINISH LINE, BUT IT APPEARS YOUR

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:49.508 line:91%
FINISH LINE IS TO GET RID OF
PLANNED PARENTHOOD, AND WHAT IS

00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:50.609 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOUR REASONING?

00:06:50.642 --> 00:06:54.914 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DARE HILLARY CLINTON,
BARACK OBAMA, TO WATCH THESE

00:06:54.947 --> 00:07:01.654 line:91%
TAPES, WATCH A FULLY FORMED
FETUS ON THE TABLE, ITS HEART

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:04.523 line:91%
BEATING, ITS LEGS KICKING WHILE
SOMEONE SAYS, "WE HAVE TO KEEP

00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:08.627 line:85%
IT ALIVE TO HARVEST ITS BRAIN."

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.698 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I'LL TELL YOU, THAT
STATEMENT IS BOTH HORRIFIC AND

00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:15.534 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHOCKING, NOT JUST BECAUSE OF
THE DETAILS BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMS

00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:17.436 align:start position:0% line:85%
TO BE UNTRUE.

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:19.839 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE IS ACTUALLY A SHORT
PORTION OF ONE OF THE VIDEOTAPES

00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:27.413 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT DOES SHOW A FETUS, LOOKS
KIND OF LIKE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:28.681 align:start position:0% line:85%
ON.

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:32.218 line:91%
BUT IT IS EDITED IN AND NO PROOF
OR ANY WAY TO ASCERTAIN THIS HAD

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:34.920 align:start position:0% line:91%
ANYTHING TO DO WITH PLANNED
PARENTHOOD.

00:07:34.953 --> 00:07:37.823 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: LOOK, WORD TO
REPUBLICANS -- STOP BULLYING

00:07:37.856 --> 00:07:38.891 align:start position:0% line:85%
PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

00:07:38.924 --> 00:07:48.534 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
PLANNED PARENTHOOD PROVIDES

00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:50.102 align:start position:0% line:91%
SERVICES FOR MILLIONS OF WOMEN
WHO NEED THEM.

00:07:50.135 --> 00:07:51.804 size:75% position:38% line:85%
IT'S NOT JUST ABORTIONS.

00:07:51.837 --> 00:07:56.008 align:start position:0% line:91%
YES, ABORTIONS ARE A VERY
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE, BUT ONLY 3%

00:07:56.041 --> 00:07:59.345 line:91%
OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S SERVICES
ARE ABORTIONS AND 0% OF FEDERAL

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:00.579 align:start position:0% line:85%
FUNDING PAYS FOR THEM.

00:08:00.612 --> 00:08:04.416 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO DEFUNDING THEM STOPS VERY FEW
ABORTIONS BUT IT STOPS A

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:07.353 align:start position:0% line:91%
RIDICULOUSLY LARGE NUMBER OF
EVERYDAY WOMEN'S HEALTH

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:14.126 align:start position:0% line:85%
SERVICES.

00:08:14.159 --> 00:08:17.329 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I MEAN, THE MEDIA DECLARED CARLY

00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:18.463 line:85%
FIORINA THE WINNER LAST NIGHT.

00:08:18.497 --> 00:08:22.935 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THE IRONY IS THAT THE ONE
WOMAN WHO WON MAY MAKE IT

00:08:22.968 --> 00:08:25.301 align:start position:0% line:91%
POSSIBLE FOR A LOT OF WOMEN TO
LOSE.
