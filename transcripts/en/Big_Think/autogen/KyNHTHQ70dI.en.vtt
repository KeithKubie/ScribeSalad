that everybody was facing with atomic

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130
that everybody was facing with atomic
 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.890
that everybody was facing with atomic
clocks was that the atoms were moving at

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900
clocks was that the atoms were moving at
 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.960
clocks was that the atoms were moving at
approximately the speed of sound and it

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970
approximately the speed of sound and it
 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.220
approximately the speed of sound and it
wasn't so easy to measure the ticking

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230
wasn't so easy to measure the ticking
 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.620
wasn't so easy to measure the ticking
frequency so we said let's cool them

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630
frequency so we said let's cool them
 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.800
frequency so we said let's cool them
down using lasers so they're going more

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810
down using lasers so they're going more
 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.809
down using lasers so they're going more
slowly and that'll make it easier to

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819
slowly and that'll make it easier to
 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.400
slowly and that'll make it easier to
measure the ticking frequency and you

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410
measure the ticking frequency and you
 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.440
measure the ticking frequency and you
can make better clocks when I started

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.890
physical activity for me involved doing
things that that related to science

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900
things that that related to science
 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.290
things that that related to science
looking at stuff being Karia curious

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300
looking at stuff being Karia curious
 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.730
looking at stuff being Karia curious
about the natural world

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740
 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.529
that's a really interesting question and

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539
that's a really interesting question and
 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.980
that's a really interesting question and
sadly the answer isn't simple the simple

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990
sadly the answer isn't simple the simple
 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.200
sadly the answer isn't simple the simple
answer is no but now I've got to explain

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210
answer is no but now I've got to explain
 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.240
answer is no but now I've got to explain
wha here I'm saying that the answer is

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250
wha here I'm saying that the answer is
 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.529
wha here I'm saying that the answer is
no the answer is that every process for

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539
no the answer is that every process for
 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.430
no the answer is that every process for
cooling either also introduces the

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440
cooling either also introduces the
 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.540
cooling either also introduces the
possibility that you can introduce some

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550
possibility that you can introduce some
 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.310
possibility that you can introduce some
extra energy into the system you see

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320
extra energy into the system you see
 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.159
extra energy into the system you see
cooling means taking energy out and

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169
cooling means taking energy out and
 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.840
cooling means taking energy out and
heating means putting energy in but in

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850
heating means putting energy in but in
 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.089
heating means putting energy in but in
order to take energy out then it turns

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099
order to take energy out then it turns
 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.029
order to take energy out then it turns
out that you open the door for energy to

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039
out that you open the door for energy to
 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.370
out that you open the door for energy to
go in take laser cooling laser cooling

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380
go in take laser cooling laser cooling
 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.499
go in take laser cooling laser cooling
takes the energy out by having an atom

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509
takes the energy out by having an atom
 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.600
takes the energy out by having an atom
coming along and then a photon hits the

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610
coming along and then a photon hits the
 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.900
coming along and then a photon hits the
atom and slows the atom down but then

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910
atom and slows the atom down but then
 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.029
atom and slows the atom down but then
that photon has to go someplace and when

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039
that photon has to go someplace and when
 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.969
that photon has to go someplace and when
that photon is shot out by the atom the

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979
that photon is shot out by the atom the
 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.939
that photon is shot out by the atom the
atom recoils and more energy goes in so

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949
atom recoils and more energy goes in so
 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:27.650
atom recoils and more energy goes in so
there's a balance between the cooling

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660
there's a balance between the cooling
 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.770
there's a balance between the cooling
the heating and you can try to make that

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780
the heating and you can try to make that
 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.540
the heating and you can try to make that
balance work more and more in your favor

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550
balance work more and more in your favor
 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.430
balance work more and more in your favor
but you can never make it work a hundred

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440
but you can never make it work a hundred
 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.649
but you can never make it work a hundred
percent cooling and no heating so that's

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659
percent cooling and no heating so that's
 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.330
percent cooling and no heating so that's
one of the reasons why you don't expect

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340
one of the reasons why you don't expect
 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.659
one of the reasons why you don't expect
to ever get to absolute zero on the

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669
to ever get to absolute zero on the
 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.460
to ever get to absolute zero on the
other hand what does it mean to be at

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470
other hand what does it mean to be at
 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.200
other hand what does it mean to be at
Absolute Zero it means that all the

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210
Absolute Zero it means that all the
 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.310
Absolute Zero it means that all the
thermal motion stops well I can take one

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320
thermal motion stops well I can take one
 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.779
thermal motion stops well I can take one
atom and I can take as much energy out

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789
atom and I can take as much energy out
 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.830
atom and I can take as much energy out
of it as possible so that it's in what

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840
of it as possible so that it's in what
 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.240
of it as possible so that it's in what
we would call the ground state the

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250
we would call the ground state the
 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.760
we would call the ground state the
lowest possible state of energy is it

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770
lowest possible state of energy is it
 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.120
lowest possible state of energy is it
absolute zero not really because in

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130
absolute zero not really because in
 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.560
absolute zero not really because in
order to be at Absolute Zero I really

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570
order to be at Absolute Zero I really
 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.969
order to be at Absolute Zero I really
have to have a whole bundle of things I

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979
have to have a whole bundle of things I
 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.680
have to have a whole bundle of things I
can't really talk easily about the

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690
can't really talk easily about the
 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.540
can't really talk easily about the
temperature of a single object

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550
temperature of a single object
 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.670
temperature of a single object
I should really talk about a whole

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680
I should really talk about a whole
 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.370
I should really talk about a whole
ensemble and if I do that with a whole

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380
ensemble and if I do that with a whole
 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.499
ensemble and if I do that with a whole
bunch of atoms what's gonna happen is

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509
bunch of atoms what's gonna happen is
 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.260
bunch of atoms what's gonna happen is
maybe if I'm lucky maybe 99% of them are

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270
maybe if I'm lucky maybe 99% of them are
 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.029
maybe if I'm lucky maybe 99% of them are
gonna be in the ground state and then 1%

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039
gonna be in the ground state and then 1%
 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.360
gonna be in the ground state and then 1%
isn't so it's not absolute zero I can't

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370
isn't so it's not absolute zero I can't
 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.310
isn't so it's not absolute zero I can't
come up with any procedure that is gonna

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320
come up with any procedure that is gonna
 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.560
come up with any procedure that is gonna
say a hundred percent of the time this

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570
say a hundred percent of the time this
 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.510
say a hundred percent of the time this
atoms gonna end up in the ground state

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520
atoms gonna end up in the ground state
 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.310
atoms gonna end up in the ground state
and that's what I would need to be able

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320
and that's what I would need to be able
 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.290
and that's what I would need to be able
to claim that I'd really got into

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300
to claim that I'd really got into
 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.749
to claim that I'd really got into
absolute zero but on the other hand I

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759
absolute zero but on the other hand I
 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:41.570
absolute zero but on the other hand I
can get so close to absolute zero that

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580
can get so close to absolute zero that
 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.150
can get so close to absolute zero that
for many experiments

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160
for many experiments
 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.640
for many experiments
it's basically absolute zero for all

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650
it's basically absolute zero for all
 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.890
it's basically absolute zero for all
practical purposes but not for all

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900
practical purposes but not for all
 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.900
practical purposes but not for all
experiments and we're constantly working

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910
experiments and we're constantly working
 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.030
experiments and we're constantly working
on trying to make things colder because

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040
on trying to make things colder because
 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.040
on trying to make things colder because
for some experiments it really matters

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050
for some experiments it really matters
 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.939
for some experiments it really matters
that we're not quite there

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:57.949
 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:00.100
well my reaction to hearing about the

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110
well my reaction to hearing about the
 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.409
well my reaction to hearing about the
Nobel Prize was one of shock and

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:05.419
Nobel Prize was one of shock and
 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:09.369
Nobel Prize was one of shock and
disbelief in fact I can remember very

00:07:09.369 --> 00:07:09.379
disbelief in fact I can remember very
 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:11.439
disbelief in fact I can remember very
very well when this happened I was

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:11.449
very well when this happened I was
 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:13.059
very well when this happened I was
attending a meeting in California

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:13.069
attending a meeting in California
 

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:14.619
attending a meeting in California
meeting of the American Physical Society

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:14.629
meeting of the American Physical Society
 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:16.420
meeting of the American Physical Society
and the optical Society of America

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430
and the optical Society of America
 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.390
and the optical Society of America
meeting jointly out in California in

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400
meeting jointly out in California in
 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.589
meeting jointly out in California in
Long Beach California

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:20.599
Long Beach California
 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:24.129
Long Beach California
and the day before the prizes were

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:24.139
and the day before the prizes were
 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:26.379
and the day before the prizes were
announced a number of us were sitting

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:26.389
announced a number of us were sitting
 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:28.269
announced a number of us were sitting
around after the scientific sessions

00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:28.279
around after the scientific sessions
 

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:31.450
around after the scientific sessions
were over speculating about who was

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:31.460
were over speculating about who was
 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.860
were over speculating about who was
going to get the Nobel Prize that year

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:32.870
going to get the Nobel Prize that year
 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.670
going to get the Nobel Prize that year
and believe me nobody brought up my name

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680
and believe me nobody brought up my name
 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.769
and believe me nobody brought up my name
so later that night well it was the

00:07:38.769 --> 00:07:38.779
so later that night well it was the
 

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:41.589
so later that night well it was the
middle of the night that I got a call in

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599
middle of the night that I got a call in
 

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:44.670
middle of the night that I got a call in
my hotel room to the effect that I had

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680
my hotel room to the effect that I had
 

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.260
my hotel room to the effect that I had
shared the Nobel Prize with claude

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:47.270
shared the Nobel Prize with claude
 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.350
shared the Nobel Prize with claude
cohen-tannoudji and Steve Chu came as a

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:50.360
cohen-tannoudji and Steve Chu came as a
 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.420
cohen-tannoudji and Steve Chu came as a
complete shock

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:54.430
 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.920
my life changed dramatically it's very

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:58.930
my life changed dramatically it's very
 

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.620
my life changed dramatically it's very
difficult for me to keep up with all of

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:01.630
difficult for me to keep up with all of
 

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.040
difficult for me to keep up with all of
the invitations that I get to speak

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.050
the invitations that I get to speak
 

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:09.450
the invitations that I get to speak
about my work the size of my research

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:09.460
about my work the size of my research
 

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.580
about my work the size of my research
group has has grown that's made it

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:11.590
group has has grown that's made it
 

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.500
group has has grown that's made it
possible for me to be involved in more

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:13.510
possible for me to be involved in more
 

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.170
possible for me to be involved in more
and more new kinds of physics but it's

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:16.180
and more new kinds of physics but it's
 

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.879
and more new kinds of physics but it's
made it harder and harder for me to be

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:17.889
made it harder and harder for me to be
 

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:20.580
made it harder and harder for me to be
intimately familiar with all the things

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:20.590
intimately familiar with all the things
 

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.140

that are going on so there's a kind of a
 

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.770
that are going on so there's a kind of a
tension between the joy and doing lots

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:25.780
tension between the joy and doing lots
 

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.990
tension between the joy and doing lots
of new things and the desire to

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000
of new things and the desire to
 

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.620
of new things and the desire to
understand them better and better

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:30.630
understand them better and better
 

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.820

that certain ways of interpreting

00:10:14.809 --> 00:10:14.819
that certain ways of interpreting
 

00:10:14.819 --> 00:10:18.150
that certain ways of interpreting
certain scriptures have been made

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160
certain scriptures have been made
 

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.629
certain scriptures have been made
obsolete by science but that in no way

00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:20.639
obsolete by science but that in no way
 

00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:23.460
obsolete by science but that in no way
makes religious faith or belief in God

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:23.470
makes religious faith or belief in God
 

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.670
makes religious faith or belief in God
obsolete it just requires what I would

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:26.680
obsolete it just requires what I would
 

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.610

consider to be a different outlook a

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:29.620
consider to be a different outlook a
 

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.730
consider to be a different outlook a
maturation of religious faith but if we

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:32.740
maturation of religious faith but if we
 

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.499
maturation of religious faith but if we
look at the history of religious faith

00:10:34.499 --> 00:10:34.509
look at the history of religious faith
 

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:37.429
look at the history of religious faith
as told in the scriptures and as seen

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:37.439
as told in the scriptures and as seen
 

00:10:37.439 --> 00:10:40.259
as told in the scriptures and as seen
throughout history I think the entire

00:10:40.259 --> 00:10:40.269
throughout history I think the entire
 

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:43.679
throughout history I think the entire
history of faith has been one of a

00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:43.689
history of faith has been one of a
 

00:10:43.689 --> 00:10:47.040
history of faith has been one of a
maturation of that faith I see it not so

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.050
maturation of that faith I see it not so
 

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:50.400
maturation of that faith I see it not so
much as people becoming more mature in

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:50.410
much as people becoming more mature in
 

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.309
much as people becoming more mature in
their faith but God challenging people

00:10:53.309 --> 00:10:53.319
their faith but God challenging people
 

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:57.269
their faith but God challenging people
to become more mature to get a clear

00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279
to become more mature to get a clear
 

00:10:57.279 --> 00:11:00.199
to become more mature to get a clear
understanding of what God wants for

00:11:00.199 --> 00:11:00.209
understanding of what God wants for
 

00:11:00.209 --> 00:11:03.629
understanding of what God wants for
humankind and I think God is always

00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:03.639
humankind and I think God is always
 

00:11:03.639 --> 00:11:09.880
humankind and I think God is always
pushing us to be better than what we are

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:09.890
 

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.040
okay so there's two ways of answering

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.050
okay so there's two ways of answering
 

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.730
okay so there's two ways of answering
that question by and large science and

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:15.740
that question by and large science and
 

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.180
that question by and large science and
religion deal with different kinds of

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:19.190
religion deal with different kinds of
 

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.670
religion deal with different kinds of
questions science deals with questions

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680
questions science deals with questions
 

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.680
questions science deals with questions
about how do things come to be the way

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:23.690
about how do things come to be the way
 

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.319
about how do things come to be the way
they are how should I think about the

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:26.329
they are how should I think about the
 

00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:28.960
they are how should I think about the
way things are how shall I organize my

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:28.970
way things are how shall I organize my
 

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.090
way things are how shall I organize my
understanding of the way things behave

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:31.100
understanding of the way things behave
 

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.090
understanding of the way things behave
whereas religion deals with questions

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:34.100
whereas religion deals with questions
 

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.139
whereas religion deals with questions
like how should I behave toward my

00:11:38.139 --> 00:11:38.149
like how should I behave toward my
 

00:11:38.149 --> 00:11:41.079
like how should I behave toward my
fellow human creatures what should my

00:11:41.079 --> 00:11:41.089
fellow human creatures what should my
 

00:11:41.089 --> 00:11:43.630
fellow human creatures what should my
relationship be to God how should I

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:43.640
relationship be to God how should I
 

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.620
relationship be to God how should I
understand the ultimate origins of this

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:47.630
understand the ultimate origins of this
 

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.870
understand the ultimate origins of this
world in this universe in which we live

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880
world in this universe in which we live

these are very different kinds of

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:51.470
these are very different kinds of
 

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.639
these are very different kinds of
questions but sometimes the areas that

00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:54.649
questions but sometimes the areas that
 

00:11:54.649 --> 00:11:57.269
questions but sometimes the areas that
science addresses and the areas that

00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279
science addresses and the areas that
 

00:11:57.279 --> 00:12:00.250
science addresses and the areas that
religion addresses can overlap so I

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:00.260
religion addresses can overlap so I
 

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:05.530
religion addresses can overlap so I
don't ascribe to the idea of science and

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:05.540
don't ascribe to the idea of science and
 

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.910
don't ascribe to the idea of science and
religion as being non-overlapping

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920
religion as being non-overlapping
 

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.639
religion as being non-overlapping

magisteria as they've sometimes been
 

00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:14.170
magisteria as they've sometimes been
described but I also will say that by

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:14.180
described but I also will say that by
 

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.139
described but I also will say that by
and large they deal with different kinds

00:12:17.139 --> 00:12:17.149
and large they deal with different kinds
 

00:12:17.149 --> 00:12:19.569
and large they deal with different kinds
of questions but there are ethical

00:12:19.569 --> 00:12:19.579
of questions but there are ethical
 

00:12:19.579 --> 00:12:21.460
of questions but there are ethical
questions that might involve things like

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:21.470
questions that might involve things like
 

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.889
questions that might involve things like
medical ethics or environmental

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:23.899
medical ethics or environmental
 

00:12:23.899 --> 00:12:26.410

questions where you have to understand

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:26.420
questions where you have to understand
 

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.750
questions where you have to understand
the science in order to be able to make

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:28.760
the science in order to be able to make
 

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.449
the science in order to be able to make
good ethical decisions that are guided

00:12:31.449 --> 00:12:31.459
good ethical decisions that are guided
 

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:33.310
good ethical decisions that are guided
by your religious principles so there's

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.320
by your religious principles so there's
 

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.350
by your religious principles so there's
always going to be places where science

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360
always going to be places where science
 

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.389
always going to be places where science
and religion are going to come to bear

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:37.399
and religion are going to come to bear
 

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:44.130
and religion are going to come to bear
on the same kinds of

all the time in fact it's one of the

all the time in fact it's one of the
 

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.630
all the time in fact it's one of the
greatest things about being a scientist

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:48.640
greatest things about being a scientist
 

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.410
greatest things about being a scientist
is that you're continually surprised

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.420
is that you're continually surprised

are that we never understand the secrets

are that we never understand the secrets
that nature has to has to offer but

that nature has to has to offer but
 

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.190
that nature has to has to offer but
little by little we learn more and more

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200
little by little we learn more and more
 

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.170
little by little we learn more and more
but every time we go into the laboratory

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:07.180
but every time we go into the laboratory
 

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.090
but every time we go into the laboratory
we're surprised

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:09.100
we're surprised
 

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.860
we're surprised

where the basic principles as far as we

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:16.420
where the basic principles as far as we
 

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.810
where the basic principles as far as we
know the basic principles were pretty

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:18.820
know the basic principles were pretty
 

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.740

much understood in the 1930s maybe some

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:22.750
much understood in the 1930s maybe some
 

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.900

details were worked out in the 40s and

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:24.910
details were worked out in the 40s and
 

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.990
details were worked out in the 40s and
50s but we are still surprised every day

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000
50s but we are still surprised every day
 

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.720
50s but we are still surprised every day
by the results of these things so so in

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:30.730
by the results of these things so so in
 

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.790
by the results of these things so so in
spite of the fact that some people might

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800
spite of the fact that some people might
 

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.860
spite of the fact that some people might
say well there's nothing new we're

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:34.870
say well there's nothing new we're
 

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.290
say well there's nothing new we're
surprised every day and the the things

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:37.300
surprised every day and the the things
 

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.230
surprised every day and the the things
we learn were things that nobody

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240
we learn were things that nobody
 

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.370
we learn were things that nobody
imagined that things would work this way

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:41.380
imagined that things would work this way
 

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.920
imagined that things would work this way
so for example let's go back to this

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:42.930
so for example let's go back to this
 

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.180
so for example let's go back to this
example about laser cooling everybody

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:45.190
example about laser cooling everybody
 

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.120
example about laser cooling everybody
thought they understood how cold you

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.130
thought they understood how cold you
 

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.750
thought they understood how cold you
could get things using laser cooling and

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760
could get things using laser cooling and
 

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.400
could get things using laser cooling and
the problem was a simple enough problem

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:53.410
the problem was a simple enough problem
 

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.260
the problem was a simple enough problem
you can write down the proof and in a

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:55.270
you can write down the proof and in a
 

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.360
you can write down the proof and in a
few minutes as to how cold is possible

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:57.370
few minutes as to how cold is possible
 

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.830
few minutes as to how cold is possible
to get something and we got it

00:13:58.830 --> 00:13:58.840
to get something and we got it
 

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.770
to get something and we got it
eventually 200 times colder for for one

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:01.780
eventually 200 times colder for for one
 

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.390
eventually 200 times colder for for one
particular atom then the theory said was

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:03.400
particular atom then the theory said was
 

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.450
particular atom then the theory said was
possible why well because the situation

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:06.460
possible why well because the situation
 

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.470
possible why well because the situation
was a little bit more complicated

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480
was a little bit more complicated
 

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.070
was a little bit more complicated
remember I said that physicists like to

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:10.080
remember I said that physicists like to
 

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.630
remember I said that physicists like to
make a problem really simple that's the

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:12.640
make a problem really simple that's the
 

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.100
make a problem really simple that's the
physicists way of looking at a problem

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:14.110
physicists way of looking at a problem
 

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:17.010
physicists way of looking at a problem
well Einstein once said a problem should

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:17.020
well Einstein once said a problem should
 

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.840
well Einstein once said a problem should
be made as simple as possible but no

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:18.850
be made as simple as possible but no
 

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.270
be made as simple as possible but no
simpler and sometimes you make a mistake

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:21.280
simpler and sometimes you make a mistake
 

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.730
simpler and sometimes you make a mistake
and you leave out some really important

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:23.740
and you leave out some really important
 

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.700
and you leave out some really important
stuff usually when you do that it makes

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:26.710
stuff usually when you do that it makes
 

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.240
stuff usually when you do that it makes
things worse this was a case where

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:29.250
things worse this was a case where
 

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.040
things worse this was a case where
putting in the complications made things

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:32.050
putting in the complications made things
 

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.410
putting in the complications made things
work better nobody would have guessed

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:34.420
work better nobody would have guessed
 

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.550
work better nobody would have guessed
that that was gonna happen

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560
that that was gonna happen
 

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.190
that that was gonna happen
I can't imagine anybody sitting down and

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:38.200
I can't imagine anybody sitting down and
 

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.260
I can't imagine anybody sitting down and
thinking okay we're gonna figure out how

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:40.270
thinking okay we're gonna figure out how
 

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.080
thinking okay we're gonna figure out how
laser cooling works and coming up with

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:43.090
laser cooling works and coming up with
 

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.780
laser cooling works and coming up with
what actually happens we had to do the

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:45.790
what actually happens we had to do the
 

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.720
what actually happens we had to do the
experiments first nature showed us what

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:48.730
experiments first nature showed us what
 

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.700
experiments first nature showed us what
was what was gonna happen and then

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:50.710
was what was gonna happen and then
 

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.710
was what was gonna happen and then
clever people figured out what was

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720
clever people figured out what was
 

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.660
clever people figured out what was
really going on these kinds of surprises

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:54.670
really going on these kinds of surprises
 

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:55.879
really going on these kinds of surprises
happen to us

00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:55.889
happen to us
 

00:14:55.889 --> 00:14:58.249
happen to us
all the time
