00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
We started with an input to SAT,

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:07.020
and that is going to be a lean formula with n variables

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.740
and these are going to be as always x₁, x₂ and so on until you reach xn.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.400
And we are also going to specify the number of clauses

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.290
and I'm just going to use the letter m here

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.200
so we're going to say we have m clauses

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.100
and I'm also going to give them names

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.320
so I'm going to call them C₁, C₂ and so on until you reach Cm.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.210
We're now going to construct a graph that represents or encodes this Boolean Formula here

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.120
and we are going to do this just as we have done before.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.730
So, this part here is going to represent X₁.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.720
This part over here is going to represent X₂ and so on and this one here Xn.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.320
Now, the question of course is how long these parts for each X need to be,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.660
and that depends on the number of clauses

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.150
because we're going to attach clauses to the variables here.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.340
In order to make this safe, we should construct this part

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.790
so that we have m of these edge crossings here

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.590
because then we know that for each clause we have an edge

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.610
where we can attach that clause to.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.010
Now, if we have m of these crossings here

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.770
this means that we have m+1 of these groups of three vertices here

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.070
so we have 3(m+1) vertices in this part here

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.400
and then we have one more vertex here, one more vertex here

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.090
so +2 if we extended like this, and this holds true for all of the other parts here as well.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.320
Now, for each clause but of course also going to add a vertex like so

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.090
and again this vertex here is going to represent clause 1

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.940
this vertex here is going to represent clause 2 and so until we get to clause m.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.640
My first question for you is

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.770
how many vertices are we using to represent the variables

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.460
so to represent x₁, x₂ and so on until we get to xn

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.550
and I would like you to enter this as four numbers

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.950
and so it's going to be some number times n plus some number times m

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.520
plus some number times mn plus possibly some constant.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.280
Please give me these four numbers here

00:02:14.280 --> 99:59:59.000
to correctly count the number of vertices that we have here to represent variables.
