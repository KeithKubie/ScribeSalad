00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.070
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.670
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
And I

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.270
just checking in on you.
Just checking in to see how you're doing,

4
00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:18.200
man.
Shit,
by the way.
Um,

5
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.000
you know,
also checking and specifically if they can fucking still hear me.

6
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:27.740
Anybody who stuck around in North Carolina,
Virginia,
wherever else,
the Carolinas,

7
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.450
the CAC and lackeys.

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.360
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.570
<v 2>I had fucking going anywhere.
God Damn.
And I got a fucking fast boat.
All right.</v>

10
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.741
Oh,

11
00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:40.741
that term I took the fucking camper off the back of my camper special.

12
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:45.670
I welded it to my fucking bass boat.
I am good to go

13
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.740
<v 1>to see your fucking gator come along my way.
All right.</v>

14
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:53.280
I have a feast and a new pair of fucking shoes,
water moccasin.

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.330
I'll make you into a fucking belt.
Bring it on,
Mother Nature.

16
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.260
You fucking bitch.
Um,
that's what a lot of people,

17
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.340
that's what a lot of people think.

18
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.580
People who are not leaving despite all of the warnings are thinking that's what

19
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:13.350
they think is going on,
right?

20
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.640
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.870
<v 2>I put on a pair of fucking snow shoes and I walked right across the fucking</v>

22
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.800
class.
Oh,
they're spinning.
I don't give a shit.
I drink moonshine.

23
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:25.860
Spinning is my natural state mother fucker.

24
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.530
<v 1>Well,
nature coming over here like some sort of fucking ex wife,</v>

25
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.340
one more fucking money.
Um,
a lot of people think that that's what's going on,

26
00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:37.001
but uh,
you know,

27
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:40.630
people don't understand that what the bankers did in the two thousands is still

28
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.501
affecting people.

29
00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:44.950
And there's a lot of people who are still upside down in a house that's never

30
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:47.890
going to be worth more than what they're,
what they owe.

31
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.210
The American dream is over for these people.
And when you're in that situation,

32
00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:53.020
you know,
Eh,

33
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.710
that leads to driving a piece of shit car at least to a whole bunch of shit.

34
00:01:56.711 --> 00:01:58.450
You don't have health insurance and all of that.

35
00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:01.720
So now you're supposed to get into your fucking,
you know,

36
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.220
questionable car and just drive a state away with no fucking money.

37
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.120
You know,
you got kids,
you've got all of this shit.
What are you going to do?

38
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.340
Nine on the other side.
People go,
oh,
well you,
you know,
you,
you lease,

39
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.320
you be alive.

40
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.790
You know what I would do now that I'm driving dry and safe,

41
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:23.090
I would just drive to a waffle house and I would sit in the parking lot.

42
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.780
You know what would happen?
The security guard at the waffle house,

43
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.120
there's no security.
There's no security.

44
00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:33.650
They just have a fear of a bat phone to the cops at the waffle house.

45
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.190
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

46
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.821
<v 1>the waffle house.</v>

47
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:39.240
They have got to have the most fucking altercations at any just,
I mean,

48
00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:44.070
it's just such a wonderful place.
You go in there to get this delicious,

49
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:46.890
unhealthy fucking food that just,
it's comfort food.

50
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.860
You know what happens every,
I swear to God,
I don't care who the fuck you are.

51
00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:56.670
Black,
white,
male,
female,
Asian,
fucking Anda Ron deck.

52
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.370
You go in there,
you're,
you're,
you're fucking going to get into a fight.

53
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.870
You're going to see a fight.

54
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:04.840
You're going to have to pick up your fucking waffles and move it out of the way

55
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.890
is somebody slams down on your table like you're in some sort of fucking saloon

56
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.330
in the 18 hundreds.

57
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.490
And you're telling me these people in North Capitol are supposed to drive to

58
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:19.380
that fucking parking lot?
Well,
Bill,

59
00:03:19.381 --> 00:03:22.430
don't you think that's better than trying to wait it out in a hurricane?
I Dunno,

60
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.340
Dude.
I've never had to do that.
You know,

61
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:28.260
fortunately I'm not in that financial fucking position,
but um,

62
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.731
you know,

63
00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:32.260
I just don't understand how these fucking bank has got away with that too.

64
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.460
I understand how they did it and then doing it again with these luxury high rise

65
00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:37.860
apartment buildings that they're fucking building everywhere.

66
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.960
What kind of a fucking jerk off rents?
A luxury high rise apartment building.

67
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.860
Okay.
Don't do that by a piece of Shit House.
Okay.

68
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.480
At least at the end of living there,

69
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.850
you can sell it and get some of your money back.

70
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.510
You may or may not make a profit,
but I'm just saying,

71
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.630
<v 0>yeah,</v>

72
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.240
<v 1>you know,
all you Instagrammers.
You know,</v>

73
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:00.940
what's really interesting that I didn't realize,
uh,

74
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:04.180
do you know old millennials are,
everybody is looking and like myself included,

75
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:06.400
you look at college kids,
he's fucking millennials.
They,

76
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.500
they can't do anything for themselves.
They're not millennials.
All right?

77
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:15.490
Millennials,
the first millennials,
you know what year they were born?
1980.

78
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.270
Okay.
To 19,
I think 95.

79
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.140
So millennials right now or 22 to 38.

80
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.790
And I imagine this a mother uninformed shit heads like me out there who are 38

81
00:04:28.791 --> 00:04:33.200
years old and talking about people who are 18 calling them fucking millennials

82
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.760
when they are not millennials,

83
00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:39.260
but the person is saying it is actually a fucking millennial.
All right,

84
00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:42.830
people now you,
you gotta know what generation you're talking about.

85
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.700
Like,
you know,
it's funny,
I'm actually generation x,

86
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.740
so I was after the baby boomers and that ended in like,
I dunno,

87
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.880
63 or 64 or something like that.

88
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.960
And then generation x went up to 1979.

89
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.570
And what's funny is I did not,
I did,
I,

90
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.770
I don't identify as Gen x.
Know,
generation x to me was,
uh,

91
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.300
the Seattle music scene.
That's when I started fucking here in it.
Um,

92
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.560
I don't think in that,
but I didn't think the baby boomers were like,
hey man,

93
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.830
we got to get out of Vietnam,
man.

94
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.680
Fucking baby killer man.
Right.

95
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.320
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

96
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.320
<v 1>I feel like this should be a generation between baby boomers and generation x.</v>

97
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.870
You know,
that generation that like Ronnie James Dio,

98
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.940
you know,
but you know,
didn't listen to the Mamas and the Papas.

99
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.563
All the leads are

100
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.660
proudly supra and the sky is gray.
Like that shit.

101
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.500
Um,
I like to watch your Mama Cat's dance.

102
00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:57.220
She had a fucking cool little two step she used to do.
Um,

103
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.250
anyways,
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about right now.
I'm just saying,

104
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:03.620
you know,
uh,
good luck to all of those people.

105
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:06.290
I'm coming there next week if it's not under fucking water.

106
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:09.650
I really hope it isn't.
And uh,

107
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.160
you know,
I dunno this,
it's crazy.
This is just fucking crazy.

108
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.320
I know we always had hurricanes and stuff,
but like,

109
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.440
I just hope they're not going to keep getting worse.
And the,

110
00:06:20.441 --> 00:06:23.140
the sheer amount of them,
um,

111
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.960
you know,
I,
there's nothing worse than watching people lose everything,
right?
Um,

112
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.940
if only there was a way to fix this,

113
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.130
mother nature is trying right now,

114
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.190
trying with the only the quickest swiftest fucking solution that's literally,

115
00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:48.400
you know,
metaphorically what she's doing right now going,

116
00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:52.090
I see what the problem is.
I need to drown some of these mother fuckers.

117
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.890
I need to drown a certain amount of them.
Right?
But she's going to have,

118
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.110
the scary thing is she's going to have to do way better than what she's doing

119
00:06:59.111 --> 00:07:01.810
right now because we always worn everybody out.

120
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.900
<v 4>Oh God.
Right.</v>

121
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.640
<v 1>The storms come in and everybody gets the fuck out of dodge.</v>

122
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.590
So Mother Nature has gotta be walking around just shaking her head after every

123
00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:12.960
one of these things going on.
I'm telling you,
I don't know.

124
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.390
It doesn't make any fucking sense.
She's like,
Mr Pink.
You know,

125
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.260
tell me we've got a fucking rat.
Okay.
When those alarms go off,

126
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.800
you've got 15 minutes.
I'm telling.
Go to the cops.
They were just there,
man.

127
00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:27.400
They were just there already.
All loaded for bear.

128
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.270
I know Emma.
Right?
I'm fucking positive.
You're like,

129
00:07:31.271 --> 00:07:35.050
I gotta to watch that movie again.
Um,
yeah.

130
00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:39.790
Mother Nature has gotta be we gotta fucking rat in the house.
Okay.
So who's,
uh,

131
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.640
who's Tim Roth?
Terentino's.
Mr. Brown.
Like Mr Shit.

132
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.990
Mr Pink,
Mister Blonde.
Mr. White.

133
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.140
Mr Orange.
Yeah.

134
00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:56.890
She has to find out who are Mr oranges and our Misto Orange is the fucking

135
00:07:56.891 --> 00:07:57.724
weather channel.

136
00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.723
<v 3>You know,</v>

137
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.950
<v 1>she's got to come in there.
So you like to tell jokes?
Huh?</v>

138
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.420
Giggling like a bunch of girls at the school yard.
Well,
I got a job for you.

139
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.173

143
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.110
I'm in like the fucking best shape I've been in,
in,

144
00:08:22.111 --> 00:08:25.060
in years and uh,

145
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.820
it is fucking unbelievable.
I know.
People always told me Diet,
it's,

146
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.710
it's 90% died.
95,
85%,
70% die.
Dude.
It's,

147
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.710
it's all diet.
It's all die.

148
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:43.730
Because like if you can go kick the shit out of yourself and a Goddamn gym,

149
00:08:44.611 --> 00:08:48.330
jump on a fucking elliptical,
you jump on an elliptical for an hour.

150
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.520
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

151
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.440
<v 1>Burns 600 calories according to that fucking computer,</v>

152
00:08:53.441 --> 00:08:57.240
which how the fuck it knows how much burning versus somebody else.

153
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.330
You know what happened?
It's an incident estimate.
So you,

154
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.310
you've sweat all over the fucking thing.

155
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.540
You don't wipe it off because you're a selfish cunt.
You go walking out of there,

156
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:08.400
right.
And then later on that night,

157
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:13.430
all you got to have like three and a half for Oreo cookies and you just negated

158
00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:15.024
that workout,

159
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.940
done all of that fucking work out the window and you can,

160
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:25.050
you can fucking do this.
And I got a minute and a half.
You know what it's like.

161
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:26.390
It's like every year when we are,

162
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.410
whenever we put out these seasons at f is for family.

163
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.530
It takes us like fucking 14 months to finish them.
And then people just not,

164
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.130
not saying,
you know,
that's how kids watching,

165
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.970
not saying I don't want you to do it.
I'm just saying.

166
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.970
Then they just come back like,
hey man,
like when's the next season coming?

167
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.720
Same thing,
same thing.
Um,

168
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.640
<v 0>yeah,</v>

169
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.470
<v 1>I got went out.
I,
I'm actually like,
uh,</v>

170
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:56.500
I am off sugar and salt to the point I asked my wife to go out and get some

171
00:09:57.881 --> 00:10:00.820
almond butter and she got it and I already knew there was something going on

172
00:10:00.821 --> 00:10:03.190
with it where it says you didn't have to stir this shit.
And I'm like,

173
00:10:03.191 --> 00:10:05.680
this doesn't sound like the not just doesn't feel like the natural shit.

174
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.660
So I put it in this smoothie,
two tablespoons of this shit and I meet,

175
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.350
I say let's just fucking sugar in this.

176
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.220
And after like for like five weeks I've been eaten like this.

177
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.590
Like it literally almost made my,
my fucking,

178
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.810
I made like a like a bit into a lemon like Jesus Christ and I never noticed that

179
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.131
beforehand.

180
00:10:24.131 --> 00:10:29.131
So if you're old like me and you want to regain some of your old glory,

181
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.480
you want to drive down the street with the hair is slicked back.

182
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.130
Do you want to put the top down?

183
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.200
You want to tell these bitches what time it is.
Um,
it's all about diet.

184
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.750
Your abs are there,
man.
If you didn't have any,
I don't have abs.
Yes you do.

185
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:50.610
If you didn't have abs,
you could not sit up in bed.

186
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:52.460
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

187
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.780
<v 1>You know,
you couldn't even roll out of bed.</v>

188
00:10:53.781 --> 00:10:58.010
You need your obliques could not roll out of bed to go downstairs and eat a

189
00:10:58.011 --> 00:11:00.890
chocolate chip muffin or whatever other stupid thing that you're going to do

190
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.650
that's gonna make you break a blood vessel.
When you fucking sit down,
you know,

191
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.290
let's sit down that you do,
when you get really out of shape,
where you,
you lose,

192
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.700
you use your leg muscles,

193
00:11:10.701 --> 00:11:13.700
and at some point it just becomes a free fall into the couch.

194
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.820
You'd give yourself whiplash and you fucking head hits the table that your wife

195
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.750
just had to have.
That was just a little bit higher than the couch.

196
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.880
He put them out.
Fuck right.
And then immediately

197
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.230
<v 2>what happened,
honey?
Wait,
what the fuck?
A table here.</v>

198
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.480
<v 0>Okay.</v>

199
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.350
<v 2>Oh,
I thought it look nice.
And now you're in a fight.</v>

200
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.100
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

201
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:39.670
<v 1>right.</v>

202
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.060
And now you going to work telling your friends that you're not getting along

203
00:11:43.061 --> 00:11:44.830
with your wife and what a fucking bitch she is.

204
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.880
And all of this type of shit and when it really comes down to is you're just,

205
00:11:48.881 --> 00:11:52.440
you're not eating right.
You're not eating right.
See little,

206
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.790
you have to do a trust.
Fall into your fucking couch.

207
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.570
You get a fucking mild concussion on the [inaudible]

208
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:03.830
<v 2>giant and table that she just had the hat just had to have it.</v>

209
00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:04.890
And it's slack

210
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:08.640
<v 1>for what I'm loving yet.
And southern accent lately,</v>

211
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.980
I kind of disguises that.
It's actually my own ignorance saying it.
Oh No,

212
00:12:13.981 --> 00:12:17.340
I was just doing a character.
I was just doing a character.

213
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:18.853
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

214
00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:22.460
<v 2>Well,
they got a woman doing play by play it in a fail.</v>

215
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:23.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

216
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.470
<v 2>Oh my God,
you got a big kid then we're nobody's women.</v>

217
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.340
They don't even sport.
Oh,
they do.
Than what a fucker.

218
00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:36.410
Only eight people at a w NBA game.
You explain that to me.

219
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:37.840
<v 0>Okay.</v>

220
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.020
<v 2>So women on the car.</v>

221
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:40.270
<v 0>Okay,</v>

222
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.680
<v 2>why aren't the feminists are,</v>

223
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.400
why aren't these feminists out there to fucking at the Goddamn,

224
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.420
uh,
whatever they're called?
Oklahoma Twat game.

225
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:55.000
Well,

226
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.590
why don't you watch an episode of the real housewives maybe figure out that's

227
00:12:58.591 --> 00:13:00.120
why they don't show up.
Shit.

228
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:01.370
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

229
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.540
<v 2>Maybe they're three minutes.
It'd be fucking London over a goddamn table.</v>

230
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:08.980
They ain't give me no camera,
man.
They're not enough camera man.

231
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.550
<v 1>Break it up.
Um,</v>

232
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.310
I went down a Randy Newman,
a rabbit hole the other night.
Jesus Christ.

233
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:20.890
That guy's talented.
Huh?
And one that's,

234
00:13:20.891 --> 00:13:25.260
I'm old enough to remember when that song.
Yeah,
show up.
People got no reason.

235
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.830
Shore people got no reason.

236
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.330
Shore people got no reason to live.

237
00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.580
And that came out in all these short people got mad and he was,

238
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:41.320
he was making fun of racism.
The ridiculousness of racism,
right?

239
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.690
It got a little cars go beep,
beep beep.

240
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.580
They got Little Voices Go pee,
Pee,

241
00:13:48.581 --> 00:13:52.720
pee grubby little hands,
dirty little mug.

242
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:59.160
And people once again took it at face value.
But you know,
having said that,

243
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:03.930
that song came out and then there was a bunch of people that didn't get what it

244
00:14:03.931 --> 00:14:08.400
was about and they were singing it to short people.
So I dunno,

245
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.520
it was so brilliant on so many different levels.
And I love his voice.

246
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.700
I love the piano he plays and he's done all these,

247
00:14:14.701 --> 00:14:16.920
all these great songs from movies and stuff like that.

248
00:14:16.921 --> 00:14:20.700
And I actually looked up to see if he was a touring anywhere.

249
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.930
Um,
there's some really great footage of them to actually with that short people

250
00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:28.200
think where he's in the studio,
like an incredible credible sense of humor,

251
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.090
you know,
as most,
you know,

252
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.780
geniuses that I've seen always self deprecating in that type of stuff.

253
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.040
Um,
it's really funny how that is,
you know,

254
00:14:41.041 --> 00:14:44.700
people who stick just walk around like,
like they're fucking astronauts.

255
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.270
Just supreme confidence,
you know,
always thinking they killed,

256
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.970
let's just,
no fucking clue where it's just like,

257
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.860
it's just one of those fucking things,
you know?
I don't know.

258
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.450
That's always a red flag to me when someone's walking around.

259
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.830
Maybe that's my own fucking thing.
Maybe that's the Boston thing,

260
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:12.200
like easy,
the Ikea,
don't forget where you came from.
Fucking relax.
Easy.

261
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.140
They're Travolta.
Um,

262
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.350
anyways.
Uh,

263
00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:20.260
<v 3>okay.</v>

264
00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.290
<v 5>What else?
What else is there to talk about?
I've just been,
yeah,
I was,</v>

265
00:15:23.291 --> 00:15:26.410
you know what?
It was fucking amazing.
I was watching this episode last night,

266
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.590
Sunset Strip and they showed the Coanda pass,

267
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:35.790
which is where the one on one goes from a Hollywood into the valley.

268
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.240
<v 3>And um,</v>

269
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:43.240
<v 5>there's this old bridge and they were showing like footage of it from the 1950s</v>

270
00:15:43.241 --> 00:15:47.260
and I'd seen this before at a car dealership that had all these old pictures of

271
00:15:47.261 --> 00:15:47.830
Hollywood.

272
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:51.730
And you see on the one on one between the one on one north and one on one on one

273
00:15:51.731 --> 00:15:56.731
south at the Coanda passes in between the railroad tracks that no longer exist.

274
00:15:58.971 --> 00:15:59.870
And it's always like,
you know,

275
00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.840
<v 1>they used it.
They,
the city,
believe it or not,
from what you know,</v>

276
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.890
the tree huggers saved me on,
had one of the greatest,
uh,

277
00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.990
public transportations of any city.

278
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:16.220
And the conspiracy theory is that the oil company companies and a Goodyear tire

279
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.980
created a corporation.
And they bought up all the street cars,

280
00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:25.620
all the trains and all the trolleys and all that type of shit.

281
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.490
A bought it up and just ripped up all the tracks,

282
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.820
paved over everything and forcing people to all have to drive.

283
00:16:34.831 --> 00:16:36.150
So then they like,
they will,

284
00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:40.560
they would make so much fucking money that they could buy a business as big as

285
00:16:40.561 --> 00:16:45.510
that with trains who can afford to throw out of one fucking train,

286
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:51.420
forget about a whole city full of them.
Streetcars and trolleys and all that.

287
00:16:51.421 --> 00:16:54.690
Ripped up all the fucking tracks.
I mean,
I don't know what happened,

288
00:16:54.691 --> 00:16:59.100
but there's something happened cause it may,

289
00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:00.420
it makes no sense.

290
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.673
<v 3>You know,</v>

291
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.430
<v 1>streetcars were the best.
They know.</v>

292
00:17:08.431 --> 00:17:11.550
They still have them in like San Francisco.
And on talking about the stupid one,

293
00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:15.000
we'd go up the fucking hill like you were.
I mean,
those old school,

294
00:17:15.001 --> 00:17:16.620
the ones that I grew up seeing,

295
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.533
<v 3>mmm.</v>

296
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.130
<v 1>I don't know,
but they're actually there.
They're building a,</v>

297
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:25.730
they are building public transportation out here again.

298
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.940
So,
uh,
we shall see.
It's weird though,

299
00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:33.290
because everything then got built up like everybody had a car.
So,
uh,

300
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.940
like most buildings just to go from the sidewalk to the building is like you

301
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.380
have to go to Vegas and you're like,
oh,

302
00:17:39.381 --> 00:17:43.970
I'm going to walk across the street to this other casino.
And like fucking,

303
00:17:43.971 --> 00:17:48.870
you know,
15 minutes later you're on your hands and knees going like water,
water.

304
00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.570
Like it's like an illusion.
It looks like it's right there.

305
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:55.710
It's right across the street.
It is so fucking far away.
Um,

306
00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.540
I know the a,

307
00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:02.790
it's seizes what's hilarious is you can go from the Mirage to the,

308
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.740
uh,
to Caesars and they just have this moving air conditioned sidewalk,

309
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.690
you know,
and there's just all these fat,
sweaty people on it.
You know,

310
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.150
the thing should actually be moving in the opposite direction,

311
00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:18.360
should be a giant treadmill for these people and he should have to walk on it

312
00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:22.110
for 10 minutes,
then it shuts off and rolls the other way.
You should,
you should,

313
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:27.000
you should have to earn it,
you know?
Um,
they would just be too much,

314
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:30.060
too much liability.
Somebody has a heart attack,
somebody slips and falls.

315
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.190
So they don't,
they just conveyor belt,
you know,

316
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.780
like cattle off to slaughter Jesus bill.

317
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.370
Why can't it just be people who are just fat and happy and outgoing and you
know,

318
00:18:43.371 --> 00:18:47.870
wearing their favorite loud shirt to go play some craps.
You know what,
you know,

319
00:18:47.871 --> 00:18:49.940
I think you guys might have a point on this one.

320
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.063
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

321
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.580
<v 1>Um,
so anyways,
the first week of NFL has gone by.</v>

322
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:56.960
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

323
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.090
<v 1>Now you know what everybody's doing.</v>

324
00:18:58.091 --> 00:19:02.320
Everybody looks at week one and then they just say that's who these people are.

325
00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:07.340
The New York jets.
Are they the favorites in the AFC aged?

326
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:08.790
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

327
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.780
<v 1>they won one game.
Um,
I'll tell you the Patriot look good,</v>

328
00:19:12.781 --> 00:19:16.140
but all of a sudden a texted came back and made it really close.

329
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.560
If I was a Patriot fan,
I wouldn't be a good chat about that.

330
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.190
I don't know about you guys.
Don't you feel like there's about three weeks in?

331
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:24.690
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

332
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.830
<v 1>You know,
you can kind of start to tell like,
okay,
this,
this team is this,</v>

333
00:19:28.831 --> 00:19:30.690
this team is that.
And then there's,
you know,
injuries.

334
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:32.010
I don't know what the fuck's going to happen,

335
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.610
but I really don't think that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are going to put a 48

336
00:19:35.611 --> 00:19:40.590
points a week while letting up 40 or the saints going to let up 48.

337
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.990
I don't fucking know.
Right.

338
00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.670
Cincinnati you're going to go down by 20 every fucking week and then come

339
00:19:48.671 --> 00:19:50.920
roaring back and fucking waiting.
I don't know.
Maybe they will.

340
00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.050
Maybe this is what's going to happen.

341
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.673
<v 3>MMM.</v>

342
00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.690
<v 1>Tell you right now Cincinnati,
I mean,</v>

343
00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:02.280
if this is what we're going to be most exciting season.

344
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:05.603
<v 3>MMM.</v>

345
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.790
<v 1>Anyways,
so I am going to,
uh,</v>

346
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:11.800
I'm going to be in town this whole weekend because I have a,

347
00:20:11.801 --> 00:20:15.890
I have a bunch of big gigs coming up,
so I am touring like I used to tour,

348
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:22.060
so I have like one weekend off until like towards the end of October.

349
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:27.530
And um,
but this weekend obviously got moved to next weekend,

350
00:20:27.531 --> 00:20:32.060
which was my only weekend off.
So it Kinda worked out.
And,
um,

351
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:37.400
so my wife was going,
hey,
I got some stuff to do Saturday afternoon.

352
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.210
Do you mind?
You know,

353
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.740
hanging out with our daughter and blah,
blah,

It's like,

354
00:20:44.741 --> 00:20:46.580
why are you Yada him?
Of course I don't.

355
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.920
Of course we have to hang with my daughter and watch Lsu verse Auburn.

356
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.350
Are you kidding me?
This is a dream.

357
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.080
<v 2>So fucking dream.
Well,</v>

358
00:20:56.081 --> 00:21:00.460
I ain't going to be a dream to got a goddamn broad announcing the fucking game.

359
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.670
<v 1>Um,
it would still be a dream.
I don't give a shit.
Welcome ladies.</v>

360
00:21:08.671 --> 00:21:13.350
Welcome to the world of broadcasting.
Uh,
anyways,
uh,

361
00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.420
yeah,
I can't wait to my,
we took our daughter over to get some shots,

362
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:20.040
you know what I mean?
Like,
uh,

363
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.370
I decided to stop listening to Hollywood celebrities and actually listen to

364
00:21:23.371 --> 00:21:26.700
people in the medical field.
So my daughter is getting all the shots.

365
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.600
We stretched them out or whatever.
So she went there to get like her shot.

366
00:21:30.601 --> 00:21:35.280
So she's been there numerous times.
And um,

367
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:39.270
so now like she knows when we go in there that this is the place where she feels

368
00:21:39.271 --> 00:21:42.210
that needle and stuff.
So she's like on nurse,
she's like,
you know,

369
00:21:42.211 --> 00:21:45.750
when I used to bring my dog to the vet,
you know,
same thing.

370
00:21:45.751 --> 00:21:47.310
So I'm trying to make a laugh and stuff.

371
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:52.830
So we ended up going in there and the woman,
she's great,

372
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.370
she just real quick gets it done.
And um,

373
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:02.100
my daughter said her first three word sentence after she got the shot,

374
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.590
<v 5>like she was already crying when we laid back,
anticipating.</v>

375
00:22:04.591 --> 00:22:09.000
And then she got the shot and then she,
uh,
she let out this yell,
uh,

376
00:22:09.001 --> 00:22:11.850
just broke my heart and then she looked at the nurse and she just goes,
yeah,

377
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.470
<v 2>odd John,
bye bye.</v>

378
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.270
<v 5>Like it was so funny.</v>

379
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:23.470
<v 2>Fucking cute.
And it also like broke my heart all at the same time.</v>

380
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.840
I picked her up and she,
you know,
a little hand grabbing a handful,

381
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.010
<v 5>my shirt like Terry O'Reilly back in the day,</v>

382
00:22:30.011 --> 00:22:32.340
but she's trying to hug me and she just kept looking at the nurse.

383
00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.700
The nurse goes,
it's all okay.
That's it.
Yeah,
all done.

384
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:35.460
And she just kept [inaudible]

385
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.200
<v 2>go.
Bye Bye.
Bye Bye.</v>

386
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.590
<v 5>Let's just like,
it was like a kid going,</v>

387
00:22:45.591 --> 00:22:48.740
I don't you get the fuck away from me man.

388
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.080
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

389
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.340
<v 5>bye bye.
Like I can't,
I can't even,
I can't even recreate,</v>

390
00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:56.733
um,

391
00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:57.470
<v 0>okay.</v>

392
00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:01.430
<v 5>That moment.
And um,
it's so,
I was so glad that I was there as a dad,</v>

393
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:03.080
cause I gotta be honest with you.

394
00:23:03.081 --> 00:23:06.500
Like I would stay out in the waiting room because I could not handle,

395
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.940
I was hearing those babies crying then I was just like,
you know,
I,

396
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.980
I don't know that I could,
I can handle,
even if it's a good thing,

397
00:23:12.981 --> 00:23:17.720
watching somebody on any level hurting my kid and I know that they're doing it

398
00:23:17.721 --> 00:23:20.810
for the right thing,
but it was just like,
uh,
so I went in there.

399
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:23.703
<v 1>MMM.</v>

400
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:29.130
<v 5>And I,
I got through it and uh,
I'm glad I did.
I was glad that I did.</v>

401
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.330
And uh,

402
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.290
<v 1>it was,
oh my God,
it was so fucking cute.
It was so cute.
Oh,</v>

403
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.970
I'd done well.

404
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:44.400
<v 5>well,
I buy,
just kept saying it like,
like,
like I'm done with you.</v>

405
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.040
Get away from,
I don't want any more

406
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.280
<v 1>of this shit.
I just can't,
I can't like the emotion in her voice.</v>

407
00:23:49.281 --> 00:23:52.760
I just can't put it into fucking words for whatever reason.
Um,
anyway,

408
00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:57.070
so let's do some advertising here for the week.
My bookie,
everybody,

409
00:23:57.071 --> 00:24:01.390
I call them in every week,
or I call in a,
do they have a plan?

410
00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.210
I didn't know what the fuck it is.
I call him.
So God damn busy.
I know.

411
00:24:04.211 --> 00:24:07.150
I call it a couple of people.
I do my pics here.
All right.
My bookie,
you know,

412
00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.810
ever since I saw this podcast,

413
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:15.580
people have been asking me for advice.
Ask me what team to bet on.
The truth is,

414
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.450
I don't know.
I don't know.
It was going to win.
I don't know.
Shit.

415
00:24:19.451 --> 00:24:21.220
I can't even name half the quarterbacks in the league.

416
00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.580
I keep forgetting the name of the guy and the Texans who is fucking incredible.

417
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:29.830
Uh,
Watson,
Dante,
Derek,

418
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:35.050
deandre,
something,
one of those cool black ID names,
Watson.

419
00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.980
Uh,
but if you think,
you know,
you got to check out my bookie.

420
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.780
Remember who you remember.
Who you're betting on is just as,

421
00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.010
as important as who you,
who you're betting with.

And then we talked about the eagles.

everybody Hellickson.
There's nobody on the planet like you.

469
00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:46.250
So why would you buy a fucking generic mattress built for everyone else?

470
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:50.870
Next,
please mention all the talking points below.
Well I was Gunna,

00:27:50.871 --> 00:27:53.360
I'm going to show you.
I'm going to read it.

00:27:56.991 --> 00:27:57.680
your life.

475
00:28:01.311 --> 00:28:03.710
sleep preferences.
Just go to helix,

contouring to your body to provide unprecedented comfort and better sleep.

479
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:14.751
You know,

480
00:28:14.751 --> 00:28:17.870
when you lay on your side and your beer belly just digs into the mattress,

481
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:22.600
they'll pebble little concave spot there just for you and your belly,
right?
Uh,

482
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.710
you got a lot of chest hair and you sleep on your stomach.

483
00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.150
They even have a mattress for that.

484
00:28:26.151 --> 00:28:31.151
36% of Helen's helix sleep customers report better sleep after watching,

485
00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.580
switching to their customized mattress from helix sleep.

486
00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.540
Right now they're offering up to $145 on all mattresses,

487
00:28:38.541 --> 00:28:42.890

488
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.300
They've got the mattress that will fit just right.
I sleep on my back.

489
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:48.760
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

490
00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.810

like I'm in a coffin occasionally on the right shoulder,</v>

491
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.900
may be on the left.
Never on the stomach though.

492
00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:01.660
My back has been too fucked up to lay on my stomach for years,
for decades.

493
00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.630
I lay on my stomach and then all of a sudden I'm just like,
ah,

494
00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.990
turnover roll out of the bed,
got to start stretching.

495
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:14.270
Um,
anyways,

you know,
every time I get on the floor too,

496
00:29:14.271 --> 00:29:16.760
I think there's going to be something under the bed.
I never got over that.

497
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:21.070
You know,
it's weird.
I'm not really a religious guy,
but I definitely,
uh,

498
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.110
some of the go shit even though I don't believe in that either.

499
00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.840
You know what I do and I get on the floor and I started taking this something

500
00:29:26.841 --> 00:29:28.970
looking at me under the bed and I get over it.

501
00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:33.770
I just give whatever's under the under the uh,
bed,
the finger,
you know,

502
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:36.170
cause I figure if there's something underneath it and I give it the finger,

503
00:29:36.171 --> 00:29:39.230
it's going to kill me.
That's going to be over.
Right.

504
00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.760
And then if it doesn't do anything like does he have enough that underneath

505
00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:45.580
there or it's a fucking,
it's a fucking bitch.
It's a pussy,

disparaging about the,
um,

uh,

561
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.550
the female announcer and I add as far as I can tell,
nothing really happened.

562
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:26.190
You know,
I was just fun,
right?
The Ana mine,
I said,
good luck to everybody.

563
00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.890
What?
They should have a transgendered person in that fucking do it,
dude.

564
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.340
As long as they're still playing football,
I don't give a fuck.
All right.

565
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.310
And as long as you know what you're talking about,
I don't know why I don't care.

566
00:33:38.311 --> 00:33:41.850
What's between your legs,
what you used to have there,
what you attached,

567
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.900
what's your carved out?
I don't,
I don't give a fuck.
Just please,

568
00:33:45.901 --> 00:33:48.750
for the love of God,
know what you're talking about and enhance the experience.

569
00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.740
Don't take away from it.
Right.
In other words,

570
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.950
do the exact opposite of what I do on my fucking podcast.
All right.

571
00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.550
Have a great weekend.
You [inaudible] uh,
let's go Lsu.

572
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:00.640
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

573
00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.670
<v 5>Actually,
Randy Newman has a song called rednecks where he actually a,</v>

574
00:34:03.671 --> 00:34:07.810
he's actually making fun of northern liberals.
Uh,

575
00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.290
when it comes to racism,
how everybody acts.
Like,
you know,

576
00:34:11.291 --> 00:34:12.870
all the racism is down south.

577
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.610
It's a song you could never write today because of the lyrics.
But you know,

578
00:34:15.611 --> 00:34:19.630
if you actually knew what he was talking about,
um,
but there's this,

579
00:34:19.631 --> 00:34:23.650
there's a line in there.
Got College kids at Lsu,

580
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:27.250
uh,
go in dumb.
Come out dumb too.

581
00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:30.220
So I figured people of Alabama would like to listen to that one.
Right?

582
00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:35.350
Maybe Mississippi.
It's always the state.
Next door.
Arkansas.
I've noticed like,

583
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.310
states always think the state next to him was fucking stupid and they're better,

584
00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:43.600
you know,
which is why rough and rowdy is so fucking tremendous.

585
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.960
They're the only people I've ever seen that really exploit

586
00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:53.480
that state to state rivalry at the level that people really want to take it to.

587
00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.291
All right.

588
00:34:54.291 --> 00:34:57.560
We play football because it's illegal to just go and beat the shit out of each

589
00:34:57.561 --> 00:35:01.010
other.
But with rough and rowdy,
like when they had it down in the Carolinas,

590
00:35:01.011 --> 00:35:05.480
I had no idea how much people in South Carolina in North Carolina didn't care

591
00:35:05.481 --> 00:35:09.020
for one another.
You know,
and literally thought because that,

592
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.900
because of that invisible line,
if you were on the other side of it,

593
00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:14.160
that meant that you was some sort.
Yeah,
you were less than them.

594
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:17.670
It's fucking tremendous.
So the next rough and rowdy event,

595
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.700
unfortunately I'm not going to be there,
but you can bet good and God damn well,

596
00:35:20.701 --> 00:35:23.880
I'm going to order it and I'm going to tape it and I'm going to just sit down

597
00:35:23.881 --> 00:35:27.210
with my Miller highlights and I'm gonna Watch it.
Um,

598
00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:31.290
<v 6>the next one I believe is in Kentucky and,
uh,</v>

599
00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.080
it's on October 5th,
but I have a Gig in Boston that night,

600
00:35:34.081 --> 00:35:36.370
so I won't be able to do it.
Please.
Uh,

601
00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.490
please on tune in j Portnoy,
big cat,
almost hilarious people over there.

602
00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.900
All right,
set.

Joining us on the line,
Bill Burr.
Bill.
I know,
uh,

615
00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.710
I know you said you had some travel and to do this past Sunday,

616
00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.590
were you able to enjoy NFL week one?

617
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:33.620
<v 9>Yeah,
I watched the,
uh,
the Patriots game.</v>

618
00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:38.360
I love my direct TV was kind of cutting in and out for whatever reason.
Um,

619
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.940
so I watched a little bit of that.

620
00:37:40.941 --> 00:37:45.140
I saw a little bit of the jets and I watched John John Gruden's return and I was

621
00:37:45.141 --> 00:37:47.540
loving the first half.
It was great seeing them there.

622
00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:49.310
I thought it was funny when we say and he couldn't,

623
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:52.610
he wasn't gonna be able to write to these younger kids and they got rid of all

624
00:37:52.611 --> 00:37:54.950
the young kids.
He has like the oldest team in the NFL.

625
00:37:54.951 --> 00:37:57.920
I that's either going to be a,
I think I actually,

626
00:37:57.921 --> 00:38:00.290
I think think it's going to just kind of a genius move on his part.

627
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:06.020
<v 8>Yeah.
It seemed to be a bold play to kind of do what Curtin did and obviously the</v>

628
00:38:06.021 --> 00:38:10.640
second half didn't work out.
I mean last week we hit on it.

629
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.370
Uh,
I think your lot cash that the,

630
00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:17.870
every sports announcer will be coming out with the sky is falling down and that

631
00:38:17.871 --> 00:38:21.530
certainly seems to be the case for the Raiders.
And then on the positive side,

632
00:38:21.531 --> 00:38:22.364
the jets,

633
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:26.350
<v 9>well why the rate?
I mean the Raiders play like the first half state,</v>

634
00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.890
they weren't,
they will met some really good rams team.

635
00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:33.760
I mean I like the Raiders event like,
like you know,

636
00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:38.560
a slapstick forever.
I think for week one I that was,

637
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.840
I would be happy with that if I was a Raiders fan.

638
00:38:40.841 --> 00:38:45.070
I've even known what that second hips,
they didn't look clueless.

639
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:47.050
I mean it's only week one.
Yeah,

640
00:38:47.051 --> 00:38:50.920
I know in the Jetson now like you know they're already going,
you know

641
00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.790
whatever that USC guy did.
Yeah.
They like,

642
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:58.870
you know what he did week one that Tom Brady did this first week and it's just

643
00:38:58.871 --> 00:39:00.950
like,
you know,
I'm not,

644
00:39:00.951 --> 00:39:03.850
I'm not saying that that guy isn't going to be greater I think,
but like,

645
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:07.840
like I don't think you really even know what's going on until after three weeks

646
00:39:07.841 --> 00:39:10.990
as far as just like,
all right.
I mean look at that,

647
00:39:10.991 --> 00:39:14.260
that Tampa saints game 48 40 I mean,

648
00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.840
is that what they're going to be doing each week?
I don't know.

649
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.080
He ain't giving up 40 or the other way around at this.

650
00:39:20.081 --> 00:39:23.440
That just seems like sometimes it's just weird games and I don't think

651
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.730
Stafford's going to throw five interceptions.
He just,
you know,

652
00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:32.520
sometimes you just have a bad game and,
uh,
I dunno,

653
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:36.970
that was,
that was that jets game.
I was,
um,
you know,
I mean,

654
00:39:36.971 --> 00:39:39.400
obviously if they do that every week they're going to be world beaters,

655
00:39:39.401 --> 00:39:42.070
but I got a feeling that they're not going to be.

656
00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:46.940
<v 8>Yeah,
I agree.
And just as a,
as a,
as someone who grew up as the jet says,</v>

657
00:39:46.941 --> 00:39:51.610
like the little brother team just listening them,
Chad,
j e t s jet,
Cha Cha,

658
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:53.150
it's like calm down one win.

659
00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.480
And that the worst heartache of the week so far is the,
you know,

660
00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:01.160
Brett farbs first pass in the NFL was an interception too.
It's like calm down,

661
00:40:01.161 --> 00:40:04.010
calm down there.
The jet there,
the jets,

662
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:07.250
<v 9>just too many channels.
They have to overhype everything.</v>

663
00:40:07.251 --> 00:40:12.140
But what the judge did was obviously really impressive.
Uh,
and I,
you know,

664
00:40:12.141 --> 00:40:16.910
I mean,
Afc East Guy,
so Miami went to when the buffalo good Lord Build.

665
00:40:16.911 --> 00:40:20.180
So yeah.
Um,
buffalo good Lord.

666
00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:25.760
They ever going to turn it around,
but it's only one week.
Who knows.
But I mean,

667
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:29.350
well,
you know,
it's funny that they set out the Patriots,
uh,

668
00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:33.020
for the first time since 2016 or not favorites next week.
And,
um,

669
00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:37.050
I was sick of like,
well,
2016 isn't that long ago,
you know?
Yeah.

670
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:43.460
So,
I mean,
I guess it is as far as like,
you know,
being a favorite,
all of those,

671
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.180
all of those games,
but uh,
you know,

672
00:40:47.181 --> 00:40:49.280
they made it seem like it was going to be a decade ago.

673
00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.770
<v 8>Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
New England,
they came out,</v>

674
00:40:52.771 --> 00:40:56.290
they took care of business against the Texans,
who wasn't,
it was a,
it was Kinda,

675
00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.040
it was,
it was a weird game.
It didn't,
it,

676
00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.230
you never thought the Patriots were going to lose,

677
00:41:01.231 --> 00:41:04.680
but the spread seemed like it might come into a play at Gronk,

678
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.810
obviously looking great.

679
00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.900
<v 9>I mean,
and then hold them,</v>

680
00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:11.960
we'll let them back in the game and then I'm just sitting here with like six

681
00:41:11.961 --> 00:41:14.330
minutes ago.
Like,
are they going to tie this up?
Like,

682
00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:18.140
why do we get into this situation?
I kind of like,
you know,

683
00:41:18.141 --> 00:41:22.070
I was very impressed with our defense.
Um,

684
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.650
you know,
containment of their quarterback.

685
00:41:24.651 --> 00:41:28.550
Like never I can remember his fricking name that God's not.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Watson.

686
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:34.310
Um,
but I,
I our special teams,
um,
of let up a lot of yards.

687
00:41:34.311 --> 00:41:38.780
It seemed like every time they ran it back they've got at least to the 30.
Um,

688
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:41.180
I dunno,
we shall see.

689
00:41:41.181 --> 00:41:44.300
But our defense looked pretty soluble a now it's only one week

690
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:49.870
<v 8>they finally got rid of Patricia took that garbage defense to Detroit.</v>

691
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.070
Oh Man.
Oh yeah.
I mean if you're,

692
00:41:53.071 --> 00:41:57.200
if you're a lions fan and you watch the Superbowl and then week one Monday night

693
00:41:57.201 --> 00:41:59.160
against the New York jets,
you can not be happy.

694
00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:01.160
It's like you brought in a defensive coordinator.

695
00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:04.640
The defense sucked and you kept the offensive coordinator because you liked the

696
00:42:04.641 --> 00:42:06.560
chemistry and they looked like horrible dog shit.

697
00:42:06.561 --> 00:42:11.330
So I don't know a lot of good regression angles in the NFL for me too.
Exactly.

698
00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.090
I mean that's when you're talking about pet in the NFL,
that's what you,

699
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:15.710
that's kind of what you have to do.

700
00:42:15.711 --> 00:42:19.520
You have to look to opportunities to fade some crazy outcome.

701
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:23.810
Like you said,
Bill with the box putting up 48 points on the road.

702
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:28.220
I have a feeling Ryan Fitzpatrick isn't going to do that week to just gut

703
00:42:28.221 --> 00:42:32.240
instinct.
There's a reason he's not doing that every week.
It's,
it's a fluke.

704
00:42:32.241 --> 00:42:33.530
Crazy shit happen.

705
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:41.580
<v 9>Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the same thing.
Yeah.
But I don't know.
It's,
it was,
yeah,</v>

706
00:42:41.581 --> 00:42:46.000
it was definitely a weird,
it's a lot of weird games.
Um,
but we'll,

707
00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.190
we'll still hold on until a tie here in the last time I saw a tie.
Lord.

708
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.070
<v 8>Well,
what's funny is I was,</v>

709
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:55.850
one of the things I bet on this season is there will be no tie this see,

710
00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.800
I want on it last year,
the first week of the season,
Bam.

711
00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.020
And of course it's the fucking browns.

712
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:07.680
It paid like one and a half to one.
It just seems like there's,
like you said,

713
00:43:07.681 --> 00:43:11.040
there's never a tie even now with only the 10 minute over time it seems like

714
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.770
it's,
and it's the NFL,
they're not going to end in a tie.
Come on.
Yeah.

715
00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.550
They should switch it to the college football rules for overtime because that's

716
00:43:17.551 --> 00:43:20.220
such a more exciting way to finish the game.

717
00:43:20.221 --> 00:43:23.880
And then you never end up with a tie one and a half one.

718
00:43:23.881 --> 00:43:27.070
Does that mean you got to beat up the bet to 50 to make a hundred?
No.

719
00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:31.200
So I w I bet a hundred and I would win one 50 plus my original bet back.

720
00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:35.520
So it felt,
it felt like the right,
I mean I,
you know,
obviously it's a losing bet.

721
00:43:35.521 --> 00:43:39.150
So hindsight is is what it is.
But yeah,
ties are just,

722
00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:41.850
both teams really tried to lose the game.

723
00:43:41.851 --> 00:43:45.210
That's what we were actually out in Las Vegas hanging out in the sports book

724
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:49.380
when they missed that field goal to end the game and the tie and it was,

725
00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:54.060
the sports looks great for dramatic wins and losses,
but dramatic ties.

726
00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:58.380
It's just no one's happy.
Even if you had Cleveland plus three and a half,

727
00:43:58.381 --> 00:44:02.130
you still wanted to see them hit that field goal just to just to end the

728
00:44:02.131 --> 00:44:05.910
suffering.
It was like we were at a strip club and a dude walked out on stage.
I,

729
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:11.210
everyone's just like,
ah,
trying to make sense of this.
All right,
we'll have,

730
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.000
who would have thought you'd say that this is their,

731
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.720
this is their best start and over what,

732
00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:24.030
14 years best starts since 2004.
Oh man,

733
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:27.570
they were loving that stat.
All right,
well let's,
uh,

734
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.460
let's get into some of these spreads.
Of course,

735
00:44:29.461 --> 00:44:32.730
the spreads are brought to you by my book,

739
00:44:42.811 --> 00:44:47.130

My bookie dad Agee Promo code bill pets.
All right.

740
00:44:47.131 --> 00:44:50.910
First game to talk about New England patriots.

741
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:55.680
They head into Jacksonville where the Jaguars right now are a,
uh,

742
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:57.720
the pats actually our favorite in this game.

743
00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:02.280
They're a a three point favor right now,
Jack.
Yeah.

744
00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:07.290
Jags are the home dog here.
We're looking at a rematch of the AFC championship,

745
00:45:07.291 --> 00:45:11.880
although it was played in New England and that Jacksonville Bill,

746
00:45:11.881 --> 00:45:14.610
are you worried about the,
the jags defense here on the road?

747
00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:19.010
<v 9>Yeah,
Tom Claflin is and you know,
obviously she's,</v>

748
00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.920
he's beaten us twice in super and every going to cut quickly.

749
00:45:21.921 --> 00:45:26.300
He's turned that team around everywhere and the guy goes eight that,
you know,

750
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:28.760
fright from the back his days when he's at Boston College.

751
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:32.990
I'm a big fan of Tom Costs and she's getting three points at home and it did

752
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:37.850
Jaguars defenses as good as that.
I would take,
I would take the Jags,

753
00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:43.670
I wouldn't be afraid I would take the Jaguars,
uh,
getting tiny at home.

754
00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:47.390
Um,
you know,
they,
they,
I don't know.

755
00:45:47.391 --> 00:45:52.070
I just think there were really tough team and uh,
we'll see.
We'll see.

756
00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.110
We'll see.
I mean,
obviously I'm rooting for the Patriots,

757
00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.210
but we're talking money here.

758
00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:58.070
<v 8>Yeah,
exactly.
Can't mess around to keep the lights on here.</v>

759
00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.220
<v 9>I would take the jaguars getting three.</v>

760
00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:03.800
<v 8>Yeah,
it does feel like that's the smart play.
I mean,
you touched on it last week,</v>

761
00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:07.400
shown on the Patriots.
Generally aren't playing their best ball in September.

762
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.391
And guess what,

763
00:46:08.391 --> 00:46:12.020
this is the biggest game on the schedule for the jags after blowing that game in

764
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:13.760
New England.
So I mean,
look,
the,

765
00:46:13.761 --> 00:46:17.840
the paths led a Houston team that played pretty poorly,
uh,

766
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:21.910
get back in the game and Watson was not himself.
So I'm going to,

767
00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:25.820
I'll say a,
unless Bortles completely Bortles it,
uh,

768
00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:29.150
I think the Jags jags are gonna win this game.
Yeah.
It,

769
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:34.070
and you talk about Tom Coplin style,
the way to beat New England is the,

770
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:37.640
to try and get pressure on Tom Brady with just using your defensive line and not

771
00:46:37.641 --> 00:46:38.660
blitz in a bunch of guys.

772
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:43.130
The jags have that strong defensive line that might be able to,
well,

773
00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.720
my dominate the game,

774
00:46:44.721 --> 00:46:48.310
but certainly pressure Brady enough and uh,

775
00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:52.030
I think what the paths have going for them is Leonard for net looks like he's

776
00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:56.120
going to be out for the jags.
Jags don't have a ton of offensive weapons.

777
00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:00.620
Honestly,
I think the play in this game maybe,
uh,
maybe to go under,

778
00:47:00.621 --> 00:47:02.480
it feels like it's going to be a little slug match here.

779
00:47:02.481 --> 00:47:06.950
But I'll take the jags catching three in a rematch at home.
Yeah,

780
00:47:06.951 --> 00:47:10.940
I know God hates Jack.
Sean.
Remember that a next step

781
00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:16.280
<v 9>then the under,
since this everybody throws hand offs now.
You know what I mean?</v>

782
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:17.900
I just can't

783
00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:23.260
<v 8>or receive or past five years.
I just,
I always get nervous button,
the button,</v>

784
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.890
the under from before.
If you want to fade.
Recency,

785
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.640
just take the under in every game.
I feel like they're there.

786
00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:32.580
They're may be an over adjustment to the total is after that point.
Yeah.

787
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:36.820
Everything.
I mean the fantasy,
everything.
The scoring was just off the charts.

788
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.980
Yeah,
it is.
It is tough to bet the under,

789
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:43.060
I mean just for the entertainment value alone to just root against every play to

790
00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:44.260
succeed.
But

791
00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:48.040
<v 9>I don't think anybody's ever going to break Emmitt Smith uh,</v>

792
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:52.150
time rushing record.
They just did.
Opportunities just aren't there anymore.

793
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:54.080
<v 8>No.
Yeah,
I mean it's,</v>

794
00:47:54.081 --> 00:47:57.800
I think it's going to be really hard for any running backs to set marks going

795
00:47:57.801 --> 00:48:00.230
forward.
Cause I mean,
half their touches are going to be passes.

796
00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:03.280
<v 9>He's going to be like that guy who's won the most games.</v>

797
00:48:03.281 --> 00:48:05.460
Like whoever won the most games in NLP histories.

798
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:09.660
It's like in the five hundreds like it's just like it's gonna.

799
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:13.120
It's gonna seem that daunting.
Like it was a different era.
Yeah.

800
00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:14.830
Besides saw young guys are head

801
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:19.470
<v 8>is over 800 starts.
They're not doing that anymore.
No,
they,
yeah.</v>

802
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:22.650
I mean they're never going to come even close to getting there.

803
00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:27.700
<v 9>Yeah.
You pitch a whole double header.
They were men die a march.</v>

804
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:30.030
They were,
they were men back then though.
Oh,

805
00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:33.740
they had a stake giant cigar and called it a day.
A little bit of a beer league,

806
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:34.850
you know,
let's be honest.

807
00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:37.770
<v 8>Yeah.
I mean you look at Babe Ruth,
he does.</v>

808
00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:41.610
He does strike you as your uncle at a softball game who can just crush it.

809
00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.890
We just had a little bit of hand eye coordination.

810
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:45.081
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

811
00:48:45.081 --> 00:48:47.800
I used to play in a softball team when I was working in a warehouse and they

812
00:48:47.801 --> 00:48:48.634
always had these,

813
00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:51.970
these ringers would come out and they all look built like Babe Ruth,

814
00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:55.210
a little skinny legs,
big beer belly.

815
00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:59.920
And they would just get up and they would turn that torso and the thing would go

816
00:48:59.921 --> 00:49:01.000
a mile.
Yeah.

817
00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:03.660
<v 8>That's like,
I mean,
that was Cecil fielder,
you know,
he was,</v>

818
00:49:03.661 --> 00:49:06.870
he was the modern day version of that meal.
All right,

819
00:49:06.871 --> 00:49:11.040
next up we got the New York giants heading down to Dallas.

820
00:49:11.041 --> 00:49:14.220
Right now it's sitting at a even minus three here.

821
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:19.650
Both teams started out.
Oh,
and one neither.
Neither looked great too.

822
00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:22.470
Uh,
yeah.
I mean,
giants lost at home to the jags.

823
00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:27.000
Cowboys lost on the road to the panthers.
Spill.
Which way you lean in here.

824
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:32.530
<v 9>I hate this game.
I know.
Same here.
I hate this game where it's just like,</v>

825
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.960
like the cowboys at,
I dunno,
they're at home.

826
00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:41.290
It's a deficient rivalries to the Games are always closed.

827
00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:43.390
You can never bet against Eli.

828
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.810
Eli doesn't seem like it gets excited until like November,

829
00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:53.860
but they got that running back.
Jesus,
am I going to go giants,

830
00:49:53.861 --> 00:49:57.520
giants with Tom Claflin and then I'm going to go,
they're going to go,
I think,

831
00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.580
you know,
they beat us twice.
So,
I mean,
I can't,
I got to keep it.

832
00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.900
I,
uh,
I believe it here,
right?
And I think,
uh,

833
00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:11.950
the Dez Bryant hangover and this whole,
whatever the hell they've done,

834
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:16.870
reef formation of the cowboys is the hangover lasts for at least three weeks.

835
00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:18.040
I'm going with the giants.

836
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:20.840
<v 8>Kramer,
I'm assuming you're going to be back in your giants as well.</v>

837
00:50:20.841 --> 00:50:22.400
I also believe in Ely.

838
00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:26.270
I appreciate all these mentions of Tom Coughlin and the Superbowl wins.

839
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.210
And you see how excited Ryan is getting on the other end of this.
But I mean,

840
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.151
here,
here's the thing,
right?
I,

841
00:50:31.151 --> 00:50:33.920
I think I was talking to my dad today and I was like,
I,
you know,

842
00:50:33.921 --> 00:50:36.590
I actually wasn't that upset.
The giants played fine.

843
00:50:36.591 --> 00:50:39.380
They played a really good team.
Uh,
they played a really good defense.

844
00:50:39.381 --> 00:50:42.680
More importantly,
and the offensive players got theirs.
They just,

845
00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:44.720
they were picked six away.
So,
uh,

846
00:50:44.721 --> 00:50:48.620
but what I would they saw on the Dallas cowboys game was the team that even when

847
00:50:48.621 --> 00:50:53.420
Kiki was out of the game,
this team struggled to anything and deck as we know,

848
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.630
Sean Dakota,
Prescott not the best quarterback in the NFL.

849
00:50:56.631 --> 00:51:00.530
So Eli has historically played well in Dallas.

850
00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:03.810
I'm going to keep throwing that out there and yeah,
no,
of course.
You take the,

851
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:08.290
take the giants before it gets off at three.
Yeah.
As much as it pains me,

852
00:51:08.291 --> 00:51:11.240
I'm going to take this,
I'm going to take the giants getting three points.

853
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:15.620
You look at the cowboys,
they're only,
they got seek and that's it.

854
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:18.440
They're authentic line isn't the dominant force that it was an eight.

855
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:22.970
They have no skill positions to help deck out.
Uh,
on that offense.

856
00:51:22.971 --> 00:51:26.670
I think they're just going to have trouble putting up points and the giants,

857
00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:30.170
their weaknesses,
he offensive line.
Obviously the jags were able to exploit that.

858
00:51:30.171 --> 00:51:33.890
I don't see the cowboys being able to get enough pressure on Eli and listen,

859
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:38.900
it is Sunday night,
Sunday night football.
I think your Buddy Odell Ryan,

860
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:42.020
in spite of the fact that he has not won a game since he went on the infamous

861
00:51:42.021 --> 00:51:45.710
boat trip,
I think they get a victory down in,
uh,

862
00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.860
down in Dallas stadium there.
So I'll,
I'll take the giants plus three.

863
00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:54.020
I don't feel,
I don't feel great about it because Dallas coming off at a loss.

864
00:51:54.021 --> 00:51:54.801
Maybe they rally,

865
00:51:54.801 --> 00:51:59.060
but I am just still not a believer in chasing Karen at all as a head coach.

866
00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:04.930
<v 9>I think Dakota Prescott sounds like some country singer on one of those,
uh,</v>

867
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:06.060
American idol shows

868
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.350
<v 8>so true.
I mean,
it's just,
it's,
it cracks me up.</v>

869
00:52:08.351 --> 00:52:11.230
His name's Dakota vote now for Dakota.
Prescott.

870
00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:14.960
<v 9>It's the fact that he is also Prescott.
Yeah.</v>

871
00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:19.730
You could be Dakota something or something.
Prescott,
but did code of Prescott.

872
00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:22.070
That's a tough one,
man.
I,
you can just like,

873
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:26.900
you're just born with an acoustic guitar in a cowboy hat.
Second you come out.

874
00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:28.970
<v 8>Yeah.
You imagine it's a,
yeah.</v>

875
00:52:28.971 --> 00:52:33.590
He's like a chick with a cutoff flannel shirt with some like short jean shorts

876
00:52:33.591 --> 00:52:37.670
coming out with the acoustic guitar ready to wow you with their latest
rendition.

877
00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:41.530
<v 9>Well,
that's another way of looking at it.
I didn't tell him in daisy.</v>

878
00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:46.440
<v 8>Well,
he's a,
he is.
He is a woman.
In my scenario bill,
he's done.</v>

879
00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:50.340
He's done and shown and let's not forget that Dak Prescott,
sorry.

880
00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:53.820
Dakota's Prescott.
Favorite Song is drops of Jupiter by train.

881
00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:58.230
That was a little known nugget about Dakota.
That was the trivia fact.
We dug up.

882
00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:03.660
All right,
last game of the week.

883
00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.010
Now we'll be breaking down here.

884
00:53:05.011 --> 00:53:10.011
Kansas City chiefs come off a nice win on the road against the Los Angeles

885
00:53:11.131 --> 00:53:13.290
chargers.
Now they're heading into Pittsburgh.

886
00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:17.010
Obviously Pittsburgh coming off that ugly,
ugly tie against the Cleveland browns.

887
00:53:17.011 --> 00:53:18.630
Right now my book,

888
00:53:18.631 --> 00:53:23.631
he has the Pittsburgh Steelers as minus five favorites home

889
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:31.170
<v 9>bill.
Which way you lean in here.
You know,
I didn't see a second of that.</v>

890
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.860
Steel is game.
I don't know how was Big Ben Looking?

891
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:36.280
<v 8>He looked pretty like typical road,</v>

892
00:53:36.281 --> 00:53:40.550
Big Ben like through five one five interceptions.
I five interceptions.

893
00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:44.920
I'm turnovers.
Maybe?
No,
I think he,
I think he through maybe four or five pics.

894
00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:48.460
They had six turnovers overall,
but he didn't look

895
00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:51.730
<v 9>good at all.
I liked the Steelers at home.
I don't like that number though.</v>

896
00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:55.600
Here's what we picked a perfect number where you just sit on the fence.

897
00:53:55.601 --> 00:53:58.340
Which way am I going to fall?
Uh,

898
00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:01.220
you know what I say to steal his crew are going to cover the chiefs.

899
00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:05.500
So the chiefs,
the chiefs,
you know what I mean?
Until they,
not the chief's,
the,

900
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:09.190
the chief's.
The Steelers.
That's still the Steelers.
I,
I mean,
I just thought,

901
00:54:09.191 --> 00:54:12.490
I'm just going to be like historical betting here in the first couple of weeks.

902
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.830
I mean,
I don't know who anybody is at this point.

903
00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:20.060
<v 8>Well,
I think,
you know,
talk about overreaction.
Oh my God.
Big Ben was horrible.</v>

904
00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:24.740
He's always bad on the road.
Oh my God.
They,
the timer,
they tied the browns.
Oh,

905
00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:25.893
lovey on bill.

906
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:31.150
<v 9>Big Ben.
He's old school.
Take a hit.
Like that guy,
you know,</v>

907
00:54:31.151 --> 00:54:33.020
he's just,
you know,
and he,

908
00:54:33.021 --> 00:54:37.720
he gets it done in the big moments of the games and I don't know,
I,
I,

909
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.510
I believe in that guy still.
Yeah,
he looks like

910
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.680
<v 8>he plays well in the home at home.
And that's why I like this.</v>

911
00:54:43.681 --> 00:54:45.810
Like we're gonna fade public perception,

912
00:54:45.811 --> 00:54:49.740
but the Steelers stink and we're going to fade public perception that the chiefs

913
00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:53.850
are going to win the Superbowl because Oh my God,
Andy Reid started.
Well again.

914
00:54:54.370 --> 00:54:54.871
Uh,
I mean,
look,

915
00:54:54.871 --> 00:54:59.430
this is a classic fade recency or this line opened at seven Sean and people that

916
00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:03.360
have been crushing the chief side of this.
So,
wow,
let the number come down.

917
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:05.350
I'm also going to be on the Steelers,
Sean.

918
00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:08.700
I think this is a great kind of fade recency both ways here.
Wow.

919
00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:11.970
It's going to be a clean sweep are all integrated and all these pics.

920
00:55:11.971 --> 00:55:15.990
I love the Steelers at home coming off a,
I mean,
not a loss,

921
00:55:15.991 --> 00:55:19.200
but it may as well be.
Then you come home for their home opener,

922
00:55:19.201 --> 00:55:20.670
you know they're going to bounce back.

923
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:25.260
And then meanwhile you've got the chief's coming off a huge road victory to go

924
00:55:25.261 --> 00:55:29.340
to the other side of the country in Pittsburgh.
My home smelling himself like,

925
00:55:29.341 --> 00:55:32.930
come on.
Yeah.
And we watched that.
We watched that game.
Ryan,
the uh,

926
00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.860
chief secondary looked horrible.

927
00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:37.390
<v 9>Hey,
I don't want to be at geography Snob,</v>

928
00:55:37.391 --> 00:55:40.210
but they're not going to the other side of the country to Kansas City,

929
00:55:40.211 --> 00:55:44.590
to Pittsburgh.
That's,
you know,
to just into the east coast.
I was,

930
00:55:44.591 --> 00:55:49.030
I was factoring in the them going out to la,
then to Kansas City,

931
00:55:49.031 --> 00:55:53.480
then out to Pittsburgh.
But yeah,
a lot of trash,
a lot of traveling plane.
Come on.

932
00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:57.360
They've got a connection in Poughkeepsie United in the middle seat.
You know,

933
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:59.410
I think there'll be all right.
They're going to have Chris

934
00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:04.220
<v 8>next.
They're not,
they're going to be dehydrated from all those salty peanuts.</v>

935
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:05.540
I,
I just,

936
00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:09.800
I just think it's a good spot for Pittsburgh add home home opener for the Kansas

937
00:56:09.801 --> 00:56:13.370
City defense is just their passing defense in particular is just horrible.

938
00:56:13.371 --> 00:56:14.480
And it's a passing league.

939
00:56:14.481 --> 00:56:17.720
I just feel like Pittsburgh is going to be able to throw all over him.

940
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:21.930
<v 9>Anything you say with confidence that they're passing the stinks?</v>

941
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.100
I'm not giving you crap if just

942
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.520
<v 8>after one week.
Well,
I'll give you two reasons.</v>

943
00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:32.550
One reason is I watched the game and I saw that the chargers receivers were wide

944
00:56:32.771 --> 00:56:36.700
open a number of times that just dropped easy casual balls.

945
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:40.510
And then two,
other than that,
other than that,

946
00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:46.560
my other mother deeper reason is I sit next to a chiefs fan at work and everyday

947
00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:50.080
he opens up his laptop and starts reading blogs and just goes,

948
00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:54.430
our fucking secondary fucking sucks.
So I'm kind of using that as well.

949
00:56:56.110 --> 00:57:01.000
Okay.
I'm,
I'm convinced.
So one year over.
All Right,

950
00:57:01.001 --> 00:57:03.520
Bill,
do uh,
you know,
wrap things up here.

951
00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:07.180
You hit with your lock last week you were,
you were two and one with your picks.

952
00:57:07.181 --> 00:57:10.460
The lock of course was that the sky was falling down or that the,

953
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:14.710
the announcers all proclaimed the sky was falling down.
Yes.

954
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.620
Hopefully we get that three and oh,
this week.
But what's your,

955
00:57:17.621 --> 00:57:21.040
what's your lock prediction for a NFL week too?

956
00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:22.310
<v 10>Uh,</v>

957
00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:27.310
one person tweets that women should not be play by play announcers and by

958
00:57:28.131 --> 00:57:32.510
Wednesday,
oh,
I guess it's a,
I got another two days.

959
00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:34.990
Somebody is going to say something.
Oh yeah,

960
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:39.380
somebody will say something and then it's going to become this huge thing.

961
00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:43.250
And then I think by this time next year,
all play by play.

962
00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:48.200
People will be women.
That would be,
that's that.
That is my luck.

963
00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:51.180
<v 8>Lock it up.
Doris Burke will be doing it.</v>

964
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:54.950
<v 10>It's finding a way as a Jew,
as a joke,
I was joking with my buddy,
I go,
dude,</v>

965
00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:59.600
Burt Reynolds died in the play by play on Monday night.
Football is a female.

966
00:57:59.601 --> 00:58:03.500
I go,
it really is over.
We had a great run.
So as,
as a joke,

967
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:07.430
I actually looked at the elks club going like,

968
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.530
I'm maybe just see what the elks club that's in men's club or whatever and

969
00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:13.640
looked it up.
And in 2005,
first of all,

970
00:58:13.641 --> 00:58:15.560
I looked it up in the picture was of a woman.

971
00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:17.210
When you go to the whole website of number,

972
00:58:17.211 --> 00:58:22.211
like they sued in 2005 and one so like even they've even infiltrated obviously,

973
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:29.450
I mean arguably the biggest group of jerk off men in the country.

974
00:58:29.451 --> 00:58:31.580
I mean you're literally talking to take away like the hats with the little

975
00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:35.120
tassel.
See?
Yeah,
it's hilarious.
Like I looked it up,
I would never join it,

976
00:58:35.121 --> 00:58:35.571
but I was just,

977
00:58:35.571 --> 00:58:38.720
I just was going to get a check out of the fact that there was one place left

978
00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.420
where you could just chill out and not have to adjust your behavior and the old

979
00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:46.780
gentleman,
no help scope.
It's over.
It is over man.

980
00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:50.110
<v 8>It was the elks club and Augusta national and then both those had been</v>

981
00:58:50.111 --> 00:58:54.490
infiltrated.
They're now no longer all male.

982
00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:58.020
<v 10>All right.
I know we had a hell of a run dude run.</v>

983
00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:00.170
<v 8>Yeah,
man.
Really did have a hell of a run.
Hey,</v>

984
00:59:00.171 --> 00:59:04.340
all every dynasty must come to an end.
Tens of thousands of years.

985
00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.110
I think

986
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:10.890
<v 10>Roy Emmett and uh,
what's his face?
The urban.
The triplets.</v>

987
00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:14.430
Yeah.
We weren't a three headed monster for a long time.

988
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:17.530
<v 8>Well,
this is a lot of people are seeing,
this is a rebuilding year for men.</v>

989
00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:18.370
You know,
we're,

990
00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:22.520
we're open to get the number one draft pick took a lot of heat loss,
a lot of uh,

991
00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:25.430
lost a lot.
I took a lot of L's out there.
Yeah.

992
00:59:25.431 --> 00:59:27.830
We're going to try to forget about last year and uh,
you know,

993
00:59:27.831 --> 00:59:30.710
if we're going to hit reset,
we've got Jon Gruden back.

994
00:59:30.711 --> 00:59:35.510
He's back for different times so much.
Jon Gruden face.
I can't wait.
Oh Man.

995
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:37.890
It was,
he was loved seeing him back then.

996
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:42.140
It was so funny how like he was just kind of a different guy in the broadcast

997
00:59:42.141 --> 00:59:45.380
booth and then the second he put the headphones back on again.

998
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.650
He just wanted a break back to the chuck you face.
I loved it.
Yeah.

999
00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:52.580
The thing that was frustrating about him as an announcer was that clearly he

1000
00:59:52.581 --> 00:59:55.940
thought about getting back into coaching so he wouldn't bad mouth guys on the

1001
00:59:55.941 --> 00:59:58.800
air and he just loved everyone at ease.
A great guys.

1002
00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:02.990
You guys look at this guy and then as soon as he's got that headset on,

1003
01:00:02.991 --> 01:00:05.990
you could just see him screaming and yelling.
He was,

1004
01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:10.760
he was just so pissed at cars.
We got that job.
He cut half the team.

1005
01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.240
And I thought you said you love me.
The broadcast booth.
Yeah.

1006
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:20.910
Not on the claims paid it.
Yeah.
All right,

1007
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:23.290
<v 9>well let's see how we do gentlemen.
Uh,</v>

1008
01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:28.100
I'm going to get more bold with my predictions is once,
you know,
hopefully,

1009
01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.570
you know,
what am I actually,

1010
01:00:29.571 --> 01:00:32.450
my show's got moved this weekend because of that hurricane,

1011
01:00:32.451 --> 01:00:34.680
which hopefully goes out to sea.
I'm,

1012
01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.820
I supposed to work in Virginia and South Carolina.
So I'm hoping that,
you know,

1013
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.721
you know,

1014
01:00:38.721 --> 01:00:41.470
a lot of those people are probably still upside down in their houses because of

1015
01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:42.560
the piece of shit bankers.

1016
01:00:42.561 --> 01:00:45.170
So the last thing they need is a hurricane to hit the house.

1017
01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.240
That's never going to be worth more than what they owe on it.

1018
01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:52.100
Screwed by the insurance companies as well.
Yes.
Yeah.
For the trisector.
So,
um,

1019
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:53.900
uh,
that's what I'm thinking about this week.

1020
01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:55.580
I'm supposed to be there the following me,
but I,

1021
01:00:55.581 --> 01:00:59.050
but the other side was I will be home and have enough time to watch the games.

1022
01:00:59.051 --> 01:01:03.020
So hopefully a silver lining in.
Now shout out to Dakota Prescott.

1023
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:06.560

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:57.053
[inaudible].

1030
01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:08.250
<v 8>Hey,
what's going on?
It's built bar and it is the Monday morning podcast</v>

1031
01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:12.760
<v 10>for Monday,
September 13th,</v>

1032
01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.390
2010 what's going on?
How are you?
You're feeling good.

1033
01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:18.970
I'm going to try to pretend like,

1034
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:24.110
am I actually went out drinking last night and a little banged up,

1035
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.710
a little banged up.
It's actually 10 oh one east coast time.
I'm in New York City.

1036
01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:32.980
This is a the biggest week of the year for me.
Um,

1037
01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:37.410
I'm back here doing press for my,
I'm new one hour special.
Let it go.

1038
01:02:37.411 --> 01:02:40.530
That comes out in premiers.
They switched the date on me.

1039
01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.530
It is now it's Sunday,

1040
01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:48.570
September 19th at 11:00 PM.
So,
uh,

1041
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.960
please tune in.
Please listen,
please watch.

1042
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.060
Please invite other people over.

1043
01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:58.950
Why don't you have a little fucking stand up comedy party?
Don't they have those?

1044
01:02:58.951 --> 01:03:01.470
They have super bowl parties.
You know,

1045
01:03:01.471 --> 01:03:06.420
we invite a bunch of broads over and they talked during the game and they shut

1046
01:03:06.421 --> 01:03:09.930
up during the commercials.
I kind of liked that one.

1047
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:13.830
How much do you think that that went Costa dated?
Um,

1048
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.660
anyways,
yes,

1049
01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:20.550
I'm in town this week and I'm going to be doing the opiate Anthony Program,

1050
01:03:20.551 --> 01:03:24.210
my fucking favorite.
Um,
I'm going to be doing that.

1051
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:27.720
I believe I'm going to be doing something on the versus network.

1052
01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.840
I am going to be talking to anybody with a microphone this week doing my gosh,

1053
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:36.600
darndest to try and get people to listen to my fucking podcast.

1054
01:03:36.601 --> 01:03:38.220
But how many podcasts?

1055
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.340
See what happens when I multitask to get people to watch my specials.

1056
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.030
And,
um,

1057
01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:49.050
I'm gonna apologize for the lack of funny up until this point already right out

1058
01:03:49.051 --> 01:03:49.771
of the fucking gate,

1059
01:03:49.771 --> 01:03:53.580
just because I have to make sure I get this information out at the beginning of

1060
01:03:53.581 --> 01:03:54.690
the podcast.
All right,

1061
01:03:54.691 --> 01:03:59.640
so my special September 19th at 11:00 PM on comedy central.

1062
01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:05.340
Um,
please go ahead and watch it.
And if you want to preorder my DVD,

1063
01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.890
look into your heart.

1064
01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:12.390
If you want to order this thing for an unbelievably,
ridiculously,

1065
01:04:12.391 --> 01:04:14.280
almost an embarrassingly low price,

1066
01:04:14.281 --> 01:04:19.281
you can order the fuck that thing for like $13 in like 29 cents on amazon.com.

1067
01:04:20.701 --> 01:04:24.090
I don't know how the fuck they came up with that price,

1068
01:04:24.091 --> 01:04:28.290
but I got to admit I felt a little insulted.
You know,

1069
01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:31.440
why don't you just fucking give it away?
amazon.com

1070
01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:36.690
<v 5>so there you go.
Why don't you buy to look at that?</v>

1071
01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.000
Because right after that it's going to be 1999.

1072
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:42.210
So then if you actually go out and buy two,
then if you come out to my show,

1073
01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:42.721
you'd be like,
Dude,

1074
01:04:42.721 --> 01:04:46.160
stop bitching about your free fucking podcast because I actually bought two year

1075
01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:50.010
DVDs and now be thinking in my head,
wow,
this guy dropped 40 bucks.

1076
01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:51.630
What a good shit.

1077
01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:54.060
And you'll be laughing because in the back of your head you're like,

1078
01:04:54.061 --> 01:04:57.240
actually I dropped 26 and change,
you know,

1079
01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:00.840
26 and change.
I mean,
what can you,

1080
01:05:00.841 --> 01:05:04.440
what can you get to have for $26?

1081
01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.000
I can get gum,
get two packs of gum.
Actually probably get a lot more than that.

1082
01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:12.840
Of course,
if you go to footlocker,
those fucking tee shirts you can get like,

1083
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:18.040
what can you get?
Like,
like 58 tee shirts at foot locker.
Is

1084
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.310
<v 10>that Michael Moore's next movie?
If I was Michael Moore and I was going,</v>

1085
01:05:21.311 --> 01:05:22.780
what the fuck should I in the next movie?

1086
01:05:22.781 --> 01:05:27.070
Should I make about how poor people are sad and rich people are evil?

1087
01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.330
I would try and find who are the people who may,
who

1088
01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.900
<v 11>are these bubal
[inaudible]</v>

1089
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:41.860
<v 10>um,
you know,
how do they give you fucking like nine t shirts for $18.</v>

1090
01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:45.700
How do they do that?
Um,
you know what,
this,

1091
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.630
I'm not even hung over,
but I just,
I rather than being hung over,

1092
01:05:49.631 --> 01:05:54.310
which I should have been,
but I wasn't,
but I'm not,
whatever I'm trying to say.

1093
01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:59.170
I just woke up with just weird music in my head.
You have to do that.
You wake up,

1094
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.190
you drank last night,
you're not hung over,
but he's,

1095
01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.180
you just wake up and then you just singing some song that you haven't even

1096
01:06:04.181 --> 01:06:08.530
thought of for years.
I was just walking around my,
my,
uh,

1097
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.580
fucking apartment here,
just walking around and going some like it hot,

1098
01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:17.940
some like it hot bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
Bapapapapa pap.

1099
01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:19.771
Then how it goes,

1100
01:06:19.771 --> 01:06:24.771
feel the heat burning into the knife or the night,

1101
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:30.360
whatever the fuck it is is at Robert Palmer.

1102
01:06:31.050 --> 01:06:34.020
So I'm like kid hot.
Ooh.
Robert Palmer.

1103
01:06:34.021 --> 01:06:37.320
Tell us about your new sexy,
sultry,

1104
01:06:37.321 --> 01:06:41.340
single with that hot Latino beat underneath it.
Well,

1105
01:06:41.341 --> 01:06:46.290
I had recently gone to Cuba and I are inserted a fucking Cohiba into some

1106
01:06:46.291 --> 01:06:49.170
fucking prostitutes,
a or fish.

1107
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:53.790
A dye was just really a overwhelmed by the culture down there and she fucking

1108
01:06:53.791 --> 01:06:56.610
hate that.
You know what I mean?

1109
01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:00.900
Whenever like the White Star tries to have some sort of ethnic beat under their

1110
01:07:00.901 --> 01:07:04.620
music and then they always get to talk about some trip that they took to Swahili

1111
01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:08.850
and how when they were sitting there in that Walden resort,

1112
01:07:08.851 --> 01:07:12.150
they somehow fucking absorbed the culture.
You know,

1113
01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:14.070
you guys have had gone down to the Caribbean,

1114
01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:16.830
you're gone down into the Caribbean.
However the fuck you say it.

1115
01:07:16.831 --> 01:07:19.620
Some people say Caribbean,
some people say Caribbean,

1116
01:07:20.850 --> 01:07:23.220
but to me it's,

1117
01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:28.400
it's all one beautiful universe because man down in the Caribbean to go scuba

1118
01:07:28.591 --> 01:07:31.830
diving,
to be nose to nose with a fucking Barracuda.

1119
01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.620
They get barracudas down there quick.

1120
01:07:34.621 --> 01:07:37.050
Why don't you look it up and then send me an email and tell me how fucking

1121
01:07:37.051 --> 01:07:37.890
uninformed I am.

1122
01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:42.020
<v 11>Actually,
Barracuda are indigenous to the ego of Brazil.</v>

1123
01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:45.940
<v 10>The fuck up.
I can look this shit up to.
What is that a freshwater fish.</v>

1124
01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:51.790
You go down to like fucking Uruguay.
Can you get a Barracuda Sandwich?
You know,

1125
01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:55.000
just to start your day rather than,
than getting like a bacon,
egg and cheese.

1126
01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.260
Did they do that and do they use the whole fish?

1127
01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:02.640
Because they're better than Americans where we would just like use like just the

1128
01:08:02.641 --> 01:08:03.780
best part of the fish.

1129
01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:07.230
And then the rest we would just sort of throw out the window,

1130
01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:12.030
just toss it back into the ocean and it get all hooked up with like old

1131
01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:16.340
rollerblades and fucking,
um,
those shoes.

1132
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:19.130
Every guy war in the late nineties.
Remember those fucking shoes,

1133
01:08:19.131 --> 01:08:23.750
those slip on shoes that sort of look like sneakers kind of look like shoes.

1134
01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:27.410
Remember those fucking things.
Where are all those right now?
Huh?

1135
01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:29.240
I'll tell you where they are.

1136
01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:31.100
They're floating out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,

1137
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:33.620
getting broken down in the sunlight.
Right.

1138
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:38.420
And then some dolphin inhales it and then you go out to Japan.
Right?

1139
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:43.010
And they don't give a fuck about dolphins.
You guys see the cove,
you know,

1140
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:48.860
they'll fucking Dolphin Schindler's list basically.

1141
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:49.550
I couldn't,

1142
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:52.970
I just heard what that movie was about and I fucking love animals so much that I

1143
01:08:52.971 --> 01:08:54.260
couldn't eat.
I couldn't even know.

1144
01:08:54.261 --> 01:08:57.650
Schindler's list actually had somebody fucking decent in it,

1145
01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:02.930
trying to help out those being slaughtered.
I what the fuck am,

1146
01:09:02.931 --> 01:09:06.020
I didn't even see the goddamn movie.
All I heard was a bunch of people,

1147
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:10.940
they drive these dolphins into this fucking cove and then they just beat him to

1148
01:09:10.941 --> 01:09:13.280
death.
And it was,
uh,

1149
01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:19.100
it was so fun just to hear.
It was so fucking sad.

1150
01:09:19.101 --> 01:09:23.060
And then it just made me so God damn angry that I was like,
you know what?

1151
01:09:23.061 --> 01:09:24.740
I'm not going to fuck.
I'm not gonna.
You know,

1152
01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:29.990
I'm not going to watch that stuff is what am I going to do?
Oh,

1153
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:35.930
who got himself to treat at the local Deli?
This is what,

1154
01:09:35.931 --> 01:09:37.400
this is how you get out of shape in New York.

1155
01:09:37.401 --> 01:09:38.930
Even though you walk around all the time,

1156
01:09:38.931 --> 01:09:40.820
as you just walk into a Deli and you're like,
you know what?

1157
01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:45.800
I'm going to start my day.
We're on our way to the perfect place,

1158
01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.640
the perfect place.
[inaudible].

1159
01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.410
That's another fucking song just popped in my head.

1160
01:09:51.411 --> 01:09:55.070
What does that from it step perfect place

1161
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.840
was that,
that was like a Hanna Barbera cartoon.

1162
01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.440
We're on our way to the perfect place.
That perfect place.

1163
01:10:04.670 --> 01:10:05.900
Anyways,
I'm sorry.

1164
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:08.570
This is like something I have weird hangovers sometimes I don't have a headache.

1165
01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:10.670
I just,
just music pops into my head.

1166
01:10:10.671 --> 01:10:15.320
Some like it hot [inaudible] hot Paul Paul,
Paul,
Paul,
Paul,

1167
01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:20.840
um,
anyways,
some white guy playing yoga blocks.
Does that sound Latino?

1168
01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:23.960
Speaking of Latino,
I went into,
well,

1169
01:10:23.961 --> 01:10:26.580
one of these little fucking Bodega's

1170
01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:32.410
now [inaudible] the s uh,

1171
01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:37.240
the fucking orange juicer.
Um,
I was up there and I,

1172
01:10:37.241 --> 01:10:41.090
I got myself an Oj and a banana because I'm really into these light breakfast is

1173
01:10:41.091 --> 01:10:41.360
now.

1174
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.510
I finally realized that when you wake up and you have a lumberjack breakfast at

1175
01:10:44.511 --> 01:10:48.680
seriously,
it's like I've been saying on this podcast,
it's like getting up.

1176
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:53.750
It's like if you just woke up the second you woke up and you just sprinted 400

1177
01:10:53.751 --> 01:10:57.890
yards without stretching or anything,
didn't even put on your fucking shoes.

1178
01:10:57.891 --> 01:11:01.340
He just ran down the street.
I'm on the fucking pebbles,
right?

1179
01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:05.750
That's what you're doing to your body.
That's why I started slow.

1180
01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:10.780
I get a little fucking corn based orange juice according to food inc all corn

1181
01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:15.690
now.
Ooh,
excuse me.
And then I have a banana,
you know,

1182
01:11:15.691 --> 01:11:17.370
which is like sort of like a

1183
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:23.400
baby food in a phallic form.
That's why it's like,

1184
01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:28.200
it's like a big fucking,
uh,
would have a big yellow dick.
One animal.

1185
01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:31.890
I got fucking Porno,
Star Canary if you want to to,

1186
01:11:36.970 --> 01:11:39.240
that's what it bananas like.
Right?
So typical New York,

1187
01:11:39.241 --> 01:11:42.630
I'm trying to eat healthy and then I look over and I see these two little

1188
01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:47.100
toasted balls to add to the fucking,
the,
the,
the,

1189
01:11:47.101 --> 01:11:50.340
the canary thing,
right?
Like they lopped off this fucking port nuts.

1190
01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:55.510
And I looked at the lady and I was like,
oh,
la,
Santa Rita,

1191
01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:59.280
what the fuck are those?
And she's like,
oh,
those are those,
uh,

1192
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.000
coconut balls.
And I was like,
get the fuck out of here.

1193
01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:08.140
And she says,
I can't get the fuck out of here.
I have to work.
And I said,
Nah,

1194
01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.580
I didn't mean it.
Literally.
I meant get the fuck Outta here.

1195
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:18.420
Those are made out of coconut.
And she said,
see?
And I was like,

1196
01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:21.960
I fucking love coconut,
you know?

1197
01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:26.100
And she started laughing like I never said you didn't fuck.
Oh,

1198
01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.460
do you want them?
And I'm like,
absolutely,
I want them.
So now I have him.

1199
01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:34.710
So I have to tell.
And you guys,
I was going to begin my day with a,

1200
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.050
you know,
eating really healthy.
I ended up grabbing two sugar balls,
actually.

1201
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.430
They're called,
uh,
I actually hear the Coco
Comodo

1202
01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:50.550
and underneath an English macaroon coconut.
Here's the ingredients,
sugar,

1203
01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:55.820
coconut.
And then in parentheses says,
may contain sodium metaphor,
wholesales,

1204
01:12:55.830 --> 01:13:00.050
hush,
hush for whiteness.
I love that shit.
Like how,

1205
01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:03.510
how much did they not even research?
What the fuck is?
Yeah,
I might,
it might,

1206
01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:03.960
it might,

1207
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:08.960
might have a little bit of this Meta by Sulfite for whiteness.

1208
01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:14.370
Well,
the coconuts white.
Why would you need to add to that?

1209
01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:18.930
Is this some coconut that you fucking had an awareness for?
Years,
egg whites,

1210
01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:23.700
invert sugar,
corn Syrup and salt.
So for the most part,

1211
01:13:23.701 --> 01:13:25.650
it's all natural except for the sodium.

1212
01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:30.030
Metapod bicep vice types of like for whiteness.
And I'm gonna try one.

1213
01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.733
Let's see.

1214
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:37.320
Sweet dreams are made of the eas.

1215
01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.570
How bad his fucking Annie Lennox.

1216
01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:44.160
When you think of the animals of the fucking baddest rock chicks,

1217
01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:47.550
we'll start with white chicks,
right?
We'll move all the way around.

1218
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.340
We'll start with the baddest white chicks of all time.

1219
01:13:50.341 --> 01:13:55.341
I would say fucking Annie Lennox in no particular order here.

1220
01:13:57.090 --> 01:13:59.820
If I was rolling stone,
I do an entire issue of this.

1221
01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.480
The hundreds greatest rock chicks of all time.

1222
01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.780
Rolling Stone really is clearly showing people.

1223
01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.710
If you haven't been paying attention,
how few people buying magazines now?

1224
01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:14.950
Oh that fucking listening to discussion.

1225
01:14:17.770 --> 01:14:22.750
There's like a donut.
Oh,
it's gross.
Ours too much.

1226
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:27.180
That's fucking disgusting.

1227
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:32.160
I have to take another bite cause now my sugar shot and arise.
All right,

1228
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.180
now I'm craving it.
Fuck man.
I need another hit man.
Oh,

1229
01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:42.240
oh yeah.
I stand corrected.

1230
01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:45.840
These are fucking delicious to eat.
The first bite.

1231
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.880
Is your body going?
No,
don't do it.
So it tastes like shit.

1232
01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:54.330
Then that sugar gets in your veins and it's like,
come on man.
You know,

1233
01:14:54.331 --> 01:14:56.940
you want it,
then you just keep going.

1234
01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:01.290
Like this is really rude to be eating on the mic.
All right.
Annie Lennox,

1235
01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:07.380
you know,
and that
can't even think now.

1236
01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:12.600
Any Linux,
the chick from the pretenders.
Chrissy Hind,

1237
01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:17.280
right?
Pat Benatar.

1238
01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.780
No,
that's not how I want it.
I,
you know,

1239
01:15:21.781 --> 01:15:25.080
I always get it confused with the chick from the runaways.
Joan Jett,

1240
01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:30.720
Joan jets,
the shit.
Um,
and she's still hot.

1241
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:33.610
<v 12>Okay.</v>

1242
01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:37.510
<v 10>God Damn it.
Those are fucking delicious.
Oh,</v>

1243
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:40.510
not after a swig of Oj though.
Gross.
Okay.

1244
01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:44.870
Yeah.
Really hard to chew.

1245
01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:47.093
<v 12>Okay.</v>

1246
01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:51.610
<v 10>Oh,
what am I fucking neighbors just here.
Just heard that.</v>

1247
01:15:51.611 --> 01:15:54.860
Wondering what the fuck I'm talking about?
Um,

1248
01:15:56.220 --> 01:16:00.100
all right,
sorry.
Sorry.
You know what?
I'm actually last night.

1249
01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:05.290
Um,
no,
finish your fucking talk,
Bill.
If you look at rolling stone,

1250
01:16:06.370 --> 01:16:10.240
they used to be this big magazine.
Just I'm talking about when you held it,

1251
01:16:10.241 --> 01:16:12.310
it was used to be like a fucking third bigger.

1252
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:15.340
Now they've shrunk it down to,

1253
01:16:15.341 --> 01:16:17.440
it's like a third of the size it used to be.

1254
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:20.260
And now every other month they're doing those,

1255
01:16:20.290 --> 01:16:23.710
those lists things 100 greatest guitarists of all time,

1256
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:28.600
the 100 greatest tambourine players of all time right now they have the hundred

1257
01:16:28.601 --> 01:16:31.570
greatest Beatles songs of all time.
It's like,

1258
01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:35.990
did they even write a hundred songs?
You know,

1259
01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.960
they just do that so people can,
you know,
they,

1260
01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:41.080
I guess people always buy those magazines and they go,
well too,
fuck,
oh,

1261
01:16:41.081 --> 01:16:44.230
can you put oh hey bulldog in front of,

1262
01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.700
well my guitar gently weeps and then people write notes.

1263
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:52.690
Was that really worth revisiting?
I don't think it was.

1264
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:53.800
Well those are my top three,

1265
01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:58.210
top three fucking white chick rock singers of all time.
And um,

1266
01:17:00.130 --> 01:17:02.470
well considering we've been talking so much about Latino's,

1267
01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:07.120
let's go with top three Latinos of all time,
Latino's singers.

1268
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:10.040
And this is when my whiteness is going to come to see if I can even

1269
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.830
<v 5>name three.
Uh,
Salina.</v>

1270
01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.620
They did a movie about her Salina,

1271
01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:20.180
Jennifer Lopez and um,

1272
01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:24.270
ah,
fuck.
This is embarrassing.

1273
01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:32.120
Lucille ball and Lucille Ball.
Fuck you.
She was married to Ricky Ricardo,
Bam.

1274
01:17:34.530 --> 01:17:37.740
Those year three,
but she never really sang.
Did she,
what the fuck?
I know.

1275
01:17:37.741 --> 01:17:42.190
I know more than that.
Selene.
I don't even know any songs.

1276
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:46.060
Selena was saying.
I just know she had a psycho fan.
That's all I know.

1277
01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:50.140
And the Jennifer Lopez plater.
Oh wait,
wait.

1278
01:17:50.141 --> 01:17:53.380
The chick from Miami sound machine,
right?

1279
01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:57.670
What songs did they sing?
Ooh,
Miami.

1280
01:17:58.990 --> 01:18:03.430
We have fucking taken over.
What songs did they sing?

1281
01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:07.030
I saw that fucking band stunk.
Miami sound machine,

1282
01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:12.110
all that fucking turquoise with all that.
That just die.

1283
01:18:12.111 --> 01:18:15.910
When I pictured that my chest was a bunch of people in puffy pants

1284
01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:22.530
and they had like 58 people on percussion and then like one keyboard and then

1285
01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:25.160
she was skipping around in her boots.
Right?
Isn't that what they're,

1286
01:18:25.170 --> 01:18:28.440
what Miami sound machine was the fuck songs do they say,

1287
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:33.750
God damn man,
I used to know all of this shit.
I can't get that.

1288
01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:37.240
Robert Palmer Shit out of my head anyways,
whatever.
So I want to learn some,

1289
01:18:37.241 --> 01:18:40.380
tell me,
give me your top three Latino fucking singers of all time.

1290
01:18:40.650 --> 01:18:44.040
I know somebody who's already compiling a list and getting pissed at me because

1291
01:18:44.041 --> 01:18:45.810
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

1292
01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:50.970
But that's what people do on this podcast.
Mike,
last week I made a,

1293
01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:56.490
I made a reference to the Pullman strike when I was reading about a Grover

1294
01:18:56.490 --> 01:18:59.580
Cleveland or some shit like that.
And this guy wrote the roads,
hey,

1295
01:18:59.581 --> 01:19:00.810
uninformed bill.

1296
01:19:00.811 --> 01:19:04.920
The reason they brought the military in during the Pullman strike was because

1297
01:19:04.921 --> 01:19:08.580
the workers in quotes,
he puts,
we're becoming violent.

1298
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:13.320
Not because they were striking because they were attacking the alternate workers

1299
01:19:13.321 --> 01:19:17.310
brought in to fill the void of labour caused by this strike.

1300
01:19:18.090 --> 01:19:20.370
And this is hilarious.
The guy writes down his name,

1301
01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:23.940
marketing and business development coordinator.

1302
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:27.380
Yet you sound like the guy who would side with the fucking people who,

1303
01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:32.760
who are underpaying.
It's first of all,
why do you put workers in,
in,
uh,

1304
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:37.360
in parentheses?
You know what I mean?

1305
01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:41.960
The strike was because the workers were becoming violent,

1306
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:44.930
not because they were striking,
because they were attacking the,

1307
01:19:44.931 --> 01:19:49.760
the scabs they brought into to take their jobs.
That's part of a strike.

1308
01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:54.560
You dumb fuck.
You know,
and you know,
I love to sir,

1309
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:57.620
is the way you're acting as though you had even heard of the Pullman strike

1310
01:19:57.621 --> 01:19:58.371
before I said it.

1311
01:19:58.371 --> 01:20:00.980
That's that classic Internet Shit where you don't have to go to the library

1312
01:20:00.981 --> 01:20:01.460
anymore.

1313
01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:04.410
He just look up the Pullman strike and then you read two paragraphs and then

1314
01:20:04.411 --> 01:20:08.970
you're like,
oh,
actually,
you know what the reason is you're just as dumb as me,

1315
01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:11.130
sir.
Of course,

1316
01:20:11.131 --> 01:20:14.070
they attack the scab workers brought in because now they're going to be out of

1317
01:20:14.071 --> 01:20:16.500
out of a job.
And that was my point.

1318
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:21.230
And who does the military side with the military works for the fucking rich

1319
01:20:21.231 --> 01:20:24.560
people.
All right.
If you don't fucking believe that,

1320
01:20:24.710 --> 01:20:29.140
that I'm not going to eat another fucking coconut ball.
Oh,

1321
01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:35.230
it just gets better.
No,
it doesn't.
All right,
that's enough of that.

1322
01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:40.090
Jesus Christ.
Jesus.
All right,
let's talk NFL football.

1323
01:20:40.091 --> 01:20:40.924
Everybody.

1324
01:20:41.230 --> 01:20:44.320
<v 10>Oh,

1325
01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:47.260
I made a video on there,
um,

1326
01:20:47.770 --> 01:20:51.820
where I did a little tour of the comedy store and Elsa stood outside the comedy

1327
01:20:51.821 --> 01:20:54.550
store and they talk shit about some of the people walking by down the street.

1328
01:20:54.551 --> 01:20:59.160
If you guys want to check it out,

All right.
I uh,

1334
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:18.870
was very impressed with the amount of people that,
uh,

1335
01:21:18.871 --> 01:21:21.840
that that went ahead and bought the a ringtone if he didn't listen last week.

1336

<v 5>you know,</v>

1338
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:31.860
that way I don't have to really charge for the fucking podcast and it's also a,

1339
01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:37.030
um,
it's not required if you want to do what you can.

1340
01:21:37.031 --> 01:21:39.810
If you don't,
you don't,
it's no big deal.
And uh,

1341
01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:42.670
we have all the instructions up there.
If you have an iPhone,

1342
01:21:42.730 --> 01:21:44.680
it goes right onto your phone.
If you have a blackberry,

1343
01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:47.800
there's like one little thing you have to do with something,

1344
01:21:47.801 --> 01:21:52.480
but they have all the instructions on the m podcast on how to upload it to your

1345
01:21:52.481 --> 01:21:56.010
phone.
And um,
you know,

1346
01:21:56.011 --> 01:21:58.730
we just want to thank everybody for being patient,
uh,
for a couple,

1347
01:21:58.750 --> 01:22:01.320
took a couple of days to explain it to,
to get the information out there.

1348
01:22:01.321 --> 01:22:04.740
So I wanted to thank you guys for chipping and seriously means a lot to me that

1349
01:22:04.741 --> 01:22:06.930
people actually went out and supported the podcasts like that.

1350
01:22:06.931 --> 01:22:09.810
So thank you from the bottom of my heart.

1351
01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:13.830
And the gentleman who runs the MM podcast.com.
All right.
And with that

1352
01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.960
<v 10>Bop,
bop,
bop,
bop,
bop,</v>

1353
01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:20.380
<v 5>it's time to talk about NFL football here.
Um,</v>

1354
01:22:20.410 --> 01:22:24.250
I actually was flying on a plane during the Patriots game,

1355
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:28.030
so I can't really talk too much about it.
Other than that,
I just,
I was watching,

1356
01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:32.770
I actually had satellite TV on,
on the,
on the plane,
so I was sitting there going,

1357
01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:34.240
Oh fuck,
I'm gonna miss the fucking game.

1358
01:22:34.241 --> 01:22:37.180
And then I see that they're going to have satellite TV.

1359
01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.440
And I got excited all boy.
Oh boy.
Right.
And I fucking turn it on and all I get,

1360
01:22:41.441 --> 01:22:42.640
I had NBC

1361
01:22:44.410 --> 01:22:46.690
and then the rest were like discovery animal planet.

1362
01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.360
And then they had three ESPNs.
Okay.

1363
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:53.460
<v 10>So I'm praying how I hope and pray that I will,</v>

1364
01:22:53.461 --> 01:22:58.020
but today I am still just a bill.
Um,
fuck you.

1365
01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.630
The songs are in my head because I'm hung over.

1366
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:05.860
I'm praying that the Patriots game was going to be on NBC.

1367
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.860
<v 5>And it turned out that not only was the game not on NBC,</v>

1368
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:11.620
they didn't even have a football game on NBC.

1369
01:23:11.621 --> 01:23:15.700
They had some fucking infomercial on insults.

1370
01:23:16.150 --> 01:23:19.360
So I was like,
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
Right?

1371
01:23:20.150 --> 01:23:24.670
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
And uh,
so then I,
I just was watching ESPN.

1372
01:23:25.570 --> 01:23:29.290
I was watching all the college football games that I already watched.
Uh,

1373
01:23:29.291 --> 01:23:31.030
I think Michigan's back,
everybody

1374
01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:37.420
hail to the victors value yet hell to the victor

1375
01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:39.590
[inaudible]

1376
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:44.380
<v 13>bap,

So

1378
01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:48.461
<v 5>you want to just sit there?</v>

1379
01:23:48.461 --> 01:23:53.020
I did three fucking college songs and they all sound the exact fucking same hail

1380
01:23:53.021 --> 01:23:56.170
to the victors.
Wake up the echoes and fucking uh,

1381
01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:00.550
the Fleetwood Mac Trojan band.
It's all all the same shit.

1382
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:03.820
Anyways.
Yeah.
So I watched that and I watched the uh,

1383
01:24:03.821 --> 01:24:08.260
the USA basketball game against a Turkey.
That was the shit.

1384
01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:11.590
And uh,
we won that championship.
But anyways,

1385
01:24:11.591 --> 01:24:14.410
I was watching the ticker and by the way,

1386
01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:18.070
what's his face there is going to be the next superstar.

1387
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:21.070
And I saw him when he played in Seattle and I can't even remember his fucking

1388
01:24:21.071 --> 01:24:24.070
name already cause I'm that fucking hung over.

1389
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:28.900
Come on brain work for me
because with a d,

1390
01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:33.430
I can't fucking remember,
but he was the shit he was hitting.
Fall away.

1391
01:24:33.431 --> 01:24:37.150
Three pointers as a six,
10.
I even know what position you play.
I don't know.

1392
01:24:37.151 --> 01:24:40.480
I don't know shit about basketball.
All right,
let's plow ahead here.
Um,

1393
01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:47.080
patriots won.
The cults lost,
so I'm excited,
right?
I'm so,
so excited.

1394
01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:50.590
How about Detroit?
How about Cleveland?
Come on.
You guys,
you've got admit,

1395
01:24:50.591 --> 01:24:54.610
you know,
you had a little bit,
uh,
I think,
I think that does this,
uh,

1396
01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:59.290
a ray of light.
I didn't see any either one of those fucking games,

1397
01:24:59.291 --> 01:25:02.770
but I was just,
I was just watching the ticker and um,

1398
01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.510
I saw that that dude from outplay for cal best tattoo touchdowns,

1399
01:25:07.511 --> 01:25:12.430
right.
And Cleveland was basically one in the fucking game right down to the end.

1400
01:25:12.431 --> 01:25:15.070
I know I'm not trying to talk down to you guys,
but I'm just saying,
you know,

1401
01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:18.900
whenever you beat Miami,
that's got to feel good luck.
You know,

1402
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.630
it's the main reason why I'm bringing this shit up is,

1403
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:23.860
is because I want to say this shit before the fucking game comes out tonight.

1404
01:25:24.010 --> 01:25:28.810
I got 50 bucks on the ravens tonight.
Straight up.
I bet it's straight up.

1405
01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:32.290
Even though the jets are favored by like six.
I don't know what the line is,

1406
01:25:32.291 --> 01:25:35.710
but I was like,
you know what?
You can keep your fucking points there,
missy.

1407
01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:38.800
I don't give a shit.
That's how confident I am.

1408
01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:43.390
How fucking dumb are the New York jets?

1409
01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:45.520
What do they,
can you just,

1410
01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:50.640
can somebody explain to me the strategy of pissing off every fucking every team

1411
01:25:54.011 --> 01:25:57.190
in the league?
It's first of all,

1412
01:25:57.191 --> 01:26:02.191
I love it being a patriots fan because for the first time in 10 fucking years

1413
01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:04.160
nobody was talking

1414
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.070
<v 10>about bill Belicheck.
Nobody was talking about the Patriots.</v>

1415
01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.050
Nobody was talking about Tom Brady.
Really?

1416
01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:13.760
The guy even got into a fucking car accident and that was barely a fucking story

1417
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:17.720
compared to the shit storm

1418
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:22.130
<v 5>that is going on with the New York jets.
What?
What are they doing?</v>

1419
01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:24.680
Let me ask you guys a question.

1420
01:26:24.681 --> 01:26:28.880
How amped up does Ray Lewis get before a football game when,

1421
01:26:28.881 --> 01:26:31.220
when the other team hasn't talked shit about them?

1422
01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.730
Are they out there out of their fucking minds?
Ray Lewis,

1423
01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:37.370
I put it on my Facebook page.
That's my prediction.

1424
01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:42.380
He is going to rip Sanchez his fucking head off tonight.
Sanchez.

1425
01:26:42.650 --> 01:26:45.860
This guy who everybody for some reason they're forgetting

1426
01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:50.530
<v 10>the up and down season that he had last year and they're,</v>

1427
01:26:50.531 --> 01:26:54.310
they're acting like they have this proven quarterback.

1428
01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:58.390
I don't get it man.
And they went out and they drafted all,
they got signed,

1429
01:26:58.391 --> 01:26:59.590
all these free agents,

1430
01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:03.760
they're really reminded me of the University of Miami when they got off the

1431
01:27:03.761 --> 01:27:06.280
plane wearing the fatigues and they were talking all this shit.

1432
01:27:06.281 --> 01:27:08.620
And then when it came down to it,
they didn't fucking win anything.

1433
01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:10.253
<v 5>Remember that?</v>

1434
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:12.940
<v 10>Well,
like the,
the Los Angeles Lakers,</v>

1435
01:27:12.941 --> 01:27:15.520
when they added Gary Payton and Karl Malone,
and you're thinking,

1436
01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:19.780
how can they not fucking,
and then they didn't,
I don't,

1437
01:27:19.781 --> 01:27:23.860
I don't get it that that year when the Patriots went undefeated in the regular

1438
01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:26.890
season and then get their asses kicked in in the super bowl by the giants,

1439
01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:32.100
it's like the hype was so fucking big that from November on,

1440
01:27:33.010 --> 01:27:35.780
we were playing playoff games.
Teams were coming in

1441
01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:40.380
<v 5>so fucking amped up to kick the shit out of us.
It just wore it.</v>

1442
01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:44.970
It wore us down.
It was down to me while no one's paying attention to the giants,

1443
01:27:44.971 --> 01:27:49.500
to the point that Jane has put up like 35 points and the last week of the season

1444
01:27:49.501 --> 01:27:50.334
against us.

1445
01:27:50.490 --> 01:27:53.940
And for some reason we were still 14 point favorites three fucking weeks later

1446
01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:58.230
to this day,
I kicked myself for not taking that bet.
And uh,

1447
01:27:59.790 --> 01:28:00.890
yeah,
it was ridiculous.
I mean,

1448
01:28:00.891 --> 01:28:04.340
while the giants had beaten Tampa Bay in Tampa Bay,
they beat Dallas in Dallas.

1449
01:28:04.630 --> 01:28:06.960
They beat Green Bay and Green Bay and no one's paying attention to them.

1450
01:28:07.410 --> 01:28:09.550
Then everybody sat there with the jaws on the ground.
They kicked him,

1451
01:28:09.570 --> 01:28:13.320
didn't even kick the shit out of us.
They just beat us like,
holy fuck.

1452
01:28:13.530 --> 01:28:17.280
How did this team that beat three awesome teams and their own fucking building

1453
01:28:17.281 --> 01:28:20.640
come in and beat us is fucking ridiculous.

1454
01:28:20.641 --> 01:28:25.641
So the jets have started their season at zero and zero with the whole league as

1455
01:28:26.911 --> 01:28:29.730
amped up the kick the shit out of them as people were amped up to beat the

1456
01:28:29.731 --> 01:28:32.400
fucking patriots.
It by mid November.

1457
01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.760
<v 10>All right,
and I'm telling you right now,</v>

1458
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:38.070
they are going to have a mediocre fucking season.

1459
01:28:38.071 --> 01:28:39.990
I think it's going to start off with the loss tonight.

1460
01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:44.400
I'm not saying that they're not going to go nine and seven,
but these guys,

1461
01:28:44.401 --> 01:28:47.280
I don't know what the fucking problem is and not to mention that now they have a

1462
01:28:47.281 --> 01:28:51.600
nice little scandal here.
Cover the daily news.
They says,
cool.
Your jets,

1463
01:28:51.630 --> 01:28:54.900
TV reporter,
flags team for Lewd behavior.

1464
01:28:56.370 --> 01:28:57.203
<v 5>Um,</v>

1465
01:28:57.990 --> 01:29:02.370
Ian is saints reporter for as TV.

1466
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:10.680
<v 10>Where the fuck is that broadcast?
It's is at the center of a jet Brouhaha.</v>

1467
01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:14.220
Basically,
if you see this girl,
she's fucking hottie right?

1468
01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:18.240
She's got her little pass here.
And uh,
you know,

1469
01:29:18.241 --> 01:29:21.330
she's got some Cleveland show.
Oh my God.
Are you serious?

1470
01:29:24.630 --> 01:29:26.850
They got a picture of her edit jets practice.

1471
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:30.930
She's got on the tightest fucking jeans I've ever seen in my life with the most

1472
01:29:30.931 --> 01:29:34.770
perfect round ass you've ever seen.
And she's in high heels.

1473
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:36.211
Okay.

1474
01:29:36.211 --> 01:29:39.810
And she's walking around a bunch of football players who got that testosterone

1475
01:29:39.811 --> 01:29:43.110
going with a fat shit-talking coach.
Let me guess.

1476
01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:47.730
Somebody said something out of line.
Oh,
this is just,
this is,

1477
01:29:47.731 --> 01:29:49.770
you know what I mean?
This right here.

1478
01:29:49.771 --> 01:29:51.540
And this is one of these things where you can't say,

1479
01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:55.470
we'll look how you're dressed cause they go,
you're playing the victim.

1480
01:29:56.250 --> 01:30:01.250
She should have a right to have three quarters ever tits outside of her shirt

1481
01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:04.770
with a thong going up her fucking ass crack.

1482
01:30:04.770 --> 01:30:09.770
And she should be allowed to walk into a locker room with a bunch of football

1483
01:30:09.811 --> 01:30:14.811
players and not have one out of fucking whatever the fuck are you going to say?

1484
01:30:15.301 --> 01:30:17.490
Well,
one fucking rude comic.
Give me a break.

1485
01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:23.340
Nfl boss Roger Goodell was demanding answers last night from jets players.
Well,

1486
01:30:23.341 --> 01:30:27.150
why don't you look at the pictures,
Roger.
Huh?

1487
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:31.480
What are you a fucking unit?
You don't understand what the problem was.
Uh,

1488
01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:32.191
for players,

1489
01:30:32.191 --> 01:30:37.191
coaches accused of subjecting of female sports reporter to sexist locker room

1490
01:30:37.861 --> 01:30:42.570
conduct.
They should've just said for subjecting her to lock a room conduct.

1491
01:30:42.810 --> 01:30:44.160
This is basically what happened.

1492
01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:48.810
She went into a locker room and was subjected to locker room conduct.

1493
01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:49.710
Can you believe it?

1494
01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:54.770
I remember last night when I went out to a bar and I was subjected to barroom

1495
01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:57.180
conduct.
I couldn't believe it.
I was like,

1496
01:30:57.210 --> 01:31:02.210
what am I in a bar or something as they prepare for their season opener tonight,

1497
01:31:02.650 --> 01:31:06.990
gang green is dealing with the burgeoning scandal over the treatment of Inez

1498
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:10.200
Saints,
uh,
for Azteca of Mexico.

1499
01:31:10.710 --> 01:31:15.420
This girl is a 10.
She's fucking smoking gorgeous Emmy.

1500
01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:21.300
You got to see the way she's dressed.
Okay.
And Fuck you ladies.

1501
01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:24.480
Fuck you.
Look at the way she's dressed.
She's one of those,

1502
01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:27.420
you know what's funny about the broads out there?
It is.
This is the kind of girl,

1503
01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.410
right?
The kind of woman that kind of fucking who,
uh,
who,

1504
01:31:31.411 --> 01:31:35.210
if you know any of these women,
you know,
we'll listen to his podcast.

1505
01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:38.430
They walking down the street with their husband and this girl comes walking by,

1506
01:31:38.610 --> 01:31:40.290
they immediately,
they date fucking,
you know,

1507
01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:43.590
in the eyes become like little slits.
Is He looking at me?
You know,

1508
01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:46.530
and then they're looking at their husband and they're going to get mad at you

1509
01:31:46.650 --> 01:31:49.260
because this other bitch goes to the gym.
You know,

1510
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:55.230
like somehow it's your fucking fault and they fucking looking at you because

1511
01:31:55.231 --> 01:31:58.320
they can't just come out and say,
oh my God,
that girl is fucking gorgeous.

1512
01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:02.650
I'm so jealous her,
they,
they can't,
they can't own that emotion.

1513
01:32:02.651 --> 01:32:06.820
So then they look at you and they're just waiting for you to glance in that pert

1514
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
and that woman's direction so they can blame you that this fuck another girl is

1515
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:15.460
eaten,
right?
And,
and fucking doing herself up.
Right?

1516
01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:19.990
It's going to become your fucking fault.
I used to do a bit about that.

1517
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:21.183
Next time you,
you know,

1518
01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:24.130
here's one for you guys to burn a joke right here that I never fucking recorded.

1519
01:32:24.131 --> 01:32:27.100
So who gives a shit next time you walking down the street with your girlfriend,

1520
01:32:27.101 --> 01:32:31.030
right in this fucking unbelievably smoking check comes walking up the street,

1521
01:32:31.031 --> 01:32:33.550
right?
And what do you got?
And she immediately just looks at you like,

1522
01:32:33.551 --> 01:32:36.640
go ahead and look at her so I can take out my fucking hatred of this better

1523
01:32:36.641 --> 01:32:39.460
looking girl and make it your fucking fault,
right?
This is what you do.

1524
01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:43.150
Rather than trying to look away and having blood come out out of your eyes.

1525
01:32:43.151 --> 01:32:46.360
You try not to look at this fucking hot peas.
Hey,
it's coming up the street.

1526
01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:51.260
What you do is you fucking point right at her and whatever she's wearing,

1527
01:32:51.410 --> 01:32:54.860
you tell your girl that she'd look great in that you point right.

1528
01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:57.590
And I'd be like,
you know what?
You'd look great in a dress like that.
Right?

1529
01:32:58.350 --> 01:33:02.040
And then immediately just a p,
you know,
it makes her insecurity go,
oh my God.

1530
01:33:02.041 --> 01:33:03.780
Really?
Do you think I could get away with wearing something?

1531
01:33:04.050 --> 01:33:08.310
They totally huge girls failing.
Good.
You're staring at the girl's ass.

1532
01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:11.010
You're talking about the cut of the dress.
It's bullshit.

1533
01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:15.060
You're checking around without disrespecting your woman.
See right there.

1534
01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:19.380
Bill Burke bringing couples together.
All right,

1537
01:33:31.031 --> 01:33:35.230
she was bombarded with cat calls and boarish antiques at the jets,

1538
01:33:35.231 --> 01:33:38.770
New Jersey training facility to the extent she wanted to.

1539
01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:43.990
And in quotes that cover my ears.
I'm dying of embarrassment.

1540
01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:46.810
Yeah.
This woman,
right?

1541
01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:52.050
Former Miss Universe contestant who would walk on stage with a fucking string

1542
01:33:52.151 --> 01:33:56.470
bikini and high heels with the hoo ha hanging out talking about how to save

1543
01:33:56.471 --> 01:34:00.980
Greenland or whatever is embarrassed cause she walked around.
I mean give me a,

1544
01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:05.170
you know what I mean?
This is why women stink.

1545
01:34:07.050 --> 01:34:10.200
It's like,
what are you doing there to begin with?

1546
01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:13.890
It's a bunch of guys playing football can,
it's like,

1547
01:34:14.250 --> 01:34:18.660
and then we're cool enough to let you in there and then everybody has to fucking

1548
01:34:18.661 --> 01:34:23.400
adjust their behavior because your there waig scares me.

1549
01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:27.990
Scares me.
There's a lady present.
You know what I mean?

1550
01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:32.940
And You wonder why you get called a cunt.
That's why.

1551
01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:37.050
Right fucking there.
It's just fucking unbelievable.

1552
01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:42.360
I would never walk into a Goddamn baby shower be,
oh,
excuse me.
Excuse me.

1553
01:34:42.361 --> 01:34:43.530
There's a guy president,

1554
01:34:43.531 --> 01:34:47.580
can we put a fucking game on Ovia I wouldn't.

1555
01:34:48.450 --> 01:34:52.600
I'd be standing in the and going,
oh Geez,
when is this Shit gonna be over?

1556
01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:56.410
But I wouldn't at any point try to cock block what anybody was fucking talking

1557
01:34:56.411 --> 01:34:58.790
about.
Go ahead and talk about sex in the city.

1558
01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:03.020
Talk about your favorite shoes or whatever the fuck it is you do.

1559
01:35:03.021 --> 01:35:06.840
I wouldn't be covering my ears.
Dying of embarrassment.

1560
01:35:06.841 --> 01:35:09.780
If you all started talking about my package,
I'd be flattered.

1561
01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:12.353
<v 12>Okay.</v>

1562
01:35:12.630 --> 01:35:15.480
<v 10>Um,
this is some of the more ignorant shit that I've sat on this podcast,</v>

1563
01:35:15.481 --> 01:35:19.670
but I think there's a point behind this.
Let's continue with the article.
MMM.

1564
01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:25.830
Goodell is she said,
I'm dying of embarrassment.
Saints tweeted in Spanish,

1565
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000
um,

1566
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Goodell immediately ordered an investigation into the troubling in air quotes,

1567
01:35:32.071 --> 01:35:36.840
allegations,
which were addressed in a team meeting last night.
Uh,

1568
01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:39.330
there's meeting is now called to order,
uh,

1569
01:35:39.390 --> 01:35:43.170
last night when that smoking hot chick with the tight clothes came in and

1570
01:35:43.171 --> 01:35:46.140
everybody said,
God Damn,
look at that fucking ass.
Yeah.

1571
01:35:46.141 --> 01:35:50.890
You're not allowed to do that anymore.
Uh,
excuse me,

1572
01:35:50.891 --> 01:35:53.140
coach.
Ah,
yeah.
Yes sir.
Yeah.
Well,

1573
01:35:53.230 --> 01:35:55.930
you're talking about that girl who came in and her titties way hanging out of

1574
01:35:55.990 --> 01:36:00.010
her shirt.
Yeah,
that one.
Yeah,
that one.
We are disrespected her.

1575
01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:08.170
See,
this is,
this is the deal.
All right.
They come down,

1576
01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:12.910
they want the fucking attention.
You know what?
Wait,
what is she,

1577
01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:17.380
what is she doing in the fucking locker room to begin with?
You know?

1578
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.890
Well,
she even in the locker room,
did I even,
they even say that.
I can't remember.

1579
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:24.760
Didn't you see any given Sunday?
You don't remember that movie?

1580
01:36:24.761 --> 01:36:27.100
You're going to stand there and there's gonna be some black dude with a dick

1581
01:36:27.101 --> 01:36:29.320
down to the floor.
I mean,
why are you going in?

1582
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:34.260
I wouldn't go in there if I went in there,
they'd start giving me cat calls.

1583
01:36:34.410 --> 01:36:39.240
Like I was that fresh fish guy when the beginning of shots,
Shawshank redemption,

1584
01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:44.960
and I'd be dying of embarrassment too,
but I'd fucking take it.
It'd be like,
ah,

1585
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:46.910
well what the fuck did you think was going to happen?

1586
01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:51.020
You're a fucking Pansy and you come walking into an NFL locker room,

1587
01:36:51.021 --> 01:36:55.810
they're all going to give you shit and say you're a pussy,
right?
I mean,

1588
01:36:55.811 --> 01:36:58.720
what kind of a fucking world are we living in now?

1589
01:36:58.870 --> 01:37:00.910
When a gorgeous woman wearing tight,

1590
01:37:00.911 --> 01:37:05.911
ridiculous clothes is going to walk into a fucking at a football practice and

1591
01:37:06.071 --> 01:37:09.880
she's going to get upset that she got unwanted attention.
Well,

1592
01:37:09.881 --> 01:37:14.430
why don't you come there and dress like they did in the 18 hundreds with one of

1593
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:17.070
the big hoop skirts so they can't see you fucking thighs.

1594
01:37:17.370 --> 01:37:21.600
This chick is fucking ridiculous.
Look,

1595
01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:25.320
look at the New York Daily News and look at the little inset picture that they

1596
01:37:25.321 --> 01:37:29.550
have of her.
I'm sure they did it for a fucking reason.
It's ridiculous.

1597
01:37:30.450 --> 01:37:33.810
Look at that fucking ass.
Look at it.
That's the first thing I think.

1598
01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:36.810
Look at that fucking ass.
Jesus Christ.

1599
01:37:36.811 --> 01:37:40.140
And then she's holding a Mike looks like a dick in her hand while she bobbing

1600
01:37:40.141 --> 01:37:43.320
her head up and down and she asked the questions.
This is like entrapment.

1601
01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:45.550
<v 12>Okay.</v>

1602
01:37:45.550 --> 01:37:48.940
<v 10>Anyways,
let's fucking continue.
Um,
but Papa,
Papa,</v>

1603
01:37:48.941 --> 01:37:52.600
we've had contact with the team multiple times and are moving very aggressively

1604
01:37:52.601 --> 01:37:56.190
to establish the facts.
The NFL spokesman Greg,

1605
01:37:56.220 --> 01:38:01.220
<v 5>I Hilo said jets owner woody Johnson woke up from his coma and said,</v>

1606
01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:04.010
oh,
wait,
that guy,
that guy's actually young,
uh,

1607
01:38:04.110 --> 01:38:07.450
called saints to hear his side of the story,
uh,
said that,

1608
01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:12.060
that the team will take any appropriate steps necessary to maintain a respectful

1609
01:38:12.061 --> 01:38:13.470
environment for the media.
Basically,

1610
01:38:13.471 --> 01:38:18.471
this girl is now going to become a fucking millionaire off of this lawsuit

1611
01:38:19.230 --> 01:38:24.230
because she walked to an NFL practice were there miss universe body with tight

1612
01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:27.150
fucking clothes on?
And somebody said,
God Damn,

1613
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:31.890
look at that fucking ass right there.
Hey mark,

1614
01:38:31.891 --> 01:38:35.760
what the fuck would you do with dad?
Right?
I'd fucking Ben Rover fucking table

1615
01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:41.070
and then fucking rex Ryan.
I can't even see in my fucking my fucking stomach.

1616
01:38:41.071 --> 01:38:45.750
So big.
Huh?
Was that a good one?
Players.
Do you guys like me?
I talk just like you.

1617
01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:47.940
I can't wait for them to fucking lose tonight.

1618
01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:52.500
They're going to get their fucking asses kicked and that can get their asses

1619
01:38:52.501 --> 01:38:53.580
kicked,
but they're going to lose.

1620
01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:56.710
They're going to lose them then they're going to have a short week.
All right,

1621
01:38:56.820 --> 01:39:00.430
and guess who's back the New England patriots?
Huh?

1622
01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:03.860
38 fucking points up against.
Oh,

1623
01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:10.650
Sinco Terrell Owens.
Kate Mckinnon.
What's the name of your quarterback?
Something.

1624
01:39:10.651 --> 01:39:14.220
Wilson.
I don't even know the name of your fucking quarterback.
He was awesome.

1625
01:39:14.221 --> 01:39:16.800
And then he got hurt.
He's actually a good quarterback with the fuck's his name.

1626
01:39:16.801 --> 01:39:21.090
I know it's not caving now.
Ucla fucking Heisman trophy winner.

1627
01:39:21.091 --> 01:39:24.450
Classic Chicago Bear quarterback drug draft.

1628
01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:29.040
They love Kate Mcdowell and they loved the Rex Grossman for some reason they

1629
01:39:29.041 --> 01:39:32.670
didn't like Doug Flutie.
Let's keep,
let's ship him out of there.
Really,

1630
01:39:32.671 --> 01:39:35.250
you want to ship a proven winner out?
Absolutely.

1631
01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:39.570
We don't want him around here leading the team to victories.

1632
01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:45.690
Where the fuck is that under the Goddamn patriots game here?
Oh,
Carson Palmer.

1633
01:39:46.650 --> 01:39:51.110
This is what I love about that man.
He was 34 for 50 for 345 yards.
Oh,

1634
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:54.480
chose Sinco had 12 catches for 159 yards.

1635
01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:59.610
All right.
Yet they only scored 24 fucking points.

1636
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:03.020
You know my buddy was saying it,
they,

1637
01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:06.210
they getting back to that bend but don't break.
You know,

1638
01:40:06.211 --> 01:40:08.640
someone else was telling me Belicheck is doing the defense again,

1639
01:40:08.670 --> 01:40:13.530
which is his fucking,
that's,
that's what he does.
I don't know.

1640
01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:17.670
I have a,
I have high hopes,
but you know it's not about the patriots this year.

1641
01:40:17.671 --> 01:40:22.420
It's all about the JTS jets,
jets,
jets.
Right.
Run in their fucking yaps.

1642
01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:26.520
You wanted the attention now you got it.
Ah,
I can't fucking wait.

1643
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:31.230
Do you guys looked up the stats of that fucking Joe Flacco,
Joe Falco,

1644
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:33.090
whatever the fuck his name is.
I didn't know what his name is.

1645
01:40:33.150 --> 01:40:35.640
All I know is they raped us last year in the playoffs.

1646
01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:39.870
You got ray rice is going to be running all over you fucking cunts.
Huh?

1647
01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:43.110
What do you think?
Cause you got that old guy from the dolphins,

1648
01:40:43.290 --> 01:40:44.460
that good looking son of a bitch.

1649
01:40:44.461 --> 01:40:48.780
You should be doing fucking underwear ads like Jim Palmer.
That's the guy.

1650
01:40:48.810 --> 01:40:50.460
That's the guy that's going to stop everybody.

1651
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:53.160
That dude has been shown up late to practice.

1652
01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:56.230
Rex Ryan is making a joke out of it because he has such a fucking need to be

1653
01:40:56.231 --> 01:40:59.320
liked by his own goddamn players.
You wait,

1654
01:40:59.590 --> 01:41:02.840
you wait to the fucking wheels fall off.
All right,
here's,

1655
01:41:02.841 --> 01:41:05.710
here's a contest I want.
I want to introduce here.
How about

1656
01:41:07.450 --> 01:41:08.950
whoever guesses which week?

1657
01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:13.720
Rex Ryan's going to fucking cry first after which game.

1658
01:41:14.170 --> 01:41:15.010
If you pick it right,

1659
01:41:15.130 --> 01:41:19.420
I'm going to send you an autographed copy of my new fucking DVD.
So there you go.

1660
01:41:19.421 --> 01:41:24.280
People,
he got fucking 17 weeks to pick when actually not this week,

1661
01:41:24.281 --> 01:41:26.080
16 weeks.
I'm including the bye week.

1662
01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:30.640
The first week he's going to start fucking crying because somebody criticized,

1663
01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:35.500
you know,
or somebody stole his m and m flavored fucking ice cream.
All right.

1664
01:41:35.501 --> 01:41:38.740
Enough of this shit.
That's my thing.
I got 50 bucks,

1665
01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:42.490
50 bucks in the Ravens and I'm confident.

1666
01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:47.680
I'm confident that not only I didn't even take the spread straight up.

1667
01:41:48.190 --> 01:41:49.870
Can you tell,
I don't know what else to talk about.

1668
01:41:49.871 --> 01:41:51.850
I just keep saying over and over again what my bet is.

1669
01:41:51.851 --> 01:41:56.410
Let's talk about depression.
Shall We?
Speaking of fucking Rex Ryan,
um,

1670
01:41:56.411 --> 01:42:00.700
somebody sent me a long email here that should eat up some time.
Um,

1671
01:42:01.090 --> 01:42:04.090
I actually did,
I tell you guys last night,
we actually recorded me.

1672
01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:07.660
Andrew Rosa got fucking hammered last night and we like,
you know,
we should do,

1673
01:42:07.661 --> 01:42:10.600
we should go home and record a drunk,
uninformed.
I'm like,

1674
01:42:10.601 --> 01:42:13.570
well I have to do the Monday morning podcast.
He goes,
we'll fucking do that too.

1675
01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:19.080
So last night for an hour in a half as we sat there drinking and getting even

1676
01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:26.920
more drunk,
drunk,
[inaudible],
whatever the fucking word is,
we recorded,

1677
01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:28.690
we talked for at least an hour and a half.

1678
01:42:28.691 --> 01:42:32.650
The recorder shut off at an hour and 15 fucking minutes and you just hear us get

1679
01:42:32.651 --> 01:42:36.340
progressively more and more drunk.
Uh,
I listened to it.

1680
01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:40.930
There's a lot of funny moments,
but it's just way too long.
So I am going to,

1681
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:44.500
I'm going to edit it,
I'm going to dice it up and I'll,
I'll,

1682
01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:49.510
I'll put together a greatest hits of it.
They got that coming up,
but I just,

1683
01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:51.190
it was just too much self sabotage.

1684
01:42:51.191 --> 01:42:53.110
It's like I got my special coming out this week.

1685
01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:57.820
I really had to make sure I hyped it and I completely was not hyping it in a,

1686
01:42:57.821 --> 01:43:01.390
in a great way.
Uh,
you know,
it was just thought it was bad,

1687
01:43:01.810 --> 01:43:06.810
it was bad and there was a lot of embarrassing moments and you know,

1688
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:11.740
I,
you know,
I'm just,
I'm going to edit it people,
that's what I'm trying to say.

1689
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:14.560
All right,
go fuck yourself and not putting it all up.
All right.

1690
01:43:14.561 --> 01:43:15.700
Youtube videos of the week.

1691
01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:20.290
A fat kid goes insane after getting air horned in the face.

1692
01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:22.480
Try to guess what that one's about.

1693
01:43:22.481 --> 01:43:27.481
Fat Kid goes insane after getting air horned air horn in the face and uh,

1694
01:43:28.090 --> 01:43:30.700
this kid,
his face,
he looks like,
if,

1695
01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:35.560
if precious was a white eight year old,
just picture that face.

1696
01:43:35.561 --> 01:43:40.390
That's what this kid looks like.
All right,
here's what I'm sure everybody saw.

1697
01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:42.190
It says face verse watermelon.

1698
01:43:42.490 --> 01:43:45.250
This is somebody on the amazing race that took a slingshot and,

1699
01:43:45.251 --> 01:43:48.310
and shot a watermelon on a fucking cantaloupe.
I don't know what it was.

1700
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:52.010
And it came back and bless her right in the face.
It's absolutely hilarious.
They

1701
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:53.630
<v 10>actually showed it on ESPN.</v>

1702
01:43:53.631 --> 01:43:58.130
They did the top 10 funny sports moments of the weakened.
Hers was number one.

1703
01:43:58.310 --> 01:44:01.400
And you know what they did because she's abroad.

1704
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:03.740
What they had to do was they put,
you know,

1705
01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:06.860
you know when they had the list of shit that they're going to talk about coming

1706
01:44:06.861 --> 01:44:09.560
up on the right hand part of the screen out of nowhere,

1707
01:44:09.561 --> 01:44:12.560
right before the cantaloupe or watermelon blasts or in the face,

1708
01:44:12.561 --> 01:44:15.200
they put that up and half censored her head.

1709
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:19.520
Cause I can guarantee you there was some woman there going,

1710
01:44:19.730 --> 01:44:24.320
this is going to Jeff,
it's going to um,
cause violence against women.

1711
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:27.110
How is it going to cause violence against women?

1712
01:44:27.111 --> 01:44:32.111
Because the way the watermelon just slaps her in the face,

1713
01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:37.940
it's just it,
it was self inflicted.
That's one of those things,
once again,

1714
01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:41.210
those double standard,
if a guy did that,
do you think they'd censor it?

1715
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:45.440
What if it came back and hit him in his nuts and he actually lost the ability to

1716
01:44:45.441 --> 01:44:50.030
have a child?
They still would've shown that completely uncensored.
Wait a minute.

1717
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:54.170
Is this a special guests who just walked in?
Joe,
I got like an,

1718
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:58.640
I've got another eight minutes.
Just sit down and help me throw it.
Oh,

1719
01:44:58.650 --> 01:45:02.090
don't be a fag.
Get over here to pick up the microphone.
Ladies and gentlemen.

1720
01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:07.220
Look who just walked in.
Hey folks,
Joe to Rosa.
Or are you Jesus Christ.
Joe,

1721
01:45:07.221 --> 01:45:09.560
what are you doing here?
I uh,
you know,

1722
01:45:09.561 --> 01:45:13.190
I was just walking through the studio bill or the,
I saw you through the glass.

1723
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.330
This is like that moment when fucking Johnny Carson walked over to,
uh,

1724
01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:19.940
what's his face?
His Sitcom when he was doing CPO.

1725
01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:25.100
Sharkey remember that when he broke his,
uh,
what's his name?
Dom.
Dom.
Dom Delouis.

1726
01:45:25.490 --> 01:45:28.790
Don Rickles.
Yeah.
He just came walking in.
This is very old school.
Yeah.

1727
01:45:28.850 --> 01:45:32.420
I just actually alluded to them.
Uh,
and not even alluded.

1728
01:45:32.421 --> 01:45:33.860
I mentioned that we did a podcast.

1729
01:45:33.861 --> 01:45:36.200
I finally did talk to how we did a podcast last night.

1730
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:40.880
Completely fucking shit faced and a of the hour and 14 minutes.

1731
01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:43.640
How much do you think is going to be funny that we can actually chop up?

1732
01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:46.670
I think at least four minutes of it was really good.

1733
01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:50.030
I think the bulk of it was funny,

1734
01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:52.940
which was actually a good point about like it's just a little too much all at

1735
01:45:52.941 --> 01:45:53.271
once.

1736
01:45:53.271 --> 01:45:56.840
Like you got to split it up a little bit and it just kept me and then by the end

1737
01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:57.620
I was just,

1738
01:45:57.620 --> 01:46:01.190
I was really getting into your financial businesses of some deal that you had

1739
01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:04.840
and we were like,
yeah,
we don't,
we don't want that on there.
Yeah,
yeah.

1740
01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:08.720
Let me tell you about the cons and that's business gel.
It was really sloppy.

1741
01:46:08.721 --> 01:46:12.540
But dude,
I got to tell you a fucking hilarious on it you to,
I loved it.
I loved,

1742
01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:16.430
I was little.
I was,
I was kind of an angry let's that whiskey shit to bear.

1743
01:46:16.431 --> 01:46:21.170
I'm a happy drunk,
you know,
don't blame them.
Don't blame the whiskey bill.
Oh No,

1744
01:46:21.171 --> 01:46:25.280
no.
I'm already angry.
But like when I'm,
when I'm fucking,
when I'm sober,
I keep,

1745
01:46:25.281 --> 01:46:29.150
I keep it in check for the most part,
for the most part.
But when I drink whiskey,

1746
01:46:29.151 --> 01:46:30.410
then I'm not,
if I drink beer,
you know,

1747
01:46:30.411 --> 01:46:34.130
I got my arm around people and we'll all go down together.

1748
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.110
We're all singing songs.
Right?
I'm good time Charlie with the beer.

1749
01:46:39.111 --> 01:46:42.160
I start drinking whiskey.
Ah,
it's awful.
Do,

1750
01:46:42.170 --> 01:46:45.800
can you finish chewing whatever's in your mouth to fingernails biting my nails?

1751
01:46:45.801 --> 01:46:48.310
I ah,
through the doors.
He's checking.
No,
I'm sorry.
What?

1752
01:46:48.370 --> 01:46:49.780
Do you want to spit it out?
Or You,

1753
01:46:49.810 --> 01:46:53.940
you yelled at me to get over here and sit down.
Yeah.
What do you want me to do?

1754
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:55.120
I want you to fucking

1755
01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:59.550
<v 5>see what happens.
Why?
Why Joe?
Yeah.</v>

1756
01:46:59.670 --> 01:47:04.440
Be a professional.
You know,
Joe,

1757
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:06.750
you look at this,
you know,
I was just,
and I just went off on this.

1758
01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:11.880
Can you see this woman here?
She walked,
she showed up at a,
at a NFL practice.

1759
01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:16.230
This former Miss Universe here.
Look out.
She dressed at the practice.

1760
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:19.740
Oh yeah.
Looking good.
She's hot.
Well,
what?
Yeah,
and guess,

1761
01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:23.730
and evidently somebody made some people made,
she was subjected to catcalling.

1762
01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:26.670
Joe,
can you imagine that?
You could look like that,
dress like that.

1763
01:47:26.671 --> 01:47:30.900
And you can't go to an NFL practice without getting cashflow.
She upset about it.

1764
01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:36.000
Upset.
She tweeted in Spanish that she was,
um,
dying of embarrassment.

1765
01:47:36.810 --> 01:47:38.340
She had to cover her ears.

1766
01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:41.040
<v 10>Well,
look,
I gotta say though,
she looks great,</v>

1767
01:47:41.041 --> 01:47:42.990
but she is wearing jeans and a shirt.
It's like,

1768
01:47:42.991 --> 01:47:45.720
what the hell she supposed to wear?
Does that when she's in a miniskirt.
Okay,

1769
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:50.080
<v 5>Joe,
she's wearing high heels.
Look at a Gel.
How tight are those goddamn jeans?
Ah,</v>

1770
01:47:50.250 --> 01:47:53.700
righteously tay.
Really?
Joe,
what would you do with that Joe?
Ah,
Bill.

1771
01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:54.670
Tell me fucking

1772
01:47:54.670 --> 01:47:59.110
<v 10>leave it in disappointment.
Look,</v>

1773
01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:02.220
I'm not looking,
I'm not condoning that.
You shouldn't,
you shouldn't do that.
Hey,

1774
01:48:02.230 --> 01:48:06.390
she was asking for it.
I'm not,
I'm not.
She was so,

1775
01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:11.080
she is kind of a Jesus.
What the hell is she supposed to wear?

1776
01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.990
What she's supposed to wear?
Sweatpants.
Joe,

1777
01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:18.370
is it possible for those genes to get any tighter?
No,

1778
01:48:18.371 --> 01:48:21.250
but that's how chicks wear their jeans.
Chicks don't wear baggy jeans.

1779
01:48:21.251 --> 01:48:23.380
They were tight jeans.
Like,
you know something,
Joe,

1780
01:48:23.710 --> 01:48:27.450
why don't you just walk back out the door and bring in the fucking Joe Derosa

1781
01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:32.080
that I know.
All right.
All right,
Joe.
He's a no show their work.

1782
01:48:32.350 --> 01:48:33.910
I'm kidding.
What Joseph?

1783
01:48:33.970 --> 01:48:36.970
If I walk through central park at three in the fucking morning dress like

1784
01:48:36.971 --> 01:48:38.770
Liberace,
sing an almond,
the money,

1785
01:48:38.771 --> 01:48:41.560
and I get the shit kicked out of me and I get mugged.
It's wrong.

1786
01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:43.330
I should be able to do that.

1787
01:48:43.390 --> 01:48:48.070
But do I have any sort of fucking personal responsibility for my own fucking

1788
01:48:48.071 --> 01:48:51.250
safety?
All right.
You don't want go to a football practice.

1789
01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.230
She's got high heeled shoes.
She,
you know what?

1790
01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:58.420
First thing that drops a girls sex sex thing is down by at least 30% is when

1791
01:48:58.421 --> 01:49:00.940
they wear those flats.
Isn't that the worst?
When you,

1792
01:49:00.941 --> 01:49:03.340
when you're in a relationship and they get so comfortable that they stopped

1793
01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:04.590
jacking their ass up.
Yeah,

1794
01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:06.750
and they just wear the flats and all of a sudden they look like,

1795
01:49:07.050 --> 01:49:09.340
like they're a little clown climbing out of a car.
Yeah.

1796
01:49:09.341 --> 01:49:12.670
She should have worn those.
You're doing,
you're preaching to the choir.
I,

1797
01:49:12.910 --> 01:49:17.110
I'm doing a bit of doing my bit a bit in my act right now about take your
lashes,

1798
01:49:17.530 --> 01:49:21.460
like you chose this role and the the soul,
why are you defending this girl?

1799
01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:24.850
I'm saying,
I'm,
I'm you,
you convert,
you convinced me the center,

1800
01:49:25.730 --> 01:49:28.240
the center piece of the bid is that,
uh,

1801
01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:32.260
it's about this fat girl cock blocking me with the skinny girl and doing the

1802
01:49:32.261 --> 01:49:36.100
whole angry fat girl thing.
And it's like,
yeah.
It's just like,
you know,

1803
01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:39.670
I didn't eat all the egg sandwiches you did.
That was your decision.

1804
01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:43.990
You're going to get mad at me that I'm not leap frogging over your hot friend to

1805
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:48.850
get a shout at your Michelin Man Body right now.
There's nothing wrong with it.

1806
01:49:48.851 --> 01:49:52.420
You Fat.
That's okay.
But take the fucking hit sometimes.
You know what I mean?

1807
01:49:52.421 --> 01:49:53.650
It's not fair to everybody else.

1808
01:49:53.651 --> 01:49:57.070
You're waltzing around like you're a piece of Taylor.
You're not,
you know?
Yeah,

1809
01:49:57.630 --> 01:50:01.240
yeah,
yeah.
He's sitting there like a walrus.
Sunning yourself at the bar.
Yeah.

1810
01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:03.430
But my whole thing too is like,
you know,
I'm part Arab.

1811
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:04.960
If I were a turban on an airplane,

1812
01:50:04.961 --> 01:50:07.700
I gotta be ready for a couple of people to be like,
Ooh,
Ooh,

1813
01:50:07.930 --> 01:50:12.000
fuck is going on over.
You know,
like I told them [inaudible] territory,
dude.

1814
01:50:12.170 --> 01:50:15.260
She is.
Look,
I'm not saying that she's a bad person.

1815
01:50:15.530 --> 01:50:17.630
She looks like she's fucking gorgeous,
but she doesn't,

1816
01:50:17.631 --> 01:50:20.330
she doesn't look like I look at her.
I was at the shirt she was wearing.

1817
01:50:20.630 --> 01:50:25.520
That's the,
this is,
that's well that's her at the Superbowl.
But is that the shot?

1818
01:50:25.550 --> 01:50:28.820
The shot you showed me in the,
in the actual article was the ass shot,

1819
01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:32.120
is that what she looked like from the front?
That is her.

1820
01:50:32.121 --> 01:50:34.730
I mean that's not her at the practice,
but yeah,
that's what she wearing.

1821
01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:38.670
She's wearing that nightclub top.
She's got like the diamonds on the tits.
Tits.

1822
01:50:38.690 --> 01:50:42.890
Yeah.
Glittery tit shirt.
Yeah.
It's ridiculous.
Glittery Ted.

1823
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:48.110
I mean,
look,
yeah,
you can't,
you got to understand that.
Ooh,

1824
01:50:48.670 --> 01:50:53.110
she sweet.
This is what pisses me off,
Joe,
is it's NFL football.
It's a guy sport.

1825
01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:56.500
There's a bunch of guys playing it.
Nobody asked you to fucking come there.

1826
01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:59.470
You inserted yourself into this situation and this,
this,

1827
01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:03.240
I'm repeating myself in the podcast,
but just to hear your opinion,
that's when,

1828
01:51:03.250 --> 01:51:05.290
don't you hate that when if much guys hanging out,

1829
01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:06.900
you shooting the shit and we're talking,
then I'll send you just said,

1830
01:51:06.970 --> 01:51:07.880
it scares me.
Ski.

1831
01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:12.900
There's a lady present and then all the fun just stops and everybody has to

1832
01:51:13.241 --> 01:51:16.590
adjust their fucking behavior because you're there.
You know,

1833
01:51:16.610 --> 01:51:21.460
my favorite thing ever been on chest,
let me hear some hate hate is when,

1834
01:51:21.890 --> 01:51:22.280
uh,
uh,

1835
01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:26.530
like a waitress will say that to a bunch of drunk guys and there's always the

1836
01:51:26.531 --> 01:51:28.840
one 50,
you know,
the waitress will go like,
uh,

1837
01:51:28.841 --> 01:51:30.550
is that how you talk in front of a lady?

1838
01:51:32.010 --> 01:51:34.090
And then there's always one 50 year old drug that goes,
well,

1839
01:51:34.091 --> 01:51:38.650
why don't you show me a fucking lady?
And I'll tell Ya,
you know,

1840
01:51:38.651 --> 01:51:43.240
it's such an old joke,
but it always gets a laugh.
It always gets a laugh.

1841
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:48.070
It's just nothing.
Ah,
you know,
somebody was telling me,
um,
I,

1842
01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:52.660
when I was,
I was out in Denver,
they were saying,
um,
that they will,

1843
01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:54.950
they went out to go shoot pool right there shooting.

1844
01:51:55.090 --> 01:51:59.140
Now I remember they were shooting pool and there was a,
you know,
they,

1845
01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:01.240
they were kicking the shit out of these guys and there was this group of guys

1846
01:52:01.241 --> 01:52:02.170
they had next,
right?

1847
01:52:02.171 --> 01:52:05.350
And then some girl Cottey comes up and she didn't want to fucking wait and she

1848
01:52:05.351 --> 01:52:09.400
puts her money down,
but she so fucking hot that these other ball is jackasses.

1849
01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:13.240
They let her cut right night and then she's making this big,

1850
01:52:13.370 --> 01:52:14.800
and then she's just such a already,

1851
01:52:14.801 --> 01:52:17.770
just an arrogant fucking twat that these guys are like,
look,

1852
01:52:17.771 --> 01:52:20.320
we don't want to play.
We don't want to play.
You were going to play those guys.

1853
01:52:20.321 --> 01:52:23.050
Right?
And she gets blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
giving him shit.

1854
01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:24.340
And he goes,
look,
we're not playing.

1855
01:52:24.341 --> 01:52:28.590
You were playing those guys and she took a full drink and throw it in this guide

1856
01:52:28.590 --> 01:52:33.520
.
Oof.
So I go,
well,
you can't hit them.
What do you do?
He goes,

1857
01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:38.410
Oh,
this guy's brilliant.
He,
he's a spitter.
He doesn't,
he just,

1858
01:52:38.650 --> 01:52:41.750
when she goes and he was so fucking much,
what are you going to do?

1859
01:52:41.890 --> 01:52:44.810
Are you going to hit me?
He goes,
no,
I'm not going to hit you.
And he goes,

1860
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:50.300
hit her right in the chest and it rolled down between her titties.

1861
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:54.440
And this is the worst part.
The bouncers come over,
flipping the end.

1862
01:52:54.441 --> 01:52:59.090
They fucking of course go.
And those guys who she cut all fucking ran at,
at,

1863
01:52:59.091 --> 01:53:03.270
at they do to just did that shit.
Oh,
that's great.
Just immediately.
It's fucking,

1864
01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:05.570
yeah,
because spitting on somebody is so much worse.

1865
01:53:05.571 --> 01:53:08.990
I'd much rather get blasted into it.
I even take the brain damage.

1866
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:12.710
Did you ever hear that term or that Tony Roberts joke where he's like,

1867
01:53:12.711 --> 01:53:16.760
he's like fucked up to hit a woman.
I would never hit.
All right.
I'm bullshit.

1868
01:53:19.650 --> 01:53:19.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1869
01:53:19.890 --> 01:53:23.190
<v 10>And he's like,
if you put your hands on me,
I'll fucking lay out.
Oh,</v>

1870
01:53:23.210 --> 01:53:27.500
that's awesome stuff.
I could hit me fine.
Don't do this whole bit.

1871
01:53:27.590 --> 01:53:31.580
Go See Tony Robertson.
Oh wait,
I gotta finish this bit.
It's so funny,
Dude.

1872
01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:33.980
He goes,
you see those commercials?

1873
01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:38.090
Are you guys every 12 seconds a woman is hit [inaudible] in this country?

1874
01:53:38.091 --> 01:53:38.924
And he goes,
he goes,

1875
01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:42.380
they will tell you how every eight seconds there's a bitch in your face.

1876
01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:42.650
Go ahead.

1877
01:53:42.650 --> 01:53:46.730
<v 0>How about that?
My bad,
my bad.
And he goes,
I've warned you,</v>

1878
01:53:48.130 --> 01:53:49.730
bitch you at four seconds.

1879
01:53:54.010 --> 01:53:55.870
<v 10>Tony Robbins,
one of the most underrated comedians of all time.</v>

1880
01:53:55.900 --> 01:54:00.220
That guy is so fucking ridiculously talented.
He's so funny.
Yeah,

1881
01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:03.650
I saw them on comedy central.
Typical,
ridiculously talented duties.

1882
01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:06.910
Unbelievably humble.
I saw him on comedy central and he,

1883
01:54:07.570 --> 01:54:10.660
I think he just starts the bit like this.
He just goes and it was so good.

1884
01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:12.430
Cause I fucking hate Wendy Williams.
He goes,

1885
01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:16.030
Wendy Williams and Danny Glover or the same mother fucking person.

1886
01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:21.080
<v 0>That's so mean.</v>

1887
01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:24.740
<v 10>All right,
well we've got to wrap up the podcast here.
Joe,</v>

1888
01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:28.610
with his squeaky little voice.
That really just annoyed me.
Oh yeah,
it's Yo me.

1889
01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:31.140
<v 0>Oh,
oh,</v>

1890
01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:35.510
<v 10>here's another youtube video to watch.
Uh,
go to [inaudible] dot com uh,</v>

1891
01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.510
build dances.
Classic bloopers.
Joe,
I actually have to show you this one.

1892
01:54:39.511 --> 01:54:44.070
This is like a guy trying to do a fishing show and one of them,
I swear to God,

1893
01:54:44.071 --> 01:54:45.870
I can't believe that it's actually true.

1894
01:54:46.170 --> 01:54:49.830
He's going down the river and in the distance,

1895
01:54:49.831 --> 01:54:53.750
the other camera man from the two,
they're doing like a two shot the chute,
right?

1896
01:54:53.790 --> 01:54:58.070
The other camera man,
first of all is in the shot and he's edging towards the,

1897
01:54:58.130 --> 01:55:01.680
the bank to get a better shop and it's an eight foot drop into the revenue from

1898
01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:05.520
that guy with the falls into the fucking river

1899
01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:11.430
and the,
what's his face?
He's one of those redneck guys who he gets mad,

1900
01:55:11.431 --> 01:55:14.670
but he's like a,
a classic dude so he doesn't curse.

1901
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:17.820
So he uses like those redneck Hicks.
I don't know what the fuck they are,

1902
01:55:17.821 --> 01:55:21.840
but he's,
is that dagnabbit you know two goes in the water.

1903
01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:25.590
I'm butchering it.
It's actually,
it's fucking hilarious.
Hey,

1904
01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:28.420
I gotta hop in the shower cause Bobby Kelly's meeting me here in a couple of

1905
01:55:28.630 --> 01:55:33.390
these Joe,
but Bobby Kelly,
is he gonna come walking through the door?
No,

1906
01:55:33.391 --> 01:55:35.870
he's going to ring the buzzer and I got to rally so I gotta get ready here.

1907
01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:40.080
So lazy boy chairs,
we,
no,
no,
it's my show.

1908
01:55:40.110 --> 01:55:41.060
I tell you when we're,

1909
01:55:41.061 --> 01:55:43.590
when we were up against the heartbreak and it's time you to go,

1910
01:55:43.650 --> 01:55:45.210
where are you going Joe?
You're just going to put it down.

1911
01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:48.900
It is going to tap out and walk out.
I get shower.

1912
01:55:51.090 --> 01:55:55.260
Jesus.
All right,
no problem.
Joe.
To rose,
everybody.

1913
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:58.380
Jode Rosie has a new CD out that I would have hiked,
but he walked away.

1914
01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:02.880
We'll give me the height.
What's the hype,
Joe?

1915
01:56:05.490 --> 01:56:08.940
When does it come out now?
Seriously,
Joel,
if it was out,

1916
01:56:08.941 --> 01:56:12.840
people will be talking about it.
When does it come out?
Oh Jesus,
it's out.

1917
01:56:12.841 --> 01:56:17.380
It's called out the depression auction and I endorse it.
Joe Rock.
Come on.

1918
01:56:17.381 --> 01:56:22.230
He did want he or eat burned a bit on the podcast for you.
Why am I yelling?

1919
01:56:23.190 --> 01:56:25.770
Um,
anyways,
uh,
I think that's going to be the podcast for this week.

1920
01:56:25.771 --> 01:56:29.190
I'm doing a ton of media this week.
Fans of the Opie and Anthony Program.

1921
01:56:29.191 --> 01:56:33.450
I believe I'm going to be on there.
Uh,
definitely tomorrow.
Hopefully Wednesday.

1922
01:56:33.630 --> 01:56:38.610
I'm basically going to be on that show as many days as they'll have me because,

1923
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:42.990
uh,
I like those sons of bitches.
Um,
that's it.
No,
seriously.

1924
01:56:43.070 --> 01:56:44.970
And if you don't listen to the OPR Anthony Program,

1925
01:56:44.971 --> 01:56:47.850
I don't know what your problem is.
Get an XM satellite,

1926
01:56:47.930 --> 01:56:51.420
whatever the Fuck Sirius XM player,

1927
01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:55.610
and check those guys out.
Watch a little bit of this stuff on Youtube.
They're uh,

1928
01:56:56.640 --> 01:56:58.830
they're,
they're fucking awesome.
So I'm going to be doing them this week.

1929
01:56:58.831 --> 01:57:03.150
I'll probably be doing something on versus,
and um,
you know what,

1930
01:57:03.151 --> 01:57:06.090
as I do them,
if they're not live and they're going to be shown later,

1931
01:57:06.091 --> 01:57:09.120
I'll just on the MM podcast,
we'll have that information up there.

1932
01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:11.970
But if you didn't get the,
Oh gee,
she's ringtone.

1933
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.860
You can go to the [inaudible] podcast.com and on the left hand corner you'll see

1934
01:57:16.861 --> 01:57:20.040
it right there.
And you just click on old Jesus and you can get it,

1935
01:57:20.041 --> 01:57:24.210
put it in your phone.
And then whenever the biggest continue life calls you up,

1936
01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:28.640
that's what your phone's going to be saying.
Oh Gee,
go.
Um,

1937
01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:32.520
if you don't,
don't do it.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm just happy you listening.

1938
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:36.540
All right.
You guys have a great week and a that's my prediction.
Ravens will win.

1939
01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:41.940
Um,
and I don't know,
jets,
jets are patriots.
I gotta be honest with you.

1940
01:57:41.941 --> 01:57:43.080
Could go either direction,

1941
01:57:43.081 --> 01:57:47.760
but I'm really liking what I watched on the ticker tape on the airplane.

1942
01:57:47.761 --> 01:57:51.000
I have no fucking idea.
I miss,
I don't,
I can't judge the Patriots,
but uh,

1943
01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:55.860
and I think the jets are going to at best Miko tenants six after all that

1944
01:57:55.861 --> 01:57:59.130
fucking Yip Yapping,
they'll probably make it into the playoffs.

1945
01:57:59.131 --> 01:58:01.680
God knows they got in,
they got enough talent on the fucking team,

1946
01:58:02.070 --> 01:58:05.230
but I think all this shit talking is really gonna hurt them and I don't,

1947
01:58:05.231 --> 01:58:07.380
I don't think they're going to go as far as they went last year.

1948
01:58:07.410 --> 01:58:11.040
What do you think about that?
Huh?
What do you think about that?

1949
01:58:12.510 --> 01:58:15.390
Jets play like a jet.
What the fuck does that mean?

1950
01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:17.970
You haven't won one since 1969 what does that mean?

1951
01:58:18.090 --> 01:58:22.850
Get your fans all excited and then you shit the bed in January.
What Joe?

1952
01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:25.920
That's what they do,
Joe.
They haven't won since.

1953
01:58:25.921 --> 01:58:29.430
We were excited that we landed on the moon like that was going to lead to new

1954
01:58:29.431 --> 01:58:31.530
real estate.
That was the last time they want Joe.

1955
01:58:33.690 --> 01:58:37.140
I was six months old.
Joe,
six months old.

1956
01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:42.250
Curt Gowdy announced the last time that they want a bowl.
All right.

1957
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:44.410
<v 5>Jim Morrison was still alive.
Joe,</v>

1958
01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:47.770
Jimi Hendrix was still putting out albums.

1959
01:58:49.150 --> 01:58:53.110
Joe De Rosa the last time they won and this same play like a jet.

1960
01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:55.510
<v 14>When you're a jet,
you're a jet all the way.</v>

1961
01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:57.210
<v 5>I like that.</v>

1962
01:58:57.210 --> 01:59:00.450
<v 14>Oh,
that's from a west side story.
That really is where we differ.</v>

1963
01:59:00.451 --> 01:59:02.460
You're talking about the jets that I'm singing the song.

1964
01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:05.150
<v 5>That sounds like one of the old stair really into that old school shit.</v>

1965
01:59:05.300 --> 01:59:06.720
You know what the sad thing about the jet side?

1966
01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:10.760
They're the only professional franchise and all four sports that actually sub

1967
01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.510
lets their stadium let's,
yeah.

1968
01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:17.510
If they play a giant stadium there.
You know what they are?

1969
01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:21.170
They're like that fucking loser who never moves out.

1970
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:25.850
And that window of getting married and actually meeting somebody just closes and

1971
01:59:25.851 --> 01:59:27.020
then they just say fuck it.

1972
01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:31.940
And they're just waiting for the last of their alive parent to die so that they

1973
01:59:31.941 --> 01:59:33.740
can take,
they can take over the house.

1974
01:59:34.330 --> 01:59:37.770
<v 14>Oh God.
It never ends his podcast when he's at your apartment.</v>

1975
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:43.270
<v 5>Oh Jesus.
Joe,
look at you.
Come with a little bit of anger.
Joe.</v>

1976
01:59:43.271 --> 01:59:46.450
You know what I hate are uninsured.
Unashamed.
You are about your torso.

1977
01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:55.360
I give Joe Shit because his body,
he looks like an adolescent.

1978
01:59:55.361 --> 01:59:59.440
Will Ferrell like what picture will Ferrel's body at 23

1979
02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:04.630
do you,
have you ever done a pull up in your life?
Do you like,

1980
02:00:06.070 --> 02:00:10.420
do you even have those muscles?
Yeah,
he left me.

1981
02:00:11.110 --> 02:00:14.020
I was really going to compare him to like the Camaro rally sport.

1982
02:00:14.050 --> 02:00:17.170
You know somebody goes out and you get the Iraq,
right?

1983
02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:20.830
You got the air conditioner,
you got the tee tops,
you get the electric windows,

1984
02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:24.040
and then you had the rally sport,
which you basically had the same body,

1985
02:00:24.041 --> 02:00:26.260
but you didn't have those options.
I was going to go that route.

1986
02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:29.050
Is that what you were going to do,
Bill?
Where are you going to do it?

1987
02:00:29.050 --> 02:00:32.650
In a funny way because the way you presented that,
it wasn't too funny.
All right,

1988
02:00:32.651 --> 02:00:37.390
that's the podcast for this week.
God bless all of you guys.
Let's go ravens.

1989
02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:39.790
Fuck the jets and a,

1990
02:00:39.791 --> 02:00:44.791
I'm hoping this time next week that jets are fucking oh into and if they are all

1991
02:00:45.731 --> 02:00:49.630
into,
I'm telling you right now,
Rex Ryan,
I am Guaran fucking teeing.

1992
02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:54.100
It will cry during a press conference and he's going to be crying and his

1993
02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:57.460
fucking,
you know,
bodies going to be jiggling.

1994
02:00:58.690 --> 02:01:03.580
I hate the jets.
I hate the jets more than I hate the cold snap,
you know,

1995
02:01:03.581 --> 02:01:07.240
kind of helps it.
They lost to the Texans.
But yeah,
the jets,

1996
02:01:07.330 --> 02:01:11.950
I want nothing more than to watch them eat their fucking words.

1997
02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:16.720
The arrogance of that fucking team.
Look at that.

1998
02:01:16.721 --> 02:01:20.920
You don't even know how to behave when there's a lady in the room.
Um,
all right.

1999
02:01:21.010 --> 02:01:22.930
Who gives a fuck?
Ravens are gonna win tonight.

2000
02:01:22.931 --> 02:01:24.340
I'm going to have an extra 50 bucks in.

2001
02:01:24.341 --> 02:01:26.470
The Patriots are going to beat him next week.
All right?

2002
02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:29.110
That's what my heart says.
All right,
you guys have a good week.

2003
02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:30.760
Please watch my special Sunday night.

2004

2006
02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:17.740
[inaudible].
