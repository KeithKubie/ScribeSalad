00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.990
The Great Frederick Douglas

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.119
“We shall look over the world, and survey
the history of any other oppressed and enslaved

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.480
people in vain, to find one which has made
more progress within the same length as the

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.870
colored people of the United States.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.780
These, and many other considerations which
I might name, give brightness and fervor to

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.040
my hopes that that better day for which that
thoughtful amongst us have long labored, and

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.040
the millions of our people have sighed for
centuries, is near at hand.”

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.859
With those written words, the great Frederick
Douglass laid down his pen.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.750
Through the 77 years of his life, he had been
a slave, a runaway, a world-renown orator,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.960
a best-selling author, an adviser to presidents,
a candidate for national office, a US Marshall,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.000
and an advocate to both men and women, particularly
being a key advocate for the right for women

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.360
to vote.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.960
Born into slavery on Maryland’s eastern
shore in 1818, Frederick Augustus Washington

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.399
Bailey (the name given to him by his mother)
was the offspring of a slave mother and a

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.490
white man, thought to be his mother’s master.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.720
Early in his life, his mother was “rented”
to another farm in the north, leaving young

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.300
Fred to be raised by his grandmother.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.970
His grandmother Betsy, while a slave herself,
was married to a free man.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.880
There was a significant free African-American
population on the eastern shore and it exposed

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.770
Frederick to the idea that you didn’t have
to be tied to your born lot in life.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.110
Around 1825, he was sent to the Wye House
(he wasn’t sold, he moved to a different

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.850
property of the same owners), separating him
from his grandmother.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.310
Life got even tougher Frederick, as he bore
witness to, and endured himself, beatings

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.590
and starvation.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.520
His master, Aaron Anthony, was particularly
cruel.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.770
Fortunately, the women of the Anthony and
Auld (Anthony’s son-in-law’s family) households

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.720
saw great potential in Frederick.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.530
Along with their own similarly aged sons,
they taught Frederick how to read and write.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.870
When the men of the house learned of this,
they immediately put a stop to it.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.730
It was against the law, not to mention the
social code of the day, to allow a slave to

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.910
become literate.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.311
Undeterred, Frederick continued to teach himself,
knowing that an education was the key to a

00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:27.311
life of freedom.

00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:30.890
Over the next ten years, Frederick would also
often be caught teaching other slaves how

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.890
to read.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.610
He would be punished, but that did nothing
to stop him.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.610
After an escape plot was foiled, Frederick
was sent to a reputed “slave breaker.”

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.670
But he could not be broken.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.860
While working in Baltimore, he met a free
black woman named Anne Murray.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.180
They fell in love.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.760
He had tried escaping twice before and failed,
with severe consequences.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.330
The third time was a charm for him.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.280
In 1838, disguised as a sailor, and with identification
papers from a real free black sailor, he endured

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.510
a harrowing, but short, 24 hour journey that
ended in the home of abolitionist David Ruggles

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.700
in New York.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.040
He said of this,
“I have often been asked, how I felt when

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.930
first I found myself on free soil.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.910
And my readers may share the same curiosity.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.480
There is scarcely anything in my experience
about which I could not give a more satisfactory

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.480
answer.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.640
A new world had opened upon me.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.640
If life is more than breath, and the ‘quick
round of blood,’ I lived more in one day

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.900
than in a year of my slave life.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.910
It was a time of joyous excitement which words
can but tamely describe.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.180
In a letter written to a friend soon after
reaching New York, I said: ‘I felt as one

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.310
might feel upon escape from a den of hungry
lions.’

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.500
Anguish and grief, like darkness and rain,
may be depicted; but gladness and joy, like

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.430
the rainbow, defy the skill of pen or pencil.”

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.900
Now a free man, Frederick Bailey married Anne
Murray (they remained married for 44 years

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.070
until her death) and changed his surname initially
to “Johnson”, but then later to “Douglass”,

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.220
after reading Sir Walter Scott’s The Lady
of the Lake, which features the “Douglas”

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.220
clan.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.650
In New York, his personal narrative and incredible
intelligence became his ticket to being one

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.180
of the most sought after abolitionist orators
of the day.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.040
Traveling around the midwest and northeast,
Douglass told his story of being torn from

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.350
his family, beaten daily, and his heroic escape.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.759
He gained admirers and fans, most prominent
of which included fellow abolitionist William

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:22.759
Lloyd Garrison.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:28.810
In 1845, he published his first book “Narrative
of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.810
Slave.”

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.810
It became a best-seller.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.780
(And is a phenomenal read even today.)

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.090
Rochester, the western New York town in which
the Douglass family settled, was the perfect

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.060
place for Frederick Douglass to call home.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.920
It was a hotbed of progressive activity and
ideas.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.740
Besides Douglass and his now-friend Garrison,
the women’s suffrage advocate Susan B. Anthony;

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.389
escaped-slave and caretaker of the Underground
railroad Harriet Tubman; and New York governor

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.129
and well-known abolitionist (later, Lincoln’s
Secretary of State) William Seward all called

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.409
Rochester home during their lives.

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.389
His social conscience and the environment
around him encouraged Douglass to take on

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:03.569
other causes.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.270
Douglass was one of the few men to attend
the first Women’s Rights Convention in Seneca

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.630
Falls (about 50 miles from Rochester) in 1848,
and played a key role in swaying the opinion

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.460
at those meetings that women should be given
the right to vote (many of the women at the

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.569
convention, including one of those who organized
it, thought that was a ridiculous notion).

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.689
He spoke out against the way the Native Americans
were being treated.

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:29.539
He campaigned on behalf of all Union soldiers
to be paid equally- no matter race, social

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.629
status, or what state they were from.

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:36.330
In April of 1861, with the attack on Fort
Sumter, the Civil War commenced.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.379
Douglass believed that African-Americans had
a responsibility to take part in the war and

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:41.740
a right to be able to.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.569
The Commander-in-Chief of the Union army,
President Abraham Lincoln, agreed with him.

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.669
Frederick Douglass became Lincoln’s connection
to the African-American community and he invited

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.150
him to the White House on several occasions.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.139
They would discuss ensuring the equal pay
and treatment of African-American soldiers,

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.539
the link between preserving the Union and
the abolition of slavery, and granting escaped

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:02.680
slaves asylum.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.050
Following his reelection, Lincoln invited
Douglass to a White House reception.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.360
It was the first time a black man was invited
to a reception of that nature.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.150
The two had an immense amount of mutual respect
for one another, but it didn’t mean they

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.150
always agreed.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.590
Lincoln’s first priority was always to preserve
the Union and Douglass felt that Lincoln did

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.580
not go far enough with the Emancipation Proclamation.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.240
He was also disappointed that Lincoln never
publicly supported suffrage for African-Americans.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.729
Once, he even called Lincoln “the white
man’s President.”

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.199
Even after Lincoln’s death, when saying
anything publicly in the North that was even

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:38.629
remotely negative about Lincoln was practically
blasphemes, Douglass spoke about the fact

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:43.879
that Lincoln “shared the prejudices common
to his countrymen towards the colored race.”

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:49.030
But on April 14th, 1876, nearly 11 years after
Lincoln’s assassination, Douglass delivered

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.610
what would be his greatest speech on the subject
of Lincoln during the unveiling of the Freedmen’s

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.610
Monument.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.409
While he wasn’t afraid to give his thoughts
on Lincoln’s prejudices, he also described

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:01.820
Lincoln as such:
“Though high in position, the humblest could

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.419
approach him and feel at home in his presence.

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:10.169
Though deep, he was transparent; though strong,
he was gentle; though decided and pronounced

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:15.389
in his convictions, he was tolerant towards
those who differed from him, and patient under

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:16.389
reproaches.

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:21.029
Even those who only knew him through his public
utterance obtained a tolerably clear idea

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:23.149
of his character and personality.

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:28.460
The image of the man went out with his words,
and those who read them knew him.”

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:34.439
On February 20th, 1895, at the age of 77,
Frederick Douglass passed away in Washington

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:38.550
DC, hours after giving a speech to the National
Council of Women.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.050
He was a tremendously admired man for his
commitment to his convictions and unwavering

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.069
advocate to the African-American community.

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:49.669
He was welcomed by Presidents, kings, and
leaders across the world.

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:54.449
Thousands attended his funeral in New York
and you can still visit his gravesite today,

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:57.550
in the Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.749
Bonus Facts:
• After the publishing of his first book,

00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:04.800
“Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,
an American Slave,” he became a prominent

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.360
and well-known figure.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.139
For this reason, he traveled to Europe to
not only promote his book, but to avoid the

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:14.439
potential consequences of being an escaped
slave in the United States where a lot of

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:16.639
people now knew where he was.

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:19.490
Technically, Douglass was still-owned and
had a master.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.330
He feared that he would be hunted down.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:26.259
Eventually, he would return and British admirers
of his raised the necessary funds to buy his

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:28.490
freedom.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.490
• It is thought that the British government
wanted to intervene in the American Civil

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.669
War on the side of the Confederacy.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:37.251
Not because they supported slavery (it had
previously been outlawed in Britain), but

00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:41.029
because the lack of export of cotton from
the Americas was hurting the cloth industry

00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:42.560
in Britain tremendously.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.339
They never did provide any significant aid
to the South due to what some say was the

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:50.490
overwhelming sentiment against slavery that
Frederick Douglass helped provoke in the British

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.700
people during his time there about 16 years
before the Civil War started.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:00.019
This public sentiment, combined with the 1863
master stroke that was the Emancipation Proclamation,

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:03.940
officially making the war about slavery, made
it impossible for the British government to

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:10.260
come to the aid of the South in exchange for
favorable deals on cotton exports.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.139
• When Douglass began his career as an author
and orator, well-known abolitionist William

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:16.880
Lloyd Garrison helped him become a well-known
figure.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.770
Later, they became rivals over a key difference
in the interpretation of the Constitution.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.000
After much studying, Douglass believed that
the Constitution was inherently an anti-slavery

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
document.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.709
Garrison believed the Constitution was pro-slavery
and actually would go so far as to advocate

00:09:31.709 --> 00:09:34.019
the burning of the document in effigy.

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:38.449
In addition, Garrison saw Douglass’ “North
Star” publication as a direct competitor

00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:41.050
to Garrison’s “National Anti-Slavery Standard.”
