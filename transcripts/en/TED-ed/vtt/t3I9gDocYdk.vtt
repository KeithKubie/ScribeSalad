00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.830
We all know about the dinosaurs

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.714
that once roamed the planet,

00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:12.966
but long after they went extinct,

00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.380
great beasts we call the megafauna

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.964
lived on every continent.

00:00:17.964 --> 00:00:21.843
In the Americas, ground sloths the size of elephants

00:00:21.843 --> 00:00:24.216
pulled down trees with their claws.

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:26.799
Saber-toothed cats the size of brown bears

00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:28.266
hunted in packs,

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.300
but they were no match for short-faced bears,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.216
which stood thirteen feet on their hind legs,

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:35.131
and are likely to have driven these cats

00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:36.690
away from their prey.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.610
There were armadillos as big as small cars,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.131
an eight foot beaver,

00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.324
and a bird with a 26 foot wingspan.

00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:46.909
Almost everywhere, the world's megafauna

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.381
were driven to extinction, often by human hunters.

00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:54.298
Some species still survive in parts of Africa and Asia.

00:00:54.298 --> 00:00:59.005
In other places, you can still see the legacy of these great beasts.

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:00.882
Most trees are able to resprout

00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:02.547
where their trunk is broken

00:01:02.547 --> 00:01:04.966
to withstand the loss of much of their bark

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.798
and to survive splitting, twisting and trampling,

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:12.132
partly because they evolved to survive attacks by elephants.

00:01:12.132 --> 00:01:14.632
The American pronghorn can run so fast

00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:17.799
because it evolved to escape the American cheetah.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.029
The surviving animals live in ghost ecosystems

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:25.215
adapted to threats from species that no longer exist.

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:28.381
Today, it may be possible to resurrect those ghosts,

00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:31.163
to bring back lost species using genetic material.

00:01:31.163 --> 00:01:33.216
For instance, there's been research in to

00:01:33.216 --> 00:01:36.716
cloning woolly mammoths from frozen remains.

00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:38.466
But even if it's not possible,

00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:41.340
we can still restore many of the ecosystems

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.217
the world has lost.

00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:47.095
How? By making use of abandoned farms.

00:01:47.095 --> 00:01:49.133
As the market for food is globalized,

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.966
infertile land becomes uncompetitive.

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:54.186
Farmers in barren places can't compete

00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:57.382
with people growing crops on better land elsewhere.

00:01:57.382 --> 00:02:01.360
As a result, farming has started to retreat from many regions,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.988
and trees have started to return.

00:02:03.988 --> 00:02:07.116
One estimate claims that two-thirds of land in the US

00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:09.827
that was once forested but was cleared for farming

00:02:09.827 --> 00:02:11.632
has become forested again.

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:13.832
Another estimate suggests that by 2030,

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:16.166
an area in Europe the size of Poland

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:18.299
will be vaccated by farmers.

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.670
So even if we can't use DNA to bring back

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.173
ground sloths and giant armadillos,

00:02:23.173 --> 00:02:25.509
we can restore bears, wolves, pumas

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.466
lynx, moose and bison

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:29.382
to the places where they used to live.

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:32.019
Some of these animals can reshape their surroundings,

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.518
creating conditions that allow other species to thrive.

00:02:35.518 --> 00:02:37.049
When wolves were reintroduced to

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.938
the Yellowstone National Park in 1995,

00:02:39.938 --> 00:02:42.382
they quickly transformed the ecosystem.

00:02:42.382 --> 00:02:44.987
Where they reduced the numbers of overpopulated deer,

00:02:44.987 --> 00:02:47.071
vegetation began to recover.

00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:51.299
The height of some trees quintupled in just six years.

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.632
As forests returned, so did songbirds.

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:57.706
Beavers, which eat trees, multiplied in the rivers,

00:02:57.706 --> 00:02:59.582
and their dams provided homes

00:02:59.582 --> 00:03:04.049
for otters, muskrats, ducks, frogs and fish.

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.630
The wolves killed coyotes, allowing rabbits

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.426
and mice to increase,

00:03:08.426 --> 00:03:11.011
providing more food for hawks, weasels,

00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:12.930
foxes and badgers.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.766
Bald eagles and ravens fed on the carrion

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:17.603
that the wolves abandoned.

00:03:17.603 --> 00:03:19.632
So did bears, which also ate the berries

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.966
on the returning shrubs.

00:03:21.966 --> 00:03:23.966
Bison numbers rose as they browsed

00:03:23.966 --> 00:03:26.153
the revitalized forests.

00:03:26.153 --> 00:03:29.549
The wolves changed almost everything.

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.382
This is an example of a trophic cascade,

00:03:32.382 --> 00:03:34.410
a change at the top of the food chain

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.799
that tumbles all the way to the bottom,

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.466
affecting every level.

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:41.295
The discovery of widespread trophic cascades

00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:44.085
may be one of the most exciting scientific findings

00:03:44.085 --> 00:03:45.920
of the past half century.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.131
They tell us that ecosystems that have lost

00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:50.633
just one or two species of large animals

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:53.215
can behave in radically different ways

00:03:53.215 --> 00:03:54.931
from those that retain them.

00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:56.851
All over the world, new movements are trying

00:03:56.851 --> 00:03:59.215
to catalyze the restoration of nature

00:03:59.215 --> 00:04:01.716
in a process called rewilding.

00:04:01.716 --> 00:04:04.523
This means undoing some of the damage we've caused,

00:04:04.523 --> 00:04:07.049
reestablishing species which have been driven out,

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.737
and then stepping back.

00:04:08.737 --> 00:04:11.882
There is no attempt to create an ideal ecosystem,

00:04:11.882 --> 00:04:15.243
to produce a heath, a rainforest or a coral reef.

00:04:15.243 --> 00:04:17.787
Rewilding is about bringing back the species

00:04:17.787 --> 00:04:19.966
that drive dynamic processes

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:22.337
and then letting nature take its course.

00:04:22.337 --> 00:04:25.134
But it's essential that rewilding must never be used

00:04:25.134 --> 00:04:27.967
as an excuse to push people off the land.

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:29.716
It should happen only with the consent

00:04:29.716 --> 00:04:32.548
and enthusiasm of the people who work there.

00:04:32.548 --> 00:04:35.015
Imagine standing on a cliff in England,

00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:38.049
watching sperm whales attacking shoals of herring

00:04:38.049 --> 00:04:40.216
as they did within sight of the shore

00:04:40.216 --> 00:04:41.881
until the 18th century.

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:43.549
By creating marine reserves

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:45.382
in which no commerical fishing takes place,

00:04:45.382 --> 00:04:46.900
that can happen again.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.984
Imagine a European Serengeti

00:04:48.984 --> 00:04:51.322
full of the animals that used to live there:

00:04:51.322 --> 00:04:54.947
hippos, rhinos, elephants, hyenas and lions.

00:04:54.947 --> 00:04:57.132
What rewilding reintroduces,

00:04:57.132 --> 00:05:00.163
alongside the missing animals and plants,

00:05:00.163 --> 00:05:02.882
is that rare species called hope.

00:05:02.882 --> 00:05:05.001
It tells us that ecological change

00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:07.921
need not always proceed in the same direction.

00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:11.633
The silent spring could be followed by a wild summer.
