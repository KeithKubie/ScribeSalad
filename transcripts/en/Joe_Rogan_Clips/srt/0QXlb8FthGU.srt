1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,960
The Joe Rogan experience.
What was your first car?

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,550
My first car was in 1973
Chevelle, Chevelle. S.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,930
S it was a shitbox.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,370
I drove it from the guy's house to
my house and then it died. It never,

5
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:15,420
it never worked again.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,800
I think I drove to my girlfriend's house
and then I drove back to my house and

7
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:23,030
then it died. Yeah. And I called the guy
up my hand and your fucking car done.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,080
He came and gave it back. He gave me the
money back and took his car. He said,

9
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:31,780
what happened to my car? I'm like,
it died. It just doesn't work. Wow.

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,380
And so you had like a day?
I had it for a day and then my,

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,530
that's horrible.
Yeah.

12
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:42,380
Then I had a 1968 four four two that
are wrapped around a telephone pole.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,420
Oh Shit. Yeah. Whoops.
Hydroplaned yeah. Yeah.

14
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:48,000
If you didn't know how to drive back
then and you had to like kind of balding

15
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:52,920
tires. Yeah. And you hit some water. Yeah.
Cars would just go sideways. You know?

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,320
What is this like? You're floating
in the air. Yeah. It's crazy.

17
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,240
It's a crazy feeling.
Can't do anything about it.

18
00:00:57,241 --> 00:01:01,020
Nothing about it that would tell you
to turn into it. Nothing's happening.

19
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:03,900
I was just going sideways. I was
like, I can't believe this shit.

20
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:06,690
I just got this car. I had that one
for a few months and then paying,

21
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:10,250
fuck that one up. Just hydro planning.
She was hired by herself. No,

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,730
I was with a couple of guys from a school.
It might get hurt. No, we're aren't.

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,700
Yeah, but it fucked the car up. I was
in a fee era. Remember Fierro? Yeah.

24
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:21,710
My sister had one of those. It's like
a little key chain Ferrari. Yeah.

25
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,670
I remember used to do so small. These
should do Ferrari kits for those. Yes.

26
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,300
It turned into a fake Testarossa
put a car bra on there.

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,870
Yeah. Those were, those were interesting.
My friend Joe had with those two.

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,040
Those were cool little cars.
Jim caught right back in the day.

29
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,600
It was like either in my hometown.
It was like, here it is a one

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,040
ridiculous car. Great. Adorable.

31
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,780
Those cars are so gross when people
do that. Yeah, and it's obvious. Well,

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,280
it's like, what do you, no one wants
that once you is that one that can't no,

33
00:01:55,281 --> 00:02:00,060
that is that the one year old
says, wow, great job. That's crazy.

34
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:02,510
That one actually looks good.
Yeah. What's I'm looking tricks.

35
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:06,300
I'm really dumb girls with that Miami.
Right.

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,690
Let me see your cell phone to the
really dumb ones. Yeah. Like that's the,

37
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,300
like if you were only looking for
really dumb gals. Yeah. That's your car.

38
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,070
Dumb gold diggers. Those louvers.
What does that in the back? Yeah.

39
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:24,600
It looks like glass louvers. Yeah. It's
probably a plastic rear window. Oh my God.

40
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:29,310
They make some cars with plastic windows
just to save weight. Okay. Relax.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,140
Relax with that. Yeah.
We, uh, my buddy and I,

42
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,150
he had one of those, we hydroplaned
spun around a couple of times.

43
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,111
Totaled it,

44
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:45,111
hit another car that was parked at a
body shop and they had just finished it.

45
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,550
No, swear to go. He's like, oh, cool. Uh,

46
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,020
I guess I'm doing two colors.
Just cost fixed.

47
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,150
Totaled by slamming into a car that
was just finished at a body shop. Yeah.

48
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,243
That was a

49
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,990
jet. That Uber is that guy's
friend. Get on down the Uber

50
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,580
[inaudible].
