00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.800
Most modern web applications
have elegant URLs.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.220
This helps people remember links,
which then can be easily bookmarked or

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.420
shared with others.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.900
As we saw in previous videos,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.210
the route decorator is used to
bind the function to a URL.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.610
But there is more to it,
than just static paths.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.850
We can make certain paths
of the URL dynamic, and

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.950
attach multiple rows to a function.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:25.100
To add variables to a URL, I can specify
a rule, with type: variable_name,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.180
where type can be an integer,
string, or another path.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.420
I will restructure the code for
my menu app as so, and

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.570
use the restaurant_id,
to specify which menu I want to see.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.340
Note that it's handy here to leave
this trailing backslash, and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.120
Flask when render the page,
even when it's not there in the URL.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.140
I will save my changes.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.218
And now when I visit
localhost:5000/restaurants/1, I

00:00:47.218 --> 00:00:49.540
can see my first restaurant menu there.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.680
If I change the integer
after restaurants,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.020
I can see my other restaurant
menus in the database, as well.
