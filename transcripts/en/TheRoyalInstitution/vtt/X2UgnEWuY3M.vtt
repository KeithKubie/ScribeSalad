00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:12.780
Because lithium ions are so tiny, it's very
difficult to see them using experiment alone.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.000
So as a chemist, I'm lucky that my research
can use more than supercomputers-- and to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.289
model what's happening inside batteries at
the atomic level.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.640
In fact, at parties-- when I get invited,
that is--

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.620
when people ask me, what do I do? I sometimes
say, I model.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.980
And this is a computer model of the atomic
structure of a lithium battery matrix.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.750
So this is a lithium cobalt oxide electrode.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.460
The cobalts are in purple.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.510
The oxygens are in red.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.990
But you can see the lithium ions zipping through
between the channels.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.210
So it's a very sheet-like structure.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.500
And the important stuff is happening between
the sheets.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.120
So you can see the lithium ion just zipping
through.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.850
So they just indicate very fast ion motion.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.719
So when you charge up your phone tonight,
probably Snapchatting too, late in the evening--

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:20.600
when you see those red and green symbols,
they just indicate that tiny lithium ions

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.500
are moving through a battery mattoo.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.549
Those tiny lithium ions are moving through
those sheets.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:35.039
But, as you may have seen in the news recently,
batteries sometimes go wrong.

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.039
They overheat and it's usually due to short
circuiting.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.850
And I should stress that this is a very rare
event, considering the billions of cells that

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.159
have being sold practically every week.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.789
So we've set up a demonstration.

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.700
And this one is so dangerous, that we couldn't
actually do it in the lecture theatre.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.219
So we're doing outside, and we're doing it--
we've set it up on the roof.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.240
So what you see there is a lithium battery
pack.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.429
It's within a perspex box. And right above
it, you can just about see a tube.

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.629
And at the top of the tube, you'll see a giant
nail.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.189
And it's gonna go straight down into that
lithium-ion battery.

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.319
And this is a serious point.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.939
Do not attempt this at home. OK?

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.120
It's gonna be pulled by that small string
there.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.860
That's gonna release the rod, and that nail
is gonna go straight down.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.760
So I think we need a countdown here.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:46.439
All right? Another countdown-- 3, 2, 1.

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:52.790
So what you're seeing there is the reaction,
right on that lithium-ion battery.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.210
So, as you can see, that is an intense reaction.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.650
Just from that nail going right through that
lithium-ion battery.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.489
So what's happening there? So what's happening
is that the nail connects the two electrodes

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.980
and short circuits the battery. Which makes
it overheat.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.750
And this mimics the short-circuiting caused
by bad battery design.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.620
But it's not the lithium that explodes.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.400
It's actually something else.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.569
It's the liquid electrolyte that sits between
the two electrodes.

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.540
And that electrolyte is made up of a lithium
salt in the solvent.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.650
And that solvent is highly flammable.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.430
And get it too hot-- and it simply erupts
out of the casing.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.590
So we're gonna see a demonstration of this,
right now.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:56.520
I think, Natasha-- I think we're ready, so
give us a demonstration.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:05.120
Great!
