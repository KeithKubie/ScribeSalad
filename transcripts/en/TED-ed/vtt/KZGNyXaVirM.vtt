00:00:06.513 --> 00:00:08.764
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:08.764 --> 00:00:10.317
Lady,

00:00:10.317 --> 00:00:11.977
woman.

00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:14.024
Lady is tied to a number of words

00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:15.524
that seem at first glance

00:00:15.524 --> 00:00:18.241
etymologically unrelated.

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:19.890
She traces her roots back

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.616
to the Old English words hlaf,

00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:25.148
which referred to a loaf of bread

00:00:25.148 --> 00:00:29.334
and is the direct ancestor of our modern word loaf,

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:30.680
and daege,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.472
which meant maid

00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:34.772
and is the root of our word dairy,

00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:38.711
the place where the dairymaid works.

00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:43.827
Together, hlaf and daege became hlafdige,

00:00:43.827 --> 00:00:46.864
literally loaf maid,

00:00:46.864 --> 00:00:50.838
or, more figuratively, kneader of bread.

00:00:50.838 --> 00:00:52.988
As early as the ninth century,

00:00:52.988 --> 00:00:56.842
hlafdige was the name for a mistress of servants,

00:00:56.842 --> 00:01:00.083
or the female head of the household.

00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:03.458
The Old English word for a male head of household

00:01:03.458 --> 00:01:05.408
was hlafweard,

00:01:05.408 --> 00:01:08.337
a compound of hlaf, loaf,

00:01:08.337 --> 00:01:09.618
and weard,

00:01:09.618 --> 00:01:11.203
which meant keeper

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:13.201
and is the word of modern words

00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:16.153
like ward and warden.

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:20.297
Both hlafweard, the breadwinner,

00:01:20.297 --> 00:01:23.189
and hlafdige, the bread kneader,

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.610
came to be titles of respect,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.657
referring to citizens of higher social standing.

00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:32.358
Through a process known as syncopation,

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:35.149
both words lost their internal sounds

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.771
to become lord and lady, respectively.

00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:42.439
Though still an expression of courtesy,

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.191
lady has since moved

00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:47.078
down the ladder of social standing

00:01:47.078 --> 00:01:48.411
and is now often used

00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:51.212
to mean simply a woman.
