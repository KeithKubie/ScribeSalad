00:00:05.886 --> 00:00:07.260
PROFESSOR: So for
today's lecture

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.310
we have Jason Ku
guest lecturing.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.790
And he's the president of
OrigaMIT, which you should all

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.360
check out Sunday afternoons,
origami club at MIT.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.472
He's an origami designer
and a grad student

00:00:18.472 --> 00:00:19.930
in mechanical
engineering, and he's

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.170
going to talk about the more
artistic perspective on how

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.910
origami design
works, in particular

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.940
in the representational and tree
method of origami design world.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.688
So take it away, Jason.

00:00:31.688 --> 00:00:32.229
JASON KU: Hi.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.090
I'm Jason.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.590
Eric gave a bit of
an introduction.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.390
I've been folding
origami instance maybe

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.580
I was five years old,
and I've been designing

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.180
origami for maybe
the past 10 years.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.600
I'm a PhD student in
mechanical engineering,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.740
working in folding things
on the micro and nano scale.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.340
So that's how this is
applying to my research.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.460
I'm here to talk a little
bit about origami art

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.970
and how the concepts we've
been talking about in class

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.140
apply to origami in actually
designing and folding

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.620
artwork out of paper.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.170
These are all the
websites that I'm

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.170
going to be pulling
pictures from.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.440
So if we can't
use these pictures

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.460
in future versions
of this lecture,

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.830
then you can still
see some of the media.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.350
I want first make the analogy
of origami art to music.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.230
Many, many people
make this analogy,

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.570
and it's actually
very apt analogy.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.790
In music you have
composers, you have

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:01.450
people who produce a work of
music, design the structure,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.850
design what the main
aspects of the piece

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.139
are, in terms of a
structural sense,

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.720
but aren't necessarily
performers themselves.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.380
Now in origami, the
performer and the composer

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.630
are usually one and the same.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.110
But hopefully in the future,
that won't always be the case.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.975
In music the composer
usually makes

00:02:25.975 --> 00:02:29.780
a piece for multiple instruments
or multiple voices or things

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.027
like that, so most the time
can't do all that performance.

00:02:34.027 --> 00:02:36.360
And some people are more
gifted in the performance side.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.980
Some people are more gifted
in the composition side.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.370
And I think it's a
fairly apt analogy.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.560
There's tons of
mathematics in music.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.350
There's tons of
mathematics in origami.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.890
But there's also this level
of artistic complexity, which

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.640
we'll see later in this lecture.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.710
I'm going to concentrate mostly
on representational origami.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.060
Representational
origami is traditionally

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.520
representing living
things in our world,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.390
but it's pretty much, you
see something not necessarily

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.210
living, but you see
something and you

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.580
want to make that form
for the form's sake,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.290
to represent that form.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.750
And this is different
than, say, patterning

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.160
to create artistic patterns
on a sheet of paper,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.910
tessellating, making
geometric polyhedra,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:38.060
or making more abstract art
that doesn't necessarily

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.580
have a relation to
a real world object.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.400
So I'm going to start with a
little bit about origami art.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.380
We've heard this.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.106
Eric mentioned this particular
individual, Akira Yoshizawa.

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:57.810
He is widely understood to be
the father of modern origami.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.340
He was born in 1911.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.020
He was around for
a very long time.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.580
Unfortunately,
passed away in 2005.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.600
I was lucky enough to get
to meet Akira Yoshizawa when

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.140
he attended a convention
in North Carolina

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.250
when I was maybe around 10.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.320
He was very powerful
and influential

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.470
in the world of origami, because
he was one of the first people

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.130
to start creating new models,
be able to look at an object

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.890
and create that object
just from folding.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.300
He was one of the first
people to actually try

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.450
to make a large
number of new models,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.080
as opposed to the
past many centuries

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.440
when only a few traditional
models were known or pursued.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.110
This is a picture of
Yoshizawa right here.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.260
He's fairly happy
in this picture.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.800
But he's holding the logo
of the US organization

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.770
in origami, OrigamiUSA,
which is this sailboat.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.470
But as you can see, different
than the traditional origami

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.790
crane or the frog or
things like that, you

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.320
see a lot of curves in his
work, a lot of shaping.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.410
He uses a technique called
wet-folding, in which he

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.770
weakens the paper
to some degree,

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.710
weakens the paper fibers
by applying water, shaping

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.170
the paper, and letting it dry
so that it holds that form.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:44.130
And you can see in this
sparrow-- this is particularly

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.280
one of my favorite
works by Yoshizawa--

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.870
it really has the essence
of this little bird,

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.190
but is actually very
simple and elegant.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.680
Origami design isn't
all about making

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.630
the most complex
thing in the world.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.750
It's really trying to
represent a subject elegantly.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.930
And I think this model does
a very good job with that.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.660
But you can see here, very
clean surfaces, not a lot

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.160
of extra creases
that you can see.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.450
Traditionally, wet-folding
uses thicker paper

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.825
and is slightly
more substantial.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.100
So here are some
of his other works.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.020
And I want to start
out with Yoshizawa

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.770
because he was represented
as the father and the master,

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.470
and many, many of the
origami designers,

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.080
if not all of the origami
designers that I'm

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.580
going to continue to
talk about were heavily

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.630
influenced by Yoshizawa.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.920
So I'm going to first talk
about the traditional style.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.690
And I'm going to compare it
to, say, the crane or the frog.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.470
These types of models are
characterized by straight,

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.610
well-defined, polygons
in the final form,

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.540
typically folded flat.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.500
Little shaping is
traditionally needed

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.110
to go from the base of the
model to the final form.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.040
It's very geometric,
these models,

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.600
characterized by very
straight, precise creases.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.220
So here is, I think,
a very good example

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.220
of this traditional style.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.200
While there are
some curves here,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.440
everything is very
well-defined, maybe

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.260
just a slight shaping here.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.070
But even that is
fairly well-defined.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:59.820
But you can see Komatsu, Hideo
Komatsu, a Japanese folder,

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:06.450
uses really clean, large
polygons of open paper

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.650
without creases on them
to represent polygons

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.690
on the model.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.060
The folded form.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.780
His design process isn't
really using tree theory.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.460
I mean, all origami design
is subjected to the condition

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:27.470
that no two points on
the unfolded square

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.400
can increase in distance
in the folded form.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.039
That's a property called
developability of the paper.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:40.960
The paper's not going
to stretch, basically.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.710
So all origami design is
subject to that condition,

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.800
but you don't have to deal with
necessarily these things called

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.050
uniaxial bases.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:53.550
Pretty much all of these
models are non-uniaxial.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.510
His design process is
kind of a trial and error

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:03.760
process of folding along
different 22.5 degree grids.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:12.800
22.5 degrees is, I
guess, 1/8 of pi.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.580
1/16 of 360 degrees.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:22.160
And it's a particularly nice
and useful discretization

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.900
of angles in origami design.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:30.280
All the traditional bases are
based on this 22.5 degree grid

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.770
system.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.550
And there's a certain
elegance of that.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:37.030
Actually I think, the mouse
is based on a 30 degree grid

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:42.400
system, but is kind
of an exception,

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.310
but follows the same principles.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:49.160
He keeps folding
a piece of paper

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.800
and tries to get these
geometric shapes that really

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.580
are able to by themselves
capture the model.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:04.710
And I'm going to use some
of that design technique

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.690
later in a design example.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.620
He has a small but
very distinguished

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:18.370
repertoire because his process
is less algorithmic-- I mean,

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:25.100
he has algorithms, I'm sure,
that are difficult to describe,

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.520
but his process is
actually very artistic.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.840
And while it's
very exact, I think

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:38.530
it's one of the most elegant
examples of origami design.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.930
Here's another example
of the traditional style.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.290
As you can see, there's slightly
more curves and things in it,

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:51.640
but it's fairly
well characterized

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.920
by these straight creases.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.570
Heavier paper for wet-folding.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.370
This model on the left
here is box pleated.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:08.560
So as opposed to the
22.5 degrees structure,

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.390
box pleating is characterized
by only multiples of 45 degrees.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.160
So pi over 4.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:24.700
And so you see the
grid here, this model

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.860
is based on a fairly
large grid, so you

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.510
can get the detail
that it needs.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.230
These are not
uniaxial bases, again,

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.080
but they're still limited
by this stretch ability

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.830
constraint.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.620
And those were
styles that stemmed

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:50.290
from the traditional
crisp folding of say

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.160
the crane and the crab
and the frog and all

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.640
these traditional designs.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.360
The non-traditional
style is more

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.224
an extension of Yoshizawa's work
and shaping and curved folding

00:12:03.224 --> 00:12:04.390
and things like wet-folding.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.520
There is much shape
that needs to be

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.970
done to create the
essence of the model.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:23.140
The model is encapsulated by
not necessarily the structure

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:28.600
as much, but of the final
shaping, the undefined shaping

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.290
that you kind of
put into the model.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:35.160
Here's an example
of an English folder

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.230
named David Brill, who
is an investment banker,

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.700
if my memory serves me.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.070
He now lives on a golf course.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:48.850
And I think he's retired now,
but he likes to fold paper.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:54.360
But you can see
here, a good example

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.710
of this style, thick paper.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.160
The character of
the model is really

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:12.260
defined by these curved
tension folds, which

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:17.770
is slightly different than at
least the traditional style.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.850
And oftentimes, it's
very, very difficult

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:27.340
to replicate to any of
these types of models,

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:33.790
because it has so much to do
with subjectivity as opposed

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.360
to objectivity, as in
the traditional style.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.090
Here's another good
example, Michael LaFosse.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:47.510
He's a paper folder who actually
resides here in Massachusetts.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.300
He's in Haverhill,
"Have-er-ill,"

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.900
something like
that, Massachusetts.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:57.310
He is unique in origami
designers in the fact

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.940
that he is also an
avid paper maker.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.980
So he actually makes a lot
of the media which he folds.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.090
And that gives this
intimate relationship

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:10.480
between the life
cycle of the paper.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:20.330
He's able to make
specialty paper that's

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.230
really necessary to make some
of the most complex works

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.790
out there.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.530
He's gone to culinary school.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.510
He was a chef for a while.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.710
And he was also a marine
biologist for a while.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.970
So these origami
artists have come

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.300
from many different
walks of life.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:49.790
This next folder, Eric
Joisel, he's a Frenchman,

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.640
lives in Paris.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.780
He was a former clay sculptor.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.500
And actually, I think you can
really see that in his work,

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:05.470
the kind of solidness
and really cohesiveness

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:08.140
of his composition.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:14.490
All the detail and
texturing are very well

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.247
thought out in terms of the
subject as a complete piece.

00:15:18.247 --> 00:15:19.580
Heavily influenced by Yoshizawa.

00:15:22.831 --> 00:15:27.600
A lot of this use of texture,
incorporating texture

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:33.270
into his models, he was a
big pioneer in that area.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.070
This texturing is fairly
obviously non-uniaxial.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.640
He doesn't go
through a tree method

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.170
and represent each
one of these points

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.680
as a stick in a stick figure.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.950
These flaps don't
lie along an axis.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.880
They don't hinge
perpendicular to that axis.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:02.590
Yet he's able to create
these amazing forms in paper.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.940
He has stopped
doing clay sculpture

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.080
and does origami full time now.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:13.530
He's very well known for his
depiction of the human form.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:17.690
This is taken from a
collection of masks.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.980
He's done numerous,
numerous masks

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.100
that are really very expressive.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.840
He was one of the first people
to really, for me at least,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:35.490
evoke emotion and convey
emotion in his work.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:40.580
But you can see here, the
structural crease pattern

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.340
for this face is actually
very, very simple.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.420
It's kind of represented
by a few pleats.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.620
But the amount of work used to
transform that very simple form

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:57.790
into this very expressive,
curved work of art

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.200
is kind of astonishing.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:06.210
Here's a more recent work
of the entire human form.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:16.130
You see how this is starting
to come as some sort of blend

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:19.369
between the traditional
and nontraditional forms.

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:22.109
It lies somewhere
along the spectrum.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:24.920
But it's a very
complex model, so it

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.240
had needs to have this
structural complexity.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.840
But at the same time, he
shapes it to an extent

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.960
that very few people can do.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.170
I'm paraphrasing a
quote of his, but he's

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:47.550
of the opinion that
if you can reproduce

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:52.560
exactly a piece of origami
then it's not really art,

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:58.190
because you're not putting
anything more into the model,

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.050
if it doesn't have something
unique and original

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:06.330
and something that can't
be reproduced in the model.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:12.290
Here's two fantastic subjects
in terms of art, to me.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:18.370
Very Escher-like and
it's self-referencing.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.420
This is called
the Self-made Man.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.960
And I forget the
title of this work,

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.050
but he's basically
emerging from the paper.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:31.240
You see that his arm and leg
are not actually finished.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.910
I think this is called
Birth, actually.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:41.640
But really, using paper to
express an artistic idea,

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.720
very few people get to
that stage of competency

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.770
with the technical and
being able to infuse

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.250
that emotion into the subject.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:59.070
So Eric Joisel is a pioneer
in that realm of origami art.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.890
Here are three
very, very complex--

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.740
These are very recent
works, probably

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.840
within the last year or two.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:15.200
Lots of use of texturing
to make the armor here.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.590
Lots of planning,
tree theory included.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.310
These are mostly
box pleated models,

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.510
but you can't really
tell from here because

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:29.760
of his impeccable
ability to shape a model.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.500
I'm going to remind you
guys that everything

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.230
I'm showing to you is a
representational work.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.250
Each one of these is made
from a single uncut square.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.380
Pretty much, I
believe everything

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.507
I'm going to show you
today has that property.

00:19:47.507 --> 00:19:49.992
AUDIENCE: When people fold
these, do they fold them

00:19:49.992 --> 00:19:51.980
by hand or do they
need special tools?

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.465
To me, this looks like
it would be completely

00:19:54.465 --> 00:19:55.956
impossible to just
fold it by hand.

00:20:01.321 --> 00:20:03.320
JASON KU: These are
actually fairly large works.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.550
Each one stands maybe
about that tall.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.620
So the paper's very
large to begin.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.140
But yeah, I believe
he just uses his hands

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.290
and this wet-folding
technique to allow

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.090
things to be held in place.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:21.140
I mean, many people, including
Eric Joisel, use clips

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.090
and braces and things like that
to hold certain things in place

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.990
while he's working on
other areas of the model,

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.310
but it's pretty much by hand.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.340
Some people use tweezers
or things like that.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.070
But most of it is by hand.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:36.430
AUDIENCE: Does he add color
or shade or those things?

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:38.250
JASON KU: Sometimes.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:42.160
For example, that mask I
think was speckled with paint

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.090
after, before or after.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:55.140
There are different opinions
on this idea of origami purity.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.490
I like Robert Lang's
definition of origami,

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:11.040
that it's any work
whose primary structure

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.550
is defined by folding.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:17.540
And that's a very broad
definition of origami.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.820
But I think it
works really well.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:26.400
So if the subject matter is
still heavily characterized

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.820
by the folding and
not some other thing

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.100
that you do to
the model, I think

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.400
most people are OK with
that, as long as you're not

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.650
trying to pass it off
as something it's not.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.450
There are many origami designers
to do multi-sheet things

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:52.010
and do very complex works and
very beautiful pieces of art.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.750
I think Joseph Wu is a
great example of this,

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.520
who I don't have
pictures of his work.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.270
But he doesn't try to pass them
off a single sheet origami.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.680
He is a very skilled designer.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.380
He could do it with
a single sheet,

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.380
but he finds that the
solution is more elegant

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.797
using multiple sheets.

00:22:10.797 --> 00:22:11.630
Any other questions?

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:18.420
Just one more picture of
some of Joisel's work.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:24.110
He actually made an entire
orchestra of these little guys.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.130
This is two sheets.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.300
The saxophone is
a different sheet.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:31.255
But again, he's not
trying to pass them off

00:22:31.255 --> 00:22:40.440
as being the same sheet here,
whereas in here, the weapons

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.750
actually are from the
same sheet of paper.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.870
And these multi-subject
pieces, each one of these, it's

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.730
not all three of them
together as one sheet.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.740
Just to clarify.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.880
But these multi-subject,
trying to represents

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.910
clothes, and weapons,
and the human,

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:05.700
and all these types of things,
is becoming more and more a way

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.890
to a push the limits
of origami design.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:13.500
So again, trying to breathe life
into the paper is really what

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:18.830
Yoshizawa's mantra was,
and so is Eric Joisel's.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:19.330
All right.

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:27.780
So I'm going to move on to this
independent concept of really

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.990
the ability that
we have right now

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:35.550
to pretty much-- We have the
algorithms to make anything

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.830
we want and really
trying to capture

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:43.575
that is this idea that I
call this modern realism.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:54.790
The style, like
Eric Joisel's work,

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.700
kind of follow
along the spectrum

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:03.620
of this rigid structure
and this free-form shaping,

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:09.590
but really try to capture
this realism of the subject.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:14.040
So I think Robert Lang is
one of the foremost origami

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.690
designers in this kind of area.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:21.000
He's a guy from
California who is

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.050
a pioneer of algorithmic
origami design.

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.540
You've heard his name
a number of times.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.600
He has kind of
codified tree theory,

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.040
if not one of the
pioneers of establishing

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.950
that research himself.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:42.530
He wrote the program TreeMaker
that you guys are all probably

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.130
using to do your homework.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:52.520
He was at Caltech Ph.D., and
was a laser physicist for NASA.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:57.050
And he decided maybe
less than 10 years ago

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:00.740
to quit and do
origami full time.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.900
So that's what he does now.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.280
So here's a number of his works.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.520
Very complex, very exact.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:16.720
For example, he
was a huge pioneer

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.980
of what we call the Bug Wars.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.490
When we had these
tools at our disposal

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:28.340
to make very complex
trees, we can

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.080
represent very, very
complex subjects.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.900
And that led to this Bug
Wars of trying to one-up

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:39.370
each other on how many legs you
could make or things like that.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.630
So here's a centipede,
for example,

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.610
with lots and lots of legs.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:49.550
And the exactness to which
we can specify the tree

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.550
is phenomenal.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:55.680
For example, the
scorpion here is a design

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.450
that Robert Lang
has approached--

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:02.540
a subject he's approached--
many, many, many times.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.910
This is a design that
I particularly like.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:12.330
It's very clean in its folded
and its structural forms.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:16.450
But he actually used
TreeMaker and designed

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.080
each of these pairs
of legs to actually

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:23.350
be increasing in
length as they go back.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:27.870
So really being very
exact with the proportions

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:30.790
of the model, the
proportions in the tree.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.730
And tree theory
really allows you

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.280
to do that, to capture that.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.520
Here's a slide for the
mathematicians in here.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.600
This is not one
square sheet of paper.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.070
This is probably the only
model here that isn't.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:53.190
But it's what we call modular
origami, making a single unit

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.870
and sticking them all together
in a very complex and elegant

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:57.380
way.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.650
Here's a representation of
some of the tessellation work

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.900
that Robert Lang
has been working on.

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:12.800
This is a vase form.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.210
And all these, or at
least these three,

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:20.880
were very much characterized
by using mathematics

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.070
to find these forms.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:26.200
And while they're very
heavily rooted in mathematics.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.380
Mathematics, as I'm sure
all of us can appreciate,

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.840
is an elegant subject
in and of itself.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.920
There are elegant
solutions to problems.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.090
And in origami it's
particularly nice,

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.400
because these elegant
solutions often

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.840
are very elegant and
pleasing to the eye, as well.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.630
So this is also a Klein bottle.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.690
It's kind of a joke.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:53.610
But it topologically does
intersect and things like that.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:57.500
So in an interesting work.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:01.310
I want to move on to a
guy named Brian Chan, who

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.270
is an alumni of MIT.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:08.560
He got his bachelor's, his
master's, and his Ph.D. at MIT.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.420
He defended his Ph.D.
in 2009, but he's still

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.510
around Cambridge.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:22.230
He is a big pioneer of pushing
the limits of complex folding.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:26.610
He's picked up origami
design very quickly.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.040
And so it is possible to do.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.270
So I encourage all
of you to try it.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:36.410
Here is an example of a very,
very complex centipede that he

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:39.885
designed kind of in
response to Robert Lang's.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:53.640
There's a huge history
of really trying

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.760
to one-up each other in origami.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:00.090
And it really helps
spur the creativity.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:05.970
And playful competition is
very useful to any subject.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.700
These multi-subject
things, like this

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:13.510
rose, the stem and
the petals itself,

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.610
all from one square
sheet of paper.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.390
He uses color change.

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:20.050
One side of the paper is red;
one side of the paper is green.

00:29:24.756 --> 00:29:26.880
There have been tons of
people that design just the

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.110
rose part of the rose, and then
they make an additional stem

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:32.360
and stick it on.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.280
This is the first
one-piece model of that.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.140
And was somewhat
influential in that respect.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:44.200
Here's a very complex,
textured character

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.790
from an anime TV show.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.120
I forget which one it's called.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.100
AUDIENCE: Rozen Maiden.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.750
JASON KU: Rozen
Maiden Thank you.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:50.740
That is correct.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.410
But you really can see his
use of color change here.

00:29:54.410 --> 00:30:02.980
Again, being able to make
this cross in the fabric here.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:10.450
The zigzags of lace, and
this texturing of the dress,

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:15.560
very, very complex, in its form.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:19.850
But these are all
actually uniaxial bases,

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.830
all come from this
idea of tree theory,

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.520
being able to map
things on your subject

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.330
to the sheet of paper
in an algorithmic way.

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:36.400
Here's a very complex, another
anime work, a Neko Bus.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.480
Neko is, I believe,
Japanese for cat.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.970
And it's very, very complex.

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.000
Again, similar to the centipede.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.930
Lots and lots of points.

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.780
But this tree is actually
kind of represented

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.260
by-- There's a head
region and there's

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:55.630
many points sticking
out on both sides.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:59.530
And then this flap kind of
comes over and attaches up here,

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:02.640
and you've got the tail.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.670
Here's another example
of a multi-subject model.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:09.530
Every year there's
a design challenge

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.610
in New York for origami.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:15.200
And this was the
sailing ship category.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.740
And he kind of went
another direction with it.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.310
He did make a sailing
ship, but this

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:24.540
is a kraken attacking the ship.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.160
He's got a little person
in one of his tentacles.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.700
Part of the ship
and the ship itself,

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:33.950
and it's all one square sheet
of paper without cutting.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:39.390
And if that wasn't enough,
then the MIT seal, as well.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.140
One square sheet of
paper without cutting.

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:46.960
The mens and manus,
so the mind and hand.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:53.830
And I believe this isn't
traditionally a crane,

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.070
but yeah.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:57.520
The last person I
want to touch on

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.720
is a guy named
Satoshi Kamiya, who's

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:07.390
represented as probably
the foremost pioneer

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.130
of super-complex origami.

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.620
He is a little further
on the spectrum

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.810
on the traditional
style than many

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:19.090
of these other
super-complex folders,

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:23.990
characterized by kind of
very exact, straight creases,

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:30.670
this texturing for example, a
unique balance between making

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:37.040
a very cleanly folded--
The Japanese traditionally

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:42.080
make very clean subjects in
terms of exactness and form.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.800
Here's a little more
shaping in the wet-folding.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.460
But again, this is one
of my favorite works

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.700
of his, another Lord
of the Rings character.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.910
What's neat about this
sea turtle actually,

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:01.310
the diagrams for it
were just published.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:06.950
I first all this work in
2001 or something like that.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:11.080
But it has these plates
on the back, this texture,

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.110
but it also has plates on
the front of the model.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:15.970
So you can actually
pick it up, and it

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:20.220
looks very, very convincing.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.280
Here are some more
models by him.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.200
Again, you can see a lot
of this texturing here

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:30.300
in this wasp, very
clean folding.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:34.930
A dog, multi-headed
dog, a caribou

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:39.320
with very complicated antler
patterns, and this dragon.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.000
And again, you see the
crisp, clean folding,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.800
but at the same time very
well-planned and well-designed

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.330
3D structure to be
shaped afterwards.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.890
Here's another work that
I particularly enjoy.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:02.430
Really lending this texturing
he applies throughout the model,

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:06.730
and it's a very
cohesive subject,

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:07.870
from an artistic sense.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:10.800
It's very complete.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.840
There's the same level
of detail everywhere

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.860
on the model, which
is very useful.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.300
And I'm going to kind of
end this artistic side

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:22.170
with a model which
is widely regarded

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:26.870
as the most complex
single work in origami.

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:31.580
This took Kamiya over the
course of a year to fold.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.010
There's thousands of
scales on this guy.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:37.260
And again, it's one square
sheet of paper without cutting.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.701
You see that it's
a very long model.

00:34:41.701 --> 00:34:43.159
You'd think that
this subject would

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:46.139
be much better represented
by a long rectangle

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:47.550
or something like that.

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:50.750
But actually it's
very symmetric.

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:55.889
This crease pattern,
which we'll look at later,

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:58.800
actually has an
asymmetric crease pattern

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.020
and is quite ingenious
in how he decides

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.820
to accomplish this
form and structure.

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:10.220
If you're interested in learning
more about the origami art

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:15.160
side of things, there's this
phenomenal document documentary

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.350
which you can and
purchase online.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:23.020
Or I've believe OrigaMIT
has a copy of this,

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:26.320
and we'll probably be
screening it some time

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.930
this semester or next.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:31.100
It's called Between the Folds.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:38.160
And it features, among others,
both Erik and Marty Demaine,

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.520
Robert Lang, and many more.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.860
And there's a picture
of Stata from the film.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:48.705
Now we're going to move on a
little bit to origami design.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.140
We've learned what
the algorithms are

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.030
behind a lot of origami
design, but now we're

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:04.660
going to see how that applies
more directly to creating

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.210
a representational work of art.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:08.720
If you're really
serious about wanting

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.340
to get into origami design, this
book, Origami Design Secrets

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.040
by Robert Lang, is really
the first major book

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.370
on the methods of
origami design.

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:23.560
Most origami books are
traditionally about diagrams,

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.550
trying to fold specific models.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.880
This is the first
book really to lay out

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.640
some of the ground rules
of how you create models.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.570
And it goes through a number of
the things we've talked about.

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:40.050
So just to review a little bit
about tree theory, the idea,

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:45.150
the process is you start with
a subject, like this picture

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:49.980
I took at a Japanese
museum of a little crab.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.770
You kind of draw a
little stick figure

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:57.610
of what that crab might look
like in a one-dimensional form,

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:59.550
characterized just
by the lengths

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:02.500
of these flaps and
the connectedness.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:06.380
You go from here to here
to an origami base, which

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.380
has all of those flaps
of the right length

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.877
and connected in the right way.

00:37:11.877 --> 00:37:13.710
And then you shape it
into an origami model.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:21.110
Now this method, this step here
might seem hard to you guys.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:28.920
With a little experience,
it's actually very reasonable

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.530
to assume that someone
fairly well versed

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.020
in the vocabulary
of origami will

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.570
be able to accomplish that step.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:40.720
This step, again, this kind
of child's play, somewhat.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.850
It's actually not,
to do it really well,

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:46.600
to represent this model
as a stick figure,

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:52.230
and we'll see that when we
try to go through an example.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.950
This step is the one where
algorithms and mathematics

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:59.030
really help to do a
lot of the work for us,

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:04.550
and essentially is kind of the
easy part from our perspective,

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:07.680
because it's kind of
methodical and there's

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.360
algorithms involved
to help us out.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:18.590
The most artistic
and free things

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:21.540
we can do with
origami design are

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.320
kind of this step in the
shaping and this step

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.200
in defining the proportions.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:31.990
In this step really you define
what the abstraction you

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:33.930
choose to characterize
in your model.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:38.450
Like here, we are
choosing to represent

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:40.590
all four legs on either side.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.400
You don't have too.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:50.760
But we also decided to model
the eyes and the claws as is.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.630
But an underbelly to a crab.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:57.820
We could have modeled
that with the texture.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:03.220
We could have modeled the
little mouth parts of the crab.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.930
There are many things we
could choose to model on here

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.590
that we don't choose to.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.820
So this is one level
of abstraction.

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:16.150
And this comes with
a lot of choice.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:20.040
Here, there's lots of algorithms
and math to help us out.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.880
But as we'll see,
there is actually

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.200
a lot of choice going
from here to here

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.470
as well, artistic choice,
and from here to here, again,

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:37.300
probably the most blatant
way that an artist can

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.740
put his style in essence
into an origami work.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:47.587
AUDIENCE: What is
the extra fringe?

00:39:47.587 --> 00:39:48.420
JASON KU: Which one?

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:48.980
This?

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:51.310
AUDIENCE: Diagonal from the top.

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:52.404
AUDIENCE: On the left.

00:39:52.404 --> 00:39:53.320
JASON KU: On the left.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.431
Oh, this?

00:39:54.431 --> 00:39:54.930
OK.

00:39:54.930 --> 00:40:01.260
So I modeled here
the body of this crab

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.900
as a flap coming from here.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:07.370
I kind of wanted a flap
to cover the rest of this.

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:11.260
And so that's why I've added
this leg of the tree there.

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:21.620
While branch edges-- this
is a branch edge, it doesn't

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:27.130
terminate-- will provide
paper in that region,

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:31.190
as we'll see later,
branch edges of the tree,

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:35.060
rivers in the space
allocation, really

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.970
don't lend themselves to
being shaped very easily.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:42.400
And so if I isolate
that body segment

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.010
as a leaf edge
for itself, then I

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:49.700
can actually do
control a little more

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.520
about how I'm able to shape it.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.890
Good question.

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:55.790
So we're going to
review a little bit

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:57.540
about uniaxial bases.

00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:03.520
This these are the definitions
that Erik Demaine posed

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:09.080
in the algorithm, I
think in lecture four.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.750
Again, you have
this uniaxial base.

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:18.180
It has these
characteristics that it's

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:25.230
in the positive space above
the z equals zero plane.

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:28.670
And that's kind of
represented here.

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:35.300
The intersection with that
plane is the projection.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:39.210
So if you shine
the light above it,

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:42.030
it would cast a shadow of
a stick figure out, which

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:43.610
is exactly kind of what we want.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:47.840
We want to make an origami
base that associates itself

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.000
with a stick figure.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.920
And then we partition
the faces into flaps.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.295
So there's all
these definitions.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.820
I think to put these in
kind of layman's terms

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:06.290
from an origami designer's
point of view, what

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:09.880
do these really mean?

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:13.260
Really, the important
characteristics that we want

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:17.950
are that the flaps lie along
or straddle a single line.

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:21.480
Because if they do that, then
we could just fold it in half

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.510
and it will have that
property of everything

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:29.690
being above an axis and
everything lying along an axis,

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:33.620
and that the flaps hinge
perpendicular to that axis.

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:37.160
The reason why we need the
flaps to hinge perpendicular

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.290
to the axis is if they don't
hinge perpendicular to the axis

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:50.540
then you will not be able
to create a projection

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.910
to the plane that is a
one-dimensional stick figure.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:56.880
If these hinges are
tilted then that line

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.540
will project to a line instead
of a point, like we'd want.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:04.790
We'd want it to project to
a single node on the tree.

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:08.500
In any of these
uniaxial bases, think

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:12.210
about the base being thinned
in the limiting case, that we

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:20.150
can create folds parallel to
this axis and thin this model

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:22.830
until it's right along the axis.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:25.360
And then in that
limiting case it

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.800
is a stick figure, essentially.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.420
And once it is a stick figure,
layering and orientation

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.110
of the flaps really
don't matter,

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:38.460
because it is the stick figure.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.670
So this is kind of an
informal definition,

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:45.830
but we'll use these
later in the lecture.

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:47.180
So what is a flap?

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:54.210
We kind of made this argument
a couple lectures ago.

00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.550
So we want to model a flap, so
that we can kind of stick it

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:01.227
together.

00:44:01.227 --> 00:44:02.810
And this is kind of
an intuitive sense

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:07.400
of we take a sheet of paper,
we thin it a little bit,

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:12.510
we hinge it perpendicular
to some axis.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:16.120
And when we do and
we unfold the paper,

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.120
we see that it
takes up this kind

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.975
of quarter octagon of paper.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.700
Now, if we continue
to thin this,

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.680
if we make it
really, really thin,

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:37.160
you see how deep the boundary,
this fold that we make,

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:41.960
will little closer and
closer approximate a circle.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.600
Everyone see that?

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.300
It's kind of like an umbrella.

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.950
I like this analogy
with an umbrella.

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.335
That you have a
single point that's

00:44:49.335 --> 00:44:50.710
the center the
umbrella, and when

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:55.980
you close the umbrella,
all of the umbrella

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:59.180
kind of maps to a single line.

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:06.450
And so it's neat to
see on the paper.

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:08.340
It's kind of what
you could think

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:12.150
of as a projection to this tree.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:19.690
Lines on the unfolded
square, these lines

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:22.800
at the edges of the circle,
map to a single point

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:30.400
on this flap, or infinitely thin
flap, or essentially the tree.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:38.150
This is kind of a
leaf edge of our tree.

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:43.170
And so everything along this
line maps to a single point,

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:44.830
is compressed onto
a single point.

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:50.280
You can do that with any
point going up this flap.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.620
We can actually pick
off a point here,

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:59.840
and we see a line of constant
elevation with respect

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.010
to this flap.

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:07.540
And so now we've created
a very, very simple tree.

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:13.710
Instead of one leaf
edge extending off

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:18.400
of the rest of the model, we
have a branch edge, and then

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.880
a leaf edge.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:27.730
And this branch edge is
corresponding to this strip

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:29.660
of paper here of constant width.

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.660
That's what we call a river.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:35.540
And we see that a circle is
just a limiting case of a river.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:40.240
Rivers separates two parts of
the model off from each other

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.480
by a constant distance.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.560
That's what that constant
thickness strip of paper means.

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.750
And the circle is really
just a limiting case

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:54.625
off that river that separates
only a single point away

00:46:54.625 --> 00:46:55.750
from the rest of the model.

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.620
That's all I want
to say about that.

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:09.790
And we can actually
tile these rivers

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:12.360
onto a plane to create
arbitrary trees.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:15.976
So here's an example
of the correspondence.

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:22.880
I call these
circle/river packings.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.980
That's the common term
in origami design.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.360
This is a circle/river packing.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.960
It's kind of a space allocation.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.920
It's an idealization.

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.610
The model we make
is actually not

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:38.090
going to be infinitely thin.

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:44.102
So each flap is going to take up
more space than these circles.

00:47:44.102 --> 00:47:45.310
But it's a good idealization.

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:53.480
This circle/river packing
or this space allocation

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:56.140
actually maps
uniquely to as a tree.

00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:01.190
So if we go through
it, this point,

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:07.050
this circle here might map
to this line on the tree.

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:11.840
It can actually also map to this
line, this edge or this edge,

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.860
as well.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:18.255
Because I don't really care
how these flaps are oriented.

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.340
The tree is just
supposed to preserve

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.730
length and connectedness.

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:28.000
It doesn't really have to do
with where they're mapped.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.340
And so we'll see some
examples of that later.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:37.420
But we can kind of
go through this tree

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:42.900
and see all the
different aspects of it,

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:47.440
how the edges correspond
to circles and rivers

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:48.720
on the packing.

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.890
And we're going to do a
little bit of practice

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:56.450
for that, because I think
that was one of the day

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:59.390
hardest parts for me starting
out in origami design,

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:03.600
was being able to be comfortable
with going from a tree

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.450
to a space allocation, from
a space allocation to a tree.

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:11.490
Getting that concept in my
head was kind of difficult.

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:14.320
So how about we
practice a little bit.

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.950
We have this space allocation
of maybe two circles, a river,

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:22.890
and three more circles.

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:28.550
I'll just give you a second to
see which one of these trees

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:34.190
is represented by
this space allocation.

00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:38.100
Or should I say
how many of these.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:42.170
Because some of these
trees might be equivalent.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:46.420
So we're going to start with
the upper right one here.

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:54.610
Does it correspond to
this space allocation?

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:55.240
Yes or no?

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:55.970
No.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:57.224
Why?

00:49:57.224 --> 00:49:58.156
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:58.156 --> 00:49:58.780
JASON KU: Yeah.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:00.320
So the topology's kind of wrong.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.250
You've got three equal
length flaps up here,

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:04.320
which is what we want.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.420
We want three equal
length flaps separated off

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:12.430
from the rest of the model by
a river of the same length.

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:13.560
That makes sense.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:18.860
But instead of separating
off two flaps, two leaf

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:21.930
edges of maybe
twice the length, it

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:26.510
separates three of the same
length, which doesn't quite

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:27.040
work out.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.700
So the distances and
the connectivity's

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.830
kind of off here, just
terms of the numbers.

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:34.315
So this one's wrong.

00:50:34.315 --> 00:50:36.860
How about this one?

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:37.360
Yes.

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:37.940
Right?

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:41.000
It has the right topology.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.810
This one?

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:44.600
No, again.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.660
The wrong typology.

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:52.510
There is, again, three separated
from two by a branch edge.

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:57.100
But it doesn't have
the right lengths

00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.800
associated with this
space allocation.

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.710
And how about this one?

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:01.210
Yes.

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:03.030
Right?

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:07.230
I've transformed this
tree from here to here.

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:11.700
I just moved them around
with respect to each other.

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:16.200
They're equivalent, in terms
of how we choose our tree.

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:20.190
And this will be important
when we actually use TreeMaker.

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:28.220
Because it doesn't matter how
we orient things in our tree,

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:33.570
we can manipulate where we
put our circles on the paper

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:35.150
to get the same tree.

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:38.640
The mapping from here
to a tree is unique.

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:41.020
Mapping from a tree
to a space allocation

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:45.395
is not, which leads to
interesting design choices

00:51:45.395 --> 00:51:49.780
that you can make in
designing an origami model.

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:52.440
Yeah, those two.

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.630
One more time.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.130
We'll go through this
one a little quicker.

00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:59.460
I'll give you maybe
five seconds or so.

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:06.550
So we're going to start with
this one, the first one.

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:10.380
Does that map to this
space allocation?

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:12.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:14.040
JASON KU: Yes, it does.

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:21.050
We have two equal length set off
from the same length to equal,

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:22.580
and then one twice as big.

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:28.780
And see how I've actually
added a redundant node here.

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:34.220
I've split this leaf edge into
a branch edge and a leaf edge.

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:37.370
That's kind of a redundant
node that I don't really need.

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:40.210
It doesn't really change
the topology of this at all.

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:44.250
It would just map to
a line right here.

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:45.360
Everyone see that?

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.330
How about this one?

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:47.830
No.

00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:48.580
Right?

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:51.470
For a number of reasons
that I won't go into.

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:53.910
How about this one?

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:54.410
No.

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:58.430
Again, the distances and
the topology are wrong.

00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:59.970
This one?

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:01.500
No.

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:05.110
This is actually one of the
trees from the slide before.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:06.530
And this one?

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:07.660
Yes.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:10.870
This is actually just a
manipulation of that tree.

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:12.170
So yay!

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:13.790
We're awesome.

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:16.670
Now, going the other way
is not necessarily unique.

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:22.000
So there would be
multiple answers here.

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:31.670
Is this a correct
representation of this tree?

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:33.644
Yes or no?

00:53:33.644 --> 00:53:34.440
AUDIENCE: No.

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.315
JASON KU: It has the
correct topology, right?

00:53:36.315 --> 00:53:39.580
It has three equal length
flaps separated off by a river

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:40.840
from three equal length flaps.

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:41.881
That's what we have here.

00:53:41.881 --> 00:53:47.000
But this river is actually twice
as long as any of these flaps.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.810
So this is actually
a little bit shorter

00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:52.300
than the length of
any of these flaps,

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:55.150
not really working for us there.

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:57.420
How about this one?

00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.460
No, for pretty much
the same reason.

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:03.260
It actually has a very
similar, if not identical, tree

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:05.830
to this one.

00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:07.770
How about this one?

00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:11.230
No, topological problems there.

00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:12.780
This one?

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:13.540
Yes.

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:16.740
So it's got three equal
length flaps separated off

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:20.850
by a large 2x river, I guess.

00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:21.460
And this one?

00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:26.210
No, for the same reason here.

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:30.080
And here we can actually
see three different packings

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:37.020
of a very similar,
if not same, tree.

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:39.770
And this goes to
show you that there

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:41.880
could be many
different ways we could

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.770
put these disks on a sheet of
paper that could either improve

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:48.490
efficiency or be more useful.

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:52.950
For example, this packing
has a central flap.

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:55.820
We may or may not want
that central flap.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:55:00.300
You can see that a central
flap will use more paper

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:05.020
than a flap at the corner
or the edge of the paper,

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:09.060
because it has 360
degrees of paper

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:11.920
that you have to fold
as opposed to 180

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:16.430
or even just 90
degrees of paper.

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:18.430
So typically in
origami design, if you

00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:22.110
have a flap you need a little
bit of bulk in, a little more

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:24.010
paper, you might
want to consider

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:25.960
making that a central flap.

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:29.890
If you want to make a very thin,
maybe an antenna or something,

00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:32.510
a corner flap might
be a better choice.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.680
So correct, in that sense.

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.890
Now again, I want
to stress the fact

00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:42.630
that this is an idealization.

00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:43.860
These are circles.

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:51.076
They don't really account for
all the paper in the square.

00:55:51.076 --> 00:55:53.960
This paper between the
circles and the rivers

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.760
is not really used.

00:55:55.760 --> 00:56:01.030
Pretty much everything in
this no man's land here

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:06.940
actually maps to a single
point in the tree right.

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:11.210
This is a bad example, so
I'll use this correspondence.

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:13.940
This kind of looks like a
bikini or something like that.

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:16.960
That's neither here nor there.

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:23.290
But this space all maps to
one of these branch nodes.

00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:24.640
Everyone see that?

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:31.680
Because in the situation where
we thin this model infinitely,

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.230
this is kind of extra
space that we kind of just

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:36.090
don't even deal with.

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:39.020
In reality, that
extra space will

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:43.450
have to go into either
the rivers or the circles

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:44.560
in the packing.

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:50.230
So the reason why uniaxial
bases are nice in this model

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:56.720
is because since all they hinge
creases of the model, basically

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:59.260
the boundary of the
flap with the model,

00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:10.530
hinge 90 degrees to some
axis, then its projection maps

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:11.780
to a single point.

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:15.840
So if we cut off all the
flaps along the hinge creases,

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:19.695
we should actually get
a very similar mapping

00:57:19.695 --> 00:57:20.570
to what we have here.

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:26.370
And here's an example of
a fairly complex model.

00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:29.790
But you can see, I've
just highlighted the locus

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:33.370
of possible hinge
creases on this model.

00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:35.320
There's a unique way to do this.

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.410
I won't go into it.

00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:40.780
But there is a unique way
to add these hinge creases.

00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:45.030
But as you can see, the
idea is very similar.

00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:48.860
But instead of having these
curves of constant width,

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:52.550
you have these discrete angular
curves of constant width.

00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:57.330
So for example here, you have
a river of constant width

00:57:57.330 --> 00:58:01.080
that changes directions
at a discrete corner,

00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:03.710
but it's still a strip
of constant width.

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:05.250
Everyone see that?

00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:09.239
So maybe we could
go ahead and see--

00:58:09.239 --> 00:58:11.030
If we had this crease
pattern and we didn't

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:13.230
know what the model
was, we could actually

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:17.430
pick off the tree and figure
out what this model is.

00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:23.660
So maybe we start with
these two points down here.

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:25.970
They're all points separated
off the rest of the model

00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:27.600
by a certain distance.

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:35.630
And that distance here, all
these lines that are connected

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:39.850
must be at the same location,
the same node on the tree,

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:43.110
because all those hinge creases
must map to a single point.

00:58:43.110 --> 00:58:48.320
So these two flaps
connect with each other

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:51.810
because they share this
set of hinge creases.

00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:54.000
And so that's that
point right there.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:59.290
I'm going to ignore these two
flaps at the bottom for now.

00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:01.980
We have this big long river.

00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:05.140
I'm just going to deal
with the big points first.

00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:07.690
And that connects to
two more big points.

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.350
Everyone see that?

00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:13.080
I don't want to go too fast.

00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:15.790
And actually, you can do that.

00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:19.260
You can just keep doing that,
and methodically picking off

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:22.120
distances on this hinge
crease representation,

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:26.230
this is discrete
space allocation

00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:28.865
and fill in the whole tree.

00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:35.960
Anyone can think of
what this might be?

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:41.910
Maybe a four-legged animal with
antlers, like maybe a moose.

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:45.020
So this is a model
I designed, I think,

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:47.732
my freshman year
as an undergrad.

00:59:47.732 --> 00:59:49.232
AUDIENCE: What
happens when you have

00:59:49.232 --> 00:59:50.930
the squares inside the squares?

00:59:58.545 --> 01:00:00.170
JASON KU: That's an
excellent question.

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:02.320
First, I want to answer
one other question

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.660
before I get to that one.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:12.610
Here, these polygons,
these squares,

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:16.480
you could think of maybe
putting a circle in them.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:21.440
And the square is taking up
more paper than the circle,

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.490
and so the flap
that this represents

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:28.200
would be the largest circle
that would be fully contained

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.880
in that square.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.680
And that would be the
length of that flap.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:35.110
What does it mean to have
instead of this point separated

01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:38.000
off from the rest of the model
have a line separated off

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.670
from the rest of the model?

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:46.440
Can anyone guess
why would you want

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:49.710
that as an origami designer?

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:51.730
Well, you might
want that property

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:56.210
if you want not just
a point separated

01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:58.070
off from the rest of
the model, but a line.

01:00:58.070 --> 01:00:59.800
You might want thickness.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.410
It's a qualification
of thickness

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:07.480
of that flap at the extreme
distance away from the model.

01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:13.510
And I don't have
this example with me.

01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:16.660
I talked about it yesterday
at the OrigaMIT lecture.

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:20.360
But let's say you wanted
to model a butterfly wing.

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:25.420
It's not well
characterized by a stick.

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:28.430
Its thickness is
kind of important.

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:31.530
So how I designed
a butterfly wing

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:34.230
is I separated a line
off from the rest

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:38.900
of the model, something
similar to this,

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:41.600
so that I would have enough
paper to kind of spread out

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.740
that idealized single point.

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:49.880
I could spread the end of that
point to have some thickness

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.990
and to make a full
butterfly wing.

01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:56.080
And what you're
saying is what does it

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.170
mean to have these points,
these single leaf edges,

01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:02.720
separated off kind of
surrounded by river?

01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:06.460
You see what that means?

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.240
Yep, this is just a river.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.510
Rivers, again, don't have to
go all the way across a model.

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:14.180
They can also connect.

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.860
You're separating
these two points off

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:20.630
from the rest of the model by
a certain constant distance.

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:21.970
So excellent question.

01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:32.580
And as I promised before, I
want to take look a little bit

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:36.380
about the structure
of this model.

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:38.850
It looks very symmetric, right?

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:41.960
And you'd think that maybe
it would be well represented

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:45.590
by a rectangle of paper
instead of a square.

01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:48.010
How do you fit
this into a square

01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:49.335
by still having this detail?

01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:54.930
How do you think this
texture was made?

01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.490
Anybody?

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:06.424
It's kind of just pleating
the paper back and forth.

01:03:06.424 --> 01:03:09.240
If you've ever taken
a sheet of paper

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.080
and pleated it to
form a texture,

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.550
kind of a
one-dimensional problem,

01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:16.130
but you're pleating it.

01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:17.805
But after you pleat
it, it's smaller.

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:24.956
If we take a look at the
crease pattern here--

01:03:24.956 --> 01:03:26.330
This is actually
a crease pattern

01:03:26.330 --> 01:03:30.910
to an earlier version
of this model.

01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:33.000
This is slightly
less detailed, if you

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.860
can imagine, than
this model right here.

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:42.770
What do you think this is?

01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:45.560
Maybe the scales, right?

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.070
This is the head region.

01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:52.540
We can actually do
a rough version,

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:55.370
perform a rough version of
this kind of hinge crease

01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:58.500
representation, and get
an idea for the structure

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.270
of this model.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:04.710
So here, we see the tail.

01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:06.030
I'll talk about this later.

01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:08.972
We have the two back
feet separated off

01:04:08.972 --> 01:04:10.680
from the rest of the
model by a distance.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.040
That's this distance here.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.570
Two more feet.

01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:18.100
This is kind of the neck region.

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:20.400
And here's the head.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:20.900
OK.

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.580
So this looks kind of weird.

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:26.670
I haven't really been specific
about the details here.

01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:29.030
But what does that pleating do?

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:32.230
Well, it shrinks the
useful area of the paper,

01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:33.700
because I pleated it.

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.480
So that's why here the
length of this flap

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.660
is this distance here.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:39.980
That's the length of the tail.

01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:46.260
But when I make pleats,
this thing shrinks.

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:49.170
And it actually shrinks
to this distance.

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:54.340
This whole thing is cut in half.

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:58.080
So we make these
pleats, it shrinks,

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.830
and then it can lie
along this segment.

01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:09.180
Then this area here
also shrinks by half.

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:11.020
So the length is here.

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:16.270
And it is able to cover
this aspect, this part

01:05:16.270 --> 01:05:19.610
of this middle
river with texture.

01:05:23.584 --> 01:05:25.500
Please ask questions,
because this is complex.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.708
AUDIENCE: [? What's the ?]
distance between the front

01:05:27.708 --> 01:05:28.447
and back legs?

01:05:28.447 --> 01:05:29.030
JASON KU: Yes.

01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:31.709
So this is the distance between
the front and back legs.

01:05:31.709 --> 01:05:33.250
But we have to cover
it with texture.

01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:34.810
There's no texture here.

01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:38.980
So what we do is create
this extra flap here

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:46.440
where the back legs are with
a length of half of this,

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.840
and cover it with texture.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.850
So that's what he's done here.

01:05:50.850 --> 01:05:54.760
And so the same goes for here.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:59.150
It's not quite half down
here, but this covers up

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:00.876
the rest of that section.

01:06:00.876 --> 01:06:02.250
And there's actually
some overlap

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:04.610
so that they can mesh correctly.

01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:09.020
Then here, we have enough paper
to provide texture to the neck

01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:10.760
region, and then
there's the head.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:14.880
It's kind of an ingenious way
of actually the top and bottom,

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.780
this top texture and
this bottom texture,

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:21.760
folding up onto this line
segment which represents

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:26.100
the length of the
dragon, and still

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:30.750
having space for
these toes and feet.

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:35.850
It's an ingenious way
to distribute the paper,

01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:36.930
in this case.

01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:39.090
Here we can understand
another reason

01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:41.940
why we might want to
separate a line off

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:45.570
from the rest of the model,
because then that line has

01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:47.750
some thickness, you have
a certain amount of space

01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:49.730
out there, and you
can actually then

01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:53.510
create more points
from that line being

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.520
out at a certain distance.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:59.220
We can create a number of little
points, which are then toes.

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:06.600
So I thought that
was pretty cool.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.300
One of my favorite
examples of structure.

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:15.450
JASON KU: These were
all drawn by hand

01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:18.335
using a program very similar
to Adobe Illustrator.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.490
So yeah, it's very tedious, and
lots of copying and pasting.

01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:28.890
But you should see the
more complicated version

01:07:28.890 --> 01:07:31.070
of this pattern.

01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:35.290
Because as you can see
on this model here,

01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:40.720
there are actually scales
on the feet part itself.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:47.990
These claws actually are longer
in proportion to everything

01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:49.450
else in the model.

01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:51.190
So we actually add
some more things.

01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:54.380
There's also a
strip of paper here

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:55.730
that has spines on the back.

01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:59.790
This crease pattern doesn't
represent those things.

01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:03.369
So this is a simplified
version, if you will.

01:08:03.369 --> 01:08:05.452
AUDIENCE: What was the
starting size of the paper?

01:08:05.452 --> 01:08:08.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah, how big is it?

01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:11.030
JASON KU: It's actually
an amazingly efficient use

01:08:11.030 --> 01:08:12.770
of paper.

01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:15.600
The length of the
dragon is pretty much

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:19.210
this length right
here, which is actually

01:08:19.210 --> 01:08:21.650
quite impressive for the
amount of detail there is.

01:08:24.819 --> 01:08:26.290
The shrinkage
factor is something

01:08:26.290 --> 01:08:28.510
like to the length
of the squared

01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:31.454
to the length of the
dragon is not even a half.

01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:38.990
The overall structure of this
model is actually quite simple.

01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:47.420
The model itself is
maybe about this big.

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:50.109
So I'm guessing the
size of the square

01:08:50.109 --> 01:08:53.229
was something like a meter,
if not a little larger.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:09:00.220
It's a long time to work
with a single sheet of paper.

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:00.720
All right.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.240
So we're going to very quickly,
maybe for the next 10, 15

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.270
minutes, go through a
design example of a crab.

01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:12.990
And so we're going to kind
of go through it quickly.

01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:15.020
To help you do your
homework, I just

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:19.370
want to let you know about
some details of TreeMaker that

01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:21.720
might be useful to
you to be able to make

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.380
a cleaner or nicer
crease pattern.

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:30.319
So to go to a TreeMaker example,
I'm going to open up TreeMaker.

01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:42.664
I need to bring
TreeMaker over here.

01:09:45.450 --> 01:09:46.790
So we have TreeMaker.

01:09:49.969 --> 01:09:51.510
And let's say we
want to make a crab.

01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:54.979
So how do you want
to draw this tree?

01:09:54.979 --> 01:09:57.020
Maybe I'll just draw the
tree that we had before.

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:08.870
First we have four legs
all of equal length.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:16.230
We could have them all
coming from the same spot.

01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:39.670
But traditionally, if we
take a look at a crab--

01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:43.840
That's a cartoony
version of a crab,

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.580
but we see that these maybe
our axis of our model is here.

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:55.570
These legs actually don't
need to split at the axis.

01:10:55.570 --> 01:10:59.830
We could actually model
this as in the tree,

01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:05.150
maybe we have our body
segment, and maybe we

01:11:05.150 --> 01:11:10.260
separate these four
flaps off from the axis

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:13.120
by a certain distance so that
we actually can save paper.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.810
We don't have to make each
one of these flaps this long.

01:11:16.810 --> 01:11:18.050
You see?

01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:21.420
So I'm going to add a
little line segment there.

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:27.510
Repeat on the other side.

01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:28.265
You get the idea.

01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:34.050
Then maybe you
have some modeling

01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:36.770
of the thickness of the model.

01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:38.640
Then we have claws.

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:46.800
One nice thing about this is
we could view just the tree.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.690
That might make things
a little easier.

01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:50.440
There's lots of these
view characteristics

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.180
that we're going to
take advantage of.

01:11:55.570 --> 01:11:59.540
And maybe we want to
represent the eyes.

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:07.640
Now, the lengths of these
edges in the program

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:10.670
don't really mean anything.

01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:12.990
So take that into note first.

01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:15.450
You actually I've to
click on each edge

01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:18.760
and specify its length
relative to all the others.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.570
So maybe we want
to make the claws

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:30.820
half as long as the
branch connecting them.

01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:37.170
Bear with me.

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:42.580
There's no good way of
automating this process

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:43.900
at this point.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:45.510
And maybe we make
the eyes-- they're

01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:47.930
pretty short-- so
we maybe make them

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:49.785
a quarter of the
length of those.

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:58.000
The body segment, I don't know.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.150
Also a quarter.

01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:01.810
This is really
kind of arbitrary,

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:05.320
but you can play around
with these dimensions.

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.640
And these guys, also a quarter.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.230
And the back legs
can also be one.

01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:14.630
Something like that.

01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:15.660
All right.

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:23.410
When we've got that, we see that
we actually have circles there.

01:13:23.410 --> 01:13:25.260
Now, these circles
are kind of crossing.

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:29.030
We don't want
that, because paper

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:31.430
can't go to two points at once.

01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:33.260
What we can do now
is scale everything.

01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:40.410
So it tries to pack
all the circles such

01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:45.250
that none of the conditions
are being violated.

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:50.210
So this is a valid packing,
except these points

01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:54.580
in the middle here, this
whole polygon is constrained.

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:57.750
The green line segments
here are active paths.

01:13:57.750 --> 01:14:04.250
Basically, the distance between
these points on the tree

01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:06.440
and these points on the
paper are minimized,

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.140
or they're equal.

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.670
So there must be a crease there.

01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:15.500
That is a key statement
of uniaxial bases,

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:18.310
is that there must be a
crease along active paths.

01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:22.750
Now, these two points can
actually stand to get larger.

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:31.370
That's evident to the fact
that we can move these around

01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:33.180
and it's not violating
any conditions.

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:35.770
Well, if I move it over here,
it's violating a condition.

01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:37.470
Whenever a condition
is violated then

01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:40.610
you have these red
lines that yell at you.

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:44.980
But we can move this
around in this area

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.700
without violating
any conditions.

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:49.400
So it's not happy.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:53.110
It's not completely crystallized
or well-constrained,

01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:54.660
so it's going to
yell at us when we

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:59.020
try to build the crease pattern.

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:02.500
TreeMaker was not able
to construct all polygons

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:06.230
because a polygon was either
non-convex or contained

01:15:06.230 --> 01:15:07.890
one or more nodes
in its interiors.

01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:09.789
So these have nodes
in its interior,

01:15:09.789 --> 01:15:11.455
so was not able to
fill in this polygon.

01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:16.750
What we can do about
that is we don't

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:20.120
mind if these points
get a little bigger.

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.000
Or we could add an extra point.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.830
So we never modeled
a body segment here.

01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:27.750
So maybe we just add
in a body segment.

01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:32.230
So scale everything here.

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:36.430
We still have this problem.

01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:39.390
This guy is unconstrained.

01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:42.730
So what I'm going to do is
make this guy a little bigger

01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:45.020
by selecting the
node and the edge.

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:47.980
You have to do both.

01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:50.540
I can go here and scale
just this selection.

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:53.320
And it'll increase it by itself.

01:15:57.030 --> 01:16:01.750
Actually, nicely, this is
somewhat of a symmetric crease

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:03.770
pattern, which
didn't occur before.

01:16:12.650 --> 01:16:15.230
So you see these lighter
edges of the tree

01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:17.300
are fully constrained edges.

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.680
These darker ones are not
fully constrained edges.

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.780
So this guy can actually
also increase a little bit.

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:27.340
So I'm going to scale selection.

01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:29.190
Now everything should be good.

01:16:29.190 --> 01:16:31.260
I can build the crease pattern.

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:33.050
Guh!

01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:36.980
It built it, so whatever.

01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:39.540
So this is a foldable
crease pattern

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:42.280
that will form
what we want it to.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:46.760
We can also go to
this creases view,

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:50.370
and it will show the
creases of the model.

01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:52.980
It was not able to find
valid mountain-valleys.

01:16:58.730 --> 01:16:59.910
Anyway.

01:16:59.910 --> 01:17:02.310
So to make this
cleaner, you might

01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:05.210
want to deal with symmetry.

01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:11.090
So there's an ability to
select diagonal symmetry

01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:18.230
and either add conditions
to make a node fixed

01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:21.610
to the symmetry line, so
add additional constraints

01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:23.650
to our system to
make it cleaner.

01:17:23.650 --> 01:17:25.980
We can fix them to
the symmetry line.

01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:28.250
We can fix it to the
corner or the paper edge,

01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:30.060
fix to any arbitrary position.

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:31.810
Or we can select two
nodes and pair them

01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:35.760
about the symmetry line, which
is a very useful thing to do.

01:17:46.882 --> 01:17:48.590
I don't know if it
will yell at me again.

01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:51.850
Yeah, it didn't do anything.

01:17:51.850 --> 01:17:54.290
What I'm going to
do is go in here.

01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:56.330
There's lots of things
you could do here.

01:17:56.330 --> 01:18:01.990
We could perturb all
the nodes, so they

01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:04.280
move if by a slight distance.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.850
And maybe if we try
scaling it again,

01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:08.255
it'll find a valid solution.

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:25.440
This was unfortunate.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.490
Scale everything.

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.570
Kill the strain on this.

01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:53.052
Yes?

01:18:53.052 --> 01:18:54.010
AUDIENCE: I'm confused.

01:18:54.010 --> 01:18:56.010
Is it failing
because the problem

01:18:56.010 --> 01:18:59.550
is over-constrained
or under-constrained?

01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:01.730
JASON KU: It's not
failing because of either.

01:19:01.730 --> 01:19:07.340
It's failing because
certain creases

01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:08.780
get very close together.

01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:10.380
Now it's failing
because it can't

01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:14.362
find a correct
valley-mountain assignment

01:19:14.362 --> 01:19:15.320
for the crease pattern.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:19.040
So it's able to build
the creases fine.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:24.170
So build crease pattern, fine.

01:19:24.170 --> 01:19:27.120
It just wasn't able to construct
a mountain-valley assignment,

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.190
which in the creases view
would usually give you

01:19:29.190 --> 01:19:30.523
mountain and valley assignments.

01:19:30.523 --> 01:19:32.850
AUDIENCE: That means
it's not possible?

01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:34.142
JASON KU: It couldn't find it.

01:19:34.142 --> 01:19:35.475
It's not that it's not possible.

01:19:35.475 --> 01:19:38.830
It just couldn't find it.

01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:40.290
I want to say one other thing.

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:47.650
Kill the crease pattern.

01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:52.070
We have a polygon bounded
by active paths that's

01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:54.060
not triangular.

01:19:54.060 --> 01:20:00.682
But we can actually split it
any of these up into triangles.

01:20:00.682 --> 01:20:02.640
I'm just going to mention
that you can do this.

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:05.820
You click on one
of these polygons,

01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:09.350
go here, stub, triangulate tree.

01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:12.550
It adds random points.

01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:15.084
And now all the
polygons are triangles,

01:20:15.084 --> 01:20:16.375
and that's much easier to fold.

01:20:19.090 --> 01:20:21.136
Or not.

01:20:21.136 --> 01:20:22.260
That's how you would do it.

01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:25.510
Anyway, I'm running
out of time, so I'm

01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:27.290
going to go back to
the presentation.

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:29.890
But if you need any
help with these,

01:20:29.890 --> 01:20:35.290
or the tutorial with
this program, I'm around.

01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:39.990
You can contact me through
the OrigaMIT website,

01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:44.720
or you can come to it an
OrigaMIT workshop on Sunday

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:47.900
and ask me questions then.

01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:53.125
So I'm going to quickly just go
right back to the presentation.

01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:59.330
Play slide show.

01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.830
Nope.

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.606
Technical difficulties.

01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:21.440
Play slide show.

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:25.880
So that was the
example of TreeMaker.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:29.180
Here's an example of a
non-TreeMaker example

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:32.540
that I designed this
weekend of a crab.

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:37.210
I actually designed
this model it

01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:39.550
after I had drawn this picture.

01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:44.820
And I wanted to incorporate some
of the elements of this picture

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:46.140
into my design process.

01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:49.190
So one of the first
I actually started

01:21:49.190 --> 01:21:50.740
was designing the
back so that it

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:52.200
would have this
kind of structure

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:59.410
with this polygon there, kind of
a Komatsu-like design process,

01:21:59.410 --> 01:22:04.626
and trying to make the
final form polygons

01:22:04.626 --> 01:22:06.500
and incorporate those
into my crease pattern.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:10.320
So that's what this
area is right here.

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:18.930
It has a very similar structure
to the tree we drew already.

01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:22.810
We have the four points for
the legs, the body segment.

01:22:22.810 --> 01:22:26.030
These are going to be the eyes.

01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:27.940
And so there are some
extra points just

01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:31.210
to make things easier to fold.

01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:32.340
The claws.

01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:33.340
Here's the body segment.

01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:37.270
There's these extra two
things on either side.

01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:39.650
And I made those
so that there could

01:22:39.650 --> 01:22:43.420
be an underbelly to
the crab, and that I

01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:46.150
could add some texture
in and things like that.

01:22:46.150 --> 01:22:49.400
But you can see some
of the constraints

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:52.980
that I've put on it are that
I want this to be 22.5 degree

01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:56.930
folding, which is hard to
implement in TreeMaker.

01:22:56.930 --> 01:23:00.880
I've also shown
some of the thinning

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:05.740
to make these points
thinner on the right.

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:08.290
So if we actually
pick out the tree

01:23:08.290 --> 01:23:12.270
for this hinge
representation, we

01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:14.090
get something that kind
of looks like this.

01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:15.910
So we have our legs.

01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:16.910
Here's our body segment.

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:21.650
Here are the flaps that I make
into the underbelly, eyes,

01:23:21.650 --> 01:23:23.580
and the claws.

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:26.269
And here's the folded
proof of concept version

01:23:26.269 --> 01:23:27.310
that I folded last night.

01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:29.140
It's actually a
really crappy picture.

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:29.990
I apologize.

01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:32.580
But it's up here.

01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:36.590
I fold it like 10:00 last
night, because I thought

01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:39.460
it would be useful for you guys
to see what a folded one might

01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:40.450
look like.

01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:45.090
But it actually turns out
to be somewhat non-uniaxial.

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:50.660
And you can see some of the
texturing on the underbelly,

01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:53.460
if you take a look at
it and come up here.

01:23:57.390 --> 01:24:02.280
So that's kind of describing
some of the design

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:08.880
process of a real work that uses
the concepts of uniaxial bases,

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.870
that I can make this hinge
crease representation,

01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:15.500
but then use some
shaping to modify it.

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:18.780
If you're interested in
learning about anything related

01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:22.400
to origami, there's an
excellent online forum

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:26.700
that you can ask questions
or show off work that you do

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:28.230
or anything like that.

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:33.175
And if you want to do
something slightly more local--

01:24:33.175 --> 01:24:34.960
this is shameless
self-promotion--

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:39.850
but the origami club at MIT
welcomes you with open arms.

01:24:39.850 --> 01:24:41.930
We meet every Sunday
in the Student Center

01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:42.950
from 2:00 to 4:00 PM.

01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:46.340
You can find all sorts of
details on our website.

01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:48.790
So that's about it.

01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:51.449
AUDIENCE: Are those
origami letters?

01:24:51.449 --> 01:24:52.490
JASON KU: Those are, yes.

01:24:55.450 --> 01:24:59.780
Each one of these
letters was a model.

01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:06.320
They're all the same model I
designed, in which you have a 3

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:10.180
by 4 grid of flippable
squares of color change

01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:14.620
that you can flip to either
be in the all white state

01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:18.330
or all black state.

01:25:18.330 --> 01:25:24.220
And you could also do some
of these half pixeling.

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:29.760
But you can basically make
any of these letters--

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:32.990
I have a whole alphabet of
things-- from a single model.

01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:34.000
I was lazy.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.170
I didn't want to
design 26 models.

01:25:36.170 --> 01:25:37.640
I just want to design one model.

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:41.610
So that that's what those are.

01:25:41.610 --> 01:25:43.370
So that concludes the lecture.

01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:45.980
We're just about at time.
