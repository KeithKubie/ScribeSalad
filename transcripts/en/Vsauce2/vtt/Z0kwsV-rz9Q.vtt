00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.359
Researchers at Cornell decided to figure out
some practical uses for an extra robotic arm.

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.769
They discovered it’s more useful for professional
and work settings where it’s helpful to

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:18.270
hold multiple things at once rather than recreational
uses like an extra arm for rock climbing.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.340
Although that would be cool.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.860
And also at Guy Hoffman’s Lab, Blossom is
a social home robot made out of soft, handcrafted

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.540
materials like yarn and wood instead of the
usual plastic, glass and metal.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.610
Honestly, I just wanted to show you this because
it's the first companion robot I’ve wanted

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.610
to hug.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.610
Vsauce!

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.610
Kevin here.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.180
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.790
Ohio State researchers have a one-touch organ-healing
device.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.610
The Tissue Nanotransfection technology allows
doctors to generate any cell type within a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.239
patient’s body to repair injured tissue
or restore organs, blood vessels and nerve

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.239
cells.

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.930
By placing the chip on the body and applying
electrical current, the non-invasive reprogramming

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.360
turns skin cells into whatever cells doctors
need.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.360
It injects DNA into the skin cells and it
worked on a mouse to restore blood flow to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.790
a damaged leg in the three weeks.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.670
And they’re beginning human clinical trials
in 2018.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.600
We may have discovered the building blocks
for quantum internet.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.850
Researchers at The Australian National University
used an ion called erbium in a crystal to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.260
store quantum information for over a second.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.920
10,000 times longer than previous experiments.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.960
It also works with existing fibre optic networks
and can connect to different quantum computers.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.659
And one great advantage of developing the
quantum internet is security - it would allow

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.960
for information to be destroyed if intercepted.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.380
There is a pen that can detect cancer in real
time.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.920
The MasSpec Pen, developed at the University
of Texas at Austin, works by delivering a

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.820
water droplet to a tissue surface which extracts
biomolecules which are then delivered to a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.770
mass spectrometer for molecular analysis.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.120
The system then tells surgeons whether the
tissue is cancerous or not in seconds, allowing

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.690
for safer and more effective cancer-removal
surgery.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.520
The first winged mammals evolved 100 million
years earlier than the first modern mammal

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.520
fliers.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.740
Two 160 million year old, Jurassic period
fossils, were uncovered in China and a collaboration

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.830
between The University Of Chicago and Beijing
Museum of Natural History resulted in these

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.700
awesome reconstructions.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.790
And this discovery shows the ecological diversity
of early mammals, suggesting dinosaurs were

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.340
not quite as dominant as previously thought.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.550
Neurable created the first brain-controlled
virtual reality game.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.310
The brain-computer interface company
interprets brain activity using an EEG to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.819
measure electric activity and software to
translate it into action.

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.560
Their device uses seven electrodes that measure
signals responding to stimuli so that you

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.890
can play their game Awakenings without controllers.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.879
You literally just use your brain.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.370
The plan is to make this available in VR arcades
next year.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.820
Meanwhile in Japan, rural elderly folks are
getting around in autonomous robot buses.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.550
They’ve begun experimenting with driverless
buses to shuttle the elderly to medical and

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.490
shopping services in rural areas without enough
workers to drive taxis or buses.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.110
Right now the robot shuttle tops out at 6
mph (10 kph) so hopefully as the develop the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.620
technology they can improve the travel time
before their projected launch in 2020.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.480
Nanobiotics are a new class of antibiotics.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.709
Engineers from Michigan University can create
nanoparticles 1/100th the size of a germ of

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.190
different shapes to control what they do.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.800
So by using these to coat medical devices
they bind to the proteins to prevent molecules

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.690
from changing - thereby creating bacteria
resistance.Which could be a huge advance in

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.920
the fight against antibiotic resistance.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.840
Scientists at The University Of Texas at Dallas
have developed electricity-generating yarn.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.260
The carbon nanotube twistron yarn generates
electricity when stretched and one of the

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.229
future uses of this technology could be harvesting
energy from ocean waves.

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.779
Finally, SMART self-driving wheelchairs are
continuing their development with hospitals

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:26.090
trials in Singapore.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.039
The technology will give people much more
flexibility and much richer personal mobility.

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.629
And at the same time it will make it better
for doctors and the nurses who focus on patient

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:45.729
care and will be less worried about whether
they have the right object or the right people

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:46.979
in the right place.

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:53.249
Over the years, Mind Blow has focused on breakthrough
ideas, discoveries and science to push us

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.050
all forward.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.590
The world has been on an incredible path of
progress – in our lifetimes we've witnessed

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.770
the biggest decrease in poverty, disease and
child deaths.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.050
But progress is not inevitable.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.529
So the Gates Foundation is creating the Goalkeepers
report, which they hope will inspire a new

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:19.479
generation of leaders – Goalkeepers who
raise awareness of progress, hold their leaders

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.819
accountable and drive action to accelerate
progress.

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:30.050
Education is an area where the world doesn’t
have enough data to understand progress.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.860
It’s relatively easy to count the number
of children in school, but that doesn’t

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.919
tell us how much those children are actually
learning.

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:45.789
Many countries don’t generate any useful
learning data at all, let alone in a comparable

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:46.789
way.

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:55.020
We need to know early whether children are
able to read, a pre-requisite to all learning.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.460

in ensuring quality education to transform

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.610
Now I’m gonna leave you with two walking
robots taking a stroll through the Agility

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:22.949
Robitics office - and as always thanks for
watching.

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:37.849
The art of bookmaking is older than printing
by many centuries.

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:44.620
Yet, today's members of the brotherhood of
book binders, artists of the AF of L CIO are

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:51.120
able to supply man for the most important
ingredient of the modern world -- literacy.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.199
Following a craft as ancient as cave drawings,
these union workers of the book industry are

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.699
second to none in keeping pace with progress.

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:06.319
The ingenuity which has passed on to the folders,
gatherers, sewers, trimmers, liners and case

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:13.830
makers, in a proud profession is constantly
at work for you to produce our greatest treasure,

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.500
knowledge.
