00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.270
&gt;&gt; My name is Rosemary O'Neil,
and I am with the Women's Office

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.440
at the Department of State.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.470
I've been handling women in
Afghanistan, our policy with regard

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.200
to women in Afghanistan, and one
of the great personal pleasures

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.700 position:56%
that has come to me out of the
tragic situation that has transpired

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.930 position:56%
in Afghanistan in the last 23 years
is meeting some absolutely wonderful

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.100
women from Afghanistan.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.270
Their courage is truly
remarkable, and the challenges

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.310
that they have had to meet
and address and the fact

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.200
that they are now beginning to
have a voice in the rebuilding

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.380
of their country is
very, very exciting.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.600 position:56%
So we're going to meet some of those
women today and hear from them.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.310
Sinzel Nawib [assumed spelling]
will be speaking first.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.760
She has taught at New York
University, University of Arizona

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.300
and the University of Michigan.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.160 position:56%
She received a B.A. in history from
Kabul University, an M.A. in history

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.680
from the University of Denver, and
a Ph.D. in middle eastern studies

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.230
from the University of Arizona.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:51.300
She has written extensively and
lectured on women in Afghanistan.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.880
She's going to talk to us about
Afghan women under Marxism,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.070
lessons for today, and
I think they say those

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.100
who do not study history
are doomed to relive it.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.810
So very keen to listen to the
implications of what happened

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:21.990
in the last 20 years to
women in Afghanistan.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.290
Sinzel?

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.350
&gt;&gt; Well, as Rosemary O'Neil
said, I'm talking about history.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.990
I'm going to take you back
into history of Afghanistan

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.320
in the 20th century because I think
without understanding that part

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.990
of the history, it will be very
difficult to understand what went

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.490
on later, and particularly
the period that I'm focusing

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.050
on is the period that precedes
immediately before the Mujahideen

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.450
take over and the Taliban,
which was the period

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.320
of the Marxist rule in Afghanistan.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.310
It would be very difficult
to condense the history

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.230
of several decades in 15
minutes, but I'll try my best.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.230
I'll go very quickly
over everything.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.080
We know relatively little about
how ordinary Afghans experienced

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.050
opportunities and challenges
of the Marxist era, 1978,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.070
1992 of Afghan history
and virtually nothing

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.340
about what the period
meant to Afghan women.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.860 position:56%
Today history has swept aside the
socialist experiment with assessment

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.270
of its achievement tending
toward the negative.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.800
It was in this 14 year period
wrote Fred Holiday that the society

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.420
and politics of the country were
brutally transformed from above

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.840
and below, leading to
the chaos of the 1990's

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.610
and which another radical
authoritarian faction,

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.000
the Taliban, came to power.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.200 position:56%
This paper will examine the politics

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.260 position:56%
of the Soviet backed Afghan
Marxist regime with regards to women

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.390
and the consequences of the
Marxist policies for women

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.880 position:56%
in Afghanistan and subsequent years.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.370
Now let me tell you that this
is part of an ongoing research.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.240
What I'm telling you today
is a part of my research.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.910
It is based on many
interviews with men and women

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:39.210
who lived during the Marxist era
and also on government publications

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.260
and official documents
of the period.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.890
In order to understand this period,

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.730
I have to give you
background of what happened.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.910
What was the condition of
women before the Marxist?

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.510 position:56%
Initial efforts to improve the
status of women in Afghanistan began

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.470
in the 1920's with King Amanullah.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.160
Reforms initiated by King
Amanullah included the extension

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.400
of public education to girls, far
reaching changes to family law

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.860
and the unveiling of women.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.010
I must tell you that
the emancipation woman

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.400
in Afghanistan during the
1920's was probably one

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:28.730
of the most revolutionary advanced
women emancipation movements

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.120
in the Middle East.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.500
Especially the family law
of the period was so --

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.010
was considered to be so advanced

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.030
that the [inaudible]
Afghan family law to --

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:50.740
as a model for reforms
in Soviet Central Asia.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.050
Ultimately, Amanullah's attempt to
improve the status of women was one

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.020
of the major causes of the
widespread clergy-backed revolts

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:07.100
that eventually led to his
abdication in January of 1929.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.940
With the departure of King
Amanullah, women were again veiled

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:18.300
and the pace of change benefiting
women slowed down drastically.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.090
From the early 1930's
through the 1950's,

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.880
the government undertook
a slow expansion

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.130
of girl schools in urban centers.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.800 position:56%
In 1958, the government adopted a
new cautious program to unveil women

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.740
and encourage entry into the
workplace and into public life.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.670
In 1964, a new constitution
granted women the franchise

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.730
in equal employment opportunities.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.660
By the 1970's, the status of women

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.540
and popular attitude toward
women changed in urban areas.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.980
It became acceptable for women
to seek higher education,

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:09.100
work outside the home and take part
[inaudible] life of the community,

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.270
although old patterns of
behavior were not uprooted.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.800
I want to emphasize on that.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.020
And disparities between
urban and rural life began

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.470
to grow during this period.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.730
Government policies with regard
to women provided opportunities

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:32.950
for education and paid work in
urban areas and prepared the ground

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.400
for popular acceptance of
women in the public arena.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:44.610
So when the pro Soviet [inaudible],
the people's democratic party

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:51.150
of Afghanistan which is abbreviated
as the PDPA was formed in 1965,

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.690
it was able to attract to its rank
a number of female high school

00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.140
and university students
in major Afghan cities.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:05.210
In 1965, the center committee
of the PDPA granted permission

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:11.800
for the formation of the democratic
organization of Afghan women,

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:18.390
which is called DOAW under the
direction of Dr. [inaudible].

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:24.430
When the People's Democratic
Party of Afghanistan,

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:32.200
the PDPA gained power in a coup
on April 27, 1978, it went further

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:40.690
than any previous regime in the
effort to liberate women by pushing

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:46.420
for radical changes in the
structure of Afghan society.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.740
To understand the politics,
the political dynamics

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.400
of the Marxist area with regard to
women in Afghanistan is necessary

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.400
to understand certain aspects
of Marxist [inaudible] theory

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.630
to which the leaders of the
People's Democratic Party

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.990
of Afghanistan adhere.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.300
Marxist [inaudible], feminists
theory as probably most

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.920
of you know connects
the oppression of women

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.000
with the broader issue
of class struggle.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.310
Double moral standards for
men and women according

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.010
to the Marxists originate
in class society [inaudible]

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:29.040
in the [inaudible] family system
that determines [inaudible]

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.200
and perpetuates the
suppression of women.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:39.080
Lenin went even further
by identifying imperialism

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:44.090
as the main enemy of the
oppressed including women.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:52.320
Leninist theorists then defined
women as the [inaudible] and argued

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.830
that women would be able to secure
full control over their lives

00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:02.800
and reshape their destinies
only as an integral force

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.550 position:56%
in the world's socialist revolution.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:10.470 position:56%
Guided by Marxist Leninist ideology,

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.060
the PDP [inaudible] linked
Afghanistan's backwardness

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.860 position:56%
to the structure of tribal feudalism

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.170
and promoted women's
emancipation liberation --

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:26.980
I mean, women's emancipation
movement as central tenants

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:32.020
in the fight against feudalism,
capitalism and western imperialism.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:39.960
In so doing, the regime, the
Marxist regime, pushed the issue

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:45.100
of women's emancipation to
radical extremes in Afghanistan.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.830
Similar to -- similar in content

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:56.350
to measures introduced during
the 1920's by King Amanullah,

00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:00.480
decree [inaudible] issued
in the October of 1978

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.880
by the revolutionary council
abolished forced marriages,

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.470
the exchange of women
in marriage for cash

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.290
and extravagant [inaudible].

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:16.070
It also limited the amount of
[inaudible] or bridal money

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:20.410
and set the age of
engagement in marriage at 16

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.820
for women and 18 for men.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:29.640
However, unlike King Amanullah,
the PDPA leaders were careful not

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:37.010
to tamper with provisions of
Islamic law relating to polygamy.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:42.010
The divorce law was not officially
announced, but the introduction

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:48.030
of family courts presided over by
women judges provided a hearing

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:53.550 position:56%
for discontented wives and protected
their rights to divorce, alimony,

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.370
child custody and child support.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:01.030
Along with the promotion of
[inaudible] number seven,

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.430
the regime launched an
aggressive literacy campaign

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:13.420
to strengthen its base
of support among women.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.620
Female party members were
encouraged to fight along with men

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:23.370
to counter feudalism and
the negative influences

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.070
of western imperialism
in Afghanistan.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:34.980
In 1984, the DOAW maintained that
the organization has succeeded

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:44.110
in uniting approximately 30,000
women and 669 primary organizations

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:50.530
and had mobilized more than 80,000
rural women in social production.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:56.490
The campaign to engage women as
a revolutionary force for change

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:01.320
in Afghanistan, a traditional
Islamic society would entrench

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:07.770
tribal and patriarchal values was
found to ignite a strong reaction

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.170
from the forces of tradition.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:15.000
In fact, the campaign for women's
emancipation was the impetus

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.740
for the first [inaudible]
protest against the Marxist regime

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.460
in 1978-79 resulting in the deaths

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.140
of two women activists
in [inaudible].

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:33.200
Dramas depicting women in
futile bondage on television

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.810
and in a flag day parade in which
female students were dancing

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:45.300
and chanting Marxist slogans and
waving red flags infuriated many.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.640
Most of the female
students participating

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.870
in the parade were from Kandahar.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:56.510
As it turned out, many
Kandahar fathers who had pleaded

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.870
to get their daughters admitted

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:02.900
at Kabul University before the
[inaudible] revolution were deeply

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.890
offended by the participation

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.670
of their daughters on
the flag day parade.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:18.260
And as you know, Kandahar
is the home of the Taliban.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:24.310 position:56%
[Inaudible] for many Afghan Muslims,
women's liberation was associated

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.980
with [inaudible] and
the disastrous times

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:32.260
that had [inaudible] the country
were frequently attributed

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.280
to promiscuity associated

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:40.180
with emancipation of
women in Afghanistan.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.250
So women are always
blamed for everything.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.210
This is what happened.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.210
Civil war combined

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:53.060 position:56%
with Afghanistan's economic
backwardness created serious setback

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.940
to the Soviet inspired reforms.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.400
The issue of women's rights

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.730
and women's emancipation
was deemphasized

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.930
as counter revolutionary
forces gained strength.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:10.270
In 1978, a change in the leadership

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:13.850
of the PDPA brought
Dr. Najib Ila to power.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.100
Realizing the gravity
of the situation,

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.750
Najib proposed national
reconciliation

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:26.630
and discarded all Soviet inspired
policies including efforts

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.390
to politicize women in
support of Marxist revolution.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:35.200 position:56%
However, Najib's efforts to
[inaudible] extreme measures adopted

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.910
by the previous regime had little
effect in changing the attitude

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.090
of the opposition groups.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.910
The general reaction against
the feminist movement launched

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.230
by the Marxist was so strong

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:54.190
that many PDPA members including
Najib himself prevented their wives

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:59.650 position:56%
from participating in public
affairs in fear of terrorist attacks

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:02.980
against them by opposition groups.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:08.690
In a society not yet ready to see
women enjoy equal rights with men,

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:13.260
the PDPA's highly politicized
women's liberation movement

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.830
unleashed fundamentalist,
Islamic attitudes toward women

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.210
that were now hard to reverse.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:27.800
These extreme attitudes resulted in
the torture, rape and brutal murder

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:33.880 position:56%
in Kabul of many women alleged to
be atheist communists after the fall

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.640
of the Najib government in 1992.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.680
Resentment against women's
emancipation was articulated

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.390
in a religious [inaudible].

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:51.700
Signed by 16 members of
the judiciary council

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.970
of the Mujahideen takeover.

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.430
This is not the Taliban.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.990
And I want you to remember that
this happened before the Taliban

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.670
took over.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:04.300
The verdict reads in part.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:10.610 position:56%
The Muslim people of Afghanistan
launched a jihad fought for 14 years

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:14.060
and lost numerous lives in order

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:19.540
to re-establish divine
ordinances in the country.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:25.770
Now by the grace of the almighty,
our Islamic country is free

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.920
from the bondage of
the atheist rule.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:34.440
We strongly demand immediate
enforcement [inaudible].

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.200
We recommend that women
be banned from television,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:45.780
radio and government offices and
that all girl schools which are

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:56.360 position:56%
in reality the [inaudible] and
adulteress practices be closed down.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.350
This verdict was the signal for
the Taliban to exclude women

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:04.990
from public life and push
them back into the home.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:10.230
Some lessons may be drawn from
the experience of the Marxist era.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.190
The most important initiative of
the Marxist period with regard

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.060
to the status of women was
to make education available

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.560
to women of all ages and classes.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.370
The PDPA's literacy campaign

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:28.040
if successful would have improved
the position of women even

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.000
in the remote villages
of Afghanistan.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.510
The aspects of the literacy
campaign of the Marxist era

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:40.350
which were not offensive to Afghan
culture might serve as a model

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:45.320
for the expansion of education
for women in Afghanistan.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.010
Also, significant was the
regime's efforts to empower women

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:54.540
by teaching them organizational
skills and encouraging them

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.210
to be involved in Afghan politics

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:02.450
and become active members
of Afghan civil society.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.990
On the other hand,
however, the experience

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:11.150
of the Marxist people [inaudible]
illustrates the adverse effects

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.830
of combining women issues

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:19.730
with [inaudible] propaganda
rooted in un-Islamic ideology.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:24.660
The highly politicized women's
emancipation campaign based

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:31.010
on the ideology of class struggle
propelled women into the forefront

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:36.800
of the clash between ideological
radicalism of the Marxist

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:41.980
and the traditional Muslim
indigenous society ultimately

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.450
resulting in a serious setback

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:48.780
in the liberation of
women in Afghanistan.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.800
The Marxist experience in
Afghanistan has been characterized

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:58.150
as the failure of revolution
from above.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:02.020
It represents a case of
a weak state attempting

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:06.730
to enforce revolutionary
changes from the top,

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.950
and this has happened
twice in [inaudible].

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:17.470
Twice during the 20th century in
Afghan history, once in the 1920's

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:21.750
and then during the Marxist era
in the 1980's, the state attempted

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:25.740
to bring revolutionary
changes in the status of women.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:32.070
In both instances, the
mobilization of women was met

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.390
with strong opposition
by reactionary forces

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:39.310
and created a major backlash.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:45.810
The struggle for women's rights in
Afghanistan is an ongoing process.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:55.070
I believe strongly in the power
and the potentials of Afghan women.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:21:01.250
However, now that a window of hope
has opened to the Afghan women

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:06.500
to assert the proper place in
Afghan society, it's important

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:12.660
for the advocates of women's
rights to pay heed to the outcome

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.850
of the radical campaigns of
the 1920's and the 1980's.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.770
Two decades of war
resulted in the total demise

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:26.120
of the modernization efforts
of the earlier periods

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:31.500
and re-entrenched traditional
values with regard to women.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:40.270
It would seem prudent to
establish a set of priorities

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:49.220
and proceed incrementally
and also proceed with a plan

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:54.120
that have long term effects on the
status of women of Afghanistan.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.920
Thank you.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:04.040
[ Applause ]

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.340
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:11.020
Well, I'm going to be talking
about women's state and development

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.630 position:56%
in Afghanistan, although I think I
should also have called this women's

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.860
state, the international community
and development in Afghanistan.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.430
The country is, as you are aware,

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:23.500
currently owing a political
transition in the context

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.590
of poverty, under development

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.700
and infrastructural
devastation through war.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.120
The challenges of reconstruction
are quite daunting

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.970 position:56%
and uncertainty remains about the
nature of governance in Afghanistan.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:41.360
It's similarly unclear how women
will fare given the continuing

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.560
warfare and the lack of
clarity women and gender issues

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.530
on the part of leadership.

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:50.910 position:56%
There have been some positive
developments since the bond meetings

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.510
of last year but some areas
of concern [inaudible].

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:58.630
Now the type of state and
legal system that emerges

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:03.540 position:56%
from the present transitional period
will determine the extent and manner

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.970
in which women's interests

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:08.640
and women's needs are
addressed in the country.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.190
Conversely, how genders are
addressed will reveal much

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:17.220
about the nature of the
governance structures,

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.230 position:56%
the vision of the country's
leadership and the national identity

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:25.500
that is to be constructed
in post Taliban Afghanistan.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:31.370 position:56%
Because in Afghanistan as elsewhere,
the woman question has been tied

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:36.860
to competing concepts of national
identity and has been central

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:41.760
to battles between traditionalists
and modernizers through most

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.860
of modern Afghan history.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:49.670
We've heard from Dr. Sinzel
Nawib's brilliant exposition

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:53.620
about the difficulties of the
Marxist era, and I will touch upon

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:58.980
that very, very briefly because
in my work I have argued that in

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:03.750
at least three periods during
the 20th century, women's rights

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:09.360
in Afghanistan have been very
highly politicized but also central

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.250
to the political conflicts
in the country,

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:17.990
and the first period is the
1920's, which Dr. Nawib referred

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:22.270
to when efforts by reformers,
nationalists and modernizers

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:26.160
to improve the status of women
to establish an education system

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.360
and to modernize the
economy and society met

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.890
with the fierce resistance
of traditionalists

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.860
and the [inaudible],
the Islamic clergy.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.650
The second period was
the 1970's and the 1980's

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.920
when two opposing movements,
one Marxist modernizing

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.140
and the other Islamist
traditionalist clash

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:51.460
and fought a long and bloody war
over divergent political agendas,

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.050
cultural understandings
and conceptions

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.370 position:56%
of women's rights and women's place.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:03.330 position:56%
And in the 1990's, the third
period, the Taliban gave new meaning

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:06.500
to this concept of social
exclusion, which is a term

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.370
that has become very fashionable
in European social theory

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:13.450
and development --
international development circles

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.910
when it instituted
draconian policies

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.040
against not only women's
public participation

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.290
but their very visibility.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.840
So the question is for
those of us who do sort

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.140
of a historical sociology, why has
there been such limited progress

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.090
on women's rights including
women's literacy

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:34.400
and educational attainment
in Afghanistan?

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:40.210
Why has the question of women been
so vexed in modern Afghan history?

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.430
Well, I have argued in my
previous work that the advancement

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:47.560
of women's rights in Afghanistan
has been historically constrained

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.970
by three factors.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.960
First is the patriarchal
nature of gender

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.740 position:56%
and social relations deeply embedded
in the traditional communities

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.440
in Afghanistan and expressed
also in the tribal code

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.920
of the [inaudible]
called the [inaudible].

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:07.450
The second factor is the
existence of a weak central state,

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:11.410 position:56%
which has been unable since at least
the beginning of the 20th century

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:16.170
to implement modernizing
programs and goals in the face

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:21.460 position:56%
of ethnic divisions, entrenched
rural interests and tribal futilism.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.490
And these two factors
are interconnected

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.800
for the state's weakness
is correlated with a strong

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.560
if fragmented society
that has been resistant

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:36.330
to state bureaucratic expansion,
civil authority, regulation,

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:39.230
monopoly of the means of
violence and extraction.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.050
That is, the business
of modern states.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:47.350
And the third constraining factor
has been opportunistic intervention

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:50.520
by neighboring countries
and the United States

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:55.670
and until the 1930's Great Britain,
which served to intensify tribal

00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:00.530
or ethnic conflict, stall or
setback socioeconomic development

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.180
and increase women's insecurity.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.770
So these three factors I
have argued behind the defeat

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:10.890
of the modernizing efforts of
King Amanullah in the 1920's,

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:16.000
the incapacity of the governments
during the [inaudible] era 1933

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.920
to 1973, and the defeat
of the Democratic Republic

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.680
of Afghanistan's attempt to
implement a wide ranging program

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:29.770
for land reform, women's rights and
social development in the 1980's.

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:33.000
The patriarchal social
structure, ethnic divisions

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.370
and tribal futilism also
explained the disintegration

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:40.610
of the Mujahideen government
1996 and the inability

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:44.930
of both the Mujahideen and the
Taliban to undertake reconstruction

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.710
and development, let
alone women's rights.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:51.270
[Inaudible] most of the
20th century, therefore,

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:55.890
a patriarchal social structure,
the absence of a strong centralized

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:01.020 position:56%
and modernizing state and
conflictual international relations,

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.460
the great gain, the cold
war, regional rivalries,

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.900
these factors relegated
Afghan women to a status

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.990
that could only generously
be called second citizenship.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:15.600
And during the long reign
of [inaudible] for example,

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.060
the country did experience
relative peace and stability

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:23.430
but very little social
development took place as we heard.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:28.530
The tiny elite in Kabul managed
to insert a gender equality clause

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.810 position:56%
in the 1964 constitution and four
women joined the new parliament then

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:34.110
next year.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:40.180
But by the late 1970's, fully 94
percent of women were illiterate.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:44.890
Moreover, 89 percent of village,
primary and secondary schools were

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:49.610
for boys while only 11 percent
of schools were for girls.

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:55.130
World bank data show that in
1981 the secondary school gross

00:28:55.130 --> 00:29:02.450 position:56%
enrollment rate for girls was only
4.5 percent compared with 33 percent

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:07.410 position:56%
in Iran and 7.9 percent in Pakistan.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:12.830
And I have a graph that really
dramatically illustrates the extent

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:17.870
to which Afghanistan in the
late 1970's and in 1980 sort

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.340
of on the eve of the
Marxist revolution

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:24.710
and immediately afterwards was
really very, very much behind

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.630 position:56%
on every socioeconomic indicator
compared to their neighbors Pakistan

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.970
and especially compared to Iran.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.780
This graph shows comparative
statistics

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.880
on educational enrollments
in the three countries

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.400
in 1981 using world bank
statistics and data.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:55.270
The variables are primary
school pupils percent female,

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:58.920
primary education teachers
percent female

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.440
and secondary school
enrollment percent gross female.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.440
The short bar is Afghanistan.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.180
The middle bar is Pakistan and the
tallest bar, of course, is Iran.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:13.360
So you can get a sense of how much
further behind Afghanistan was

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:20.950
compared to its neighbors as
late as 1981 or '78, '79-80.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.980
So the results of this
situation were that apart

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:34.040
from a very small albeit it very
talented urban female elite,

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:38.530
the vast majority of Afghan women
experienced social exclusion,

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:42.110
illiteracy, poor health
and subordination.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:47.990
And Afghanistan did lag behind
its neighbors for quite some time.

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:52.390
But even so, some progress was
made as Sinzel Nawib pointed

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:57.500
out in girl school enrollments
between 1981 and 1991.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.380
That is to say during the
period of Marxist rule.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.800
And the female proportion

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.510
of the tertiary level was
especially remarkable.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.780
There we go.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:36.290 position:56%
Okay. As you can see between 1980 --

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:41.990
I should point out that statistics
are very less than precise

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:44.530
in many developing countries
and especially in a country

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:48.670 position:56%
like Afghanistan where the most
scientific surveys have been carried

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:51.990
out with only great, great
difficulty and very infrequently.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.820
So these are estimates, but we
have to deal with what we have.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:01.960
As you can see between 1981 and
1991, primary school enrollment

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.200
and in particular the percentage
that was female almost doubled.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:10.620 position:56%
So there was some progress even
though there was a very nonconducive

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.530
environment, i.e. the
international civil conflict

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:17.050
that took place during
most of the 1980's.

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:18.600
And the secondary school pupils,

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:23.080
the percent female was
32.2 percent in 1991.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.200
So this also gives you
a sense of the progress.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:31.670
The other interesting thing is that
according to the 1989 UN report

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:34.050
on Afghanistan by the
UN special [inaudible],

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:37.650
Dr. Felix Amicora [assumed
spelling], and he was in Kabul

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:41.820
at the same time that I was there
in January, February of 1989.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:46.320
His report mentions that there were
seven higher education institutes

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:52.260
in Kabul with a total of
15,319 students of both sexes

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.390
and the medical institute
under the ministry

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:58.740
of public health had really
integrated a lot more students.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:04.200
For example, a total of 18,000
students in 1989 compared

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:09.700
with a total enrollment
of 7000 in '77-78.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:14.260
And in 1989, Kabul University
had about 7000 students

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.800
of which 65 percent were women.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.500
So the next time you
hear the statistics

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.640
that before the Taliban
came to power,

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.800
40 percent of civil servants
were women and 60 percent

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.630
of the university students were
female, it should be pointed

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:32.900
out that this was the era
before the Mujahideen,

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.980
i.e. during the communist
era, not in the early 1990's,

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:41.330
but during the communist era.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.630
Thank you.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.450
All right, well let's look ahead a
little bit towards reconstruction

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:51.010
and development with women
and how current policies

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:55.300
and laws might be able to meet
what researchers within the field

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:59.370
of gender and development define
as women's practical needs

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:01.160
and their strategic
gender interests.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:05.830
And of course practical needs have
to do with basic issues of literacy

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:11.820
and health and water and
shelter and perhaps a second tier

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.120 position:56%
of educational attainment and so on,

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.420
and the strategic gender
interests have to do with helping

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:21.570
to realize women's equality,
autonomy and empowerment,

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:24.220
and of course this has to
be regarded as holistic.

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:27.830
That is to say without meeting
women's basic needs, you can't help

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:30.870
to realize women's
strategic interests but also

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.720
that meeting women's
strategic interests,

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.890
that is to say attaining
equality, autonomy

00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:38.760
and empowerment also requires
a conducive legal environment.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:44.410 position:56%
The difference between Afghan women
today and Afghan women in the 1970's

00:34:44.410 --> 00:34:47.510
and 1980's when they were
really more or less neglected

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.260
by the international community was

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.000
that today they are
enjoying the benefit

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.110
of a new international environment
that really places a high premium

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:57.540
on gender equality and
women's participation,

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.450
and this is partly a legacy
of the UN decade for women,

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:05.100
but it's partly a legacy of what
we may call global feminism,

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:10.240
which really came into its own
after the 1985 Nairobi conference,

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:14.530 position:56%
and it's sort of no accident that by
the time the Taliban came to power

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:20.350 position:56%
in 1996, global feminism was in full
swing, and it became the target.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:23.560
The Taliban regime became the
target of a highly mobilized

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.570
and organized transnational
feminist movement with a commitment

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:30.940
to the universality of women's
human rights and the benefit

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:33.430
of technological know how,
and we heard a little bit

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:39.050
about this during the internet
discussion earlier today.

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:43.080
But the question is will this new
global environment favoring women's

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.650
rights influence planning,
policies and resource allocations

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:51.890
for a post Taliban Afghanistan in a
way that benefits women and girls?

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:56.410 position:56%
Well, certainly the transnational
feminist movement can be relied upon

00:35:56.410 --> 00:36:00.380
to monitor the situation, to
advocate and promote the rights

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.520
of women and girls and so on,

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.140
but the question still is whether
post Taliban Afghanistan will adopt

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.510
the legal and policy frameworks
conductive to the realization

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:14.610
and expansion of women's
needs and rights.

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:18.260
One area of concern pertains to
the legal frameworks that are

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.850
to be decided upon by
the next [inaudible].

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:26.070
The bond agreement that took
place last year stipulated

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.650
that the new constitution and the
legal framework should be drafted

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:34.690 position:56%
"in accordance with Islamic
principles, international standards,

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:38.130
the rule of law and
Afghan legal traditions."

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:39.430
That's quite a broad remit,

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:44.280
and we can expect some disagreement
among the political forces

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.250
over the mixed and hierarchy

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:51.530 position:56%
of international secular [inaudible]
traditional practices and codes.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:54.440
And the legal framework that
[inaudible] which as I said is

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.840
yet unclear will be
able to determine

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.090
and shape women's interests
and needs.

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:04.970
The challenges are very
daunting and my last --

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.860
And my last overhead
illustrates again some

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:23.830
of the daunting challenges
[inaudible] most basic needs

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:28.500
of Afghan women and men and girls.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.980
So what are some of the
major needs of Afghan women?

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.980
In an article that I published in
the Journal of World Development

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:41.850
in 1994, I identified some of
the major concerns and the needs

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:45.920
at the time, and they're actually
still quite pertinent and salient.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.220
What are they?

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.850
Literacy, basic and formal
education, and the closing

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:55.980
of the gender gap and access
to educational attainment.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.280
Healthcare.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.630
There are serious gender
gaps and special problems

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:03.510
such as maternal mortality,
infant and child mortality, TB,

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:06.760
mental illness, drug
addiction and so on.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.080
There needs to be activities
and therapies for women

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.830
and girls suffering
war-related traumas.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:16.930
There need to be special programs
for widows and disabled women,

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:20.770 position:56%
vocational training, rehabilitation,
[inaudible] projects,

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:24.070
skills training and upgrading,
refresher courses for those

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:27.760
who have been unemployed
for some time.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.510
[Inaudible], handy crafts,
food processing enterprising

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.550
and [inaudible] manufacturing,
jewelry.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.850
A lot of these sorts of things
that women can be integrated into

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:39.880
and of course the legal
rights for urban woman.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:45.940
And I was pleased that in the
Afghan women's action plan

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:51.430
which was decided upon last
March and will be coordinated

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:54.550 position:56%
by the Ministry for Women's Affairs,

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:58.970
some of these priority areas
have been delineated and four

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.170
in particular were prioritized,

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:04.260
and they are advocacy
and legal aid training.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.040
Oh sure. Okay.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:10.450
Literacy, widows and orphans
and reproductive health.

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:18.220
So just to wrap up, I'm pleased
to hear that the state department,

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:21.210
and I'm grateful to Rosemary O'Neil

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:24.430
for making this information
available to me,

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:27.470
has designed some valuable
projects for Afghan women.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:30.810
Some of these projects are ongoing
and some of them are proposed.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:35.430
And I think we have to wait
and see what the extent

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:37.520
of the implementation of
these projects will be

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.360
and also what the impact
of these projects will be.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.750
I should also point out that
there are some serious problems

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:44.190
with funding.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:49.860
A total of $4.5 billion was
allocated for the reconstruction

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:54.860
of Afghanistan and a number
of different countries were

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:59.620
to contribute to this fund
but as recently as last month

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:04.580
of the 1.8 billion which was
supposed to be allocated this year,

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.950
fully 1.2 billion is
still outstanding.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:09.870
So many Afghans are very concerned,

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:12.290
and Afghan women are very
concerned about two things.

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:14.430
One, about the low level of funding

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:17.170
that has been made
available thus far and two,

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:21.540
the whole question of security.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.880
So one can only hope
that women's needs

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:28.130
and rights will be prioritized,
that sufficient levels

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:30.030
of funding will be forthcoming

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:32.830 position:56%
and there has been some very
serious disagreements over the level

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:41.000 position:56%
and extent of funding, and also that
Afghan women themselves will be able

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.070
to -- and I'm sure they will
be able to make a strong case

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:49.220
for why their needs and their
rights need to be prioritized

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:52.570
and fully integrated into
any programs and strategies

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:56.500
for reconstruction and development
and peace building in Afghanistan.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.300
Thank you.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:04.450
[ Applause ]

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:06.300
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Rosemary.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:07.910
Thank you all for coming.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:11.670
I know you must be all very
tired at the end of the long day,

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:18.150
so I'll basically focus my
remarks today on the emergence

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:21.830
of civil society, its
role and its function

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:25.900
in Afghanistan, my home country.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:30.510
Although I focus my remarks
on women with whom --

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:34.740
Afghan women with whom I've
worked with almost two decades,

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.980
I also want to note that my
organization, Refugee Women

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:42.030
and Development [inaudible]
has worked extensively

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:46.850
with war affected women and their
male counterparts in various parts

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:50.800
of the world, and I do want to
stress that although we are a women

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:55.340 position:56%
and development organization working
with women who have been affected

00:41:55.340 --> 00:42:00.600
by war and conflict, we also
include men because especially

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.880
in Islamic society such
as the one I originate

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:07.840
from is extremely important
to work in that context.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:12.820
Now let me move on briefly to
talk about [inaudible] programs

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:16.040
and a little bit on the
history of our work.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.980
We have so far in the past
23 years provided training

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:25.650 position:56%
and technical assistance to hundreds
of civil society organizations led

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:30.350
by women and their
male counterparts,

00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:34.200
and we have basically
strengthened and focused

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:39.890
on strengthening the independent
sector, transition from war

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.740
to peace and to democracy.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.350
We remain convinced
that the existence

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:50.300
of strong civil society is
essential to monitor the functions

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:55.240
of political institutions in
a democracy, especially one

00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:01.150
that is transitioning and emerging
from war and emerging democracy.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:06.260
With regard to Afghan women,
we have worked extensively

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.330
by providing training, technical
assistance and small grants

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.800
to help upgrade the
capacities of women,

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:20.060
community grassroots organizers who
have organized in Pakistan and Iran

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:24.020
and most recently of
course in Afghanistan.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:29.150
We help women with their networking
opportunities, and we make sure

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:34.440
that women are empowered to lead
efforts which promote changes

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:40.180
in their human rights conditions
and in the conditions in general

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:45.770
and to basically serve as agents of
change and to participate actively

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:49.800
in the reconstruction of
Afghanistan and a civil society.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.840
Our philosophy basically is --

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.870
although I myself am a
product of the Afghan war

00:43:54.870 --> 00:44:00.420
and have worked extensively with
my [inaudible] in other parts

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.100
of the world, I do not believe

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:09.140
in basically taking our
[inaudible] models to any situation

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.120
because it does [inaudible]
particularly

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.890
in the case of Afghanistan.

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:17.420
We made sure that when we worked
with the civil society leaders

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:19.910
and organizers, we made sure
that we listened to them,

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:22.160
we consult with them extensively

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.260
to basically assess
what their needs are

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.560 position:56%
and basically what their [inaudible]

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:32.670
and then develop models that's
appropriate and meets their needs

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:36.620
and which is in the context
of their own aspirations.

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:42.770
We believe very much in empowerment
and inclusion of Afghan women

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:47.540
in the reconstruction of Afghan
society and to accomplish this,

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:53.030
you basically have -- we think it's
important for women to have access

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:58.690
to information, organization
management and leadership skills.

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:02.030
Women -- Afghan women I've
worked with basically tell me

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:05.170
that it's important for
them to work in unison

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:10.170
with other indigenous Afghan groups
and international organizations,

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:15.470
and they are telling me
constantly that they need regional

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:20.080
and international linkages,
particularly with women

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.040
in the Muslim world
and Muslim society

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:26.100
because they need information on
Islamic humanitarian principles

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:30.840
because this is the way -- this is
the information they need in order

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.670
to use those -- that
information and those models

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:38.200
to progress in their own societies.

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:43.400
We have worked consistently
and pursued two aims.

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:48.990
One, to rebuild the shattered civil
society institutions in Afghanistan

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:53.200
by extending our programs to war
affected Afghans in Afghanistan

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.960
and across the border as refugees
and internally displaced people,

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:02.610
and we assist Afghan community
grassroots organizations operating

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:07.780
in Iran and Pakistan to basically
relocate within Afghanistan.

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:13.870
So far, we have trained
-- we're an organization

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:17.550
that has worked extensively
across gender

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:21.040
and across sectarian
and ethnic affiliations.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:25.880
We have trained and worked with 90
Afghan civil society institutions

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:32.000
from various ethnic representations
and we provided small grants

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.710
to 13 Afghan [inaudible]
to support their projects.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:39.000
And we have worked with
many groups who were working

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.660
at the Taliban clandestinely to
help women to continue their work

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.720
to provide education
and skills training

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:50.930
to women who are in Afghanistan.

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:54.470
Let me state that during
the past two decades

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:58.150
in Afghanistan military
regimes have focused --

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:01.370
their focus has been on
war and the war economy,

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:05.990
which has led to the breakdown
of the Afghan social fabric

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.190
which has kept the
voices of tolerant

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:10.670 position:56%
and democratic-minded Afghans muted.

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:15.930
In essence, for the past 23 years,
the story in Afghanistan has been

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:20.300 position:56%
that of empowerment, but empowerment
of the communist, the holy warriors

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.910
and then the empowerment of the
Taliban, but nowhere has the story

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:28.110
of the empowerment of the
Afghan people taken place

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:31.670
and the international community
must empower war affected Afghans

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:36.850
to rebuild their economies and it's
time to finance Afghan led efforts

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:41.430
to promote peace and building
of democratic civil institutions

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:45.840
to balance the powerful
political institutions.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.650
Now let me move on and
to talk a little bit

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:50.990
about the impact for Afghanistan.

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:55.620
We all know that the war has
had a very serious impact

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:57.600
on both the social, political

00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.530
and physical structure
of the Afghan society.

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:05.480
Our society has been ravaged
by the 23 years of conflict .

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.730
Two million Afghan
lives have been lost.

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:10.100
One million land mine handicapped.

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:14.030
12 million women living in
object poverty and according

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:16.790
to the human development index

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:19.600
of the United Nations
Development Program,

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:27.260 position:56%
average life expectancy is 46 years,
a mortality rate of 25.7 percent

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:33.130
for children under 5 years old and
an illiteracy rate of 64 percent

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:38.930
and Afghan ranks among the most
destitute war damaged countries

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:43.300
in the world in terms of human
development and an average

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:47.740
of 46 women die every
day in Afghanistan.

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:51.710
Rampant poverty has long
characterized Afghanistan,

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:56.370
and 1996 takeover by
the Taliban faction

00:48:56.370 --> 00:49:01.550
of religious extremists is the most
recent assault in a long history

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:05.760
of oppressive regimes, and this is
something that I must underscore.

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:10.060
Under the Taliban, women in
particular were subjected

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:13.000
to severe form of government
and deprivation

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.450
of their basic human rights.

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:20.310
Today, approximately 1.2 million
Afghan refugees still reside

00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:23.890
in Pakistan, 1.4 million in Iran

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:28.920
and an estimated 1.7
million refugees Afghans

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:33.080
who are displaced internally
within the borders of Afghanistan.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:39.100
As in most war conditions,
the majority of the refugees

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:42.730
and the internal displaced people
are women and their children,

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:46.700
and the magnitude of this
tragedy is so mind boggling

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:52.360
that few outside Afghanistan can
conceptualize an approach let alone

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.690
a solution.

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:57.060
And here is where the problem
lies, and if we don't take

00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:00.220
that into consideration, I
don't think the solutions

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:04.100
from the outside will work
and basically affecting change

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:09.320
and bringing sustainable democracy
and development in Afghanistan.

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:14.770
Let me move on to outline a few
basic issues that's affecting the

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:16.260
status of women.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:20.200
The status of women I'm
sure as most of you know

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.640
in Afghanistan what ranks
amongst the worst in the world.

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:29.990
The statistics indicate that one
in every woman dies in childbirth

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:34.360
or pregnancy related
complications every 30 minutes.

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:39.960
70 percent of all diagnosed
tuberculosis cases occur in women.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.820
This is the highest
TB rate in the world.

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.300
Literacy is among the
lowest in the world.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:49.520
It is estimated that 80 percent
of the Afghan women cannot read

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.930
or write, and women are
the poorest of the poor

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:56.520
and in fact they are leading
what we call in the field

00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:00.090
of development the
feminization of poverty

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:02.900
and the feminization
of forced migration.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:09.070
Maternal and infant mortality rates
among the highest in the world.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:15.670 position:56%
An Afghan child is 25 times more
likely to die before the age of five

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:20.010
and 300,000 women -- sorry,
children die each year

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:23.970
from preventable diseases and
although there are no statistics

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:29.560 position:56%
on mental health, we know that women
are highly traumatized by the impact

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:34.780
of war, and suicide rates
are rapidly on the rise

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:39.040
and obviously women are
amongst the most undernourished.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.800
And the demographics
of Afghanistan is

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:47.080
such that it's a society that's
largely composed of women

00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:50.630
who are taking charge of
not only their own lives

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:54.770
but an estimated one million
children who are orphan,

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:59.220
the elderly, the handicapped
while they themselves are heavily

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:04.740
traumatized, malnourished
and under supported.

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.180
Despite these daunting challenges,

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:10.910
Afghan women have demonstrated
remarkable abilities

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:14.950
to transcend their image as
victims and instead excel

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:16.780
as resources for development.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:20.510
This is something that I
would like to underscore.

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:25.950
I'll move on now how they have
demonstrated their ability given

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:27.270
these daunting challenges.

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:31.370
The NGO movement and
[inaudible] civil society,

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:33.850
how did it come about?

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:39.320
We know that the past 23 years of
war we have not had a government,

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.430
and we have had military regimes

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:46.740
and obviously the Afghan people
were heavily impacted by a lack

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:49.120
of government that will
provide basic services

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:54.230
that normally you would have
access to during times of peace.

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:58.760
So Afghan women basically realize
that they had to take matters

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.170
in their own hands,

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:04.750
so they basically organized their
communities in exile in Iran

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:07.940
and Pakistan and also
inside Afghanistan

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.090
and during the time of the Taliban.

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:14.290
To provide the very
critically needed human services

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:19.050
in their communities, they provided
education, health, human rights

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:23.450
and social services to
their own communities.

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:27.530
And they were doing so --
at great risk to themselves

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:33.680
and their families, and the many
Afghans and the scores of Afghans

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:39.220 position:56%
that are living in these
conditions [inaudible] for democracy

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:43.760
and democratic institution building
and civil society for the future

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.840
of Afghanistan lies within them.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.040
So therefore it's imperative
that technical assistance

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:53.880
and resources be committed
to the human

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:56.140
and the [inaudible]
resource development

00:53:56.140 --> 00:54:00.660
of the indigenous Afghan
women community leaders

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:03.400
and their male counterparts.

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:09.880
However, so far the efforts to
focus on the independent sector

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:13.110
in Afghanistan has been very
short term and sporadic.

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:16.870
We have looked at the situation
in Afghanistan as an emergency.

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:19.120
All this has existed
for the past 23 years

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.890
and obviously short
term development schemes

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:26.390
and emergency relief
schemes are very different.

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:29.690
If you want to really impact
change, it's important

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:34.270
that a long term policy and
activities that long term

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:36.450
that builds the capacity
and the skills

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:40.530
of the Afghan people is
imperative to affect change.

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.590
We cannot do development assistance

00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:47.390
and rebuilding the [inaudible]
social fabric of the Afghan society

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:49.330
through short term projects.

00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:53.360
And you must support
the embryonic burgeoning

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.700
of the Afghan civil society
institutions because without

00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:00.970
that we will not be
empowering the Afghan people.

00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:08.610
What do we need now
to bring a change?

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:12.620
First of all, it is
important for us to realize

00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:17.620
that because there is
emphasis on the gender issues

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:19.350
and development issues
in Afghanistan,

00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:22.520
we are very pleased to see that.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:26.660
However, the implementation
strategies and the vision that goes

00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:31.170
with this policy really is lacking.

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:36.890
We must make sure that we establish
a structure that emphasizes

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:41.870
in building the capacities and
empowering the Afghan people rather

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:45.470
than bringing the kind of
approaches that really don't work

00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:46.770
within the Afghan society.

00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:49.600
We need to speak and to consult

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.950
and actively involve Afghan
women themselves in the planning

00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:57.150
and the design and the
implementation of all efforts

00:55:57.150 --> 00:56:01.680
to build the fabric
of the Afghan society

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:05.460
and particularly the
independent sector.

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:08.940
So far, too much emphasis
has been paid

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:11.710
on building the governance
structures in Afghanistan

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:13.570
and the political institutes.

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:16.750
I know that it's very important
that in a new democracy,

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:21.980 position:56%
one that is emerging from
conflict, it's important to do that,

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:26.390
but however, if you neglect
the civil society sector,

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:29.330
we are making a grave mistake.

00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:31.910
So there needs to be more emphasis

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:35.390
on the civil society
sector and the NGO sector.

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:39.260
However, we need to make sure that
we understand who the NGO's are,

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:42.760
who the credible NGO's
are, who are the leaders

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:47.360
and how do we provide training
and assistance and small grants?

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:53.670 position:56%
But we also need to make sure that
we provide a system that it monitors

00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:58.150
and provides -- establishes
transparency and accountability

00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:01.430
of these grassroots
organizations that are emerging

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:03.900
to provide services
in their communities.

00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:09.200
Now let me conclude my
remarks by saying that we

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.480
as Afghan women are very
pleased that the window

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:15.890
of opportunity has opened
for us, and we have hope,

00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:19.910
but we need to make sure that the
Afghan people are given a voice

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:24.610
and they are empowered because
I think that the best solution

00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:30.740
to bring to the war on terrorism
and to waging war on intolerance

00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:33.210
in Afghanistan lies
within the Afghan people,

00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:37.150
and the Afghan people
are very tolerant minded

00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:39.070
and civil society minded.

00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:41.760
However, so far we have
not heard their voices.

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:46.340 position:56%
We have heard the very extreme right
and extreme left voices emerging

00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:51.000
from Afghanistan, and it's time
for us to dispel those myths

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.690
and realize what is the true
nature of the Afghan people?

00:57:55.690 --> 00:58:01.560
So educate yourselves about
who the Afghan people are

00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:05.740
and what their needs are in order
to bring sustainable democracy

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:07.040
and peace in Afghanistan.

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.360 position:56%
It's imperative that it's time to --

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:12.560
that we actually empower the
Afghan people and give a voice

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:15.760 position:56%
to the Afghan [inaudible] 67 percent

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:18.380
of the Afghan population
right now is women

00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:20.520
and without them we
will not succeed.

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.940
I thank you for your attention.

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:24.970
I'd be happy to take
questions later on.

00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:30.410
&gt;&gt; Would like to share with you
some experiences since I've been

00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:33.210
in Afghanistan since December 26 --

00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:40.920
22, the transfer of power
the day power was transferred

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:42.220
from [inaudible].

00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:48.000
Lots of major changes
have occurred since 1999

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:54.950
when I was in Kabul like music.

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:57.550
You can actually hear
music on the streets now.

00:58:57.550 --> 00:59:00.110
Kids are going back to school.

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:04.410 position:56%
There is -- shops are all opened up.

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:08.530
There's actually life where before
during the Taliban when I arrived

00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:13.520
in Kabul, it felt like the soul of
the city is taken out of its body

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:16.320
and people were just
sitting around doing nothing.

00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.010 position:56%
And of course women couldn't go out.

00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:21.130 position:56%
We even have some traffic lights now

00:59:21.130 --> 00:59:25.290
and occasionally a car
stops when the light is red.

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:27.980
And if they do stop,
we have a traffic jam

00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.920
and then you can't get out of it.

00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:34.640
There are 25 embassies
opened in Kabul.

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.130
Peacekeepers are there.

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:41.720
So a lot of wonderful things are
going on, but we must realize

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:45.690
that we cannot cover up
scars with cosmetics,

00:59:45.690 --> 00:59:48.330
and we need to work
seriously on healing.

00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:55.290
We at Afghanistan are focusing
on healing through education,

00:59:55.290 --> 00:59:57.750
allowing the kids to
write, to paint.

00:59:57.750 --> 01:00:01.970
You should see the pictures
that the children paint.

01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:16.560
It was much easier to defeat
the Taliban than it is to deal

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.010
with the legacy they left behind.

01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:23.970
And that is the emotional
state of the Afghan people.

01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:31.760
I opened a [inaudible] school for
girls when I was in Kabul in 1999

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.790
and the Taliban came and beat them
up until their hands were bleeding.

01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:41.030
They beat up their
teacher in front of them,

01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:42.400
but they never stopped coming.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.220
They just found other
strategies to come to school

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:48.110
so that the Taliban don't see them.

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:51.280 position:56%
They came one by one, wrapped with
their books with the cover of Quran,

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:56.070
and they came with
all kinds of ideas.

01:00:56.070 --> 01:01:00.730
UNICEF summary reports says
that total of learning space

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:05.470
in Afghanistan right now is 6784.

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:09.370
That means the formal and
nonformal education --

01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:12.520
and nonformal education
are the schools that --

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.020
are schools but they're
not registered

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:17.110
with the ministry right now.

01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:24.830
There are 4686 formal schools, and
there are 2098 nonformal schools,

01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:30.000
but they couldn't really survey
all of the nonformal schools.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.470
I think there are a lot
more than just 2000.

01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:43.080
And there are total teachers
73,074, female teachers are 20,566

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:47.060
and male teachers are 52,507.

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:51.290
It's only in Kabul where female
teachers exceed male teachers

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:54.230
by 30 percent.

01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:58.950
The biggest problem right
now is that there --

01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:02.450
generation of 12 to
16-year-old girls who are sitting

01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:05.170
at first, second and third grade.

01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:09.260
48 percent of the students
currently are at first grade.

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.440
14 percent are at second grade.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.070
11 percent are at third grade.

01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:18.960
Eight percent are at fourth grade,
two percent are at eighth grade.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.780
I'm sorry, yeah, eighth grade
and then one percent are

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:26.900
at ninth, 11th and 12th grades.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:32.610
So the size of the 12th grade
classes are very, very small.

01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:36.380
Sanitation and water are
the two major problems.

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:39.770
48 percent of all schools
have access to water.

01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:46.420
And only 25 percent have access to
sanitation facilities or toilets.

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:51.000 position:56%
Now I'm going to share with you some
slides so we could have a picture

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.760
of what the schools will
look like as I'm talking.

01:02:56.950 --> 01:03:01.560
This gives you just an idea of
what the city kind of looks like.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.860
There's a river.

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:04.880
There was a river.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.420
It's dried up.

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:10.190
They have opened up a market
inside the river called Titanic.

01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:14.780 position:56%
They like the movie, Titanic so much

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:17.860
that now they could do this,
they called it Titanic.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:21.760
So this just kind of gives you a
general picture of the [inaudible]

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.680
that building, that high rise,

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.640
that's the only high
rise in the city.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:30.090
On the left is the
communication ministry.

01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:32.390
And the next one.

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:37.370
Okay, this is one of the schools
that we're supporting in Kabul.

01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:38.670
It's called [inaudible].

01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:50.860
It has 8345 students, 2732 of them
are girls, 5613 of them are boys.

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:56.750
They have 80 teachers, 80 women
teachers and 70 male teachers.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:04:05.610
Most of the kids are learning
in very strange facilities.

01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:06.940
This is a bus.

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:10.290
Can you go to the next slide?

01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:15.050
These are these buses, the skeleton
of buses that they're sitting in,

01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:19.850
and it's extremely hot because
summer is very hot in Kabul,

01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:21.960
and they're cramped in there.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.280
They don't have any tables.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.870
And this is -- the
top is just the --

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:33.360
they cut off the side of the buses.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:39.690
This is the bus.

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:47.200
It looks like it's two
stories, but it's just one.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:52.810
And there are no chairs, nothing
even to put under their feet.

01:04:52.810 --> 01:05:01.460
And this is another school
in a different part of Kabul.

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.780
There are 1173 students in this.

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:09.980
This is a big house that
somebody donated to the school.

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:16.000
And there is 556 girls and 617
boys, and they have 52 teachers.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.300
So these are the classrooms.

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:26.210
They do have some chairs
and tables that was provided

01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:28.420
by an organization for them.

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:34.500
But most of them are
sitting on the floor.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:43.760 position:56%
Now this is another school that
some German organization I think are

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.420
taking care of the building for
them, but it's a huge school.

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:51.140
They have 10,800 students.

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:56.580
We went mostly to this particular
school because all of the classes,

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:59.690
the under classes,
underground classes that we had,

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:02.340
the kids are sitting
on these classes.

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:04.960
They did very well, the ones
who were at third grade,

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.290
they are in fifth grade and the
ones that were on fifth grade,

01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:08.790
they're on seventh grade.

01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:12.430
They're doing much better
than the other kids.

01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:19.610
But they still don't
have chairs and tables.

01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:22.600
This particular school
are mostly girls.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:31.240
They have 6480 girls and
only 3620 boys in the school.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.360
That's the same school.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:37.850
These are one of our students.

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:40.550
They're sitting in the hallways.

01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:42.280
And this is eighth grade,

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:46.430
and you can see how much
older these girls are

01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:50.520
than regular eighth graders
that would be on eighth grade.

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:57.040
And they're sitting -- they have
20 classes conducting outside.

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:03.990
This is one of our students.

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:18.720
You have to reverse it.

01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:27.190
This is a 12th grade
at the same school.

01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:31.970
They don't have enough chairs,
and the girls are over 20.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.780
Okay now this is [inaudible].

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:49.380
This is a different
province in Afghanistan

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:52.410
about 1.5 hour away from Kabul.

01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:57.340
They're planning on building
an international airport

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.640
in [inaudible].

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.530
This is -- it's a very small
little village in [inaudible].

01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:04.850
It's 430 years old
this little village.

01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:06.150
They have never had school.

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:11.300
This is the first time that some
teachers are coming back from Kabul

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.610
and they have gathered
some students,

01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:16.750
and they have put together
this very small little school

01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:19.050
for girls and boys.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:29.340
This is the classroom, and they
have only first and second grade.

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.640
These are these --

01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:35.610
Beautiful kids.

01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:38.500
Nike. I just wanted [inaudible].

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:45.040
They're just amazing kids.

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:51.480
The same school.

01:08:57.230 --> 01:08:58.530
But they're just so happy.

01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:00.080
They don't have very much.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.560
They don't have chairs or books
and notebooks or anything.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.960
They don't even have much to
eat, but they're very happy.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.920
Now this is [inaudible]
Valley from [inaudible].

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:13.050
It's just a beautiful,
beautiful area

01:09:13.050 --> 01:09:19.710
with this river runs through it.

01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:23.260
We have had our projects
in [inaudible] since 1999.

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:26.980
I couldn't go back to Kabul so we
started our projects in [inaudible]

01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:29.300
because that was the
only place we could work.

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:33.860
So we do have a school being
built right now for girls,

01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:36.750
and we are supporting an
orphanage, a small orphanage

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:39.830
of 30 kids in [inaudible].

01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:42.980
So kids just go by the
river and play in the water.

01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:47.090
Believe it or not, I found a beach.

01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:51.560
This was sand, and these kids
naturally knew what to do,

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.540
and they just went and laid by
the sand and they were playing

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.970
with a tank in the river.

01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:02.860
This is the streets of [inaudible].

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:12.860
This is a school that I visited
in 2000 when I was in [inaudible].

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:15.840
Recently UNICEF has
gone and it was nothing.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.750
The kids didn't even have all this.

01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:22.420
There were only two rooms, and the
kids were all sitting on the floor,

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:25.960
but now UNICEF has put
up these tents for them,

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:31.420
and they have these classrooms
under the tents with somewhat

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:33.970
of a bench at least to sit on.

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:37.970
315 students.

01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:42.950 position:56%
It's a very small class, and the
kids were painting their blackboard.

01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:52.650
264 of these students are all
girls, and they only have 54 boys.

01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:02.720
Now this -- these slides from this
slide on will just show scenes

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.090 position:56%
of what women do in Kabul right now.

01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:09.300
This is a woman who's holding the
-- she's the police on the street.

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.410
Women are actually
working on the street next

01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:13.850
to men, fixing up the roads.

01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:19.540
And these are not very young.

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:22.030
I asked them how old they
are, and one of the --

01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:25.890
the one to the right
said, "I must be 50."

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:31.920
Most women don't know their age,
but they think 50 is very old.

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.350
This is a [inaudible] bakery.

01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:38.380
These are mostly widows.

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:41.650
Their children go to school.

01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:45.840
They work from 4:30 in the morning
until 4:30 in the afternoon.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:50.000
Those who have daughters
12 and 13 years old,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.670 position:56%
they don't let their daughters go
to school because the daughters have

01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:56.480
to take care of the
siblings, younger siblings

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.270
because the mothers have
to come and work here.

01:11:58.270 --> 01:12:00.570
They don't really have a choice.

01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:08.110
The refugee women who were coming
back and settling in this one area

01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:13.180
where all the houses are destroyed,
she was baking bread outside.

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:17.950
But she was very happy that
she can do this at home.

01:12:21.190 --> 01:12:27.070
These are refugees returning,
settling in these destroyed homes.

01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:30.490
There are no windows, no doors.

01:12:30.490 --> 01:12:33.160
I'm not sure what's going to happen

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.100
to them once it gets
cold next month.

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:38.260
It's going to be raining
and freezing.

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:39.560
I don't know.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.860
They don't know what to do.

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:43.610
They were just going to
live day by day and see.

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:51.970
Same refugees in the
destroyed homes.

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.610
They're just so happy and playful,

01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:57.260
and they don't really
have very much,

01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:59.230
no food, no clothing, no nothing.

01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:02.730
It's extremely hot, but she
just loved to pose in front

01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:05.940
of the camera, and she
followed me around.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:16.110
Children, boys, most of the boys
after school go to make money

01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:18.540
because they are the
supporters of the family now.

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:24.320
They either do shoe polishing
or selling water, washing cars

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:28.700
or sewing odds and ends
because they have to make money.

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:32.460
I met this one little
girl where I passed by.

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.270
One day she was sitting
on the street begging,

01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:36.590
and then the next day when I
passed by, she was laying down,

01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:37.890
and it was extremely hot.

01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:40.330
So I asked the driver to turn
around and I stopped next to her,

01:13:40.330 --> 01:13:41.990
and I went and bought
her some juice.

01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:44.840
And I came by and some
guys approached me

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.570
and said, "Don't worry about her.

01:13:46.570 --> 01:13:48.390
These people, this is a trick.

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:49.690
Don't give her money."

01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:51.240
And I thought it's fascinating

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:55.150
that these kids learn
tricks to get more money.

01:13:55.150 --> 01:13:57.980
She was making noise
so that she's crying

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:02.660
and maybe people will pay her
more money, and then as we left,

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:04.770
she got up and she was
walking and then we turned

01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:06.560
around again, and I called her.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.860
I said, "What are you doing here?"

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:11.970
And she said, "I'm
collecting [inaudible]."

01:14:11.970 --> 01:14:13.630
I asked her how old you are?

01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:14.930
She's nine years old.

01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:20.800
She looked -- her skin looked like
she's at least 40, and she said --

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.060
I said, "How come you're
collecting [inaudible] here?"

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:27.410
And she said, "Well my father was
killed in the last bombing of U.S.,

01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:30.920
and I've been doing
this for two months now

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:35.200
because I have a small brother,
and there's no job for my mother."

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.500
I give her a bunch of money, and
I said, "Let's go to your house.

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:38.800
Can I visit your Mom?"

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.930
She said, "No, I don't want to go
home because my mother will be mad

01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:45.710
at me because I come home early."

01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:49.340
So most of the children are
either begging out on the streets

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:55.520 position:56%
or working to earn about $2 to $3 a
day to survive for the whole family,

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.500
and they don't have much to
eat at the end of the day.

01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:03.180
They just eat bread and tea and
maybe sugar if they have it.

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:06.060
But these kids are very happy.

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:10.740
I mean, this is what surprises me
that they just have such a spirit.

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:14.250
This is our computer
center in Kabul.

01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:15.850
Unfortunately, I don't
have a better slide.

01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:20.090
If you go to our site,
www.afghanistan [inaudible].com,

01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:24.390
you'll see other pictures of
the organization and our work

01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:27.790
and this is a computer
center that we have in Kabul.

01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:30.550
We have many students.

01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:33.190
It's actually filled up.

01:15:33.190 --> 01:15:36.170
It's -- what keeps us working
and going is the spirit

01:15:36.170 --> 01:15:39.410
of the Afghan people and the
commitment and the passion

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:44.530
that the kids have for
learning and knowledge

01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:49.760
and it really makes me work
more, want to work more.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.240
I mean, the fact that they came --
it was in the middle of the winter

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:55.620
in December, and all these kids
were coming to school for --

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:58.310
we normally don't have schools in
the winter time because it's very,

01:15:58.310 --> 01:16:00.330
very cold, but they were preparing

01:16:00.330 --> 01:16:02.660
for the regular school
year for March.

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:07.840 position:56%
And these kids came and most schools
had no chairs, nothing on the floors

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.580
and they were sitting
there freezing,

01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:12.500
but schools were filled
up with kids.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.890
It was amazing.

01:16:13.890 --> 01:16:18.750
How -- where they got all of
that commitment, I have no idea.

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:26.350
Okay. I'm finished actually.

01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:29.580
I just wanted to tell you a
short story about this orphanage

01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:31.330
that we have in [inaudible] area.

01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:35.510
This is what encourages me
to work in Afghanistan is

01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:39.590
that we have 30 orphans, and when I
asked them this last time two weeks

01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:41.990
ago what do they want
me to bring for them?

01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:44.740
They said satellite dish
because we want to talk

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:46.040
to you when you're there.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:49.440
And we want to know what other
fun things is over there,

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:52.180
and we want to know
more about there.

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:55.150
There is like -- they
didn't really know where,

01:16:55.150 --> 01:16:58.730
but they knew that there is
this other place that I go to

01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:00.900
and I come back and other
people go and come back,

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.950
and there are other things
that they just want to know.

01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:06.150 position:56%
And then when I ask them what do
you want to become when you grow up?

01:17:06.150 --> 01:17:09.270 position:56%
This 80-year-old said the president.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:16.370
And one very major concern for
me is that there are still areas

01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:20.670
in Afghanistan like
[inaudible] which is an area

01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:24.850
where it's very difficult to get to
and they have not had any schools

01:17:24.850 --> 01:17:28.350
in [inaudible] but a lot

01:17:28.350 --> 01:17:30.170
of [inaudible] have
found shelter there,

01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:31.970
and they have only
[inaudible] schools.

01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:33.970
I was trying to go there this time.

01:17:33.970 --> 01:17:36.460
Unfortunately, there was not
enough time and people thought

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:39.930
that I shouldn't go
because it's too dangerous,

01:17:39.930 --> 01:17:43.770
and this will may become another
home for the fundamentalists.

01:17:43.770 --> 01:17:45.570
Thank you very much.

01:17:45.570 --> 01:18:04.170
[ Applause ]

01:18:04.170 --> 01:18:07.040
&gt;&gt; Story of Afghan women is
the story of great courage

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:14.070
and resiliency and we thank you for
your moving presentations today.
