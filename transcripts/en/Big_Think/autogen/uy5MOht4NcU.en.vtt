as you can and if you do that the idea
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.700
as you can and if you do that the idea
is you'll live life on your own terms

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710
is you'll live life on your own terms
 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.490
is you'll live life on your own terms
and sure you can't control what will

and you'll be true to yourself now

simply breaking from convention and

simply breaking from convention and

simply breaking from convention and
doing whatever you want it to but they

doing whatever you want it to but they
 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.420
doing whatever you want it to but they
would say even if you do that that will

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430
would say even if you do that that will
 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.190
would say even if you do that that will
always be momentary and then you have to

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200
always be momentary and then you have to
 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.530
always be momentary and then you have to
return to the conventions and the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540
return to the conventions and the
 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.960
return to the conventions and the
conventions are unchanged so what they

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970
conventions are unchanged so what they
 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.260
conventions are unchanged so what they
will rather say is think of spontaneity

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270
will rather say is think of spontaneity

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.470
connect in ways that he otherwise
couldn't and that's putting it very

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480
couldn't and that's putting it very
 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.300
couldn't and that's putting it very
abstractly so now let me get extremely

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310
abstractly so now let me get extremely
 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.390
abstractly so now let me get extremely
concrete so what would this mean let's

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400
concrete so what would this mean let's
 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.949
concrete so what would this mean let's
imagine you have an atmosphere in the

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959
imagine you have an atmosphere in the
 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.920
imagine you have an atmosphere in the
workplace where you feel the problem is

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930
workplace where you feel the problem is
 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.870
workplace where you feel the problem is
and again the keys are always trying to

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880
and again the keys are always trying to
 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.400
and again the keys are always trying to
see what are the dangerous patterns that

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410
see what are the dangerous patterns that
 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.740
see what are the dangerous patterns that
are setting in so one common one is

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750
are setting in so one common one is
 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.900
are setting in so one common one is
people aren't talking enough to each

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910
people aren't talking enough to each
 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.000
people aren't talking enough to each
other they're not connecting enough they

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010
other they're not connecting enough they
 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.190
other they're not connecting enough they
connect if they're in a meeting but then

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200
connect if they're in a meeting but then
 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.290
connect if they're in a meeting but then
even if the meetings are well-run it's

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300
even if the meetings are well-run it's
 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.890
even if the meetings are well-run it's
only one

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900
only one
 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.930
only one
for a brief moment so how do you get

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940
for a brief moment so how do you get
 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.300
for a brief moment so how do you get
people to connect more well you start

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310
people to connect more well you start
 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.010
people to connect more well you start
doing little things to create those

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020
doing little things to create those
 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.020
doing little things to create those
connections a common one that's been

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030
connections a common one that's been
 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.300
connections a common one that's been
done in the past few years is to tear

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310
done in the past few years is to tear
 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.020
done in the past few years is to tear
down walls so you tear down walls with

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030
down walls so you tear down walls with
 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.390
down walls so you tear down walls with
glass in where there used to be a wall

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400
glass in where there used to be a wall
 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.980
glass in where there used to be a wall
so even if there is a wall you can only

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990
so even if there is a wall you can only
 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.710
so even if there is a wall you can only
see through that physically gets people

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720
see through that physically gets people
 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.629
see through that physically gets people
connecting more but even there of course

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639
connecting more but even there of course
 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.430
connecting more but even there of course
dangerous patterns can set in I mean if

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440
dangerous patterns can set in I mean if
 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.420
dangerous patterns can set in I mean if
people feel that they actually are two

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430
people feel that they actually are two
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.680
people feel that they actually are two
connected sort of don't have places

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690
connected sort of don't have places
 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.480
connected sort of don't have places
where they can work together without

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490
where they can work together without
 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.210
where they can work together without
others constantly around them that can

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220
others constantly around them that can
 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.580
others constantly around them that can
create problems too and so what you're

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590
create problems too and so what you're
 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.270
create problems too and so what you're
constantly trying to do is to look at

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280
constantly trying to do is to look at
 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.590
constantly trying to do is to look at
what sorts of patterns are developing

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600
what sorts of patterns are developing
 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.719
what sorts of patterns are developing
assume that most patterns are going to

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729
assume that most patterns are going to
 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.659
assume that most patterns are going to
have potentially dangerous consequences

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669
have potentially dangerous consequences
 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.670
have potentially dangerous consequences
of side effects usually unintended and

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680
of side effects usually unintended and
 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.590
of side effects usually unintended and
so you're constantly trying to create

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600
so you're constantly trying to create
 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.590
so you're constantly trying to create
the conditions within which people are

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600
the conditions within which people are
 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.390
the conditions within which people are
really able to flourish and it's

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400
really able to flourish and it's
 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.400
really able to flourish and it's
constant work so you'll do something

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410
constant work so you'll do something
 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.350
constant work so you'll do something
you'll tear down those walls that'll

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360
you'll tear down those walls that'll
 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.600
you'll tear down those walls that'll
work perfectly but then again dangerous

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610
work perfectly but then again dangerous
 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.760
work perfectly but then again dangerous
patterns begin to set in so you'll say

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770
patterns begin to set in so you'll say
 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.800
patterns begin to set in so you'll say
okay let's have a few meeting spaces

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810
okay let's have a few meeting spaces
 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.640
okay let's have a few meeting spaces
that aren't open then that may work

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650
that aren't open then that may work
 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.200
that aren't open then that may work
wonderfully but that'll create some

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210
wonderfully but that'll create some
 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.480
wonderfully but that'll create some
other problems and so you're thinking of

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490
other problems and so you're thinking of
 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.430
other problems and so you're thinking of
yourself is kind of the equivalent of

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440
yourself is kind of the equivalent of
 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.650
yourself is kind of the equivalent of
and it's pushing the metaphor but you're

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660
and it's pushing the metaphor but you're
 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.020
and it's pushing the metaphor but you're
sort of the piano player except what the

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030
sort of the piano player except what the
 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.210
sort of the piano player except what the
world you're creating isn't simply

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220
world you're creating isn't simply
 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.010
world you're creating isn't simply
simply the atmosphere through your music

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020
simply the atmosphere through your music
 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.620
simply the atmosphere through your music
you're actually creating a much larger

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630
you're actually creating a much larger
 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.810
you're actually creating a much larger
atmosphere in the entire world around

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820

people where you have walls where you
 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.540
people where you have walls where you
don't have walls and all of these things

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550
don't have walls and all of these things
 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.360
don't have walls and all of these things
have an incredible impact on the entire

the little things we tend not to focus a

those little things that have huge
repercussions in terms of the entire

people can connect and the kinds of
