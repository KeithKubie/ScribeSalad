this is deep I'm a comedian from Canada

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360
this is deep I'm a comedian from Canada
 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.460
this is deep I'm a comedian from Canada
I wanted to ask in school we learn about

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470
I wanted to ask in school we learn about
 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.919
I wanted to ask in school we learn about
particle theory and wave theory and we

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929
particle theory and wave theory and we
 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.509
particle theory and wave theory and we
learned that light actually follows

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519
learned that light actually follows
 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.580
learned that light actually follows
properties both are there any other

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590
properties both are there any other
 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.070
properties both are there any other
theories that actually seem to fit the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
theories that actually seem to fit the
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.840
theories that actually seem to fit the
behavior of light a little bit more

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850
behavior of light a little bit more
 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.269
behavior of light a little bit more
closely and if so which ones and why are

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279
closely and if so which ones and why are
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.560
closely and if so which ones and why are
we talking since cool thanks
