[Background voices]

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:05.920
AMR MOUSSA &gt;&gt; My name is Amr Moussa. I am
the Secretary General of the League of Arab

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.749
States. Here in Davos we are-ah-very busy
discussing the new world. I-ah-listened carefully

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:19.570
to what-ah-Mr. Peres-ah-had to say moments
ago. I agree with his first comment, indeed,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:27.731
global warming and other issues-ah-new issues-ah-should
be voted before and given the priority in

00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:32.369
the-the national corporation and the international
scene.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:42.100
But for the second point, the-ah-the clerk
that they are going to celebrate the sixtieth

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:49.600
anniversary of the establishment of ______,
I hope that he and his _______ will remember

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.309
that this case is also a case of sixty years
of hardship for he Palestinians and that the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:07.470
time has come for all of us to cooperate to
build a new peace situation in our Middle

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:16.970
East by respecting the rights of the Palestinians
for a state of their own in Jerusalem-East

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:25.270
Jerusalem-as its government. And I hope that
all of us would see an extended Palestine

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.180
that were before the end of this year in accordance
with the promises made by Mr. Bush-by President

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.799
Bush. I hope that before he leaves, President
Bush will make good on his promise and will

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:45.380
show us that it is possible for this American
administration to produce something that will

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.710
be lasting-ah-in its effects on the Middle
East and the world.
