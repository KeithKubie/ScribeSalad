CHLOE COMBI: Thank you
very much for having me.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.560
Yes, my name is
Chloe Combi, and I'm

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.690
here today to talk
to you about my book,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.180
"Generation Z, Their
Voices, Their Lives."

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.020
And to reiterate, it
was a strange kind

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.080
of genesis, this book, because
I'm not originally a writer.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.170
I was a school teacher.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.170
And I was a schoolteacher
straight out of university,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.160
and I taught in
quite challenging

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.049
inner London schools.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.530
And there, I started my
own education charity

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.550
called Write Club, which got
quite a lot of media attention.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.530
And because of that, i started
writing for newspapers,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.170
sort of darkly humorous pieces
about the realities of teaching

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.750
life.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.855
And then from there, I
started writing features

00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:53.300
about, I guess, the grittier
aspects of teen life,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.750
so on grooming, and
busing, and gangland

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.740
culture, and dog fighting.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.740
And yes, those did get
quite a lot of attention.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.510
I think they were
well timed as well.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.586
And what became very
clear was that there

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:11.410
was this real need for this
window into teenage life.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.020
So Generation Z was born.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.936
And the concept, I
suppose, was simple enough.

00:01:17.936 --> 00:01:20.310
it was gonna take about 3
years to research and write it,

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.370
and I'd already kind of started.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.020
And the aim was to interview
2,000 teenagers, which I hit.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.220
So it's a big
sample of teenagers.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.250
And this isn't a book just
about gritty teenagers.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.460
It's from the most kind of
normal teenage experience

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.320
to the most extreme, because
you have to get the whole range.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.200
And so I think
it's a good insight

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.470
into who teenagers in the
UK in the 21st century are.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.340
So who are Generation Z?

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.550
Well, we're already
talked a bit about this.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.440
And actually,
originally, and I wanted

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.010
to call this book
Generation I. I

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.000
didn't want to call
it Generation Z,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.130
but we'll go back
into that later.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.930
And the small i,
because I thought

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.530
the I for the
narcissistic I, which

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.520
is a quality that this
generation are accused

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.630
of a lot, the i,
which obviously is

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.930
a sort of sly nod to Apple,
which most teenagers are

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.385
completely enthralled
with, I'm sure you know.

00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:21.710
And obviously, i
for information,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.350
which is a real quality
of everyday life

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.860
that we're all into.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.169
But there was a fear
that people would

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:31.960
assume that it was a
book about technology,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.340
and it's not at all, because
I'm not a tech expert.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.790
So many things.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.480
So it became Generation Z.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.770
And actually Generation
Z was more of

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.110
understood as a sociological
label than I realized.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.280
Because we've all
heard of Generation X.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.150
That was a real thing, and
there was books on Generation X.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.900
But Generation Y, which I'm
guessing most people in here

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.160
fall into, kind of fell
through the cracks?

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.535
And they were sometimes called
the millennial generation,

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:03.640
and sometimes called the
post-baby boomer generation.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.500
So on a very simple
level, Generation Z

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.750
are the children of
Generations Y and Generation X.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.170
And some of them
probably actually

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.250
have grandparents now who
are Generation X, which

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.083
is a bit terrifying.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.840
And for me, for my purposes,
they were teenagers.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.560
Everyone who I
interviewed in this book

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.220
and who is in this book is
between the ages of 13 to 19.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.310
But for some people
writing about Generation Z,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.480
they widen that
cohort a little bit,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.640
and they're probably
more 12 to 22 year-olds.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.850
And currently there's a lot
of scare pieces about how

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.820
the oldest of Generation Z are
about to enter the workplace,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.320
and ill-equipped they are, and
how they can't talk properly,

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.611
and don't write properly,
and they write in text speak,

00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:49.130
and speak in text speak.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.380
But for my purposes,
they were teenagers.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.520
On a much more complex
level, they were as complex

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.040
as any big group of people.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.550
They're as complicated, and as
strange, and as multifaceted,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.010
and as normal, and as
likable, and a unlikable,

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.290
and as difficult to define
as any other large group.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.320
But there were themes, and
they were coming up again,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.376
and again, and again.

00:04:15.376 --> 00:04:17.000
They became quite
predictable, and they

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.959
formed the natural
chapters of the book.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.839
And not in any order,
and I can't never

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.360
remember all of these, but
they are sex, of course,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.620
and body, of course,
school, family, friendships

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.730
and relationships, crime,
gender, class, race,

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.290
the future, and technology.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.840
And technology particularly
I wanted to focus on a bit,

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.420
obviously, considering
this audience.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.412
But also because
it is interesting

00:04:52.412 --> 00:04:54.870
for this generation, because
this is the first generation--

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.120
this is the thing that
differentiates this generation.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.050
This is the first generation
that have grown up

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.172
with the internet.

00:05:01.172 --> 00:05:02.630
They've grown up
with social media.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.710
They've grown up
with mobile phones,

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.100
and they've never known a
world without those things.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.225
The rest of it's probably
can remember a world when

00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:11.047
we didn't have those things,
but this generation has never

00:05:11.047 --> 00:05:12.880
known world without
them, and it's massively

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.200
influenced who they are,
and how they've evolved,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.290
and how they think.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.132
And on the way, I
actually met a few kids,

00:05:21.132 --> 00:05:22.590
several who spring
to mind, and I'm

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.900
gonna read you a
very short piece, who

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.220
didn't realize that the
internet used to not exist.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.352
And they actually thought
I was pulling their leg,

00:05:31.352 --> 00:05:33.685
and they had to go and google
this fact, which obviously

00:05:33.685 --> 00:05:35.820
in ironic in and of itself.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.940
And I'm going to read you a
very short piece from the book.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.360
Now this is a trigger warning.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.216
There's swearing.

00:05:43.216 --> 00:05:44.840
And if you do end up
reading this book,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.381
there's lots of
swearing, and there's

00:05:46.381 --> 00:05:47.790
lots of quite grim stuff in it.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.998
There's lots of really funny
and happy stuff as well,

00:05:49.998 --> 00:05:51.184
but there is swearing.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.350
And I'm not going to give
you the whole description,

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.974
but these are three
boys, and basically

00:05:54.974 --> 00:05:57.390
them describing their
relationship every day

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.670
with technology.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.790
And these three boys
have never read a book,

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.520
except "Holes" by Louis Sachar,
because they were made to,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.103
and "Romeo and
Juliette," because they

00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:08.390
were made to at school.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.370
And they figured
that they probably

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.630
accrued individually,
probably about $250 a week

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.152
online in some way,
like gaming and so on.

00:06:16.152 --> 00:06:17.610
And these are three
different boys.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.529
One's called Raj, one's called
Abdi, and one's called Jouad,

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:23.320
Do you know what I
found out the other day?

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.950
That the internet
used to not exist.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.119
I didn't know that, and my
mind was all like, the fuck.

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:29.160
And this is the next one.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.494
You're such a fool.

00:06:30.494 --> 00:06:31.910
Of course it didn't
used to exist.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.460
Mobile phones used to not exist.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.810
That's jokes, man.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.540
Can you imagine
no mobile phones?

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.321
How would you even
talk to people?

00:06:38.321 --> 00:06:39.570
With your mouth, you dickhead.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.890
But no, man.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.914
The world would be so shit
without all the stuff we have.

00:06:45.914 --> 00:06:47.497
The teachers are all
negative about it

00:06:47.497 --> 00:06:50.380
and say it's sucking our
brains up, but that's bullshit.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.190
I was gaming with this sick
guy in Columbia the other day.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.920
He told me the
shit about Colombia

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.670
that I didn't know
from geography lessons.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.070
That's educational.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.190
And he told me he gangbanged
my mum and sisters as well.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.140
But that's just
gaming, isn't it?

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.590
You cuss each other to the max.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.400
It's psychological
banter, isn't it?

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.900
You want them to get all pissed
off with you so that they lose.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.095
And it goes on.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.400
So that leads on to my
next question, which

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.140
is do teenage boys and girls
engage with and get treated

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.500
by the internet differently?

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.900
well, that piece obviously
referenced gaming quite a lot.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.350
And I'm not gonna go into gaming
today, because I don't game,

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.000
and I don't really know
enough about the logistics

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.230
and the politics of it to
really go into in detail.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.190
What I do know is that
it's a real red button

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.774
topic at the
moment, particularly

00:07:40.774 --> 00:07:42.190
to do with gender,
because there's

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.310
this whole thing about how it's
a traditionally male thing,

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.110
and more and more
girls want to game.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.930
But thumbs up to teenage boys.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.954
I will say that I met
very few who seemed

00:07:50.954 --> 00:07:52.120
to have a problem with that.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.330
They were very inclusive
about the idea.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.920
And that seems to
be more of an issue

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.140
that a few gray men seem
to have a problem with,

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.973
and I'll let you make
of that what you will.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.710
Both genders are, as
I'm sure you know,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.560
hugely, hugely, hugely
in social media.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.910
But that relationship's
evolving and changing really,

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:12.730
really quickly.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.360
And I guess what
you would describe

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.740
as the granddaddy of social
media, which would be Facebook,

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.960
is in its death
throes with teenagers.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.220
They're completely out.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.420
They leaving by the hundreds
of thousands every day.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.050
And for the reason,
and I quote, it's

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.500
because there's too many
old people on there.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.890
Their parents and their
grandparents are now on there,

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.500
and 16 year-olds don't want
to hang out with their parents

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.541
and grandparents in real
life, and they certainly

00:08:38.541 --> 00:08:39.480
don't online.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.020
I don't think teenagers
ever really embraced

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.880
Twitter that much.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.380
I think it's much more of
a middle class adult thing.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.430
I think that middle class
adults love to go on Twitter

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.730
and either show off or
get offended by things.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.867
I think that kids like
Twitter for stalking people,

00:08:52.867 --> 00:08:54.450
but other than that,
they don't really

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.751
talk about in any kind
of passionate way.

00:08:56.751 --> 00:08:58.500
The three things that
they're really into,

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.480
the mainstream stuff, there's
lots of underground stuff,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.790
but the three big ones
they're into at the moment

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.484
are Snapchat,
Instagram, and YouTube.

00:09:06.484 --> 00:09:08.150
Now YouTube I'm not
gonna talk about too

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.100
much, because it almost
deserves a talk unto itself.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.190
Because the YouTubers are
the teen-appointed new rock

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.590
stars and royalty.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.880
They are huge, and these are
completely teen-led trends.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.900
Like, beyond the ages of
19, probably PewDiePie

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.530
means absolutely
nothing to you, but they

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.680
are like these little gods
to millions and millions

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.250
of teenagers.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.670
And what's interesting is this
is not industry or adult-led.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.380
This is entirely
teen-led, which goes

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.040
to show that they have quite
a lot of autonomy and power

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.420
on the internet.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.130
But the one I wanted
to talk about today

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.620
was actually Instagram,
because there I

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.070
think there is a really
interesting gender

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.200
political paradigm
that comes up.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.740
Male vanity is a thing,
and it's a growing thing,

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.800
and there's lots of issues
about boys and their body image.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.760
But if you look at
the Instagram page

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.200
of the average teenage
boy, it revolves

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.910
around stuff or action.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.100
Stuff being cool, if
they're a bit older,

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.520
cool cars, cool headphones,
cool shades, school threads.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.380
And or it revolves
around action,

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.906
so like, on holiday
surfing with their mates,

00:10:17.906 --> 00:10:19.780
or on the side of a
mountain with their hands

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.974
in the air at sunset.

00:10:20.974 --> 00:10:22.390
Or if they're a
bit younger, maybe

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.514
like looning around a
classroom with their friends,

00:10:24.514 --> 00:10:26.920
and making those kinds of signs.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.290
Girls Instagram page
revolve around the self.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.610
And by the self, I mean the
selfie self-- very stylized,

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.250
very sexualized, the duck face.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:41.660
Now it's the fish face,
which duck face is very 2015

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.660
and we're nearly 2016.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.860
Lots and lots of pouting,
and lots of focus on body,

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.330
in a very kind of
sexualized way.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.820
And when I was writing the
book, the girls, lots of girls,

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.980
told me about selfie parties.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.800
And selfie parties,
ostensibly, I guess,

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.260
are like slumber parties.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.420
Butt the whole idea is
you get together, sit

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.840
around each other's houses,
and rather than watch

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.900
a movie or talk about boys,
you doll each other up,

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.530
take hundreds or
thousands of selfies,

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.370
manipulate them, face
tune them, although you

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.300
don't admit to that, and
then put them on Instagram.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.060
And there's a
competitive element

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.900
as to who gets the most
likes or the most comments.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.820
And obviously, the holy grail of
those comments come from boys.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:37.020
And I think that that's
pushing both genders

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.940
into roles I think a lot of them
are really uncomfortable with.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.350
Girls become the
exhibitionists on trial,

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.050
and boys become the
voyeurs and the judges.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.270
And lots of them have said
to me, I don't like this.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:54.450
And what a shame in 2015,
where most adults, probably

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.680
with the exception
of like Donald Trump,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.100
have decided that beauty
pageants are really naff,

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.750
that teenagers are in this
endless online beauty pageant.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.710
And you can say, yeah, yeah,
yeah, they don't have to do it.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.044
But I think the teenagers,
social media, and Instagram,

00:12:10.044 --> 00:12:11.960
is kind of like the tree
falling in the woods.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.250
If they're not on it, they
feel like they don't exist.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.680
And what really
interested me was

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.791
one of the undisputed queens
of Instagram, Kylie Jenner, who

00:12:23.791 --> 00:12:25.540
millions of them follow,
and unless you've

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.010
lived under a rock, a happy
rock, for the last five years,

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.870
you know that Kylie
Jenner is the half-sister

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.970
of Kim Kardashian, who
originally became famous,

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.950
ostensibly, because her mum put
her sex tape on the internet.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.470
Her mum did that.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:43.280
And I Kylie Jenner has sort
of become the next generation.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.750
And it was her 18th
a few weeks ago.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:51.150
And there was wall-to-wall,
endless, global, breathless

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.631
coverage of this--
what she wore,

00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:54.130
what her mouth
looked like, what was

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.540
on her feet, what was around her
neck, what her boyfriend looked

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.660
like.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.150
I mean, every possible thing.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.740
On the very same day, a
very different 18-year-old,

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.370
Nobel Peace Prize
winner, Taliban-botherer,

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.090
and pretty awesome
person, Malala Yousafzai,

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.220
opened a school for girls
who hadn't been receiving

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.730
an education, and that
received minimal coverage,

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.090
particularly in comparisons to
Kylie Jenner's 18th birthday.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:25.320
So you can see why teenage
girls and teenage boys

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:30.200
are assimilating this
message that it's not

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.550
how brave you are, or
how clever you are,

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.590
or how innovative you
are, all those things.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.180
It's basically if you've
got hot tits and ass.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.330
And that's what we're reducing
girls to via Instagram.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.040
Which leads me to
my next question.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.130
I hope.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.520
Is technology and social
media turning all teenage

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.300
into bullies and victims?

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.730
Well, that's really
a question, and 2014,

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.892
35% of all 11 to
17 year-olds had

00:13:55.892 --> 00:13:57.350
said that they'd
been cyberbullied,

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:58.350
and I think that's growing.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.905
That's doubled on
last year, so I'd

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:02.859
be interested to see the
figures for this year and next.

00:14:02.859 --> 00:14:05.400
Now, I guess that's a question
we could ask of all ourselves.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.320
And I know you probably
know better than anyone

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.580
that the big criticism
of the internet

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.470
is how lawless and
unregulated it is,

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.100
and how people do
things that they

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.300
wouldn't do in ordinary life.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.920
And this absolutely
applies to teenagers.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.600
The hot crucible that
the internet already is,

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.355
when you add
teenagers to that mix,

00:14:28.355 --> 00:14:32.390
it becomes a nuclear
reactor, because teenagers

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.950
are very vulnerable,
but they're also

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.440
liable to do very stupid things.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.280
If you go into any school
in any part of the country,

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.770
no matter how good
the school is,

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.186
and you say the
word cyberbullying

00:14:42.186 --> 00:14:44.050
to the head teacher
or teacher, they

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.490
will make hair tearing motions.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.450
Cyberbullying is an
enormous problem.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.160
In fact, it probably is the
biggest past all our problem

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.760
currently in schools.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.500
And the reason is very
simple, that bullying has been

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.607
an age old problem in schools.

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.440
Hands up if you were
ever bullied at school.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.945
OK, what cyberbullying has
done is taken bullying out

00:15:07.945 --> 00:15:10.510
of the classroom, out
of the playground,

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.170
out of the bus stop, and it has
placed it in a 24 hour a day,

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.331
seven days a week, 365
days a year, potential.

00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:19.080
Kids can be bullied
at 2:00 in the morning

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.176
from their bedrooms.

00:15:20.176 --> 00:15:21.592
Kids can be bullied
whilst they're

00:15:21.592 --> 00:15:23.670
on summer holiday
with their parents.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.400
And kids are really creative,
and they're really mean.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.610
I've seen fake Twitter
pages being set up.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.170
I've seen Facebook hate
groups being set up.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.110
I've seen them hack into
each of these emails,

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.840
and put them online for
other people to see.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.680
And that's with my own eyes.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:44.890
And if you wanted to ask
what the wicked stepmother

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:47.350
of this kind of cyberbullying
is, particularly

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:52.190
from the head teachers point of
view, it would be and sexting.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.960
Does anyone know
what sexting is?

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.580
OK, just in case
you don't, sexting

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:02.500
is a sexually explicit text with
a nude or semi-nude photograph.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.760
Now, as you can imagine, these
are wildly popular with kids.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.830
If you get a group
of kids in a room,

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:11.040
probably from the
age of 15 plus,

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.390
I'd say probably 75% of them
have either sent a sext,

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:19.180
received a sext or
been privy to a sext.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.750
And this is a really,
really, really huge problem,

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.280
because at any one
time in a school,

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.620
you've potentially got
live with the ability

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:33.740
to go viral pictures of
underage kids floating around.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.050
And I've seen and heard of
actual-- if you think about it,

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.585
the ethics behind it, if a
14 year-old sends another 14

00:16:40.585 --> 00:16:42.650
year-old a nude
picture of themselves,

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.200
theoretically, they're in
possession of child porn.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.510
And the schools every week
are having to bring police in,

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.617
and there's been arrests,
and in all sorts, things

00:16:51.617 --> 00:16:53.450
that won't make the
press, because obviously

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.640
it's the kind of
thing that they're not

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.870
going to be particularly
transparent about.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.650
I think this leads
to the next thing.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.520
This sexting thing
is being fueled

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.630
hugely by another red button
of the internet, which is,

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.530
is the internet
turning all teenagers

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.060
into wannabe porn stars,
pornographers, and sex mad?

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:17.839
Well, I would say to
this, no, no, and no.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.089
And the reason being is
because teenagers, not

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:21.649
this generation,
but all teenagers,

00:17:21.649 --> 00:17:25.790
are already fairly sex mad.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.680
A lot of porn watching, which
is being done in huge amounts,

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.870
a lot of porn watching
is because kids can.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:34.490
It's because it's there.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:39.450
And I don't believe that any
teenager who found, say, a porn

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.240
mag in a bush in the '70s, '80s,
or '90s was like, nah, dude.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.990
I'm gonna wait till
2015 to look at this.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:50.320
To be a teenager
is to be curious

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.580
about sex and pornography.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.970
But does that mean that I don't
think that porn is a problem?

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:57.590
No, I don't.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.760
And here's why.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.560
If teenagers were watching
the kind of porn films

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.140
that maybe they
made in the '70s,

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.840
with big bushes
and big moustaches,

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:13.590
like refrigerator operators,
that would be one thing.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.170
But they're not.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.670
A huge commission
study into pornography

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.170
that was made recently
revealed that 80%,

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:23.110
and I'd say that's probably
modest, 80% of pornography

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:26.610
now contains some extent of
violence and sexual violence.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:30.140
So kids are watching porn
films with depicted rape,

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:36.030
depicted gang-rape, S&amp;M,
beatings, slapping around,

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.406
and all manner of sex acts.

00:18:38.406 --> 00:18:40.030
And I've done a lot
of writing on this,

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.580
so I've had to do my research.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.920
And of course that is impacting
on how they see each other

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.960
and how they see sex.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.760
And I'm gonna go
out on a limb here

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.280
and say yes, there are
some teenage girls who

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.909
watch pornography, but
the vast, vast majority

00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:56.450
of teenage consumption
of pornography

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.260
has been done by boys.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.890
And I promise you they are
somewhere between watching it

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.720
quite regularly to
mainlining the stuff.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.870
And it's having an impact.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.730
It's manifesting
behaviorally, certainly.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:16.730
In this country, we have
a problem with consent,

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.860
and not just with teenagers,
but particularly with teenagers.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.420
There is confusion
over what no means,

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.380
when people can say no,
what date rape means,

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.390
what rape means.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.040
And I do believe that
is being slightly led

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.070
by porn, because in porn,
there is no such thing as no,

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.480
and there's very,
very few boundaries.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.260
And another very quick reading
that I wanted to do for you

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:44.510
today, which was from a boy who
I spoke to, I spoke to a lot

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.540
over the last couple
of years, who's

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.190
actually being
treated for I guess

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.450
you could say a porn addiction.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.990
I remember the first
time I saw porn.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.160
I was probably about six.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.110
I went to a primary school that
was attached to a high school,

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.420
and there was always old
kids most giving us shit.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.250
But some were OK.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.079
This bunch of lads were
like, look at this.

00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:06.620
Look at this.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.685
And it was a porn film.

00:20:07.685 --> 00:20:09.060
I don't know what
it was exactly,

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.893
by I remember being
really interested in it,

00:20:10.893 --> 00:20:13.290
and knowing it was probably
bad, but in a good way.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:16.442
I'd say I was about nine, and
a lot of the boys at school

00:20:16.442 --> 00:20:18.025
were either interested
in seeing porn,

00:20:18.025 --> 00:20:19.670
or had been watching it a bit.

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:22.247
You'd have to be pretty
clueless not to be aware of it.

00:20:22.247 --> 00:20:23.705
I didn't get a
mobile phone until I

00:20:23.705 --> 00:20:26.745
was 11, when the obsession
really started, because it

00:20:26.745 --> 00:20:27.950
was so easy to access.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.380
But I'd definitely
seen a lot before then.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.040
A lot of my mates
have mobile phones,

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.850
and after football,
we'd sometimes

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.610
watch a bit on
John's phone, who had

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.090
this wicked phone with a
really good screen even then.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.100
We'd all cuss each other,
saying you've got an erection,

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:40.600
you pervert.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.710
And we would deny
it, but it's porn.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.490
What else is gonna happen?

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:50.010
So he was kind of exposed
to porn at the age of nine.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.677
And I don't think
that's unusual at all.

00:20:51.677 --> 00:20:54.051
In fact, I know it's not,
because I've done a lot of work

00:20:54.051 --> 00:20:55.090
in primary schools.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:59.570
So a bit bleak,
but before I move

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:06.900
on to the last couple of
things, sex talk is rather 1997.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.470
I think in education we
need to perhaps bring

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:10.940
in a porn talk,
and porn education,

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.440
and about how it doesn't
replicate real life.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.170
But with things like
cyberbullying, and sexting,

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.420
and what happens, potentially,
if you put a picture up online,

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.237
I think that maybe companies
like this, and educators,

00:21:23.237 --> 00:21:25.570
and politicians, perhaps need
to get together and really

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.590
clarify the dangers and the
pitfalls of the internet,

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:31.880
and put them there for
everyone to see every time you

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.154
go online, because
I think lots of kids

00:21:34.154 --> 00:21:35.820
are really, really
running into trouble.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.700
I know lots of kids are
really running into trouble,

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.033
because they do things on the
internet without thinking,

00:21:40.033 --> 00:21:41.630
without realizing.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:48.840
So not a completely
different topic,

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.210
but a slightly different
topic, because I know Rob

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:54.900
was really curious
about this one.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.160
This is a country with
a class obsession,

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.720
and it's a country
with a class problem.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:07.430
There are far too many kids who
are falling through the cracks,

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:08.940
and neglected.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.890
And I think with this particular
government, that's increasing.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.660
But that can almost have
a technological slant

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.015
which I think almost
pertains to you guys.

00:22:23.015 --> 00:22:26.510
If you think about a middle
class kid, or a middle class

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:29.250
and upwards, a kid who's
reasonably privileged and well

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.044
looked after, they're gonna have
lots of access to technology.

00:22:32.044 --> 00:22:33.585
They almost always
have a smartphone.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.970
They might well have a
laptop or a personal computer

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.070
in their bedroom.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.980
They might have
a tablet that was

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:47.939
given to them by the school, or
given to them by their parents.

00:22:47.939 --> 00:22:50.480
And they'll do things, all the
things that we just discussed.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.315
They'll watch films.

00:22:51.315 --> 00:22:52.190
They'll watch movies.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:55.900
They'll upload photographs,
or chat to their friends,

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.600
and they'll do schoolwork.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.830
Kids who come from much
less privileged backgrounds,

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.300
I'd say if anything that
their access to technology

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.440
and how they use it is
more important to them.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.040
Kids who don't have
families and don't

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.230
have parents who keep
tabs and look after them,

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:17.270
they form alternative
family structures that

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.500
revolve around their peers.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.020
And technology, and particularly
mobile phone technology

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.190
is an absolutely essential
and intrinsic part of that.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.500
It's how, basically, they
look after each other.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.540
There is an endless
where are you?

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.930
What you doing?

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:31.770
Are you safe?

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:32.920
Are the feds about?

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.880
Are there enemy foe around?

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.230
And so on.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.480
And doing this book,
writing this book,

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.176
I spent a lot of time with
kids, what's called on road.

00:23:42.176 --> 00:23:44.550
And I never used street parlance
because I sound idiotic,

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.300
but on road, basically,
is street parlance

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.600
for on the road.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:53.100
And people assume that that
means a child or a teenager

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:57.210
is in a gang that's affiliated
to criminal activity.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:00.330
And actually, it can mean that,
but it doesn't necessarily.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.660
It often just means that
a kid is on the road,

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.607
because the road is
more safe than the home

00:24:04.607 --> 00:24:05.440
that they come from.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.000
And that can be mostly for
really upsetting reasons.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.030
Bad step-parents, bad parents,
drug abuse, prostitution,

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:16.020
getting knocked around, or
just getting kicked out.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.905
So there's countless
kids on road,

00:24:18.905 --> 00:24:22.360
whether they're full
time or part time.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:29.250
But to go back to the
more organized gangs,

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.470
there's much, much,
much scaremongering

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:34.921
about whether they're utilizing
technology to organize crime,

00:24:34.921 --> 00:24:36.920
and utilizing technology
to threaten each other,

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.230
and using technology to recruit.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.640
And the answer to
that is, hell yes.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.650
Absolutely they are.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.960
They're using technology
very, very, very cleverly,

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.510
and very smartly.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:52.050
And it's very, very
simple as to why.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.060
20 years ago, anyone on the
street affiliated to crime

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.770
had to rely on what was
going on and to understand

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.080
what was going on
through word of mouth,

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.540
through face-to-face
confrontation,

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.920
through graffiti, through
the colors that they wore.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.970
But now particularly with
mobile phones and social media,

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.840
this internalized
endless newspaper

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.570
as to street news, beefs.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:18.530
But also any organized crime
that you've heard of, probably

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:22.330
in the last 8 to 10 years, so if
you think about the 2011 riots,

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.240
if you heard about
that big thing

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.950
that kicked off in Walthamstow
between two rival girl gangs

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:31.220
last week, organized gang-rapes,
organized robberies, organized

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.800
movements against the police,
or what they call the feds,

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.830
they absolutely will have had
some element of technology

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.990
driving it, and
probably quite a lot.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:45.500
So it's definitely not
just a middle class

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.620
concern, the internet.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.490
So on a slightly
more uplifting note,

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:54.740
will technology save the
future for young people?

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.430
Loads of scaremongery
articles, as I'm sure

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.340
you know from adults
about how technology,

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.840
in particular the
internet, is gonna

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.480
signal the end of civilization.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.050
All newspapers will
become Buzzfeed.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:09.410
All television shows
will be fronted

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.860
by AI versions of Davina
McCall and Stephen Fry.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.950
And all shops will
be manned by robots.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:21.095
Teenagers don't see
technology like that at all.

00:26:21.095 --> 00:26:23.220
They don't see it as the
destruction of the future.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.730
They see it as the
creation of their future.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:28.970
And they're very,
very, very innovative,

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:31.570
and very creative
on the internet.

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.150
They vie, and they vlog,
they blog, they YouTube,

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.510
they create websites.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.770
I do a Sunday show
with a lad who's 17.

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:44.810
He started an internet radio
show in his bedroom age 12.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.360
Now age 17, he's sometimes
pushing seven figures

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.535
of listeners, and he's
courted by all these CEOs

00:26:49.535 --> 00:26:51.160
and brands of the world.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.870
And so that's just
a good example.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.830
But I think what the
problem is there's

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.760
too much interface
with institutions

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:04.030
that children, that teenagers,
are caught up in that are too

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:06.370
wrapped up with the path.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:09.060
And the best I can think of,
to finish this off today,

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.870
is education.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:18.340
And when I was teaching I lost
count of the number of times

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.815
that I asked a kid to go
read something from the book,

00:27:20.815 --> 00:27:23.900
or read a book, and they would
whinge and complain or not

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:24.820
do it.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.040
And then as soon as you
gave them a screen, and said

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.706
go and read this on
a screen, whether it

00:27:28.706 --> 00:27:31.870
was a laptop, or a
computer, whatever,

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.360
they go away and happily do it.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.735
And they wouldn't
complain, and it would be

00:27:34.735 --> 00:27:35.943
a completely different thing.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.824
Hard, hard fact is
we have a big reading

00:27:40.824 --> 00:27:42.740
problem in this country,
huge reading problem,

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.430
and it's gonna affect the
future of our country.

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:49.060
There's too many kids and
teenagers who are illiterate.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.760
there are far too many who are
below the level of literacy

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.580
that they should be,
and I'd say probably 85%

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.962
if not more kids don't
read enough, particularly

00:27:57.962 --> 00:28:00.170
when you compare them to
other countries and the kind

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.220
of reading levels
that they're doing.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.445
And I think if we don't
do something about this,

00:28:06.445 --> 00:28:08.320
we are heading for a
problem, because there's

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.830
no way to sugarcoat it.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.860
Reading is essential for
academic and intellectual

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:17.620
development, both as an
individual and as a country.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.240
I think the remedy
might be technology.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.920
I think schools might be
too beholden to this idea

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.530
that reading has to happen
in an armchair in a corner

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.180
in a big tome of Dickens.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.930
And they have to embrace that
this is how kids want to read.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:33.710
I did a lot of work
for Wellington College

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.730
under Sir Anthony Seldon, who's
a real educational progressive.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:43.530
Six years ago, he got rid of 75%
of the books in their library,

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.890
and replaced them with
screens and instructive forms

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:50.040
of reading, and they went
on to have unparalleled

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.260
academic success year-on-year.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.860
Now, Wellington College is an
incredibly wealthy institution,

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.430
and state schools
don't have that kind

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.420
of equipment or money.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.650
I'm a huge fan of the state
system, but it is buckling.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:06.440
It is buckling under
a weight, and it's

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.340
heading for serious problems.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.710
This is a government that
is tearing apart the state

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.260
education system piece
by piece, and it's

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.560
in desperate need of help.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.130
Year-on-year, classroom
sizes increase.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:24.480
So you'll have in one
classroom sometimes 35 kids.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.050
And within that class
size, you can have kids

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:32.170
with an ability range from
serious learning difficulties

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.280
to genius.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:38.460
So not every child
in there is gonna

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.290
have the learning
that they need.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.190
Some kids really work
well with one-on-one.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:46.450
Some kids work really
well in groups.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.160
Some kids love rote learning.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.520
Some kids love doing
project learning.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.530
So all the kids in the state
system I spoke to pretty much

00:29:53.530 --> 00:30:00.470
told me that the internet has
become their primary source

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:04.550
of top-up learning, because they
simply cannot facilitate this,

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:07.110
the kind of learning
that every child needs.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.110
And I think this
needs to be embraced.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:13.390
I think there needs to be a
collaboration between perhaps

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.750
companies like this and
all the many like them,

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.710
even though they're not
as good, in education,

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:23.252
because I think the state
system is in dire need of help.

00:30:23.252 --> 00:30:25.150
So more online
learning resources.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.200
We're not reading enough.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.730
Kids don't have
access to books, so

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:31.880
what about a heavily
promoted teen marketed

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.010
online library service?

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:38.416
A talk like this probably will
primarily be watched by adults.

00:30:38.416 --> 00:30:40.790
What about a teen channel,
where you have something like,

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.400
how to write the
perfect essay, what

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.630
the hell Hamlet's all about, the
night before a GCSE maths exam?

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.210
What about an online
live cramming session

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:50.440
with mathematician?

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:54.280
The night before an English
one, an online cramming session

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.390
with a writer?

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:59.600
So many, many possibilities.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.220
No pressure here, and this is
the point I'm gonna finish on.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.430
For teenagers in
particular, the internet

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:10.700
is so much more
than time and space.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:14.360
It's where they learn,
where they're entertained,

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.950
where they're looking for
a guide to the future,

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.600
and maybe it needs to be
filled with more spaces

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.130
to innovate, and to
learn, and to inspire,

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:26.900
because companies
like this have become

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.610
some of the most
powerful in the world,

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:32.400
and all I would say is,
with great power comes

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.120
great responsibility.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.030
And I wanted to leave
it with a final note

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:39.615
from Annabel, who's 15, who
said that if I woke up one

00:31:39.615 --> 00:31:41.740
day and found the internet
and Google wasn't there,

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.800
I'd probably just
straight up die.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.525
So Thank you.

00:31:46.525 --> 00:31:49.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:54.445 --> 00:31:56.910
FEMALE SPEAKER: So we have
20 minutes for questions

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:57.910
and one microphone here.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.540
Chloe, please
repeat the question.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.856
CHLOE COMBI: Yes.

00:32:06.856 --> 00:32:07.356
Hello.

00:32:07.356 --> 00:32:09.147
AUDIENCE: I know you
said that you'd rather

00:32:09.147 --> 00:32:10.870
have a whole session
on YouTube, but it

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.786
would be really great
to also understand, just

00:32:12.786 --> 00:32:16.030
highlight what you think teens
relationship is to YouTube.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.770
CHLOE COMBI: To YouTube?

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:23.430
God, I mean, it would be better
to get a teenager in here.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.000
It's unbelievably passionate.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.310
I mean, YouTube as I'm sure
you know, YouTubers, they

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:31.000
have a particular slant,
like they do wacky songs,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.460
or advice on life,
or makeup tutorials.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.796
And that's what is it is,
and kids just eat this up.

00:32:38.796 --> 00:32:40.920
They [INAUDIBLE] and follow
them in their millions.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.220
And all I think
it is, and again,

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.900
it reiterates the
point I was making,

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.810
they see these people as like
the cool brother and sister

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:51.684
they never had.

00:32:51.684 --> 00:32:53.350
And I think that's
just the relationship

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:54.650
they've developed with them.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:58.355
But if you look at their
subscribers on YouTube

00:32:58.355 --> 00:33:01.950
and the amount of followers
they have on Twitter and things

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.240
like that, it ranges
between like, from 500,000

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.590
to 20 million.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.840
It's extraordinary.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.620
And actually, you
probably will get them,

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.161
because the publishing industry
has really caught on to this,

00:33:13.161 --> 00:33:15.290
and everything in the
Amazon top 100 at the moment

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:17.710
pretty much is
books by YouTubers.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.740
So it's this real cash cow.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:23.770
But I'm not a
teenager, and I have

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:28.390
talked to so many girls
and boys about this,

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:30.790
and inevitably girls are
[SHRIEKS] about these things,

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:33.880
perhaps more than boys are.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.841
I think they are the
next One Direction.

00:33:35.841 --> 00:33:38.090
I think they're the new boy
bands and boy [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:42.740
But also, I think it's because
it is a big thing for males

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.380
and females.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:46.460
So I think it is very much
a sibling relationship,

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.600
and they have that
very intimate feeling

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.010
like they were in a gang or
a family if that makes sense.

00:33:54.312 --> 00:33:56.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: We have
a question in the back.

00:33:59.763 --> 00:34:02.671
Sorry, we only have
one microphone.

00:34:02.671 --> 00:34:04.254
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
so much for that.

00:34:04.254 --> 00:34:06.129
I'm a mum with a
one-year-old, and frankly, I

00:34:06.129 --> 00:34:06.950
find it terrifying.

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.280
CHLOE COMBI: Sorry!

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.696
AUDIENCE: Really
terrifying, but I

00:34:10.696 --> 00:34:16.740
imagine you spoke to a broad
selection of Generation Zers,

00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:20.170
and their relationships
with technology.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:25.701
Were there any indicators of
differentiators between those

00:34:25.701 --> 00:34:29.876
who had healthy relationships
with technology, where

00:34:29.876 --> 00:34:31.594
it didn't impact
on their ability

00:34:31.594 --> 00:34:35.277
to socially effective person.

00:34:35.277 --> 00:34:37.443
Could you share that?

00:34:37.443 --> 00:34:38.984
CHLOE COMBI: Healthy
relationships, I

00:34:38.984 --> 00:34:40.670
think it's like anything.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:45.900
I think I'm gonna sound really
old here, but I'm not a parent.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.300
I don't have children
yet, but if and when I do,

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.380
I think what you really need
to make clear are perhaps

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.150
two or three things.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.320
The number one, I
think that you need

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.690
to make absolutely clear
that the internet is not

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:01.790
the real world, that everything
on the internet to some extent

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:05.470
is airbrushed and commodified,
and sold and packaged

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:06.980
in a particular way.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.430
And I think a lot
teenagers forget that,

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.530
and they buy into this
Instagram fantasy.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.090
So that communication
to your kids

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:16.650
that the internet and whatever
they're looking at isn't real.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.500
And also that insistence.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.330
And I know the kids,
the teenagers who

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:24.190
I did speak to you
who I know and felt

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.030
like they had really
healthy relationships,

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.970
the ones that still
exist outside the screen

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:33.770
still go out with their friends,
go to the cinema, do stuff,

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:36.630
have this actually life
outside of technology.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:39.140
And I think the ones
where I looked at them,

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:42.100
and I thought, this is a
little bit toxic, unhealthy

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.600
where they're just
completely living

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.330
in this internalized
screen world

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:48.460
and they spend all
their time online

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.660
and socialize
online, and just have

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:55.510
no separation between
technology and the real world.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:57.920
And I think that's
possibly what we're heading

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.640
for more, and more, and more.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.820
People don't meat
in bars anymore.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.120
They meet on Tinder, and
that's a really good example.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.940
But I think that's gonna
to be more and more extreme

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.340
as this generation goes on.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:14.760
But just try and get them
reading, and socializing,

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.780
and talking, and interacting
in this time and space.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:28.042
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] it's
a follow-up question, how

00:36:28.042 --> 00:36:29.880
do you think we can do that?

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.820
How can we improve the situation
[INAUDIBLE] life 10 years on,

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:36.250
not just the social aspect,
but also the cyberbullying?

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.700
How do you think we can
make a possible impact

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.770
and change their lives?

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:42.720
CHLOE COMBI: So do
you mean their lives,

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.454
or the internet itself,
or a bit of both?

00:36:46.454 --> 00:36:48.144
AUDIENCE: A bit of both.

00:36:48.144 --> 00:36:49.810
CHLOE COMBI: It's
really hard, isn't it?

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:54.480
Because for lots of kids,
how does go to the Scouts,

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.450
or be a girl guide, or go
and be a champion swimmer,

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:03.190
or go and volunteer, or mow an
old lady's lawn?f and I think

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:09.280
that it can be quite hard
to sell reality when virtual

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:12.340
reality, to some kids, is
so much more appealing.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.220
But I think, again, we have
to reiterate and reiterate

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.220
that there's no substitute
for actual human contact,

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:23.210
and human emotion, and that say
chatting to your mates online

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.460
is not the same, I think,
as sitting by them,

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.440
and having them
there, and so on.

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.590
To make things
better, all I can say

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.620
is I just think it's
information, information,

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.550
information.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.780
And I think part of
the big problem is,

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.730
and I briefly touched
on that, I hope,

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.280
I think that there's
just not enough

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.330
clarity about the
laws and the rules,

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:46.799
and basically the
ethics of the internet.

00:37:46.799 --> 00:37:48.340
Not like this is
what you have to do,

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.990
but this is what you
should want to do.

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:54.509
And I think, really, if
we've got any hope at all,

00:37:54.509 --> 00:37:56.550
I think there needs to be
much more collaboration

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:59.260
between the internet
providers, and politicians,

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.900
and educators to
actually come up

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:05.700
with internet happy packages,
or something that sounds

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.890
a bit happy clappy, but
something that is a bit more

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:12.840
universally understood about
how you should behave online,

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.230
and probably maybe built into.

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:16.125
Go outside occasionally,
see the world.

00:38:27.535 --> 00:38:28.785
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:38:28.785 --> 00:38:32.497
I wonder what you thought
[INAUDIBLE] as these guys grow

00:38:32.497 --> 00:38:36.210
up, like when they're
in their 30s and 40s,

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:39.180
do you think that their actual
values will be [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:43.660
How worried should
we be about that?

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.920
CHLOE COMBI: The way we're
heading, bearing in mind

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.800
that I think that a lot
of this is easy to forget,

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.390
that a lot of this is
in its real infancy.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:55.460
And in terms of
the internet, we're

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.470
all pretty much
in nappies still.

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:00.840
There's a real
newness to this world,

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:04.065
and I think we're making up
the rules as we go along,

00:39:04.065 --> 00:39:05.860
and realizing there's
some things that need

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:09.451
to be improved or modified.

00:39:09.451 --> 00:39:11.450
I think Twitter's a really
good example of this.

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:14.680
It started as this social
experiment that is just

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.864
going horribly, horribly wrong.

00:39:16.864 --> 00:39:18.780
And I think it's turning
people into assholes.

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:24.980
And people are very quickly
saying this isn't good enough.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:28.350
And I think if we ascribe those
values and that particular kind

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:31.660
of model to kids, I
think we are going

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.910
to learn how to manage the
internet better, and manage

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:36.980
our relationship with it better,
But it is a collaborative

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.210
If it continued on its
current trajectory,

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:44.140
I think we are in trouble.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.556
I think we need to make some
really, really quick changes,

00:39:46.556 --> 00:39:47.560
and very, very quickly.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.184
So I think that's a
brilliant question.

00:39:51.331 --> 00:39:52.497
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:58.062 --> 00:40:00.353
AUDIENCE: You talked a lot
about schools, institutions,

00:40:00.353 --> 00:40:02.808
and businesses.

00:40:02.808 --> 00:40:06.245
The parents haven't
been [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:06.245 --> 00:40:08.405
and I wonder is that
because parents just

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:11.155
don't have a clue what their
children are doing [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:15.730
CHLOE COMBI: Parents
and technology,

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.855
that's a brilliant question,
because I have written

00:40:17.855 --> 00:40:20.940
a lot about this, about how kids
are basically running circles

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.780
around their parents
technologically.

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.332
And you get these really angry
emails going, how dare you!

00:40:26.332 --> 00:40:28.540
I'm a wiz on owned technology,
and I know everything.

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:32.210
And I'm sure-- if any, how
many of you guys have kids?

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.975
I'm sure not many
of your kids would

00:40:33.975 --> 00:40:36.350
be able to pull the wool over
your eyes, and say no, Dad.

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:38.955
It's a school project
on naked ladies!

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:43.910
But yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:49.864
I've got a four year-old
and a six year-old nephew,

00:40:49.864 --> 00:40:51.905
and they do seem to have
this chip in their brain

00:40:51.905 --> 00:40:55.310
that has this innate
understanding.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:57.360
Before he could even
walk he was on the iPad.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.939
And I just think
there seems to be

00:40:58.939 --> 00:41:00.230
something they're evolved with.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.730
But yes, I think
teenagers exist in a very,

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.350
very-- which is why Facebook
has become so diminished

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:07.960
in its popularity-- they exist
in this very private world

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.570
that they want to keep
separate from their parents.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:14.070
They have this very, very,
very strong online identity

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:18.020
that, I think, is very,
very confidential to them.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.140
And yes, I do.

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.880
I think for the most part,
if you read the book,

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.796
I mean, there's so may anecdotes
of parents them getting

00:41:24.796 --> 00:41:26.170
into all kinds of
trouble There's

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:30.620
a girl who got groomed online, a
horrible few horrible examples.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.850
And the parents have
absolutely no idea.

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:34.730
And I do think it's
like all of us.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.480
We're all quite secretive
on the internet.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.021
I mean, I don't
think any of us would

00:41:38.021 --> 00:41:40.025
be that happy if your
mate was like let me look

00:41:40.025 --> 00:41:42.190
at your history of browsing.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:44.330
You'd be like, uh, must you?

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.970
And so if you think about
kids, they're really, really

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:48.840
secretive online.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.380
So I think there is a problem
of this generational gap.

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:55.660
And I think it's
probably narrowing.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.341
So kids who are in their late
teens and early 20s probably

00:41:58.341 --> 00:42:00.340
have fairly clueless
parents, and then obviously

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.490
as the parents get younger,
that probably will narrow,

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.510
but right now, I
think is a big thing.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.320
Good question.

00:42:11.296 --> 00:42:12.212
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:18.104 --> 00:42:21.137
Some of what you talked about
sounds really depressing.

00:42:21.137 --> 00:42:21.970
CHLOE COMBI: I know.

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:23.338
I'm sorry.

00:42:23.338 --> 00:42:27.130
AUDIENCE: Did the teenagers
feel optimistic about life?

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:29.787
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:29.787 --> 00:42:31.620
CHLOE COMBI: For these
talks, I sometimes do

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.220
go for the jugular.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.402
And there are loads of
brilliant, and wonderful,

00:42:35.402 --> 00:42:37.860
and amazing kids, and they're
doing brilliant, and amazing,

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.568
wonderful things.

00:42:38.568 --> 00:42:43.220
And I promise you, it
isn't a bleak book.

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:47.174
But yes, the teenagers
are cautiously

00:42:47.174 --> 00:42:48.340
optimistic about the future.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:53.530
I think that they see that
there's many things in decline,

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:59.360
things like where 10 years ago,
there was a tangible dream,

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.860
I'm gonna go and
work for the Times,

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.360
or I'm gonna go and work
for The Daily Mirror

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.610
and become a journalist.

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:05.340
I think that's a
vanishing prospect,

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:07.530
and there's lots of career
vanishing prospects,

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.610
and they're very, very
well aware of this.

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:11.193
The other thing is,
I do think they've

00:43:11.193 --> 00:43:12.800
become much more realistic.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.360
Five years ago,
when I first started

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.902
writing about kids, when I
very first started teaching,

00:43:17.902 --> 00:43:19.610
and they all were
like, yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:20.610
I'm gonna be famous.

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:21.660
What are you gonna famous for?

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.220
I'm just gonna be famous.

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:23.840
I'm either gonna be a famous
singer, or a famous footballer,

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.548
or what have you.

00:43:24.548 --> 00:43:25.950
And I think they've
also realized

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:27.574
that that's a fairly
unrealistic dream,

00:43:27.574 --> 00:43:32.717
and they need to have a plan B.

00:43:32.717 --> 00:43:34.300
It's very much down
to the individual.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.890
There's some kids who
just see the world,

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:39.450
and just see things that they're
gonna add to it, and create.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.720
And there's some kids
who see the world,

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.136
and just see what
they wanna take.

00:43:42.136 --> 00:43:43.990
And let's say fr
the most part, they

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:45.570
more fall into the
former category.

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:47.820
They're much more
optimistic, and giving,

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.180
and want to do
stuff for the world,

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:51.590
and contribute to the world.

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:53.549
But trouble is you
hear-- and I'm sometimes

00:43:53.549 --> 00:43:56.090
a bit guilty of that-- the kids
who take too much stuff away.

00:44:01.131 --> 00:44:02.964
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
an interesting talk.

00:44:02.964 --> 00:44:05.910
I totally get the point about
how they view technology.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:09.228
I volunteer at this school in
north London, and some of them

00:44:09.228 --> 00:44:11.311
ask me, how the hell can
you work for Google, sir?

00:44:11.311 --> 00:44:13.800
Because it's just a website.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.401
CHLOE COMBI: Right,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:15.401 --> 00:44:17.025
AUDIENCE: So the
question I want to ask

00:44:17.025 --> 00:44:20.163
is, if a couple of the
issues are, as you mentioned,

00:44:20.163 --> 00:44:24.510
this idea that [INAUDIBLE]
kind of curated online

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:27.408
and there's a lack of
core social contexts,

00:44:27.408 --> 00:44:28.857
there's texting,
there's obviously

00:44:28.857 --> 00:44:32.110
cyberbullying, et cetera,
it's far less inhibitive,

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:35.965
because you can't empathize
with a text message.

00:44:35.965 --> 00:44:40.002
Do you think that the rise of
services like Snapchat which

00:44:40.002 --> 00:44:43.362
are more unfiltered and
have the [INAUDIBLE] aspect

00:44:43.362 --> 00:44:47.329
are a force for good when it
comes to cultural [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:49.120
CHLOE COMBI: It's a
really complicated one,

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.994
because I know completely
what you're saying,

00:44:50.994 --> 00:44:54.370
that the in the moment can
give it more of that immediacy

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:57.587
that email completely lost,
and I think even texting does,

00:44:57.587 --> 00:44:59.420
particularly as it's
backed up with pictures

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.420
and emoticons and
stuff like that

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.590
which underline your point.

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.160
I do know what you mean,
but at the same time,

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:11.950
I think that Snapchat is also
another barrier, because it's

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:15.010
like when you watch--
we're all guilty of this--

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:18.235
but when you watch kids doing
stuff, like, say having lunch,

00:45:18.235 --> 00:45:19.610
they're all too
busy Snapchatting

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:22.195
their lunch to chat.

00:45:22.195 --> 00:45:23.070
I know what you mean.

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:26.947
I think it's evolving the way we
do talk in that particular way,

00:45:26.947 --> 00:45:29.030
and I think it is bringing
it into that real time,

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:31.015
and giving that kind of
immediacy and emotion.

00:45:31.015 --> 00:45:33.140
But I think at the same
time it's another step back

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.720
from that human interaction.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.430
And I don't whether
in 30 years time

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:39.800
whether we're just gonna
have screens for faces

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.380
with emoticons coming up.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:42.838
AUDIENCE: Facebook's
working on it.

00:45:42.838 --> 00:45:43.930
It's called Oculus.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:45.013
CHLOE COMBI: There you go.

00:45:45.013 --> 00:45:47.150
That's terrifying.

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:49.926
FEMALE SPEAKER: We have time
for two more questions, one here

00:45:49.926 --> 00:45:51.560
and one in the first
row [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:56.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:01.850
I was looking up [INAUDIBLE]
changing nature of crime

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:04.300
and real decline in what
we might call [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.250
crimes or burglaries.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:07.499
CHLOE COMBI: Absolutely, yeah.

00:46:07.499 --> 00:46:12.389
AUDIENCE: And a massive rise in
terms of cyber crime and child

00:46:12.389 --> 00:46:14.834
sex abuse.

00:46:14.834 --> 00:46:18.257
If you were with the
Home Secretary right now,

00:46:18.257 --> 00:46:19.724
what three things
would you ask him

00:46:19.724 --> 00:46:22.658
to do that would make
a difference in terms

00:46:22.658 --> 00:46:25.424
of that growth on child
sex abuse and cyber crime?

00:46:25.424 --> 00:46:27.340
CHLOE COMBI: Well, this
is really interesting.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:32.160
I actually just wrote an
article about this specifically,

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.910
this whole thing
about child sex crime.

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:40.740
And it's a big question,
and this is terrifying.

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:43.180
But one of the
things, when you go

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.242
into the serious
criminal world-- no,

00:46:45.242 --> 00:46:46.950
not even the serious
criminal world, when

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:49.050
you go into the
streets of London,

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:51.550
you talk to kids involved
in criminal activity, one

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:53.320
of the things
that's fast emerging

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:58.070
is that drug dealing, and gun
running, and things like that

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:01.010
are high risk, but
pimping and the skin trade

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:03.740
is not high risk for the pimps.

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:06.470
It's high risk for the girls.

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:10.480
So kids, younger boys,
younger and younger men,

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.160
are getting more,
and more, and more

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.610
into pimping younger,
and younger, and younger.

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.640
And I think that
that is massively

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:22.700
being fueled and
encouraged by the internet,

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.537
and by this child
trafficking and things

00:47:24.537 --> 00:47:25.620
like that on the internet.

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.578
So I think that because
you've got these police

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:31.050
units that are well in there
with the drug awareness stuff.

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.010
They're well in there
with the burglary stuff.

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:34.450
They're well in there
with the riot stuff.

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:36.200
They need to get sex
units on the streets,

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.300
and really, really quickly.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.140
I was talking to 13
year-olds the other day,

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:44.680
and they all know girls who
were being pulled into the sex

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.530
industry, and girls who aren't
that much older, and so school

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:48.360
age girls.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.360
And I know for a fact, I was
talking the grooming of girls,

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.590
particularly in what would be
considered high risk schools,

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:56.590
is very, very common.

00:47:56.590 --> 00:48:01.470
I've written several about
this, 17 year-old boys,

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:04.740
they might look at a 30 or 40
year-old man, and think weird.

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.890
So what they're doing is
recruiting 17 year-old boys

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:08.950
to lure them in.

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:10.900
So it's become this hierarchy.

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.240
So that would be my
number one thing-- so

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:17.930
education and bringing
in these sex units.

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:22.090
And again, I wouldn't teach
my grandmother to suck eggs,

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:23.930
and come in here and
say I'm a cyber expert.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:26.390
I'm not, but I'm
guessing they really

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:30.910
need to get more into
these cyber aspects of it.

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:32.800
Because it seems
to be like fungus.

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.610
It just pops up everywhere
on the internet,

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:37.070
and it's really awful.

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:37.780
Great question.

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:38.300
Though.

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.615
It's one to think about.

00:48:39.615 --> 00:48:40.585
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:40.585 --> 00:48:42.668
FEMALE SPEAKER: One more
in the front [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:47.375 --> 00:48:51.700
AUDIENCE: So teenagers are
quite famously [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:55.556
and these are quite
complicated issues,

00:48:55.556 --> 00:48:56.930
and they might
not be predisposed

00:48:56.930 --> 00:49:01.710
to listen to their parents,
the police, the government,

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:03.150
or teachers.

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:05.782
How do you think we
should try and communicate

00:49:05.782 --> 00:49:06.990
to teenagers on these issues?

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:09.659
How are you gonna get
the message [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:09.659 --> 00:49:11.450
CHLOE COMBI: How are
you gonna communicate?

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:13.033
I think that's a
really good question,

00:49:13.033 --> 00:49:15.547
and I think that I do know
the answer to this one,

00:49:15.547 --> 00:49:17.380
even though it's maybe
not the complete one.

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:19.010
I think it's collaboration.

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:21.780
I think, again, this
book is in their voices.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:22.640
It's them talking.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.177
I didn't say to them this
is what I think you think.

00:49:25.177 --> 00:49:27.010
I said to them, just
tell me what you think.

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:30.990
And teenagers are so used to
be being talked at and about

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:32.946
that no one ever sits
and says, well, tell me.

00:49:32.946 --> 00:49:35.070
Tell me, well, how did you
feel when your mum died?

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:37.490
How did you feel when you
got kicked out of school?

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:40.472
How did you feel when
you got into Oxford?

00:49:40.472 --> 00:49:41.930
And all these
stories are in there,

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:43.138
and I think that's the thing.

00:49:43.138 --> 00:49:45.430
It's communication
and collaboration.

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:48.407
Rather than say, these
are the teen problems,

00:49:48.407 --> 00:49:50.240
you say, you tell me
what teen problems are,

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.475
and let's sort this problem
out togetherness, and let's try

00:49:52.475 --> 00:49:53.724
and come up with some answers.

00:49:53.724 --> 00:49:55.860
And I think that that's
pertinent for what we're

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:57.410
doing on the
internet, how we deal

00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:59.390
with quite a lot of
the internet problems,

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:03.950
and just generally how we're
going to improve as a species.

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:06.280
That's a profound note
to end on, wasn't it?

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: Please
join me in thanking

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.630
Chloe for coming on.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:09.588
CHLOE COMBI: Thank you.

00:50:09.588 --> 00:50:11.980
[APPLAUSE]
