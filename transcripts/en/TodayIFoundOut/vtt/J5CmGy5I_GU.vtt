00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.450
In March of 2008, the world lost one of the
most fearless soldiers to have served during

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.040
WWII; a man who single-handedly cleared five
heavily fortified positions with nothing more

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.770
than a knife, a few grenades, a rock, and
a complete disregard for the bullets flying

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.440
around him the whole time.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.640
This is the story of Bhanbhagta Gurung.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.640
First thing first, we should address the fact
that there doesn’t seem to be a clear consensus

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.640
on how exactly Havildar Bhanbhagta Gurung’s
first name is supposed to be spelled (Havildar

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.640
is the rank he held, not his name).

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.640
While some spell Gurung’s first name as
“Bhanubhakta”, others list it as “Bhanbhagta”.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.640
Since even the most reputable of sources can’t
seem to give a satisfactory answer on which

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.640
spelling is correct, we’ll be using the
name listed on his Victoria Cross citation,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.640
Bhanbhagta for the duration of this piece.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.640
Moving on.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.640
Little is known about Bhanbhagta’s early
life save for that he was born in the small

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.070
Nepalese village of Phalpu in September of
1921.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.010
In 1940, at just 18 years of age, Bhanbhagta
joined the British army a few months after

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.150
World War II began, at which point he was
drafted to the “third battalion of the 2nd

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.050
King Edward VII’s Own Gurkha Rifles.“

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.949
For those of you unfamiliar with what Gurkhas
(sometimes spelled Gorkhas) are, that’s

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.070
the name name traditionally given to soldiers
recruited into the British or Indian military

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.070
from Nepal.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.080
The word Gurkha is taken from an area once
known as the “Gorkha kingdom” which was

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.050
folded into, and became part of, Nepal around
the turn of the 20th century.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.300
The Gurkhas were originally formed after British
soldiers fighting in Nepal were simultaneously

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.471
impressed and terrified by the soldiers they
encountered during the Anglo–Nepalese War

00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:19.060
of 1814.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.940
After the war ended in 1816, the British,
spying an opportunity to bolster their ranks,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.470
offered these fearless Nepalese soldiers a
chance to volunteer to serve in the British

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.420
army, referring to them collectively as Gurkhas,
a name that is still used today regardless

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.770
of which area of Nepal a given soldier happens
to hail from.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.860
Back to Bhanbhagta- although he joined the
Army in 1940, he didn’t get his first taste

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.340
of combat until 1943 when he fought alongside
several thousand other men behind enemy lines

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.740
in Burma.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.140
During this time, Bhanbhagta was promoted
from rifleman to the rank of Naik (the equivalent

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.140
of a corporal).

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.920
However, he would later be demoted back to
rifleman in 1944 when his commanding officer

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.090
told him to patrol the wrong area and then
refused to admit he’d made a mistake, instead

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.200
putting the blame on Bhanbhagta.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.670
Bhanbhagta’s shining moment would come a
year later on March 5th when he single-handedly

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.910
took out five entrenched Japanese positions
under heavy fire and out of ammunition for

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.730
his gun, doing his best impression of Lance-Corporal
James Welch, who once captured four armed

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.939
German soldiers with an empty gun.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.989
Bhanbhagta was part of a platoon of men given
the singular goal of taking a hill colloquially

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.540
known as “Snowdon East”.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.580
The hill was a strategic foothold that had
been overrun by the Japanese who, in the process,

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.099
killed about half the Gurkha company after
the Gurkhas had run out of ammunition and

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.930
been forced to fight their way through the
enemy lines with nothing but knives while

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.930
under heavy fire.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.620
Bhanbhagta’s platoon was told to take the
hill back “regardless of cost.”

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.290
Bhanbhagta apparently took this command quite
literally.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.519
While Bhanbhagta and his men were sneaking
up on the position, they were spotted and

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.430
initially pinned down by machine gun and mortar
fire.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.930
Because of their extreme close proximity to
the enemy troops, support artillery from their

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.620
own side wasn’t possible.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.620
They were stuck.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.889
While all of this was happening, an enemy
sniper from a tree approximately 75 meters

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.879
to the south began picking off Bhanbhagta’s
comrades one by one.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.499
Realising that he couldn’t get a clean shot
if he was lying down, Bhanbhagta stood up

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:25.069
while still being shot at from several enemy
positions and managed to take out the sniper.

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.999
Bhanbhagta then signalled to his men to follow
him as he sprinted up the hill in the face

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.470
of the enemy fire raining down.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.150
Several Gurkhas were killed in the dash and
they were again pinned down.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.989
Apparently not one to just sit around while
being shot at, Bhanbhagta sprinted the remaining

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.420
20 meters or so to the nearest enemy trench
and quickly dispatched those inside with a

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.640
couple of well thrown grenades.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.859
He then ran towards a second enemy position,
killing the armed soldiers inside with his

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:53.859
bayonet.

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.930
Bhanbhagta then rushed two other positions,
taking them out with his now trademark combo

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.780
of grenades and furious rifle-stabs.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.079
All of this happened while Bhanbhagta was
being “subjected to almost continuous and

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.599
point-blank machine-gun fire,” particularly
from a fifth position slightly further up

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:11.599
the hill.

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.659
Bhanbhagta then headed towards the final position,
a small bunker where a machine gunner was

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.910
raining down heavy fire and doing a boatload
of damage to the Gurkhas.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.620
Nevertheless, Bhanbhagta managed to get on
top of the roof of the bunker without being

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.180
shot, and then, being out of explosive grenades,
hurled two smoke grenades into the opening

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.290
from which the machine-gun was firing.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.216
When two Japanese soldiers emerged, Bhanbhagta
pounced on them with his kukri (a curved blade

00:04:33.216 --> 00:04:35.340
not dissimilar from a machete), dispatching
them both.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.160
He then ran into the machine-gun nest, having
to kill the machine-gunner with a rock instead

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.530
of his kukri, because of the extreme close
quarters.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.920
Bhanbhagta and his men then took possession
of the machine gun and managed to hold the

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.760
position from the counterattack by the enemy
soldiers, proving that you absolutely do not

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.370
want to mess with a Gurkha.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.150
No seriously, the Gurkhas are feared and respected
in equal measures for precisely the reason

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.670
Bhanbhagta is the subject of this article-
they’re utterly fearless in combat.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.660
For instance, during WWI, despite their relatively
small numbers, thousands of Gurkhas earned

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.970
medals for gallantry and there are dozens
of documented stories about Gurkha soldiers

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.100
encountering seemingly hopeless odds and still
coming out on top.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.790
Even outside of war, for example, there’s
Bishnu Shrestha, a retired Gurkha who fought

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.370
against 40 armed robbers and won.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.310
Next up, we have Taitex Phlamachha, a former
Gurkha who punched a mugger to the ground

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.190
whilst that mugger’s own knife was lodged
inside Phlamachha’s arm.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.130
Then there was Lachhiman Gurung, who, according
to the July 27, 1945 edition of The London

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.130
Gazette,

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.340
was manning the most forward post of his platoon
which bore the brunt of an attack by at least

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.810
200 of the Japanese enemy.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.560
Twice he hurled back grenades which had fallen
on his trench, but the third exploded in his

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.460
right hand, blowing off his fingers, shattering
his arm and severely wounding him in the face,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.900
body and right leg.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.460
His two comrades were also badly wounded but
the rifleman, now alone and disregarding his

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.640
wounds, loaded and fired his rifle with his
left hand for four hours, calmly waiting for

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.720
each attack which he met with fire at point
blank range.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.490
Afterwards, when the casualties were counted,
it is reported that there were 31 dead Japanese

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.800
around his position which he had killed, with
only one arm.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.940
Despite losing the use of his hand and right
eye during that battle, among other injuries,

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.700
Gurung lived until December 12, 2010, dying
at the age of 92.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.580
Apparently, it took Death a while to work
up the courage to pay Gurung a visit.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.610
Perhaps the thing that sums up the Gurkhas
best is this quote from Field Marshall Sam

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.680
Manekshaw: “If a man says he is not afraid
of dying, he is either lying or is a Gurkha.”

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.910
After WWII, Bhanbhagta’s superiors tried
and failed to convince him to continue serving.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.740
As it turns out, Bhanbhagta had an elderly
mother and young family to support and he

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.330
wanted to go home to be with them.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.770
Before he left the army though, Bhanbhagta
was re-promoted to his previous rank of Naik

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.250
when it emerged that his previous indiscretion
wasn’t actually his fault.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.820
He was also given the honorary rank of Havildar
(sergeant) for obvious reasons.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:10.460
He died on March 1, 2008, at the age 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:17.020
of 86.
