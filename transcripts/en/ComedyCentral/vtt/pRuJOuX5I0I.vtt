Obviously, Awkward Family Photos
has made a cottage industry

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.578 align:start position:0%
out of unearthing family photos
that should have remained

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:12.979
repressed in people's memories.

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.481
But for 250 points I
want you to caption

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:17.083 align:start size:88% position:13%

delightful photographs.

Uh, Drew.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.840 align:start size:97% position:3%

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.879
(applause)

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:53.019

were different then, come on.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.421
Points, Brendon.

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:57.023

back around, okay.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:08.868
Okay, you got points,

(laughter)

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.495
- That had a whole narrative.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.063

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:45.899

all right, next.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.944

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:08.922
this is what happens.

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:10.089
- I leave my computer
alone for five minutes,

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.491
I'm a guest here.

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:15.094
- Always sign into
a secure network.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.030 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is what happens
Drew, Blaine.

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:19.892
That guy looks like
Dr. Demento though.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:22.962

looks like Nosferatu.
