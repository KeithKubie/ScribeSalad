00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.170
SPEAKER 1: The first well known
cipher, a substitution cipher,

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.235
was used by Julius
Caesar around 58 BC.

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:14.220
It is now referred to
as the Caesar Cipher.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.590
Caesar shifted each letter
in his military commands

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.830
in order to make them
appear meaningless

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.480
should the enemy intercept it.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.730
Imagine Alice and Bob decided
to communicate using the Caesar

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.780
Cipher First, they would need
to agree in advance on a shift

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.750
to use-- say, three.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.430
So to encrypt her
message, Alice would

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.380
need to apply a shift
of three to each letter

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.070
in her original message.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.280
So A becomes D, B becomes
E, C becomes F, and so on.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.940
This unreadable, or
encrypted message,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.200
is then sent to Bob openly.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.970
Then Bob simply subtracts
the shift of three

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.480
from each letter in order to
read the original message.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.450
Incredibly, this
basic cipher was

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.379
used by military leaders for
hundreds of years after Caesar.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.460
JULIUS CAESAR: I
have fought and won.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.600
But I haven't conquered
over man's spirit,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.934
which is indomitable.

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:14.350
SPEAKER 1: However,
a lock is only

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.520
as strong as its weakest point.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.100
A lock breaker may look
for mechanical flaws.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.400
Or failing that,
extract information

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.450
in order to narrow down
the correct combination.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.540
The process of lock breaking and
code breaking are very similar.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.140
The weakness of
the Caesar Cipher

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.540
was published 800 years later
by an Arab mathematician

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.210
named Al-Kindi.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.960
He broke the Caesar Cipher
by using a clue based

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.210
on an important
property of the language

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.350
a message is written in.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.700
If you scan text from
any book and count

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.360
the frequency of
each letter, you

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.850
will find a fairly
consistent pattern.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.410
For example, these are the
letter frequencies of English.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.010
This can be thought of as
a fingerprint of English.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.500
We leave this
fingerprint when we

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.810
communicate without
realizing it.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.090
This clue is one of
the most valuable tools

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.192
for a codebreaker.

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:07.500
To break this
cipher, they count up

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.759
the frequencies of each
letter in the encrypted text

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.010
and check how far the
fingerprint has shifted.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.820
For example, if H is
the most popular letter

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.430
in the encrypted
message instead of E,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.130
then the shift was likely three.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.890
So they reverse
the shift in order

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.020
to reveal the original message.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.960
This is called
frequency analysis,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.840
and it was a blow to the
security of the Caesar cipher.
