00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:07.009
A very optimistic view of how the market works,
which sometimes is associated to Adam Smith,

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:13.670
is the view that you have self-regulation
of the market and that the natural forces,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.140
natural market forces can take care of everything,
and in particular can ensure that inequality

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:28.340
will never increase to such an extent that
it becomes socially and economically and politically

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.830
useless or even dangerous for that matter.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.819
Now I think, in fact if you reread Adam Smith
or if you try to look at the economic developments

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:45.039
throughout history you see that you cannot
expect everything from the market.

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.300
You cannot just rely on natural forces to
solve all problems.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.829
And I think one of the conclusions from the
history of political economy and the history

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:02.399
of economic growth and inequality is that
you need strong public institutions in order

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.350
to put this powerful market forces in the
right direction.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:16.090
Market forces can produce a lot of innovation,
a lot of incentives for inventions and entrepreneurship

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.259
and this is very positive.

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:25.090
But it would be a mistake to rely and count
on these natural forces to sort of self regulate

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.130
themselves.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:35.409
And if you look in particular at the period
going up to the financial crisis of 2007/2008,

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.670
you have a very large concentration of economic
gains into a relatively small group of the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.009
population.

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.280
And I think everybody agrees today that this
has contributed not only to the stagnation

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.729
of median household income but also to the
rise of household debt, which in turn put

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.640
pressure on the financial system and probably
did contribute to fragilize the financial

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.060
system with the consequences that we know
in terms of financial crisis, recession, unemployment,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.390
which we are now starting to get out of this,
but there has been many years of lost growth

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.220
and a lot of social suffering because of this.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.920
So we need strong public institutions in order
to regulate these market forces.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.360
And sometimes there's really excessive phase
in these forces.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.870
There are cycles over history.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.190
Probably after the Great Depression, after
World War II people realized that market forces

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.960
need to be strongly regulated.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.460
And then starting in the '70s and the '80s
with Reagan and cultural revolution and even

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:57.030
more so after the fall of the Soviet Union,
we entered in the 1990s and 2000 in a new

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.990
cycle of sometimes unlimited phase in the
self regulation of markets.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.950
And to a large extent we are still in this
phase.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:14.950
And I think there's a reaction, a policy reaction
to the financial crisis of 2007/2008 has been

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.570
too limited so far.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.620
And this could happen again.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.450
We've asked a lot to our central banks in
the U.S. and in Europe.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.850
And of course it's easy to print billions
of dollars or billions of euros to avoid complete

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.950
bankruptcy of a financial system, which is
what happened in the 1930s and which ended

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.750
up in a complete catastrophe.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.790
So it's better to avoid that.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.540
But at the same time printing money is not
enough to solve the central problem that we

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.560
need to solve.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.430
So the good news is that we avoided a complete
bankruptcy and complete depression, but the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.510
bad news is that we did not really solve the
structural problems which might in the future

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.530
create new crisis.
