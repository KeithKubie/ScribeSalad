them look at them take them away and
 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.479
them look at them take them away and
then ask a series of questions about the

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489
then ask a series of questions about the
 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.130
then ask a series of questions about the
underlying product and see what they

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140
underlying product and see what they
 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.319
underlying product and see what they
think

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329
think

so just in passing people seem to look

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889
so just in passing people seem to look
 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.590
so just in passing people seem to look
at labels and they say they buy or do

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600
at labels and they say they buy or do
