in the early 90s so this symmetry was

in the early 90s so this symmetry was

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:35.370
a crisis and I don't see that as being
qualitatively different from what we

01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:35.380
qualitatively different from what we
 

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:38.400
qualitatively different from what we
have seen previously in Europe that is

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:38.410
have seen previously in Europe that is
 

01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:42.269
have seen previously in Europe that is
the reason why the political situation

01:05:42.269 --> 01:05:42.279
the reason why the political situation
 

01:05:42.279 --> 01:05:47.189
the reason why the political situation
in the early 80s and the early 90s does

01:05:47.189 --> 01:05:47.199
in the early 80s and the early 90s does
 

01:05:47.199 --> 01:05:50.849
in the early 80s and the early 90s does
not look dramatic of to us now he's

01:05:50.849 --> 01:05:50.859
not look dramatic of to us now he's
 

01:05:50.859 --> 01:05:53.429
not look dramatic of to us now he's
simply because we know that the story

01:05:53.429 --> 01:05:53.439
simply because we know that the story
 

01:05:53.439 --> 01:05:56.339
simply because we know that the story
went it ended well but the process was

01:05:56.339 --> 01:05:56.349
went it ended well but the process was
 

01:05:56.349 --> 01:06:00.209
went it ended well but the process was
quite messy in particular in the 80s

01:06:00.209 --> 01:06:00.219
quite messy in particular in the 80s
 

01:06:00.219 --> 01:06:02.699
quite messy in particular in the 80s
people in Europe were very pessimistic

01:06:02.699 --> 01:06:02.709
people in Europe were very pessimistic
 

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:05.670
people in Europe were very pessimistic
about national politics and they were

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680
about national politics and they were
 

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:09.029
about national politics and they were
even more pessimistic about European

01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039
even more pessimistic about European
 

01:06:09.039 --> 01:06:12.209
even more pessimistic about European
politics at that point in time European

01:06:12.209 --> 01:06:12.219
politics at that point in time European
 

01:06:12.219 --> 01:06:14.309
politics at that point in time European
politics were characterized as euros

01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319
politics were characterized as euros
 

01:06:14.319 --> 01:06:17.420
politics were characterized as euros
chlorotic and that was a reasonably

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:17.430
chlorotic and that was a reasonably
 

01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:20.880
chlorotic and that was a reasonably
consensual qualification that was made

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:20.890
consensual qualification that was made
 

01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:23.669
consensual qualification that was made
about European politics we simply forget

01:06:23.669 --> 01:06:23.679
about European politics we simply forget
 

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:25.620
about European politics we simply forget
we don't care much about what happened

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:25.630
we don't care much about what happened
 

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:30.739
we don't care much about what happened
in the eighties now the question about

01:06:30.739 --> 01:06:30.749
in the eighties now the question about
 

01:06:30.749 --> 01:06:34.499
in the eighties now the question about
banking Union and national banking union

01:06:34.499 --> 01:06:34.509
banking Union and national banking union
 

01:06:34.509 --> 01:06:37.699
banking Union and national banking union
is a very very interesting in particular

01:06:37.699 --> 01:06:37.709
is a very very interesting in particular
 

01:06:37.709 --> 01:06:42.839
is a very very interesting in particular
because in the question the euro area is

01:06:42.839 --> 01:06:42.849
because in the question the euro area is
 

01:06:42.849 --> 01:06:47.669
because in the question the euro area is
being qualified as a nation now I don't

01:06:47.669 --> 01:06:47.679
being qualified as a nation now I don't
 

01:06:47.679 --> 01:06:50.969
being qualified as a nation now I don't
think that we are going to have the euro

01:06:50.969 --> 01:06:50.979
think that we are going to have the euro
 

01:06:50.979 --> 01:06:55.849
think that we are going to have the euro
area or the European Union as a nation

01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859
area or the European Union as a nation
 

01:06:55.859 --> 01:07:00.660
area or the European Union as a nation
during my lifetime I'm a very firm

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:00.670
during my lifetime I'm a very firm
 

01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:02.999
during my lifetime I'm a very firm
believer in the fundamental political

01:07:02.999 --> 01:07:03.009
believer in the fundamental political
 

01:07:03.009 --> 01:07:06.449
believer in the fundamental political
principle of the primacy of the National

01:07:06.449 --> 01:07:06.459
principle of the primacy of the National
 

01:07:06.459 --> 01:07:08.910
principle of the primacy of the National
dimension of politics and I believe that

01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:08.920
dimension of politics and I believe that
 

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.679
dimension of politics and I believe that
will stay but I do believe that this

01:07:12.679 --> 01:07:12.689
will stay but I do believe that this
 

01:07:12.689 --> 01:07:15.120
will stay but I do believe that this
primacy of the National dimension of

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:15.130
primacy of the National dimension of
 

01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:18.419
primacy of the National dimension of
politics is compatible with the building

01:07:18.419 --> 01:07:18.429
politics is compatible with the building
 

01:07:18.429 --> 01:07:22.840
politics is compatible with the building
of a banking Union in the

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:22.850
of a banking Union in the
 

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:25.780
of a banking Union in the
euro area and deep banking and financial

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:25.790
euro area and deep banking and financial
 

01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:29.710
euro area and deep banking and financial
integration in the European Union in

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720
integration in the European Union in
 

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.590
integration in the European Union in
line with the single market I believe

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:32.600
line with the single market I believe
 

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:37.470
line with the single market I believe
that in that context we will have a

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:37.480
that in that context we will have a
 

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:41.740
that in that context we will have a
European resolution mechanism backed by

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:41.750
European resolution mechanism backed by
 

01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:45.310
European resolution mechanism backed by
a European backstop facility and we'll

01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:45.320
a European backstop facility and we'll
 

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.110
a European backstop facility and we'll
have a European Deposit Insurance Scheme

01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:47.120
have a European Deposit Insurance Scheme
 

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:51.160
have a European Deposit Insurance Scheme
backed by a European backstop as well

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:51.170
backed by a European backstop as well
 

01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:52.630
backed by a European backstop as well
and I believe that will happen

01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640
and I believe that will happen
 

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:59.320
and I believe that will happen
relatively fast so it's interesting we

01:07:59.320 --> 01:07:59.330
relatively fast so it's interesting we
 

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:01.570
relatively fast so it's interesting we
can be looking at the same eurobarometer

01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:01.580

in Europe there are a number of
 

01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:15.280
in Europe there are a number of

questions on trust in the eurobarometer
 

01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:17.890
questions on trust in the eurobarometer
that one could could see over the past

shocked and so that's well that seems to

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:56.670
shocked and so that's well that seems to
 

01:14:56.670 --> 01:14:58.340
shocked and so that's well that seems to
be where the disagreement is whereas the

01:14:58.340 --> 01:14:58.350
be where the disagreement is whereas the
 

01:14:58.350 --> 01:15:00.380
be where the disagreement is whereas the
other aspect that I don't think has been

01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:00.390
other aspect that I don't think has been
 

01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:03.830
other aspect that I don't think has been
covered enough is that a union has a

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840
covered enough is that a union has a
 

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.510
covered enough is that a union has a
value in uniformity of of reaction to

01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520
value in uniformity of of reaction to
 

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.670
value in uniformity of of reaction to
for example behavior almost like a

01:15:10.670 --> 01:15:10.680
for example behavior almost like a
 

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:14.450
for example behavior almost like a
cultural value where a banking Union and

01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:14.460
cultural value where a banking Union and
 

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:16.880
cultural value where a banking Union and
a fiscal Union would have the

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:16.890
a fiscal Union would have the
 

01:15:16.890 --> 01:15:21.230
a fiscal Union would have the
possibility to have uniform expected to

01:15:21.230 --> 01:15:21.240
possibility to have uniform expected to
 

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.720
possibility to have uniform expected to
create uniform expectations in terms of

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:23.730
create uniform expectations in terms of
 

01:15:23.730 --> 01:15:26.000
create uniform expectations in terms of
what will happen if I do this what will

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:26.010
what will happen if I do this what will
 

01:15:26.010 --> 01:15:28.610
what will happen if I do this what will
happen if I'm a firm and I'm doing mmm

01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:28.620
happen if I'm a firm and I'm doing mmm
 

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:31.520
happen if I'm a firm and I'm doing mmm
and I'm sort of trying to work in the

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:31.530
and I'm sort of trying to work in the
 

01:15:31.530 --> 01:15:33.530
and I'm sort of trying to work in the
wiggle room you know in time and not

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:33.540
wiggle room you know in time and not
 

01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:36.920
wiggle room you know in time and not
really not sure what what the regulation

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:36.930
really not sure what what the regulation
 

01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:38.390
really not sure what what the regulation
is going to be because the Italian or

01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400
is going to be because the Italian or
 

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.310
is going to be because the Italian or
the greek banks are are being lenient

01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320
the greek banks are are being lenient
 

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.170
the greek banks are are being lenient
and the German one that I have to

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:42.180
and the German one that I have to
 

01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.400
and the German one that I have to
interact with because I'm doing

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:43.410
interact with because I'm doing
 

01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:45.320
interact with because I'm doing
international business is not as lenient

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:45.330
international business is not as lenient
 

01:15:45.330 --> 01:15:48.260
international business is not as lenient
so all this it's not surprising to me

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:48.270
so all this it's not surprising to me
 

01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:49.940
so all this it's not surprising to me
that the first agreements would be in

01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:49.950
that the first agreements would be in
 

01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:52.080
that the first agreements would be in
terms of supervision

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:52.090
terms of supervision
 

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:53.880
terms of supervision
and resolution because those things

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:53.890
and resolution because those things
 

01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:55.590

supervision resolution belong to the

supervision resolution belong to the
 

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.230
supervision resolution belong to the
second category of creating uniformity

01:15:58.230 --> 01:15:58.240
second category of creating uniformity

much beyond European elections that is

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:43.450
much beyond European elections that is
 

01:16:43.450 --> 01:16:45.330
much beyond European elections that is
the fact that we have parliamentary

the fact that we have parliamentary
 

01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:48.950
the fact that we have parliamentary
elections means that there will be a new

well so what we have now in 2014 is an

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:25.950
well so what we have now in 2014 is an
 

01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:29.910
well so what we have now in 2014 is an
opportunity to have a change in the

01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920
opportunity to have a change in the
 

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.990
opportunity to have a change in the
political cycle in europe that includes

01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000
political cycle in europe that includes
 

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.480
political cycle in europe that includes
the european parliament elections but

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:36.490
the european parliament elections but
 

01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:38.760
the european parliament elections but
goes much beyond European Parliament

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:38.770
goes much beyond European Parliament
 

01:17:38.770 --> 01:17:42.480
goes much beyond European Parliament
elections and that's why the consensus

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:42.490
elections and that's why the consensus
 

01:17:42.490 --> 01:17:45.240
elections and that's why the consensus
between Germany and France which is

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:45.250
between Germany and France which is
 

01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:49.440
between Germany and France which is
being built can be leveraged because the

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:49.450
being built can be leveraged because the
 

01:17:49.450 --> 01:17:54.840
being built can be leveraged because the
European political cycle is such that it

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:54.850
European political cycle is such that it
 

01:17:54.850 --> 01:17:58.470
European political cycle is such that it
can incorporate that political impulse

01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480
can incorporate that political impulse

quickly now in terms of the

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:05.270
quickly now in terms of the
 

01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:09.080
quickly now in terms of the
characteristics of the adjustment

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:09.090
characteristics of the adjustment
 

01:18:09.090 --> 01:18:13.299
characteristics of the adjustment
process in Europe it is true that

01:18:13.299 --> 01:18:13.309
process in Europe it is true that
 

01:18:13.309 --> 01:18:17.109
process in Europe it is true that
countries that were in deficit have

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:17.119
countries that were in deficit have
 

01:18:17.119 --> 01:18:20.959
countries that were in deficit have
adjusted quite sharply current account

01:18:20.959 --> 01:18:20.969
adjusted quite sharply current account
 

01:18:20.969 --> 01:18:24.379
adjusted quite sharply current account
deficits public deficits have fallen

01:18:24.379 --> 01:18:24.389
deficits public deficits have fallen
 

01:18:24.389 --> 01:18:27.740
deficits public deficits have fallen
fallen quite substantially it is true

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:27.750
fallen quite substantially it is true
 

01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:32.419
fallen quite substantially it is true
the Germany had and has a current

01:18:32.419 --> 01:18:32.429
the Germany had and has a current
 

01:18:32.429 --> 01:18:34.970
the Germany had and has a current
account surplus and a general government

01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:34.980
account surplus and a general government
 

01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:41.359
account surplus and a general government
surplus clearly the need for adjustment

01:18:41.359 --> 01:18:41.369
surplus clearly the need for adjustment
 

01:18:41.369 --> 01:18:45.020
surplus clearly the need for adjustment
in creditor countries is recognized as a

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:45.030
in creditor countries is recognized as a
 

01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:47.600
in creditor countries is recognized as a
matter of principle and as an example

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:47.610
matter of principle and as an example
 

01:18:47.610 --> 01:18:50.180
matter of principle and as an example
the German Finance Minister Wolfgang

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:50.190
the German Finance Minister Wolfgang
 

01:18:50.190 --> 01:18:57.490
the German Finance Minister Wolfgang
schäuble has been on record stating that

01:18:57.490 --> 01:18:57.500
 

01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:03.109
increases in wages in Germany are part

01:19:03.109 --> 01:19:03.119
increases in wages in Germany are part
 

01:19:03.119 --> 01:19:05.600
increases in wages in Germany are part
of that process of adjustment and so

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:05.610
of that process of adjustment and so
 

01:19:05.610 --> 01:19:11.680
of that process of adjustment and so
clearly the need for action by both

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:11.690
clearly the need for action by both
 

01:19:11.690 --> 01:19:15.970
clearly the need for action by both
surplus and deficit countries is

01:19:15.970 --> 01:19:15.980
surplus and deficit countries is
 

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:19.899
surplus and deficit countries is
recognized what we do see however is

01:19:19.899 --> 01:19:19.909
recognized what we do see however is
 

01:19:19.909 --> 01:19:24.169
recognized what we do see however is
that as is usually the case the

01:19:24.169 --> 01:19:24.179
that as is usually the case the
 

01:19:24.179 --> 01:19:27.950
that as is usually the case the
adjustment in deficit countries was a

01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960
adjustment in deficit countries was a
 

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.379
adjustment in deficit countries was a
much sharper and as a matter of fact I

01:19:30.379 --> 01:19:30.389
much sharper and as a matter of fact I
 

01:19:30.389 --> 01:19:33.620
much sharper and as a matter of fact I
believe that every single country that

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:33.630
believe that every single country that
 

01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:35.540
believe that every single country that
was under stress has been able to

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:35.550
was under stress has been able to
 

01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:37.669
was under stress has been able to
generate the surplus by now there is I

01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679
generate the surplus by now there is I
 

01:19:37.679 --> 01:19:43.280
generate the surplus by now there is I
believe not one single exception Massimo

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:43.290
believe not one single exception Massimo
 

01:19:43.290 --> 01:19:48.740
believe not one single exception Massimo
very quickly on fiscal Union I was asked

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:48.750
very quickly on fiscal Union I was asked
 

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:51.919
very quickly on fiscal Union I was asked
a question in a panel in a conference

01:19:51.919 --> 01:19:51.929
a question in a panel in a conference
 

01:19:51.929 --> 01:19:53.629
a question in a panel in a conference

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:19.510
adjustment
 

01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:24.930
adjustment
more symmetric adjustment frankly you

01:22:24.930 --> 01:22:24.940
more symmetric adjustment frankly you
 

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.899
more symmetric adjustment frankly you
can never force someone how to consume

01:22:27.899 --> 01:22:27.909
can never force someone how to consume
 

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:31.919
can never force someone how to consume
or if they want to save more we've never

01:22:31.919 --> 01:22:31.929
or if they want to save more we've never
 

01:22:31.929 --> 01:22:33.720
or if they want to save more we've never
managed to do that so we'll always have

01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:33.730
managed to do that so we'll always have
 

01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:35.640
managed to do that so we'll always have
this asymmetry in there in the

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:35.650
this asymmetry in there in the
 

01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:38.250
this asymmetry in there in the
adjustment and I think we will always

01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:38.260
adjustment and I think we will always
 

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:40.589
adjustment and I think we will always
continue to have the asymmetry in this

01:22:40.589 --> 01:22:40.599
continue to have the asymmetry in this
 

01:22:40.599 --> 01:22:43.770
continue to have the asymmetry in this
adjustment the issue is whether we have

01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:43.780
adjustment the issue is whether we have
 

01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:46.200
adjustment the issue is whether we have
automatic mechanisms that make the

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:46.210
automatic mechanisms that make the
 

01:22:46.210 --> 01:22:50.629
automatic mechanisms that make the
adjustment smoother and less painful and

01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639
adjustment smoother and less painful and
 

01:22:50.639 --> 01:22:55.560
adjustment smoother and less painful and
this is what could be done if we had a

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:55.570
this is what could be done if we had a
 

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:58.379
this is what could be done if we had a
fiscal Union I'll to to bring it back to

fiscal Union I'll to to bring it back to

that question going forward we could
 

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.399
that question going forward we could
think of many elements the fiscal you

01:23:02.399 --> 01:23:02.409
think of many elements the fiscal you
 

01:23:02.409 --> 01:23:06.439
