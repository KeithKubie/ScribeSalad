00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.990
SUBJECT: One of the
maladies of the modern age

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.910
is that, even though
collectively we have more

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.020
than we've ever
dreamed possible,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.040
we remain perpetually
dissatisfied.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.300
It's almost like we are
wired never to be content.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.710
And that seems to be the case.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.490
I mean, it's been
written that we

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.120
are insatiable wanting
machines, designed to desire.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.060
And so, in some ways,
that has made us reach out

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.600
and transcend boundaries.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.280
We didn't stay in the caves.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.860
We haven't stayed on the planet.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.360
We went to the moon.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.440
We crisscrossed the skies.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.290
We extend and we transcend.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.340
But on the other hand,
that exploratory itch,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.580
that genetic pull that
makes us tread forth, always

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.910
in search of the insatiable
deliciousness of the new,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.470
the wholly other, the

--of the unfamiliar also makes
[NON-ENGLISH SPOKEN] day-to-day

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.000
life kind of banal.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.980
Again, it's kind of sad.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.680
Because the very
same quality that

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.530
makes us these
majestic creatures that

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.690
soar above the heavens and
transcend their batteries

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.710
has made us perpetually
dissatisfied neurotic beings,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.930
living in urban centers,
drowning in consumption

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.500
in an over-capitalist,
bloated system that

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.210
can no longer satiate us.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.635
Always wanting something
else, until we're

00:01:34.635 --> 00:01:40.490
overwhelmed and overweight
and immobilized by how spoiled

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.140
we've become.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.110
And yet, we enjoy
very little of it.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.470
So what do we do?

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.712
How do we find a
way to leverage,

00:01:46.712 --> 00:01:51.465
and combine, and reconfigure
the tension of this situation?

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:53.760
That we always want
more has made us great,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.670
but that we always
want more almost

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.950
makes us kind of miserable.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.830
And so, I don't know.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.900
I haven't resolved that yet--
I haven't resolved that yet.
