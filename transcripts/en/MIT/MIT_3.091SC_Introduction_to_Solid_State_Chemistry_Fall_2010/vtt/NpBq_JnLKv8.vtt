00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.230
PROFESSOR: Hi, I'm Jocelyn, and
today we're going to go

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.940
over to the Exam 2 from Fall
2009, and Problem 4,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.300
Parts (a) and (b).

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.930
As always, we're going to start
by reading the question.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.560
Boron exists in the gas state
as the dimer of boron 2.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.550
Explain how the fact that B(2)
is paramagnetic, two unpaired

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.070
electrons, implies that, in
this molecule, the pi 2p

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.590
orbitals must lie at a lower
energy than do the sigma 2p.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.240
OK, so what is this question
actually asking you to do?

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:10.450
Well, it's asking you why the
energy of the pi 2p is less

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:19.530
than the energy of the sigma
2p, given that boron 2 is

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.780
paramagnetic.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.620
So the first thing we need to
know is what paramagnetic

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.580
means, and he actually gives
that to you in the problem, so

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.530
it means that you have two
unpaired electrons.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.760
So this is unpaired electrons.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.770
We are asked here then to give
a reason why the fact that

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.490
there are unpaired electrons
implies a certain ordering of

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.490
the sigma and pi 2p orbitals.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.940
So the first thing we want to
do, probably, is recognize

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.160
that these are molecular
orbitals, not atomic orbitals.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.200
Therefore, we probably want to
start by drawing the molecular

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.530
orbital diagram for boron.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.520
Now, how do we draw a molecular
orbital diagram.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.890
Well, the first thing
to do is to start

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.170
with the atomic orbitals.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:30.280
So boron has five electrons,
as we can find out from our

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:41.850
periodic table, and they occupy
the 1s, the 2s, and one

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.090
electron in the 2p.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.840
Again, if this seems unfamiliar
to you, you might

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.160
want to go back to earlier in
the course, where we went over

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.940
electron configuration.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.550
However, when we're looking
at molecular orbitals, we

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.240
actually only care about the
valence electrons, because

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.400
those are what are involved
in bonding.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.060
The core electrons are much,
much lower in energy, so they

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.180
aren't really involved
in the bonding.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.290
So we're actually only going
to look at the electrons in

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.260
the second energy level.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:26.090
So we have three valence
electrons per boron, and they

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.940
are in the 2s and 2p, which we
remember, there are three p

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.470
orbitals in each energy level.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.530
So now let's draw those in.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:49.450
We have 2s and 2p.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.930
Remember to always have a scale
here, and we're in an

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:03.780
energy space, and this is not
to scale, because we're just

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.590
looking at relative energies, we
don't care about the actual

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.540
difference in energy.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.650
And because we have
two borons--

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.580
so this is boron one--

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.700
I'm going to draw the same
thing over here.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.020
Make sure they're at the same
energy level because they are

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.250
the exact same atom,
and therefore,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.630
the same atomic orbitals.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.260
So this is, again, boron,
and we have three

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.190
electrons for each.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.360
We don't have to fill them in,
but I'm going to do so, just

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.610
to keep track.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.910
And again, we're filling
according to the orbital

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.620
filling rules gone over
earlier in the class.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.380
So now that we have our atomic
orbitals, we are going to

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.326
combine them to, like,
molecular orbitals.

00:05:05.326 --> 00:05:10.010
And we want to remember that s
orbitals combine to make a

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:18.420
sigma and a sigma bonding and
a sigma anti-bonding.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.570
Remember that whenever
you combine atomic

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.990
orbitals, you create--

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.940
if you're combining two atomic
orbitals, you create one of a

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.070
higher energy and one of a lower
energy, because the net

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.120
energy stays the same.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.470
Oh sorry, that's crooked.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.280
All right, now we'll move on
to the 2p, and because the

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.710
problem told us that we need to
explain why the pi bonding

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.060
orbitals are lower in energy
than the sigma bonding

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.340
orbitals, we're going to start
with that configuration.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.640
The actual order depends on the
molecule, and so without

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.410
any extra information, we
wouldn't really know if the

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.400
sigma was above or
below the pi.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:22.630
So as the question, kind of,
hints at: p orbitals make two

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:28.675
pi bonds and one sigma bond.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:39.700
This is due to the orientation
of the pi bonds, or the p

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.990
orbitals in space.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:53.010
Then, as always, we need to put
in the anti-bonding just

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.190
to make sure we keep track
of all of our orbitals.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:09.680
OK, so we combined one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.120
eight atomic orbitals, and we
made one, two, three, four,

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.440
five, six, seven, eight
molecular orbitals.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.800
We want to make sure we always
have the same number of

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.760
orbitals before and after.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.920
So now we can fill in the
electrons into the molecular

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.400
orbitals: that's these
in the middle here.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.950
And we use the same rules as
we do when we're filling

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.370
atomic orbitals.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:42.450
So we start at the lowest
energy, pairing spins, if we

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.810
only have one orbital in the
energy level; but as here, we

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.620
have degenerate orbitals,
so we can actually

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.090
have unpaired spins.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.070
So we have one, two, three,
four, five, six electrons, and

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:02.260
we have three from each boron
atom, and so, we have the same

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.210
number of electrons
in our molecule.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.500
Now that we have our molecular
orbital diagram, we can go

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.500
back to the actual question.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.800
Some students stopped here
and were like, I made the

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.420
molecular orbital diagram.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.260
I'm done.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:22.140
But we need to remember that the
question is asking us why

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.610
the configuration we drew makes
sense because of the

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.790
unpaired electrons.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.940
So if we go back to our
molecular orbital diagram, we

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:38.050
see that because the pi 2p have
two degenerate orbitals,

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.850
we can have unpaired
electrons.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:46.240
If we think about the sigma
being below, we would have

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.620
paired up those electrons, and
therefore, gotten 0 unpaired

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.870
electrons, and it would
not be paramagnetic.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.130
So let's just try that out.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.370
Move over here, and we're
going to draw just the

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:10.180
molecular orbitals; since we
already did the full process

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.660
of making them from
the atomic.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:19.330
So this is the sigma
2s, sigma star 2s.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:24.860
And now we're just looking at
what if the sigma 2p was lower

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:29.390
in energy than the pi 2p.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:43.330
And again, we would fill up our
orbitals, and we see that

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:48.250
because this lowest occupied
molecular orbital is

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:53.210
singularly degenerate, we pair
up our electrons, and so if

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.880
this were the case, boron would
not be paramagnetic.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.950
However, because it is
paramagnetic, we know that the

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.660
pi 2p is lower in energy
than the sigma 2p.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.610
So that's what this question
was asking, and if you said

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.740
all those things, great
job, and you answered

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.810
the question correctly.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.780
Now we're going to move on to
Part (b), and it's very

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:24.980
related to Part (a), so
we're going to use the

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.590
same diagrams here.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:32.540
So it asks, is the gas molecule
B(2) 2 minus more or

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.990
less stable than the gas
molecule to B(2).

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:37.610
Explain.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.560
So here he's asking about the
boron dimer that has a

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.620
negative 2 charge-- that is,
it has two extra electrons.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.610
So we're still talking about
boron; and thus the atomic

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:56.200
orbitals that we're combining
are exactly the same.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.720
I'll write that down.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:04.280
So we have we still have
the 2s and the 2p

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.530
from each of the boron.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:18.550
That's not the same energy
level, and they still make the

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:46.350
same molecular orbitals, but we
have two extra electrons.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:53.710
So when we go to fill up our
molecular orbitals, we now

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.135
have eight instead of six.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:08.340
So not only is the boron 2 minus
no longer paramagnetic,

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:13.050
because we don't have unpaired
electrons, but we also have a

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.600
difference in the bond order.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.850
So if you don't remember what
bonding order is, it is when--

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.100
I'll just put it here--

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:33.020
it's how we determine the
strength of the interaction

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.600
between the two atoms. And
because he's asking is the

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.310
boron 2 minus more or less
stable, we want to figure out

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.550
the strength of the interaction,
and that will

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.920
tell us which is more stable.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:55.040
So the bond order is the bonding
electrons minus the

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:05.290
anti-bonding divided by 2.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:09.470
Sorry that's a little messy, but
I hope you get the idea.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:15.640
So for boron 2 minus, which
we're talking about over here,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:26.550
the bonding order: we have
two, four, six bonding

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:30.780
electrons, electrons in
bonding orbitals.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.430
And we have two in anti-bonding
orbitals, divided

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:39.780
by 2 and that gives us
a bonding order of 2.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.970
So that's equivalent to saying
there's a double bond between

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.132
the boron 2 minus, the two
borons in that molecule.

00:13:47.132 --> 00:13:54.030
So let's move back to our
diagram for the neutral boron

00:13:54.030 --> 00:14:13.210
dimer, and we have two, three,
four bonding, and two

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:21.690
anti-bonding, and so
that equals 1.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:28.470
So in the neutral dimer, we have
a bonding order of 1, and

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:34.330
in the charged 2 minus dimer, we
have a bonding order of 2.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:39.010
From this, we can see that the
2 minus has more bonding

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.250
interaction, and so, it
will be more stable.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.600
So again, you can't just put
that it's more stable, we need

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.040
to have an explanation for
why, and this is a way to

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.700
explain that.
