00:00:02.106 --> 00:00:04.016
&gt;&gt;Narrator, old footage: How
will today's children function

00:00:04.156 --> 00:00:05.116
in a dangerous world?

00:00:06.046 --> 00:00:08.746
What means will they
use to carve the future?

00:00:08.746 --> 00:00:14.116
Will they be equipped to find the
answers to tomorrow's problems?

00:00:15.436 --> 00:00:17.446
&gt;&gt;Teacher: When you think about
traditional learning you think

00:00:17.446 --> 00:00:19.786
of a student sitting in a
classroom and being talked at.

00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:22.676
&gt;&gt;Teacher, old footage: Now I imagine
a lot of you are still thinking...

00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:24.256
&gt;&gt;Teacher: They are
supposed to be a sponge.

00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:26.636
The teacher tells them
information and they suck it up.

00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:31.116
That's not the real world.

00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:36.136
Having them actively engaged learning
about things in their community

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:39.956
and doing projects that they care
about is giving them that ownership

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:42.996
of their learning, it's making
them life-long learners,

00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:46.626
it's giving them the critical
thinking and problem-solving skills

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.576
that they need as soon as they walk

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:50.136
out of your classroom
into the real world.

00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:01.516
&gt;&gt;Peggy Ertmer: So there are a lot
of different ways to approach PBL,

00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:03.946
a lot of different ways to
implement it, but really it all boils

00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:07.766
down to five essential
keys: real-world connection,

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:11.406
core to learning, structured
collaboration, student driven,

00:01:11.646 --> 00:01:13.276
and multifaceted assessment.

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:18.076
The first key component of
PBL is real-world connections,

00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:23.546
and really what this entails
is having an authentic problem

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.616
that drives the curriculum.

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:29.456
So students are given this question,
for example, "What's in our water

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:30.296
and how did it get there?"

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:32.786
And then the students
choose different paths

00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:34.396
to explore that question.

00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:37.536
&gt;&gt;Student: One of the problems in the
ocean is that with the higher amount

00:01:37.536 --> 00:01:41.296
of CO2 calcifying organisms are
decreasing and we're testing

00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:47.176
to see how well life in the ocean
lives without calcifying organisms.

00:01:47.176 --> 00:01:50.416
&gt;&gt;Tom Duenwald: When the students
know that what they're doing

00:01:50.416 --> 00:01:54.236
in the classroom has an audience
outside the classroom it really helps

00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:58.286
them deepen their thinking on it
and I think that is pretty authentic

00:01:58.286 --> 00:02:01.166
in terms of what the
future work world holds.

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:02.146
&gt;&gt;Student: -- four by eight feet.

00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:06.986
&gt;&gt;Peggy Ertmer: So the second
commonality is the PBL unit provides

00:02:06.986 --> 00:02:07.996
academic rigor.

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:12.176
This is not something that teachers
would add at the end of a unit

00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:15.356
because they learned all the content
they're supposed to learn already

00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:18.286
and so this, you know, the fluff
that they can do at the end.

00:02:18.286 --> 00:02:21.546
This is the unit, this is the
way that they learn the content.

00:02:21.546 --> 00:02:24.276
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So what's your
standards you're gonna be covering?

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:27.866
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're gonna do 5a,
which is analyzing scenes,

00:02:27.866 --> 00:02:29.596
and this is huge in this book.

00:02:29.596 --> 00:02:30.676
&gt;&gt;Steven Zipkes: When you can show

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:33.596
that you're incorporating the
standards built in these projects

00:02:34.096 --> 00:02:36.176
that aren't fluff a lot
of eyes and ears open,

00:02:36.536 --> 00:02:38.146
because people are hungry for that.

00:02:38.356 --> 00:02:42.186
&gt;&gt;Peggy Ertmer: Structured
collaboration refers

00:02:42.186 --> 00:02:44.436
to allowing the students
to work together,

00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:46.856
but giving them a structure
within which to work.

00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:52.146
&gt;&gt;David: Our project was to
create a aquaponics system

00:02:52.216 --> 00:02:53.756
and we had several
people working on it.

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:55.416
In my case I was kind
of the team leader.

00:02:55.786 --> 00:02:58.586
Two members of my group, who were
kind of just like the thinkers

00:02:58.586 --> 00:03:00.736
that would think, "What
if we could include this?"

00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:02.756
And once those two
came up with the ideas,

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:06.726
it would go through another person
who was kind of like the designer

00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:08.226
to figure out, "Oh,
how would we make it?"

00:03:08.226 --> 00:03:10.066
And then it would kind
of go up to me and say--

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:13.096
and I would kinda be
like the final decider--

00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:15.196
&gt;&gt;Sheela Webster: We would
never put four kids together

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:18.326
at a table and say, "Here's a task.

00:03:19.226 --> 00:03:21.266
Get it done during this time period."

00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:23.756
It's very carefully scaffolded.

00:03:30.286 --> 00:03:32.046
&gt;&gt;Peggy Ertmer: There's an
interesting shift in roles

00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:33.496
that happens in a PBL unit.

00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:36.076
The teacher becomes
more of a facilitator

00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:38.726
and the students take more control.

00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:40.406
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You guys are
the Red Cross responders.

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:42.476
You already looked
at news broadcasts.

00:03:42.636 --> 00:03:42.756
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:43.886
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And you
took down some notices.

00:03:43.886 --> 00:03:47.186
You need to take all of this and
you need to bring it together.

00:03:47.186 --> 00:03:50.426
&gt;&gt;Student: So I have to write down
the aspects of the news broadcast?

00:03:50.726 --> 00:03:51.556
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You got it.

00:03:51.556 --> 00:03:53.126
Exactly. So Kassim's got it.

00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:55.156
Kassim can give you some
ideas on how to start.

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:56.956
&gt;&gt;Peggy Ertmer: But as the
facilitator the teacher needs

00:03:56.956 --> 00:03:59.376
to be able to ask good questions.

00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:03.676
She needs to re-direct if necessary,
you know, give hints but not answers.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:07.996
And that's really an interesting
role for teachers to learn how to do.

00:04:10.706 --> 00:04:12.676
Multifaceted assessment refers

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:17.516
to assessment being integrated
throughout the entire PBL unit.

00:04:18.336 --> 00:04:21.086
&gt;&gt;Lisa Zeller: I do a lot
of formative assessments.

00:04:21.316 --> 00:04:24.396
It's not a test at the end of
the week or the end of the unit.

00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:28.046
You're doing a lot of small
check-ins with the students to see

00:04:28.046 --> 00:04:30.446
where they're at and to see
that they're growing along.

00:04:30.646 --> 00:04:32.566
I think it's really
important to also make sure

00:04:32.566 --> 00:04:34.526
that the students are
assessing themselves.

00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:38.616
&gt;&gt;Sheela Webster: It's a
process that we are really trying

00:04:38.616 --> 00:04:42.656
to bring back again to the
student so that kids are part

00:04:42.656 --> 00:04:45.776
of the assessment process and that
assessment is just not being done

00:04:45.776 --> 00:04:45.976
to them.

00:05:05.046 --> 00:05:07.296
&gt;&gt;Peggy Ertmer: -- are students who
would blossom under this approach.

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:10.836
They learn that they have voice and
choice and teachers would probably

00:05:10.836 --> 00:05:13.436
in the end find it
easier and more fulfilling

00:05:13.436 --> 00:05:15.406
and we would probably have
a whole lot less burnout.

00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:18.026
I mean this is really an
exciting way of teaching.

00:05:18.696 --> 00:05:19.716
&gt;&gt;Steven Zipkes: What we've done

00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:23.266
for the last hundred years direct
teaching for some students it works,

00:05:23.266 --> 00:05:24.756
but for most students it doesn't.

00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:28.346
So for us project-based
instruction is a way

00:05:28.346 --> 00:05:31.346
that we can reach all
students and get them engaged.

00:05:32.656 --> 00:05:34.346
&gt;&gt;Student: Right now my
favorite project is called

00:05:34.346 --> 00:05:35.426
"Create Your Own Project".

00:05:35.426 --> 00:05:38.206
&gt;&gt;My favorite project this year
was in chemistry and what it was

00:05:38.206 --> 00:05:42.156
about we were using chemistry
and reactions to create a soda.

00:05:42.156 --> 00:05:45.756
&gt;&gt;It's a video production class
and we're making a kids' show.

00:05:45.756 --> 00:05:47.056
We're calling it "The Dojo Show".

00:05:47.216 --> 00:05:49.196
&gt;&gt;We're learning about
spatial diffusion,

00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:50.926
Black Death, the Columbian exchange--

00:05:51.036 --> 00:05:54.006
&gt;&gt;Reactions like double replacement,
combustion, things like that.

00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:58.086
&gt;&gt;We're basically the teachers in
this so we're gonna create a rubric,

00:05:58.086 --> 00:06:01.326
our group contracts, and we're gonna
launch this project to our class.

00:06:01.456 --> 00:06:03.106
&gt;&gt;We're learning how to collaborate

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:05.796
and also work towards
a creative goal.

00:06:05.796 --> 00:06:08.646
It helps us get into
that creative mindset

00:06:08.646 --> 00:06:12.616
that really is something that's hard
to find in any other high school.
