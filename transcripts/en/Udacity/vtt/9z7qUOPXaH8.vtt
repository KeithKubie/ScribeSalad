00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.733
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, why the mood of out of proportion when conditions are table? Consider

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:07.427
this problem. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; We're going to keep our ratio with the number of dimes to the

00:00:07.427 --> 00:00:10.880
number of quarter's the same. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; How many dimes are there if there are 231

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.653
quarters? Now here, I wouldn't want to list out a long table of numbers, that

00:00:14.653 --> 00:00:18.382
would take too much time. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Instead, I could set up a proportion and solve. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;

00:00:18.382 --> 00:00:23.381
You try setting up a proportion and solving. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Put your final answer here.
