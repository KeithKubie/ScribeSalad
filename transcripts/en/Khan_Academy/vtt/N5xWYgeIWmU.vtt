00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.194
- [Instructor] What we're
gonna do in this video

00:00:01.194 --> 00:00:04.894
is begin to practice subtracting decimals.

00:00:04.894 --> 00:00:06.482
And we're gonna build up slowly,

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:07.727
and in future videos we're gonna learn

00:00:07.727 --> 00:00:10.040
to do this faster and faster and doing it

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.792
for more and more complex situations.

00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:16.658
So let's say we have 3/10 minus 2/10.

00:00:16.658 --> 00:00:18.741
What is this going to be?

00:00:19.624 --> 00:00:21.673
Well there's a bunch of
ways you could tackle it,

00:00:21.673 --> 00:00:23.212
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:24.295
and try to do it on your own

00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:26.965
before I work through it with you.

00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:30.566
But I'm assuming you did
that, so let's do it together.

00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.968
You could view this as 3/10,

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:38.175
and then we're going to take away 2/10.

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:41.119
If I have three of something
and I take away two of them,

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:42.824
well what am I gonna be left with?

00:00:42.824 --> 00:00:45.647
Well I'm going to be left with one,

00:00:45.647 --> 00:00:47.585
I'm going to be left with 1/10.

00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:49.871
And we can visualize this.

00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:52.293
Let me put a whole there,

00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:54.818
and this whole is divided into tenths,

00:00:54.818 --> 00:00:57.460
and we see that three of the
tenths are already highlighted.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.536
So these three green bars
you can visualize as 3/10.

00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:04.036
Now we want to take away 2.10.

00:01:05.024 --> 00:01:09.191
We want to take away,
we're gonna take away 1/10,

00:01:10.702 --> 00:01:13.591
and then we take away 2/10.

00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:16.807
And so what are we left with?

00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:21.691
Well we're going to be left
with this 1/10 right over here.

00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:25.858
That's the only tenth that
is left of these 3/10.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.031
Now let's build on that idea

00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:32.531
and try to tackle more complex situations.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.823
Let me delete this and this,

00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:40.585
and let's say we want to tackle 1.5,

00:01:42.332 --> 00:01:44.683
or one and 5/10,

00:01:44.683 --> 00:01:47.850
and from that we want to subtract 0.7,

00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:51.524
or 7/10.

00:01:51.524 --> 00:01:55.691
Pause the video and see if
you can figure this out.

00:01:58.038 --> 00:02:00.193
There's a couple of ways
you could think about this,

00:02:00.193 --> 00:02:02.748
and I'll tell you the way
that I do it in my head.

00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:05.351
You could view this as,
so let me rewrite this.

00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:09.812
You could view this as one plus 5/10,

00:02:09.812 --> 00:02:14.696
must 7/10, minus let me do
it in that same blue color.

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:16.529
Minus 7/10.

00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:21.047
And so there's a couple of
ways that you could view it.

00:02:21.047 --> 00:02:23.369
You could view this as 10/10.

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:28.042
One whole is 10/10, so this is 10/10

00:02:28.042 --> 00:02:29.792
plus 5/10,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.821
minus 7/10.

00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:35.654
Minus 7/10.

00:02:37.618 --> 00:02:41.080
And so you could say this is 15/10.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.106
If you're doing it in your head

00:02:42.106 --> 00:02:43.384
you might get to this faster.

00:02:43.384 --> 00:02:45.625
You might say hey, 1.5, one and 5/10

00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:50.072
is the same thing as 15/10, minus 7/10.

00:02:50.072 --> 00:02:52.434
Minus 7/10.

00:02:52.434 --> 00:02:54.826
So 15 of something minus seven of it,

00:02:54.826 --> 00:02:57.177
well 15 minus seven is going to be eight.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:01.403
So this is going to be equal to 8/10.

00:03:01.403 --> 00:03:03.000
The way I just did it I
just thought of everything

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.015
in terms of tenths.

00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:06.941
Instead of thinking of it in one and 5/10,

00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:10.865
you could view this as if
you could somehow put a 15

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:15.219
in the tenth's place, and
instead call this zero ones,

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.911
and 15/10, and then you subtract 7/10

00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:23.137
from those 15/10 to get the 8/10,

00:03:23.137 --> 00:03:26.387
which would be 0.8, or 8/10.

00:03:27.955 --> 00:03:30.074
Now another way that you
could've thought about it,

00:03:30.074 --> 00:03:32.518
let's go back to this
step right over here,

00:03:32.518 --> 00:03:34.425
I could've said well look.

00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:38.906
I can think about what one
minus 7/10 is going to be.

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:43.102
I could view this as one minus 7/10,

00:03:43.102 --> 00:03:47.782
and then I'm going to add 5/10 to that.

00:03:47.782 --> 00:03:50.052
Then I'm going to add 5/10 to that.

00:03:50.052 --> 00:03:54.133
One minus 7/10, one is 10/10.

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:58.295
If I take 7 of them away,
I'm gonna be left with 3/10.

00:03:58.295 --> 00:04:02.399
So you could say that's
going to be 3/10 plus 5/10.

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:04.046
Plus 5/10.

00:04:04.046 --> 00:04:08.477
Which is once again, it is equal to 8/10.

00:04:08.477 --> 00:04:10.618
Now another way that
you could tackle this,

00:04:10.618 --> 00:04:12.697
and once again, I'm showing
as many ways as possible

00:04:12.697 --> 00:04:15.250
just so you appreciate that
these are just different ways

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.668
of tackling the same idea.

00:04:16.668 --> 00:04:19.168
Let's draw a number line here.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.903
Let's say this is zero,
and then one, two, three,

00:04:24.903 --> 00:04:28.666
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:30.078
That is one.

00:04:30.078 --> 00:04:32.990
One, two, three, four, five.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.990
That is 1.5.

00:04:35.044 --> 00:04:38.565
We're gonna start at 1.5 right over here.

00:04:38.565 --> 00:04:39.482
That's 1.5.

00:04:40.364 --> 00:04:43.186
We're gonna take away 7/10.

00:04:43.186 --> 00:04:46.046
So one way that you might
do it is you say okay,

00:04:46.046 --> 00:04:50.213
we could take away, we
could take away 5/10,

00:04:51.474 --> 00:04:52.830
which would take us to one,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.308
and then we have to take
two more tenths away,

00:04:55.308 --> 00:05:00.182
which is gonna take us to 8/10, or 0.8.

00:05:00.182 --> 00:05:02.004
So the way that I just
thought about it just now

00:05:02.004 --> 00:05:03.669
is I said hey, this is the same thing

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.086
as 1.5 minus 5/10.

00:05:08.587 --> 00:05:10.989
Minus 5/10.

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:12.782
Minus 2/10.

00:05:12.782 --> 00:05:15.268
The reason why I broke
it up like this is look,

00:05:15.268 --> 00:05:19.100
okay 1.5, or one and 5/10 minus 5/10,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.979
that's pretty straightforward to compute.

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.442
You could say that right over there

00:05:23.442 --> 00:05:25.048
is just going to be one.

00:05:25.048 --> 00:05:27.041
I'm taking away the 5/10.

00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:29.877
And then I have 2/10
leftover to take away.

00:05:29.877 --> 00:05:34.336
One minus these 2/10, and once again,

00:05:34.336 --> 00:05:36.902
you are left with 8/10.

00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:39.800
These are all perfectly legitimate ways

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.710
to tackle this problem.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.618
And this is a way that many
people, including myself,

00:05:44.618 --> 00:05:46.879
would try to do it in their head.
