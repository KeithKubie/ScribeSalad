[APPLAUSE]

00:03:44.278 --> 00:03:45.528
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Thank you.

00:03:50.242 --> 00:03:52.280
Thank you.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.231
This next song that I'd like
to perform for you is-- you

00:03:55.231 --> 00:04:01.250
know, one of the cool things
about playing the ukulele is

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.010
that you have a very
limited range.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.140
And you have just basically
four strings to work with.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.550
And I kind of talked about this
the last time I was here.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.590
I said that you only
have four strings.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.440
And sometimes, it can appear
to be very limiting.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.710
Because you think, oh,
on the ukulele, I

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.451
only have four strings.

00:04:23.451 --> 00:04:25.920
But on the guitar, a guitar has
six strings and you can

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.080
get a much fuller sound
and a bigger sound.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.940
And you always want more and
more and more and more.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.060
So I wrote this song recently.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.450
Because I've been trying
to compose more.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.830
And I always try to come up
with a concept or an idea,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.640
whenever I'm writing
a new piece.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.800
So this idea, though, came
about by accident.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.050
See, I was changing my ukulele
strings one day.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.040
And I put the first string on.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.290
[PLUCKS STRING]

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.190
And then I put the
second string on.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.410
[PLUCKS STRING]

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.280
And then, I was going to put
the third string on, but I

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.785
couldn't find that string.

00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:58.570
So I was like, where did
I put my third string?

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:59.710
So I grabbed the
fourth string.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.875
I put the fourth string on.

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:01.170
[PLUCKS STRING]

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.790
And instead of rushing off to
look for another third string,

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.950
I thought to myself, wouldn't
it be cool to write a song

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.690
with just three strings?

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:16.340
So this is a song called
"Missing Three."

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.320
And it's a piece that just
uses three strings.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.990
That's it.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.920
And I thought it was
kind of cool.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.220
Because on the ukulele,
you always want more.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.750
You always think you
need more strings.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.200
You need a greater range.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.240
So this is a song called
"Missing Three" that kind of

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.420
proves that you don't
always need more.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.290
Sometimes less truly is more.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.560
And if you know what you're
going for, if you know what

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.190
you want to say or what you're
trying to communicate, then

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.110
sometimes you can just
do it with three

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.270
strings, rather than four.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:51.614
So here's a song called
"Missing Three."

00:05:51.614 --> 00:05:52.864

00:08:49.308 --> 00:08:51.718
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Thank
you very much.

00:08:51.718 --> 00:08:53.670
Thank you.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.006
A song entitled "Missing
Three."

00:08:58.006 --> 00:09:00.900
A couple other things happened
to me since the

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.130
last time I was here.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:08.500
Shortly after I was here at
Google, I got married.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.650
So that was pretty cool.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:16.200
And seven weeks ago, my wife
and I had our first baby.

00:09:19.469 --> 00:09:21.600
I know, I'm a dad.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.420
That's kind of a scary
thought, right?

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.830
But it's the most
amazing thing.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:31.440
Because I'm kind of at that age
where a lot of my friends

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.070
have children.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.630
And a lot of them, they're on
their second child already.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.860
But I remember when they first
had their baby, they would

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.230
always send me photos.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.190
Or they on their phones, they'd
show me pictures.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.500
And then I'm just like,
oh yeah, cute.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.850
But on the inside I'm like,
I don't want to see this.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.660
Why are you showing me this?

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.440
But it's amazing.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.110
It's so different when
it's your own child.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.150
When it's your own child, you're
just like, oh my god.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.910
Every little thing that they
do, it's the cutest, most

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.280
adorable thing.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.090
And it's so funny because
now, I'll

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.340
send pictures to everyone.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.550
But it's really the most
amazing thing.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:19.470
And so this next song,
I wrote it actually--

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.860
maybe when my wife was about
six months pregnant.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.430
I wrote this song
for the baby.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.760
And it's a song I call
"Gentlemandolin." And like I

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.280
was explaining before, that when
I write a piece, I always

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:39.300
like to have some concept,
something that is different

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.950
from anything else that I've
done before in the past.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:46.020
And the way this song came about
was, I love the sound of

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.430
the mandolin.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.420
The mandolin is actually
tuned like a violin.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.320
So it has a wide range.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.200
It has over a three-octave
range, whereas the ukulele

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.970
only has a two-octave range.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.410
So you can get these beautiful,
lush chords on the

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.950
mandolin that are
very difficult

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.220
to get on the ukulele.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:13.600
So I came across this chord
voicing that to me, in my

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.930
mind, kind of mimics the voicing
of a mandolin player.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.260
And it sounds like this.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.570
It's a really far stretch
like this, but you get

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.290
this kind of sound.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.675
[STRUMMING CHORDS]

00:11:25.675 --> 00:11:26.940
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: It doesn't
sound like a ukulele.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.800
It sounds more like
a mandolin.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.670
So I wrote this song.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.150
And I used that idea for
this tune for my son.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.930
And I call it "Gentlemandolin."
And the

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.620
title came about because I was
thinking that I hope one day

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.100
when my son grows up, he'll
grow up to be a fine

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.410

Man.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.580
I get my inspiration from
a lot of things.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.810
I'm sure it's the same
for all of you.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.680
All of you here, you're
all artists.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.230

think of the next thing and

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.800
what's going to be that
next big idea.

I get a lot of my

inspiration from the most
unusual things.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:52.710
I just did a short interview
out here for that video.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.600
I think it's called
"My Favorite

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.456

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:05.640
that I talked about was one of
my favorite performances ever

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.790
was a performance
of Bill Cosby.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.240
Bill Cosby, a long time ago, he
did this HBO special, this

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.410
stand-up comedy special, called
"Bill Cosby, Himself."

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.420
And it was the most--

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:23.690
I think till this day, of all
the comedians out there, this

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:29.890
performance is still like the
bible of stand-up comedy.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.710
And if you haven't seen
it, you really

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.230
should check it out.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.600
You guys have it in
your archive.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.660
So you should definitely
check it out.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.640
But if you can get the actual
DVD of the entire performance,

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.840
it is truly amazing.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.530
It's almost two hours long.

in a chair.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.320
Not even a high chair,
a regular--

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.950
like a chair that you're
sitting in.

chair, holding a microphone,

for me, that was very

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:07.580
significant.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:12.680
Because when I first started out
playing the ukulele, I was

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.260
always playing with a singer.

There was always a singer.

JAKE SHIMABUKURO: --and then
they're singing again.

So that was kind of my job.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.950
And the reason for
that is because I

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.470
am a terrible singer.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.130
I can't sing to save my life.

So after a while, when I stopped
working with singers,

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.370
I thought--

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.840
I had this little band
in high school.

oh, no, that's the

end for me.

my ukulele and playing.

ukulele by itself, it just

sounds so empty.

to a concert.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.240
But I couldn't get that
with this instrument.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.340
But when I saw "Bill Cosby,
Himself," when I saw him-- and

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:49.000
I saw a man just come up on
stage in front of thousands of

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.890
people, sit in a chair
with a microphone.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.760
And he could just connect
with every single

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.560
person in the room.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.570
And I was watching this
on television.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.160
And I still felt like
I was there.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.960
I felt like every story he was
telling, he was looking right

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.380
at me and telling this.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.610
Like I was sitting down in his
living room and he was just

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:13.160
sharing this amazing
story with me.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.990
And I was so inspired by that.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.690
Because then I realized,
you know what?

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.700
The instrument that we hold
is just an illusion.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.160
Guitar players-- like if you
watch Jimi Hendrix, yeah, he's

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.090
playing the guitar.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.460
But the guitar is just
an illusion.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.786
His artistry, his music,
he's communicating--

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.450
it's his whole--

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.670
before you even hear
his guitar,

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:40.920
you're hearing his spirit.

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.870
He's communicating this thing.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.000
Like one of the things that I
believe is all the music that

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.130
you play and you hear happens.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.260
It's created and happens before
it even gets to your

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.210
instrument.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.690
Before I play that chord,
I need to create

00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:59.960
it inside of me.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.960
I need to feel it and just
create it first.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.710
And then, then I can
play that chord.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.830
Or before I bend that note--

[PLAYING MUSIC, GUITAR-SOLO

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:16.580
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: --I need to
create it inside of me, before

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.970
it even gets to the
instrument.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.400
So I used to watch him.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.790
And I used to watch
him all the time.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.470
I watched that performance
over and over.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.080
And he's just so natural.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:32.330
And the title of that tour was
"Bill Cosby, Himself." And I

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.890
realized that that's
all you got to be.

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.600
It doesn't matter if you're
talking to one

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.530
person or 1,000 people.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.070
The more you're comfortable with
who you are, if you can

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.100
just get up in front of--
and not be afraid

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.370
to make fun of yourself.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:53.540
And not to have expectations
of the audience, I

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.790
think, is a big key.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.825
And that's the cool thing about
being a ukulele player,

00:21:56.825 --> 00:22:01.530
is that audiences have such low
expectations of me anyway.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.760
So if I don't have any
expectations of my audience, I

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.650
can simply get up on stage
and just do my thing.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:10.500
And I don't have to worry
about anything.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.165
If someone laughs, if they stay,
then that's all a bonus.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:22.190
So I was telling that story
because I was trying to relate

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.040
that to a song.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.860
Yeah, yeah, so.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.290
What song was I going
to play now?

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:31.720
I don't remember.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:37.250
But anyway, that's kind
of where a lot of my

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:38.810
inspiration came from.

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.330
It's not so much about
playing the ukulele.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.240
But it's just about
communicating with people.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.930
And that's what all of you do.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.360
Through Google, through YouTube,
you're providing a

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.690
vehicle for people to
communicate from one side of

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.630
our planet all the way
to the other side.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.300
And it makes the planet
seem so much smaller.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.540
It makes our world seem
so much smaller.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.000
And I think that's
a great thing.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.310
Because I grew up in
Hawaii, where we

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.490
live on a small island.

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.060
And everyone's so
community-minded.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.570
We're always thinking about
the other person.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:19.090
And we all see how we're related
and what I do affects

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:20.330
this other person.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.860
What that person does affects
the other person.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.690
And I think it's such a great
way to look at the world now,

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.020
is that we are all connected.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.560
We're all connected.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.710
And I think through music and
through what you do, I think

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.430
it's the perfect example.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:41.360
Because to me, music is not just
a universal language, but

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.690
it's the language
of the universe.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.820
And you're helping to
spread that language

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.100
all across the world.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.600
And it's a beautiful thing.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:55.050
So I'm going to play
one more song here.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:59.840
And they've asked me to try to
play more original stuff just

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.900
because of copyright issues
and all of that.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:10.780
But I did want to play this one
piece because this is the

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:11.620
reason I'm here.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.570
And this is what started
it all for me.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:19.160
And it was a simple four-minute
video clip that

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.420
happened to show up on
the internet one day.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.750
And it was for a television show
that I had done in New

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.130
York called "Ukulele Disco."

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.450
And I think I told this
story the last time.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:33.370
But since then, I've made some
changes to the song.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:34.920
So I thought I'd
play it again.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.320

I know that he was an ambassador
of the ukulele.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.520
George was famous for riding
around in a car full of them

Harrison was one of my heroes.

wish George was still alive

this instrument so much.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.990
If I had to do that on a
trumpet, it would take me like

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:56.630
two months before I could
even get a decent sound.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:59.420
Or a violin, it takes you two
months before you can even

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.830
hold the bow without cramping.

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:04.040
So it's that instant
gratification.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.732
And I think that when people
pick it up for the first time

00:36:06.732 --> 00:36:09.040
and they play it, they're like,
wow, I can do this.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.290
I can make music.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:15.130
And to me, that's the joy
that music should bring.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:17.840
That joy, everyone should feel
that joy when they're playing

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.480
the piano for the first time,
when they're playing the

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.670
violin for the first time.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:22.380
When they're playing the
saxophone for the first time,

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.790
when they're playing the guitar
for the first time.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:27.070
If everyone could feel that joy,
I think there would be a

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:28.350
lot more people playing
instruments.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.490
AUDIENCE: Well, I had a question
for you, Jake.

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:35.540
I was at the screening
of the documentary.

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.000
Congratulations on that.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.180
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Oh,
thank you very much.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.370
AUDIENCE: That was
pretty amazing.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.330
One thing that really came
through in the documentary is

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.920
how much of a family affair
your music is.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.790
And so I wanted to see if you
could tell us a little bit

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:45.850
more about that.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:50.130
And maybe let us know if that
Shimabukuro family concert at

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:53.040
that screening is going
to be available later.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.760
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Oh, well, the
documentary that Cliff's

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.060
talking about is, I just
recently did my first

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.980
full-length documentary
with PBS.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.570
And we've been shooting it for
a little over two years now.

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:09.740
And we just wrapped it up
last week Wednesday.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:13.000
And it's going to
be premiering at

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.210
some of the film festivals.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.570
And it's also going to broadcast
on PBS national TV

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:20.000
sometime early next year.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.360
So I'm very excited
about this.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:29.530
Because it was pretty amazing
just for me to kind of sit--

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:32.950
and I don't like to see myself
on television or anything.

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:39.165
But just being able to sit there
and see the last like 30

00:37:39.165 --> 00:37:42.690
years of my life just
kind of go by.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:46.580
And it really took me back to
why I fell in love with this

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.670
instrument, how I got into it.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:51.170
I started playing at
the age of four.

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.710
And I got into it because
my mom played.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:54.320
She played.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.380
And the first thing she taught
me was my C chord.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.910
And I would just do
this all day.

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:04.540
And I loved it.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.590
I did that every day.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.080
I'd come home from school,
pick up my

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.390
ukulele, and just play.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:11.880
And my mom loved it.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.300
My family, they love music.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:18.960
And I also have a younger
brother who plays, too.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.590
And when we were kids, that's
what we'd do together.

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.680
We'd always play the
ukulele together.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.650
My brother was really
good at sports.

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:27.370
And I mean, he was very
well rounded.

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:29.890
Like for me, the only thing I
could do was play the ukulele.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:33.660
Like till this day, I can't
dribble and do a layup.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.140
I mean, I'm horrible.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:42.110
But there was something about
music that I could just sit

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:45.840
down for hours at a time and
just play and discover new

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.420
chords and new sounds.

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:50.340
So that really kept our
family together.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.960
My dad played a little
bit of guitar.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.120
But they weren't professional
musicians or anything.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.140
But there was always music
playing in the house.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:03.170
So I think in the documentary,
it kind of

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:05.070
talks about my parents.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:06.720
They divorced and all that.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:11.100
And so music kind
of became my--

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.450
because my mom was
my first teacher.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:15.130
And she would spend a lot of
time, when I was a kid,

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:15.960
teaching me.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.210
So I think once my parents got
the divorce and my mom had to

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:21.220
work all the time--

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.230
my brother and I, we're
five years apart.

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:24.440
So I would always stay home.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.540
And I would always have
to watch him.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:30.770
I always felt like he was more
like my son than my brother.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:34.020
And so I think playing the
ukulele for me was--

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.230
in my mind, now looking
back at everything--

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:40.850
was kind of like that was me
trying to make up for those

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:43.600
lost times of spending with
my mom or my family.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.080
It kind of took me back.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.190
So I guess that's where my
passion, I guess, comes from

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.680
for this instrument.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:59.000
And even though I'm away from
home a lot of times, having

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.990
the ukulele with me and being
able to play and share all of

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:07.180
these things, I think I
always feel like I'm

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.806
right back with them.

00:40:09.806 --> 00:40:11.166
Thank you.

00:40:11.166 --> 00:40:13.940
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
if you had any plans or

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.610
expectations on teaching
your baby the ukulele.

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:19.990
And if so, at what age you're
planning on introducing it?

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:22.560
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Well, I have
no expectations right now.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.970
I mean, I want him to do
whatever he wants to do.

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:28.900
But I definitely want
him to have music.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:36.220
And it's funny because on my
new album, the song that I

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:39.040
wrote for him is called
"Gentlemandolin." And it's the

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.870
third song on the album.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:47.840
And it's funny because recently,
while I was on tour,

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:51.420
my wife discovered that when
he's crying, if she puts the

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.720
CD on, he immediately stops.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.180
And she says, it's amazing.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.890
So she said, she
puts the CD on.

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.910
And as soon as she puts it on,
the first song starts.

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:06.010
And she said he just kind
of stops and he

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.050
just kind of listens.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:09.840
And he becomes super mellow.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.820
Then the second song comes on.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:14.300
And it's actually a cover of
Adele's "Rolling in the Deep,"

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.780
and he listens through that.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:18.080
And then she said the third song
comes on, which is the

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.260
song I wrote for him.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.770
As soon as that song starts,
he starts, [WAILING]

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:26.050
like starts crying.

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.950
She says it's unbelievable--

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:30.390
every single time.

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:33.250
She said, he just doesn't
like that song.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:35.810
So I don't know.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.200
But anyways, so I probably
won't be

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.160
teaching him that song.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.160
Yeah, but I definitely want
to get him into music.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:42.940
Yeah, for sure.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.420
Thank you.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:44.860
Thank you very much.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.680
MALE SPEAKER: You were talking
a little earlier about just

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.680
kind of growing up with
a ukulele and

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.100
playing it for so long.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.330
But it's an instrument I've
heard my entire life.

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:58.470
And I've never heard it
played the way you do,

00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:59.500
until you came along.

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.400
So what happened in your life
when you were playing?

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:08.110
When did it start transpiring,
you started learning new

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:10.450
things and started bringing
things out of the instrument

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:13.430
that other people didn't see?

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.520
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: I think for
me I started out playing all

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.000
traditional Hawaiian music.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.570
But then I think there came a
time, I think when I was just

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:28.260
in my early teenage years,
when I saw my

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:32.720
first Van Halen concert.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.510
And it wasn't so much that I
wanted to play all those fancy

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:38.360
guitar riffs or anything
like that.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.140
But it was more about
the energy.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:44.660
When I see rock bands play,
I admire their energy.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:47.910
It's not necessarily I want to
play that kind of music or I

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:49.050
want to play that song
or anything.

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:52.430
But I want to play with
that kind of energy.

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:56.610
And so whether I'm playing
a Hawaiian tune or a jazz

00:42:56.610 --> 00:43:01.950
standard or a classical piece or
a pop tune, or even if I'm

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:04.990
covering a rock song, I
want to play with that

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:06.470
energy all the time.

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:11.780
And it's not always the physical
kind of energy or the

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:15.320
kind of energy that you can see
visually, like just the

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.700
running and jumping on stage,
jumping around and all that.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.720
I mean, that's great too.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.700
I like that, when I'm like--

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:24.410
[PLAYING MUSIC]

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:27.140
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: I like to kind
of move with the music.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:31.990
But it's also the other kind
of energy, the energy that

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:37.320
comes from within, that focus,
that mental focus.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:42.280
I'm always talking about like
when I would do workshops.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:46.110
And I would talk with kids and
performers about when you're

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:47.990
playing your instrument, it
doesn't matter what instrument

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:49.040
you're playing.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.090
Like when I'm playing the
ukulele and I'm going to play

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:55.760
a chord, it's not just
the mechanics.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:00.680
It's not just about my finger
and my hand, my fingers

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.860
holding down the right strings
and my hand just doing this.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:04.780
It's not about that.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:08.180
But there's so much that
happens before

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.140
and after the stroke.

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.510
So there's a lot
of preparation.

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:16.990
And I always kind of compare
it to a pitcher.

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:19.860
You know, when you watch a
really good baseball pitcher,

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:20.910
the windup--

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:25.140
I mean everything, the follow
through, the focus, the

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:29.470
visualizing of how the ball
is going to curve or drop.

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.090
All of that is so important.

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:33.680
Like even when you're
playing the ukulele,

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.780
that's what I'm thinking.

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.970
Before even I even
hit the strings--

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:45.340
you can't really tell, but my
toes curl up in my shoes.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:52.030
And I can feel all that energy
in my ankles and the balls of

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:54.260
my feet, to my knees,
to my hips.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:57.890
Everything that comes down, up
my back, through my shoulders.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:02.240
And when I make contact with
the string, it's all that

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.610
energy directed this way.

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:06.300
And it's not just the
physical energy.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.990
But it's all my mental
focus, my thoughts.

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:13.680
Everything is going in that
direction, going with the

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:17.320
music, playing with that kind
of conviction, my spirit.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.760
Everything that I have, that
I have control of, I try to

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.740
bring that into every stroke,
into every strum.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:25.820
And it's not just the
hard-hitting stuff.

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:27.300
It's the soft stuff, too.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.741
It's like when you play--

00:45:28.741 --> 00:45:31.450
[PLAYING MUSIC, DELICATELY]

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:33.010
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: I want
to just bring that--

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.860
bring every note out.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.320
And it's still that
follow-through, that same

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:44.140
conviction, that same energy
that I would if I were playing

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.890
like a rock tune and a classical
piece or a ballad.

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:49.620
It's a different
kind of energy.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.360
But it's still that same
intensity, with that same

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:57.590
conviction, that you want to
put into every little note,

00:45:57.590 --> 00:45:58.950
every little movement.

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:03.840
Everything that you do needs to
be somehow connected to the

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:08.860
music, whether it's just a
simple tapping of the foot or

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:10.010
tapping of the toes.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:13.740
Or if it's a little twitch
in the face.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:16.280
Like you watch guitar players
sometimes and they do these

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.180
uncontrollable facial
expressions.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.660
They're just like--

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:25.760
and it's because all of that
movement, everything that's

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:29.930
happening, is somehow connected
with the sound or an

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:35.490
idea or a concept that they're
trying to convey emotionally.

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:38.510
And I don't remember what the
question was anymore.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:42.323
But I hope I answered it.

00:46:42.323 --> 00:46:43.070
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:44.120
You did answer it.

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:44.590
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Oh, OK.

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:45.300
MALE SPEAKER: Right here.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.360
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for playing for us today.

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.800
I have a question about if
there's anything particular

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.860
about your instrument that
you'd like to talk about.

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.240
How did you end up
choosing this

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.890
particular ukulele to play?

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:57.720
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Oh, yeah.

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.970
Well, this is an instrument,
a ukulele made by a family

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:03.490
called the Kamaka family.

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:05.410
And they're made right
in Hawaii.

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:08.280
And they were the first family
to start manufacturing

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.970
ukuleles in the world.

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:12.680
I think they're going on four
generations of ukulele

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:13.530
makers right now.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:17.140
And it's just a family
business.

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.340
And they were the first
Hawaiians to learn how to

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.470
build these instruments from the
Portuguese immigrants that

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:27.390
came over to the Islands to work
in the plantation fields.

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:31.260
So they were the ones who really
started to build the

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.520
first ukuleles.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.340
And it's quite extraordinary.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.260
Because they've been building
ukuleles for

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:39.970
almost 100 years now.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:43.470
And when I was a kid--

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:46.135
in Hawaii, everybody knows
Kamaka Ukulele.

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.450
When I was growing
up, my dream was

00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:55.300
to have this ukulele.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.410
They call this a tenor-size
instrument.

00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:59.590
It's a tenor, four-string
Kamaka.

00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:03.740
And it was my dream to have the
instrument because in my

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:05.960
eyes, it was like the Excalibur
of instruments.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.680
But they're very expensive.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.160
So when I was a kid, there
was no way I could afford

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:14.950
something like this.

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:19.180
And so now that I get to play
this instrument every day, I

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.030
just feel so honored.

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:25.530
Because there's just so much
history and so much experience

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:28.110
and knowledge that goes into
every single one of their

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:28.530
instruments.

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:33.490
So to actually be able to play
and to use one, to travel

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:37.840
with, and to create music with,
to write music with, I

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:42.110
just feel like all of that
history comes with

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:43.900
everything that I do.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.760
So yeah, that's what it is.

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.711
It's a Kamaka.

00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:49.700
Yes?

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:50.510
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.910
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Hi.

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:51.510
AUDIENCE: It's always such an

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:53.930
inspiration to see you perform.

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:59.760
And two years ago, when I last
saw you, I was so inspired

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.280
that I went and I brought
an ukulele.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.820
Because I used to play the
Venezuelan four-string cautro.

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:06.300
JAKE SHIMABUKURO:
Oh, yes, yes.

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.910
AUDIENCE: It's pretty much
the same thing, right?

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:09.700
So I took it and I went
to the guitar store.

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.070
I just went right from--

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:13.030
where you were, I went right
to the guitar store.

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:14.840
I bought this little
four-string

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.110
thing, took it home.

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:17.930
And there I am with my little
three chords, you know,

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:19.569
chinka, chinka, chinka, chinka,
chinka, chinka,

00:49:19.569 --> 00:49:21.050
chinka, chinka.

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:26.030
Anyway, my then 13-year-old
wanders up, like, hey, Mom,

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:27.740
what's that?

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:29.290
I never saw it again.

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:33.180
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Wow.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.680
AUDIENCE: She goes off to
school every day with a

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.740
fiberglass ukulele slung
across her back.

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.700
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Nice.

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:46.820
AUDIENCE: So I just wanted to
let you know that you had that

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:49.550
kind of impact.

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:51.103
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Aw,
thank you very much.

00:49:51.103 --> 00:49:51.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:53.200
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: That's
beautiful.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.070
One of the coolest things
for me is seeing--

00:49:56.070 --> 00:50:00.300
like when I tour now and do
shows, we see a lot of kids,

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:04.530
young kids, come to
the show now.

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:06.390
And they don't look like
ukulele players.

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:07.760
They come with the
ukulele players.

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.090
But they have their fingernails
all painted black.

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:13.160
They have spiky hair,
piercings.

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.340
And they just think the ukulele
is the coolest thing.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:18.360
They'll come up and they'll be
like, oh, yeah, I used to play

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.720
heavy metal guitar.

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.280
And then I saw you play
"Why My Guitar

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.410
Gently Weeps" on YouTube.

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:26.450
And I threw my guitar away
and I bought a ukulele.

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:29.260
And this is all I play now.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:33.160
And It's just the most
incredible thing.

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:36.910
Because 10 years ago, or
even I don't know--

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:40.320
maybe not even 10 years ago,
it was always the opposite.

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.720
People would start
on the ukulele.

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.340
And then after that, once they
can play it pretty good, then

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:47.090
they want to put it away and
move on to a guitar.

00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:49.840
Because their goal is to play
the guitar and to use a

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.910
ukulele as a stepping stool
to get to the guitar.

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:55.280
But now it's really cool that
people that have been playing

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.740
the guitar want to put
their guitars away

00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.550
and pick up the ukulele.

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:00.310
So it's great.

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:01.560
[? AUDIENCE: Guitar players ?]
are [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:05.720
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Yes?

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.570
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the
amazing performance.

00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:09.910
So I just have a question--

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:13.610
have you ever thought about
giving up becoming a musician

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:14.390
like that then?

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:17.580
When you were frustrated, and
how you get over that.

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.340
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Oh, no.

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:27.820
The thought never crossed my
mind that I would ever want to

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.170
give up playing.

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:31.430
But to be honest, when
I was a kid--

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:37.540
or even up until 10 years ago,
15 years ago, I had no idea

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:42.610
that I was going to be a touring
musician or even or I

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:44.490
could do this all the time.

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:48.140
I knew that I would always play
this instrument for the

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.360
rest of my life because
it's my passion.

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:54.220
But I thought it would just
be like coffee shops.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.790
When l was just out of high
school, I used to play at a

00:51:56.790 --> 00:52:00.780
lot of weddings and graduation
parties and birthday parties

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:02.300
and family functions.

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:05.830
But never in my wildest dreams
did I ever think I'd be doing

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:09.180
what I'm doing today.

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:12.980
So it never crossed my mind
that I'm going to

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:14.490
ever give this up.

00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:19.520
But as things started to evolve
and a career started to

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:23.820
shape up for me, through the
internet and all that, and now

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.960
I'm touring.

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.680
Like now, in this next
two months, we're

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.190
touring through 40 cities.

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:38.300
And we got a whole tour bus now
and a seven-man crew, with

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.790
a sound and lighting guy.

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:43.230
And I never imagined
any of that.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:44.430
It's just incredible.

00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:47.340
When I was growing up, I thought
I was going to be a

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:48.500
school teacher.

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.630
I thought I was going to go into
education because I love

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:52.440
working with kids.

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:55.110
And then I thought, the ukulele
is the perfect way to

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:56.250
connect with kids.

00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:58.970
So I thought in my classes,
in the lessons, I

00:52:58.970 --> 00:52:59.870
could always use this.

00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:01.230
So I would always have it.

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:03.550
But it's been real
challenging.

00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:10.340
There have been times, like when
I first started touring,

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.110
there were a lot
of challenges.

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:14.190
But you kind of get
through them.

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:15.950
You work through them.

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:18.460
Like I say, when I first started
performing, I couldn't

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.480
look at everyone and play.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.360
I was so nervous.

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:27.160
I'd be so afraid to talk.

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.860
And it's hard.

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:30.490
But you love it.

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:31.460
You love it so much.

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:36.560
And you always want to
figure out, how can

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:37.320
I improve on this?

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.300
How can I make this better?

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:42.560
Because I realized that I can
practice all I want in my

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.130
room, just by myself.

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:52.020
But it doesn't give me that
same satisfaction.

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:56.930
Because to me, again, music is
all about communicating.

00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:59.490
It's about making a connection
with people.

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:03.650
And once I started learning
how to connect with people

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:08.400
through this instrument, oh, my
gosh, it was just a rush.

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:14.910
Now when I perform at a venue
and there are moments where

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:15.720
I'd be playing.

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:19.770
And you'd get to a real
sensitive part and you play

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:20.580
that one chord.

00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:22.690
[STRUMS CHORD]

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:26.410
And you can just almost feel
the entire audience just

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:29.720
breathing with you and just
taking it all in and just

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:33.750
waiting for that last
note to fade away.

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:37.890
And then even after you can't
hear it anymore, it's just

00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:39.755
silence, silence, silence,
silence.

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:46.530
And then everyone
starts clapping.

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:49.450
And it's those moments that
it's such a rush.

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:54.620
Because you just feel like
everyone is experiencing the

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:55.860
same thing.

00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:00.120
And I guess the only way I can
think about it's like for

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.970
surfers when they catch
that perfect wave.

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:05.690
And they're just on that wave
and just nothing else matters.

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:07.110
You're just on that wave.

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:10.200
Or when I'm on stage and I'm
playing, it's like nothing

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:11.515
else matters.

00:55:11.515 --> 00:55:14.210
I'm just having, really
literally, having

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:16.070
the time of my life.

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:18.840
And so for me, it's--

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:20.980
yeah, there are challenges.

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:27.000
But a lot of it is just pressure
that I put on myself.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.120
I'm a bit of a perfectionist
in some ways.

00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.550
And I want to keep
learning and keep

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:33.290
discovering new things.

00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:36.240
So sometimes you go through
these periods where you're

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.210
just at a plateau.

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:40.030
And you're like, when's that
next idea going to come?

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:43.670
Or when's that next concept
going to come?

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:46.260
But yeah, you find ways to--

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:49.410
but then when you find
it, then it's like,

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:51.070
oh, my gosh, yes.

00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:51.790
That's amazing.

00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:54.390
And it carries you.

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:58.250
That inspiration, that
excitement carries you through

00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:01.380
the next one.

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.230
Thank you.

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.980
Yes?

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:03.470
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:06.310
I guess I can't get enough of
hearing about "While My Guitar

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:07.870
Gently Weeps," which
was always one

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:09.480
of my favorite songs.

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.100
And it's the reason I
know who you are.

00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:13.560
Because a close friend of mine
said, oh, you've got to listen

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:14.930
to this guy.

00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:15.830
Here he is on YouTube.

00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:17.080
His name's Jake something.

00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:22.950
And your version of it
just blew me away.

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:23.555
It was absolutely--

00:56:23.555 --> 00:56:24.070
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Thank you.

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:24.820
AUDIENCE: --gorgeous.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:27.680
And especially a song that I
care so much about, to hear

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.420
someone else do it.

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.720
It was so beautiful it
moved me to tears.

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.350
And I actually made
it my ringtone--

00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:34.150
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Oh, no way.

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:35.650
AUDIENCE: --like a week
before you came to

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:37.070
Google the first time.

00:56:37.070 --> 00:56:39.640
And then I saw you the first
time and had a chance to talk

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.060
to you and ask you if you'd
ever met George Harrison.

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:44.580
And I forgot to tell you that
I'd actually just made it my

00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:48.520
ringtone, even before you'd even
come to Google, copyright

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.886
issues not withstanding.

00:56:51.886 --> 00:56:56.790
But I just wanted to ask you,
what made you put that song up

00:56:56.790 --> 00:56:57.400
on YouTube?

00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.330
Was that also one of your
favorite songs?

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:01.930
Or was it just by chance?

00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:04.080
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Well, you
know, to be honest, till this

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.900
day, I don't know who put
it up on YouTube.

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.840
And I said this the
last time to you.

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:19.080
I'm just being totally honest
and sincere because this was

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.180
seven years ago.

00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:24.300
So I didn't know what YouTube
was back then.

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.030
I'm not very internet savvy.

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:27.960
But I think YouTube just
kind of started

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:28.960
around that time, too.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.520
So it wasn't that famous yet.

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.350
Not too many people
knew about it.

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:35.790
I was doing some email.

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:40.570
But I wasn't really active
on the websites and

00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:41.820
internet and all that.

00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:47.950
So what happened was I
just did this thing

00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:49.690
for a local TV show.

00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:51.630
And that's what they did
the interview for.

00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:55.300
They videotaped me doing that
and then it aired on TV.

00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:57.650
And it was just a small
little local network,

00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:58.510
and that was it.

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:01.000
And then I went back
home to Hawaii.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.740
And about two months later,
I had a lot of

00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.770
friends that were here--

00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:08.740
in Hawaii, we call this
the mainland--

00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:12.310
so I had a lot of friends on the
mainland going to school.

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:15.200
And they started calling me
or sending me emails.

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:22.200
And they were like hey, there's
this video clip that's

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.770
going around our campus
of you playing.

00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:25.860
And I was like, what are
you talking about?

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.920
So they sent me the link.

00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:33.190
And at that time, it was still
that concept of emailing a

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:35.360
video or a video link
to somebody was

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:36.430
kind of like, what?

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:37.620
You're going to email
me a video?

00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.900
What are you talking about?

00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:42.680
Because it was just kind
of starting out.

00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:46.920
So they emailed me this link.

00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:48.130
And I clicked on it.

00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:51.370
And it took me right to
the YouTube video.

00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:52.590
And there it was.

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:56.230
And I just was like,
I don't understand.

00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:58.720
What am I looking at?

00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:03.100
And already it had almost
2 million views already.

00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:05.750
And I couldn't believe it.

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:08.300
And there wasn't a term
for it back then.

00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:10.380
There wasn't even such thing
as a viral video yet.

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.745
We didn't even know
what to call it.

00:59:11.745 --> 00:59:13.930
It was just happening.

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:17.010
And it was shortly after that
the numbers just started

00:59:17.010 --> 00:59:19.000
growing and growing
and growing.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.710
And there were multiple
videos.

00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:24.250
So there was one that didn't
even have my name.

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:26.170
It just said "While My Guitar
Gently Weeps" and it was that

00:59:26.170 --> 00:59:26.750
same video.

00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:28.320
Then there was one that
was like, Crazy

00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:29.385
Asian Ukulele Player.

00:59:29.385 --> 00:59:34.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:34.850 --> 00:59:35.770
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: So
there were eight or

00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:36.760
nine different videos.

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:41.010
And all of them had like
over a million views.

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:43.530
But none of them had
my name yet.

00:59:43.530 --> 00:59:47.280
So it wasn't until, I think, a
few months after that, that

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:50.110
finally there was a video
that had my name on it.

00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:53.570
It was Jake Shimabukuro,
whatever.

00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:55.935
And then that video just started
growing and growing

00:59:55.935 --> 00:59:57.460
and growing.

00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:01.060
And so all the other ones
just slowly disappeared.

01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:03.690
I think there's still a couple
other ones out there.

01:00:03.690 --> 01:00:08.960
But the main one right
now that was left--

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:12.440
I know when it first just had
my name on it, it was like

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:15.140
something like 30,000 views.

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:19.070
And that was maybe four years
ago or something.

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:22.440
But then that one, even from
four years ago, that one grew

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.440
to over 10 million now.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.780
And it's amazing how it's
still just growing.

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:30.540
And so people are still
discovering this video for the

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.270
first time.

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:34.750
So it's been quite
extraordinary.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:37.490
And that video changed
my life.

01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:41.160
I wish I knew who the first
person was that put it on,

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.965
because, yeah--

01:00:42.965 --> 01:00:44.215
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:48.310 --> 01:00:51.340
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Yeah, yeah,
that's what I tell people.

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:54.880
I think George Harrison up there
had something to do it.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.540
But yeah, really, it
changed my life.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:00.620
And from that, I started getting
calls from other

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:03.460
artists to come and open for
them-- oh, take care--

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:07.320
to tour with them and open for
them or record with them.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.310
And it's been totally
extraordinary.

01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:11.110
So, thank you.

01:01:11.110 --> 01:01:13.220
AUDIENCE: So now, Jake--
hey, Jake.

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:15.646
So now you know why it took so
long for them to attach your

01:01:15.646 --> 01:01:16.120
name to the video.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.560
Because it took them that
long to learn how to

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:18.450
spell your last name.

01:01:18.450 --> 01:01:21.198
JAKE SHIMABUKURO:
Yeah, I know.

01:01:21.198 --> 01:01:23.370
No, it's so true, so true.

01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:25.990
AUDIENCE: All right, so I
have a quick question.

01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.710
I'll give you a heads
up, a little

01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:27.650
bit of a set-up question.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:30.330
But tell me a little bit about
the work that you did with

01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:31.440
Alan Parsons.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.070
So obviously, he's a very
well-known, Grammy-nominated

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:34.960
producer and engineer.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.290
But you yourself, as a musician
for a long time, have

01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:39.880
worked with a lot of producers
and engineers.

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.660
What made him different?

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:46.370
What did he do differently, like
radically different than

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:51.060
the masses of audio engineers
that are out there?

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:55.050
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Well, one of
the coolest things about Alan,

01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:57.660
I mean, from day one, just being
in the recording studio

01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:00.300
with him, was--

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.600
the first thing I noticed was
the way he miked my ukulele,

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.900
the way he recorded
my ukulele.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:13.090
Every recording engineer I've
ever worked with, there was

01:02:13.090 --> 01:02:18.520
always at least one microphone
in front of my instrument.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:21.160
A lot of times if they record in
stereo, they would have one

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.710
here and then one here.

01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:26.120
Because that's how they record
guitars, in stereo like that.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.530
I've done mid-side miking where
you have one mic in the

01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:32.260
middle, like kind of
a stereo spread.

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:35.580
And then you have one
across the top.

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:38.660
I've been in situations where
they would surround me with

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:43.190
microphones, put microphones
all over me, or put two

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:45.330
microphones right here and then
put two in the back of

01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:47.310
the room or behind me.

01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:53.640
But this was the first time that
someone told me, OK, just

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.450
stand right here.

01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:55.880
He got one microphone.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:00.000
He put it here under the
neck of my ukulele.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.050
And he put another one right
here, above my right shoulder.

01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:10.670
And I was like, are you sure
this is going to work?

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:14.020
And so he's like, yeah, yeah,
just play, and I'll make some

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:14.570
adjustments.

01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:15.360
So I started playing.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.850
And he just kind of tweaked it
a little bit, just moved, but

01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:18.800
kept it right there.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.300
And then he kind of tweaked
this one like that.

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:23.290
And then he's like, all right,
yeah, just play something.

01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:24.400
So I just started--

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.010
I punched into a song.

01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:27.910
And I played it.

01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:30.360
And then he said, OK, come
in and tell me if

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.740
you like the sound.

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:34.210
So I walked into the
control room.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.080
He played it back.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:40.570
And I couldn't believe
what I was hearing.

01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:45.150
It was the sound of my
instrument the way that I

01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:49.040
always hear it, the way
that I hear it.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.670
Because I've always just
accepted that every time I

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:57.560
record, my studio sound, what I
can get on a record, is just

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.490
different from my live sound
or what I hear when I'm

01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:01.760
practicing.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.830
But it was the first time I
walked into that room and he

01:04:03.830 --> 01:04:04.460
played it back.

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:10.180
And I was stunned because
I was like, oh, my gosh.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:14.350
I feel like I'm playing my
instrument right now.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.360
That's how it felt.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.740
And so I asked him about that.

01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:21.660
I said, Alan, what made you
decide to record the

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:22.470
ukulele this way?

01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:27.410
And he said he wanted to
record it in stereo.

01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:31.130
So he wanted it at least two
microphones, so he could get a

01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:33.130
right and a left channel.

01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:36.650
But what he said was when he
records guitars that way, you

01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:39.380
usually put one here and
then one up here,

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:41.790
because a guitar is longer.

01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:46.530
So you can get a wider stereo
spread that way.

01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:49.940
But he thought that because the
ukulele is shorter, if you

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.725
were to put one mic here at the
body and one mic here at

01:04:52.725 --> 01:04:56.150
the neck, because the ukulele is
so tiny, the mics are going

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:57.980
to pick up pretty much
the same sound.

01:04:57.980 --> 01:04:59.850
So you're not going to get
that much of a stereo

01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:00.400
difference.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.730
The right and the left are going
to sound very similar.

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:07.460
So he thought he could get a
wider stereo spread if he put

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:12.110
one mic down here to pick up
closer to the first string,

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:14.850
and one mic up here, which would
pick up closer to the

01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:15.940
fourth string.

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:19.230
And that way he can keep the
mics further apart, yet they'd

01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:21.435
be the same distance
to the instrument.

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:31.930
It sounds simple, but it was
just the most brilliant thing

01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:32.800
that I had ever heard.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.460
And I was like, wow, so when
you listen to the album,

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:36.930
you're thinking--

01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:39.730
this great stereo spread that
you're hearing, I mean, it's

01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:42.040
like you're in the middle
of the instrument.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.580
But it's not so much
right and left, but

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:47.350
it's more up and down.

01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:50.640
So it's like he took that up
and down sound and just

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:53.590
flipped it over so you get
your right and your left.

01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:57.920
And so that, for me,
was like, wow.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.220
That was amazing.

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:02.620
And then other things-- like
because Alan comes from that

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.660
old school way of recording,
he wanted to

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.320
do everything live.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.950
So we have a 29-piece
orchestra on a

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:10.340
few of these tracks.

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:13.570
And everything was
recorded live.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:15.430
There are absolutely
no overdubs.

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:18.180
So we went into this
huge studio.

01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:20.390
We had the 29-piece
orchestra there.

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:22.240
And then I was in the same
room with the orchestra.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.610
The only thing that divided
me from the

01:06:23.610 --> 01:06:25.320
orchestra was a glass door.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.800
And we all watched the same
conductor up there.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.190
And we all played.

01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:32.910
And there's something amazing
that happens when you do that,

01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:33.700
when you play live.

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:37.460
Because all the musicians are
listening to each other and

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.610
playing off of each other.

01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:42.010
So there are a lot of
spontaneous things that just

01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:44.750
happen, that wouldn't have
happened if we just played all

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:45.830
our parts separately.

01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:47.770
Because we would have just been
reading the music and

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:49.530
just played our parts.

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:51.950
But because we were playing it
together, it's that whole

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:54.120
synergy effect.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.960
We're all creating something
together.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:58.440
We're all in the room together,
making this.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.340
And it was really beautiful.

01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:06.310
That song "Missing Three" that
I played for you, it's a

01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:07.370
three-string song.

01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:10.100
I was so proud of it because I
was like, oh, you only play it

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:11.200
with three strings.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.190
And I sent that.

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:14.650
That was the first demo
that I'd sent to Alan.

01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:15.540
And he listened to it.

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:16.650
I didn't tell him
the story yet.

01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:18.130
I just sent him the song.

01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:18.760
And he listened to it.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.740
And he was like, oh, gosh,
that's beautiful.

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:25.040
And he told me, I can just hear
an entire string section

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.960
playing with you on that.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.570
And so it was ironic.

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:33.000
Because it's a song that I
wrote it with just three

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.920
strings, but now there's
a 29-piece orchestra.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:39.170
So there's over 100 strings
on the song now.

01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:47.110
But still, he was very careful
about making sure that the

01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:49.410
ukulele was here and
everything else

01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:50.300
played around it.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:54.330
He didn't want anything
to bury the ukulele.

01:07:54.330 --> 01:07:56.520
And it was just amazing
working with him.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:59.160
He mixed the entire record
in two days.

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.330
He would just get up there.

01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:01.670
And you know, all the faders,
and he just--

01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:03.526
whst, whst, whst.

01:08:03.526 --> 01:08:07.430
And in like 20 seconds, he'd
have a perfect mix of a

01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:10.990
29-piece orchestra with me.

01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:12.430
And he would just sit
back and listen.

01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:17.110
He would go, maybe the horns
need to come down a little bit

01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:19.020
right here.

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:19.930
And then he would turn
around and be

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:21.990
like, what do you think?

01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:24.550
I was just like, it
all sounds great.

01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:25.979
Yeah, let's go.

01:08:25.979 --> 01:08:29.830
It was really inspiring
working with him.

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:31.310
MALE SPEAKER: I think this
is our last question.

01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:31.880
AUDIENCE: It is.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.710
And so I was wondering-- in
each of your albums, your

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:36.770
style changes, your
style evolves.

01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:41.330
So what about "Grand Ukulele"
are you most proud of in the

01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:42.310
evolution of your style?

01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:43.684
And where do you see it
going in the future?

01:08:46.810 --> 01:08:48.890
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: There were a
lot of things on this record,

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:50.850
like just really
subtle things.

01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:56.630
Like I was talking about, always
just looking for that

01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:59.779
one thing to make
it different.

01:08:59.779 --> 01:09:02.590
There were songs on this album
where I utilized techniques

01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:04.410
that I never used before.

01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:09.366
For example, there's this one
song called "Music Box," where

01:09:09.366 --> 01:09:12.210
I do this thing where I keep my
thumb alternating between

01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:13.450
the third and fourth string.

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:17.479
And then I play the entire song
or entire melody on the

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:18.413
first string.

01:09:18.413 --> 01:09:19.663
[MUSIC - JAKE SHIMABUKURO,
"MUSIC BOX"]

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:32.340
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: But there's
this one section in the song

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:37.080
where I play that melody
harmonically.

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.250
So while I'm keeping this going,
[ALTERNATING NOTES]

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:41.090
I play this melody.

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:45.184
[PLAYING MELODY]

01:09:45.184 --> 01:09:46.324
I'm going to play
it for you here.

01:09:46.324 --> 01:09:46.810
Just listen.

01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:57.750
[MUSIC - "MUSIC BOX"]

01:09:57.750 --> 01:10:01.820
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: That section
right there for me was like, I

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:03.140
had never done anything
like that before.

01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:04.170
So I thought that was cool.

01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:08.350
There's another place-- and
you'll never notice it unless

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:08.890
I talk about it.

01:10:08.890 --> 01:10:15.940
But I did a version of "Fields
of Gold." And there's this one

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:19.110
section in there where
I take the melody--

01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:20.110
[MUSIC - "FIELDS OF GOLD"]

01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:26.260
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: (SINGING
ALONG) Da, da, da, dah, dah.

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:28.590
So there's this one section
where I play that harmonically

01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:29.730
as well, again.

01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:35.430
But what I do is I utilize this
technique where instead

01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:39.790
just playing the harmonics by
itself, I would fret a string

01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:44.130
to almost mimic a bass note.

01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:47.880
So I have this over
the F chord.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.240
What I'm doing is I'm
holding the F root.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.740
But as I play that F root, I'm
also going to use my other

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:57.580
fingers to play the harmonics
of the other strings

01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:59.640
together, like this.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.655
So I can get this kind of
harmony, which is something

01:11:03.655 --> 01:11:05.650
you don't hear.

01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:08.530
Like ukulele players wouldn't
know, how do you get that F

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:10.750
Major 7 sound with harmonics?

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:12.190
So when I play that
part, it's like--

01:11:12.190 --> 01:11:22.040
[MUSIC - "FIELDS OF GOLD"]

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:22.620
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: See.

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:24.720
So for me that was another--

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:27.330
I'd never done anything,
this kind of stuff.

of sound, it's very--

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.250
Jaco Pastorius, one of my
favorite bass players, would

01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:45.440
do things like that where
he would kind of

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.700
roll the bass around.

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:49.990
And he would fret these amazing
harmonics and just get

01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:51.222
these incredible--

01:11:51.222 --> 01:11:54.700
[PLAYING MUSIC]

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:55.400
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: I don't
if you can hear that.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.870
[PLAYING MUSIC]

01:11:56.870 --> 01:12:00.372
JAKE SHIMABUKURO:
So hear that?

01:12:00.372 --> 01:12:02.690
[PLAYING MUSIC]

01:12:02.690 --> 01:12:06.900
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: So the flat
7 there, you would never

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:09.050
usually hear that
on the ukulele.

01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:10.424
But you are able to--

01:12:10.424 --> 01:12:13.981
[PLAYING MUSIC]

01:12:13.981 --> 01:12:19.030
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Yeah,
yeah, so, yeah.

01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:22.570
So those kinds of things, that's
the kind of stuff that

01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:23.420
really keeps me going.

01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:26.940
And most people won't hear
it or won't notice it.

01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:31.360
But for me it's like, oh yeah,
that makes the entire

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:36.460
arrangement for me, or
the entire song.

01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:39.630
I had a great time working
on this record.

01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:44.530
I really feel like Alan really
pushed me in the studio.

01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:45.920
And so it was great.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:48.300
Because that's what you want
from a producer, who knows how

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:53.310
to push, but not overpush, where
you get discouraged.

01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:54.580
And it was such a great
experience.

01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:57.315
He brought in just some amazing
musicians, like Kip

01:12:57.315 --> 01:12:59.260
Winger, from the band Winger.

01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:01.320
He did some of the orchestral
arrangements.

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:04.070
We had Simon Phillips,
one of my favorite

01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:05.920
drummers, from Toto.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.450
He played on the record.

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:13.680
Randy Tico, a phenomenal
bass player.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:17.920
It was just really
inspiring for me.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.910
Because Alan--

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:22.670
he's worked with everyone
from the Beatles to--

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:28.560
even with his Alan Parsons
Project and all that, Pink

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:34.330
Floyd, his vision is so grand.

01:13:34.330 --> 01:13:36.990
He has so much experience.

01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:39.120
For me, a lot of times,
my vision only

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:43.130
comes with what I can--

01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:46.070
I only see what I can
do with the ukulele.

01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:49.550
But I don't think beyond that.

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:55.970
Whereas Alan Parsons comes from
that school where he's

01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:57.740
worked with so many
orchestras.

01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.490
He's worked with so
many arrangers.

01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:02.040
He's worked with so many
rhythm sections.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.050
And he's recorded so many
different kinds of

01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:04.400
instruments.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.790
And he knows all about
microphones and preamps.

01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:10.170
And he knows how to get
this kind of sound.

01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:14.040
Or if I'm trying to express
something, he knows the best

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.800
way to capture that so that it
translates when you listen to

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.430
it on a record.

01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:23.220
If I'm going for that real
sensitive touch, he knows how

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:27.030
to pick it up with a mic and
using the right microphone

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:32.420
with the right preamp and
placing it in the right spot,

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:34.300
so that we can get that sound.

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:39.590
Or even if I'm playing with the
orchestra, how to EQ the

01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:46.160
strings or how to EQ the horns
or the woodwinds so that the

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:50.090
frequencies don't overpower the
ukulele and the ukulele

01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:51.460
can still be over.

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:53.410
Because a lot of times, it's
not just a volume issue.

01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:56.660
But it's a panning issue, like
where you place it in the mix,

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:57.990
in the stereo mix.

01:14:57.990 --> 01:15:01.540
And then also how you EQ it,
so that you EQ it just in a

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.350
way so that it--

01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:09.870
I don't really understand
all this kind of stuff.

01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:13.580
But I have very limited
understanding.

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.490
I mean, it's a whole science.

01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:16.700
And it's amazing.

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:19.730
His ears are just incredible.

01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:21.300
We'd be mixing the song.

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.570
We'd be recording something.

01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:23.980
And he'd be in the room.

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:27.250
And then we'll be listening
on the playback.

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:28.230
And we'd be just listening.

01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:29.630
And like, oh, yeah, OK, that
sounded all right.

01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:30.520
And we're listening.

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.920
And then the phone would ring.

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.890
And Alan would be like,
oh, OK, well, I

01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:34.800
got to get the phone.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.740
And so he'll kind of step out.

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:39.910
And he'll be on the phone
outside of the studio.

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:41.570
All of a sudden, he'll
come running back in.

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:42.400
What was that?

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.470
What was that?

01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:46.440
Go back, go back, go back
like 20 seconds.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.200
It's amazing.

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.370
He just hears everything.

01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:53.460
And it was just extraordinary
to work with

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:55.120
him and to see someone--

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:58.450
because when he's in the studio,
he's just like a

01:15:58.450 --> 01:15:59.900
little kid.

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:00.650
He loves it.

01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:03.050
He's so passionate
about recording.

01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:04.840
And so to work with
someone like

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.440
that was really inspiring.

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.720
Because for me, I'm passionate
about this.

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.430
And then to work with him, who's
passionate about doing

01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:16.630
all the other stuff, I think it
was a great collaboration.

01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:20.080
And it was one of the
greatest recording

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.210
experiences of my life.

01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:23.860
MALE SPEAKER: Well, great.

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.040
Thanks so much for
coming here.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.980
And we look forward to picking
up the conversation when you

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:27.470
come back here.

01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:29.340
JAKE SHIMABUKURO: Yeah,
oh, thanks.

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:30.825
Great.

01:16:30.825 --> 01:16:32.805
Thank you very much, everybody.

01:16:32.805 --> 01:16:33.795
Thank you.
