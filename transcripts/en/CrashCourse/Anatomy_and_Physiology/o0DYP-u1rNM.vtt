00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
Take a good long look at this --
we’re gonna mess with your brain.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.500
This is the first stage of an optical illusion.

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.620
Many illusions use patterns of light or perspective
to exploit the disconnect that exists between

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.269
sensation and perception -- between what your
eyes see and what your brain understands.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.900
But not all illusions work that way. Some
produce ghost effects, or afterimages, that

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.180
take advantage of glitches in the physiology
of human vision.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.900
Like this flag.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.260
I’m not trying to make a political statement
here. And I’m not going ask you to swear

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.140
allegiance to the Republic of Hank or anything.
I mean, if I was gonna start my own country,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.809
my flag would be way cooler than that -- not
that I’ve thought about that a lot.

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.339
And now, look at this white screen.

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.109
If you looked at that flag for at least 30
seconds without moving your eyes, you’ll

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:42.639
see something, even though this screen is
blank -- an afterimage of the flag. But instead

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:46.179
of being turquoise, and black, and yellow,
it’s red, white, and blue.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.440
OK so that’s pretty cool, but I’m not
here just to entertain you. This kind of illusion

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.519
is actually a great way to explain your very
complex sense of vision.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.350
And I do mean complex… nearly 70 percent
of all the sensory receptors in your whole

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.130
body are in the eyes!

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.899
Not only that, but in order for you to see,
perceive, and recognize something -- whether

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.530
it’s a flag or a handsome guy in glasses
and a sport coat sitting behind a desk -- nearly

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.850
half of your entire cerebral cortex has to
get involved.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.970
Vision is considered the dominant sense of
humans and while we can get along without

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.830
it and it can be tricked, what you are about
to learn is NOT an illusion.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.220
When we talked about your sense of hearing,
we began with the mechanics of sound. So before

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.640
we get to how your eyeballs work, it makes
sense to talk about what they’re actually

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.420
seeing -- light bouncing off of stuff.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.580
Light is electromagnetic radiation traveling
in waves.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.049
Remember how the pitch and loudness of a sound is
determined by the frequency and amplitude of its wave?

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.619
Well, it’s kind of similar with light, except
that the frequency of a light wave determines

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.789
its hue, while the amplitude relates to its
brightness.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.460
We register short waves at high frequencies
as bluish colors, while long, low frequencies

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.689
look reddish to us.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.880
Meanwhile, that red might appear dull and
muted if the wave is moving at a lower amplitude,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.409
but super bright if the wave has greater amplitude
and thus higher intensity.

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:14.000
But the visible light we’re able to see
is only a tiny chunk of the full electromagnetic

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.120
spectrum, which ranges from short gamma and
X rays all the way to long radio waves.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.880
Just as the ear’s mechanoreceptors or the
tongue’s chemoreceptors convert sounds and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.940
chemicals into action potentials, so too do
your eyes’ photoreceptors convert light

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.019
energy into nerve impulses that the brain
can understand.

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.979
To figure out how all this works, let’s
start with understanding some eye anatomy.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.500
Some of the first things you’ll notice around
your average pair of eyes are all the outer

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.330
accessories -- like the eyebrows that help keep
the sweat away if you forgot your headband

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.640
at raquetball, and the super-sensitive eyelashes
that trigger reflexive blinking, like if you’re

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.239
on a sandy beach in a windstorm.

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.420
These features, along with the eyelids and
tear-producing lacrimal apparatus are there

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.110
to help protect your fragile eyeballs.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.420
The eyeball itself is irregularly spherical,
with an adult diameter of about 2.5 centimeters.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.680
It’s essentially hollow -- full of fluids
that help it keep its shape -- and you can

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.110
really only see about the anterior sixth of
the whole ball. The rest of it is tucked into

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.370
a pocket of protective fat, tethered down
by six straplike extrinsic eye muscles, and

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.910
jammed into the bony orbit of your skull.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.480
While all this gear generally does a fantastic
job of keeping your eyeballs inside of your

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.040
head (which is good), on very rare occasions,
perhaps after head trauma or -- or even a

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.469
really intense sneeze! -- those suckers can
pop right out -- a condition called globe

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.329
luxation, which you really do not want to
google.

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.239
I’ll just sit here while you Google it.

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.299
Now, you don’t need to pop out an eyeball
in order to learn how it’s structured. I’ll

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.629
save you the trouble and tell you that its
wall is made up of three distinct layers -- the

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.719
fibrous, vascular, and inner layers.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.659
The outermost fibrous layer is made of connective
tissue. Most of it is that white stuff called

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.670
the sclera, while the most anterior part is
the transparent cornea.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.180
The cornea is like the window that lets light
into the eye, and if you’ve ever experienced

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.829
the excruciating pain of a scratched one,
you know how terrible it can be to damage

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.009
something so loaded with pain receptors.

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:06.380
Going down a little deeper, the wall’s middle
vascular layer contains the posterior choroid,

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.150
a membrane that supplies all of the layers
with blood.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.680
In the anterior, there’s also the ciliary
body, a ring of muscle tissue that surrounds

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.170
the lens; but the most famous part of this
middle layer is the iris.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.230
The iris is that distinctive colored part
of the eye that is uniquely yours. It’s

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.920
made up of smooth muscle tissue, shaped liked
a flattened donut, and sandwiched between

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.630
the cornea and the lens.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.720
Those circular sphincter muscles -- yeah,
that’s right, you’ve got sphincters everywhere!

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.390
-- contract and expand, changing the size
of the dark dot of your pupil.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.960
The pupil itself is just the opening in the
iris that allows light to travel into the

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.830
eye. You can see how an iris protects the
eye from taking too much light in if you shine

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.060
a flashlight in your friend’s eye in a dark
room. Their pupils will go from dilated to

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.860
pinpoints in a couple of seconds.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.920
Light comes in through the cornea and pupil
and hits the lens -- the convex, transparent

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.590
disc that focuses that light and projects
it onto the retina, which makes up the inner

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.070
layer of the back of the eyeball.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.860
Your retinas are loaded with millions of photoreceptors
which do the crucial work of converting light

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.510
energy into the electrical signals that your
brain will receive. These receptor cells come

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.210
in two flavors -- rods and cones -- which
I’ll come back to in a minute.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.850
But the retina itself has two layers, the
outer pigmented layer that helps absorb light

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.960
so it doesn't scatter around the eyeball,
and the inner neural layer.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.380
And this layer, as the name indicates, contains
neurons -- not only the photoreceptors but

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.560
also bipolar neurons and ganglion neurons.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.870
These two kinds of nerve cells combine to
produce a sort of pathway for light, or at

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.690
least data about light.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.460
Bipolar neurons have synapses at both ends,
forming a kind of bridge -- on one end it

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.750
synapses with a photoreceptor, and at the
other, it synapses with a ganglionic neuron,

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.570
which goes on to form the optic nerve.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.220
So, say you’ve just been hit with a blinding
flashlight beam. That light hits your posterior

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.520
retina and spreads from the photoreceptors
to the bipolar cells just beneath them, to

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.120
the innermost ganglion cells, where they then
generate action potentials.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.830
The axons of all those ganglion cells weave
together to create the thick, ropey optic

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.880
nerve -- your second cranial nerve -- which
leaves the back of your eyeball and carries

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.560
those impulses up to the thalamus and then
on to the brain’s visual cortex.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.190
So that’s the basic anatomy and event sequencing
of human vision, but what I really want to

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.130
talk about are those two types of photoreceptors
-- your rods and your cones.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.420
Cones sit near the retina’s center, and
detect fine detail and color. They can be

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.380
divided into red, green, and blue-sensitive types,
based on how they respond to different types of light.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.440
But they’re not very sensitive, and they really only
hit their activation thresholds in bright conditions.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.180
Rods, on the other hand, are more numerous
more light-sensitive. But they can’t pick

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.670
up real color. Instead they only register
a grayscale of black and white. They hang

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.000
out around the edges of your retinas, and
rule your peripheral vision.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.420
Since these receptors function so differently,
you might not be surprised to learn that your

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.150
rods and cones are also wired to your retinas
in different ways.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.520
As many as 100 different rods may connect
to a single ganglion cell -- but because they

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.370
all send their information to the ganglion
at once, the brain can’t tell which individual

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.560
rods have been activated. That’s why they’re
not very good at providing detailed images

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.760
-- all they can really do is give you information about
objects general shape, or whether it’s light or dark.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.030
Each cone, by contrast, gets its own personal
ganglion cell to hook up with, which allows

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.050
for very detailed color vision, at least if
conditions are bright enough.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.420
And all this brings us back to that weird
flag.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.950
Why does staring at this flag and then looking
at an empty white space make us see a phantom

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.520
flag of different colors? Well, it begins
with the fact that our photoreceptors can

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.060
make us see afterimages.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.470
Some stimuli, like really brilliant colors
or really bright lights, are so strong that

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.140
our photoreceptors will continue firing action potentials
even after we close our eyes or look away.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.510
The other part of the illusion has to do with
another bug in our visual programming: And

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.130
it’s just that our cones can just get tired.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.540
If you stare long enough at a brightly colored
image, your cones will receive the same stimulus

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.920
for too long, and basically stop responding.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.480
In the case of the flag, you looked at an
image with bright turquoise stripes. Because

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.540
your retinas contain red, green, and blue-sensitive
cones, the blue and green ones got tired after

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.310
a while, leaving only the red cones left to
fire.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.590
Then, you looked at the white screen. That
white light included all of colors and wavelengths

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.410
of visible light. So, your eyes were still
receiving red, green, and blue light -- but

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:13.380
only the red cones were able to respond. As
a result, when the afterimage began to appear,

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.870
those stripes looked red.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.600
The same thing happened to your rods. Except,
since they only register black and white,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.300
the afterimage was like looking at a negative
of a photograph -- dark replaced with light.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.190
That’s how those black stars and stripes
turned white.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.920
So, yes, human vision is fallible, but those
mistakes that it makes can help us understand

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.699
that wonderfully complex system.

00:08:32.699 --> 00:08:36.669
And that wonderfully complex system probably
helped you learn about the anatomy and physiology

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:41.560
of vision today, starting with the structure
of the eye and its three layers: the fibrous,

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.129
vascular, and inner layers. We spent most
of our time exploring the inner layer, which

00:08:45.129 --> 00:08:50.209
consists of the retina and its three kinds
of neurons: photoreceptors, bipolar cells,

00:08:50.209 --> 00:08:54.430
and ganglion neurons. And after learning how
to tell our rods from our cones, we then dissected

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.370
how the weird flag illusion works.
