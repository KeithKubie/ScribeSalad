00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:02.685
- So we're asked to
compare these two numbers

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:04.101
right over here and I just took a picture

00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:05.785
from the Khan Academy exercise

00:00:05.785 --> 00:00:08.107
but this isn't it, itself, so
I can't, I can't click on this,

00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:10.534
but if you did click on
this on the exercise,

00:00:10.534 --> 00:00:12.682
you'd get to choose
between one of these three,

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:13.800
but I'll just write it down.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.231
So we're gonna compare 2.7 to

00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:16.723
two and 17 hundredths,

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:18.934
so there's a bunch of
ways you could do this,

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.123
you could convert both
of them to mixed numbers.

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:26.039
So, for example, 2.7,
2.7, you could rewrite,

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.369
this is the same thing
as two and seven tenths,

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.609
two and seven tenths,

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.047
you could compare two and seven tenths to,

00:00:35.247 --> 00:00:36.622
to this right over here, which is

00:00:36.622 --> 00:00:40.866
two and 17 hundredths,
two and 17 hundredths.

00:00:41.846 --> 00:00:43.263
So, they both have a two,
so you want to compare

00:00:43.263 --> 00:00:45.173
the fraction part, so what's larger?

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:48.110
Seven tenths or 17 hundredths?

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:49.822
Well, if it doesn't jump out at you,

00:00:49.822 --> 00:00:52.034
you could convert this to hundredths.

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:54.573
Seven tenths is the same
thing if you want to convert

00:00:54.573 --> 00:00:56.895
it to hundredths, you can
multiply the denominator

00:00:56.895 --> 00:01:00.133
by 10, which would make the 10 into 100,

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.264
and then you'd also have to
multiply the numerator by 10.

00:01:03.153 --> 00:01:05.533
So two and 7 tenths is the same thing

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.640
as two and 70 hundredths.

00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:12.214
And so 70 hundredths is for
sure bigger than 17 hundredths.

00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:14.919
So, this number,

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:18.605
two and seven tenths, or two
and 70 hundredths, or 2.7,

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:21.002
is going to be greater than this number,

00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:22.529
so it's going to be greater than,

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:25.437
we open the symbol to the larger number.

00:01:25.884 --> 00:01:28.699
Another way that we could
have thought about this,

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.392
is we could have converted
both of them to decimals.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.432
So we have 2.7, which we
can leave as a decimal.

00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:40.644
2.7 but then two and 17
hundredths, we could write as 2.17.

00:01:42.718 --> 00:01:44.901
This is 17 hundredths over here.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.432
And there's a bunch of ways that you could

00:01:46.432 --> 00:01:48.150
make this comparison, you could just say,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.749
oh look, two and seven
tenths is the same thing

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:55.749
as two and 70 hundredths, over
here I have 70 hundredths,

00:01:55.753 --> 00:01:57.651
over here I only have 17 hundredths,

00:01:57.785 --> 00:01:59.172
so this is going to be larger.

00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:01.378
This one's going to be
larger right over here.

00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:02.683
Another way you could
have thought about it

00:02:02.683 --> 00:02:03.867
is we'll just start in the ones place,

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:06.469
they both have two ones, so
that doesn't tell you much,

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.430
but as soon as you go to the tenths place,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.112
this number as seven tenths and this one

00:02:11.112 --> 00:02:13.829
only has one tenth, so
this number right over here

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.597
is going to be greater than that number.

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:19.013
Let's go to, let's do another example.

00:02:20.086 --> 00:02:24.132
Which of the following are
less than two point zero three?

00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:26.012
Or two and three hundredths?

00:02:26.644 --> 00:02:28.914
Each big square represents one whole.

00:02:29.442 --> 00:02:31.103
So one way we could do it, and this is

00:02:31.103 --> 00:02:32.228
kind of the way that jumps out at me,

00:02:32.228 --> 00:02:35.253
is let's, let's write
all of these as decimals.

00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:39.542
So this one over here, we have one whole,

00:02:39.542 --> 00:02:42.318
another whole, and then over
here I don't have a full whole,

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:45.774
let's see, I've taken a whole,
I've divided it into tenths,

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.590
and I have two tenths right over here,

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.764
so this number right over here
is equal to two and two tenths,

00:02:52.432 --> 00:02:55.044
you see that, two, one, two, and then two

00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:58.638
of the ten equal sections,
so two and two tenths,

00:02:58.991 --> 00:03:02.456
which is the same thing as 2.2.

00:03:02.868 --> 00:03:06.526
And if we wanted to compare it to 2.03,

00:03:06.526 --> 00:03:08.510
well we just have to think about this,

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.985
well there's a, there's a bunch of ways

00:03:09.985 --> 00:03:11.308
you could think about this,

00:03:11.308 --> 00:03:14.894
you could view this as two point two zero,

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:17.865
which would mean this is
two and 20 hundredths,

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:20.679
and two and 20 hundredths
is for sure greater

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.099
than two and three hundredths.

00:03:23.814 --> 00:03:28.411
So, this is not less than
2.03, this one over here

00:03:28.411 --> 00:03:32.619
is greater than 2.03, so
I'm gonna rule that one out.

00:03:33.194 --> 00:03:34.275
Another way you could
have thought about this

00:03:34.275 --> 00:03:36.757
is this is two and two
tenths which is the same

00:03:36.757 --> 00:03:40.193
thing as two and 20
hundredths, which this is

00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:42.376
another way of representing that,

00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:43.933
and you say, well this
one over, the number

00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:48.082
you're comparing against is
two and three hundredths.

00:03:48.668 --> 00:03:51.241
So 20 hundredths is greater
than three hundredths.

00:03:51.595 --> 00:03:54.340
So once again this is not less than 2.03.

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.044
Here we have two and 12 hundredths,

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.688
and actually this is useful
because I already have

00:03:58.688 --> 00:04:00.615
our original number represented as

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:03.911
two and three hundredths, so the whole

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:06.599
number part, the two, is the same,

00:04:06.697 --> 00:04:08.167
so when you look at the fraction part,

00:04:08.253 --> 00:04:11.997
12 hundredths is greater
than three hundredths,

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.899
so this one is also not less than 2.03.

00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:17.523
Now what about 23 hundredths?

00:04:18.051 --> 00:04:22.503
23 hundredths, we can write
like this, 23 hundredths,

00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:26.022
or we could write it
like this, 23 hundredths,

00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:27.676
and you might be tempted to say,

00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:29.707
oh well hey, 23 hundredths,
that's bigger than

00:04:29.707 --> 00:04:32.806
three hundredths, but
remember, we have two wholes

00:04:32.806 --> 00:04:34.245
over here, we have two wholes,

00:04:34.245 --> 00:04:36.950
we have no wholes over here, we have,

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.494
over here, one would think, but you have

00:04:38.494 --> 00:04:40.746
nothing in the ones
place, over here you have

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:42.529
something in the ones place.

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:43.474
So if you look at the ones place,

00:04:43.474 --> 00:04:45.703
you have two ones, you
have zero ones over here,

00:04:45.703 --> 00:04:47.973
it doesn't matter how
many hundredths you have,

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.924
if you have less than a 100 hundredths,

00:04:50.197 --> 00:04:53.599
and so, this one is for
sure less than 2.03.

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.275
This one is, this is
significantly less than even one.

00:04:56.453 --> 00:04:58.683
So this one is the only, of the three,

00:04:58.683 --> 00:05:00.964
that is less than 2.03.

00:05:01.678 --> 00:05:03.123
Let's do one more of these.

00:05:04.174 --> 00:05:06.874
Order the following values
from least to greatest.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.481
And once again I took a picture

00:05:08.481 --> 00:05:10.455
from the Khan Academy exercise,

00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:11.964
so I'm not gonna be
able to drag 'em around,

00:05:11.964 --> 00:05:13.462
if you're doing the exercise, you would be

00:05:13.462 --> 00:05:15.075
able to drag them around, but I'm

00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:16.874
just gonna, I'm just gonna
think about the numbers

00:05:16.874 --> 00:05:18.366
and then write them in order.

00:05:19.115 --> 00:05:21.902
So, I want to write them
all, let's write them all

00:05:21.902 --> 00:05:25.983
in, as decimals, let's
write them all as decimals,

00:05:25.983 --> 00:05:27.427
I guess is the easiest thing to do.

00:05:27.812 --> 00:05:30.627
So here, this one's already
written as a decimal, 2.59.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.491
24 tenths, 24 tenths, so
let's think about this.

00:05:36.054 --> 00:05:38.207
That's 24 over 10.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.474
Well, 24 over 10 is the same thing,

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:46.474
this is equal to 20 over
10, plus four over 10,

00:05:47.257 --> 00:05:49.665
20 tenths, this is two
wholes right over here,

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:52.509
so this is the same thing
as two and four tenths,

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:58.303
two and four tenths, or,
the same thing as 2.4,

00:05:58.494 --> 00:06:01.628
two and four tenths, now if
we wanna make a comparison

00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:03.916
to two and 59 hundredths, we could throw

00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:05.913
another zero right over here, and say OK,

00:06:05.913 --> 00:06:09.168
we can view this as two and 40 hundredths.

00:06:09.477 --> 00:06:11.113
So these are all different
ways of representing this,

00:06:11.113 --> 00:06:12.437
some of you all might have
been able to go immediately,

00:06:12.437 --> 00:06:14.654
hey look, 10 tenths is one,

00:06:14.654 --> 00:06:16.958
20 tenths is two,

00:06:17.173 --> 00:06:22.173
so 24 tenths is going to be
two and four tenths, or 2.4,

00:06:22.351 --> 00:06:25.334
or 2.40, now let's try this number,

00:06:25.334 --> 00:06:27.244
two and three tenths, represented as

00:06:27.244 --> 00:06:30.691
2.3, if we want to think of it in terms of

00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:32.961
if we want to think of it
in terms of hundredths,

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:34.568
you could say, well this
is the same thing as

00:06:34.568 --> 00:06:38.061
two and 30 hundredths,
which you could also

00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.300
represent as 2.30, and
the reason why I'm adding

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.428
the hundredth there is so we can

00:06:42.428 --> 00:06:44.535
more easily make the comparison.

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:46.282
So you're comparing, you're comparing

00:06:46.282 --> 00:06:48.824
two and 59 hundredths,
to two and 40 hundredths,

00:06:48.824 --> 00:06:51.059
to two and 30 hundredths.

00:06:51.425 --> 00:06:53.369
Well, they all have two in the ones place,

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.690
they all have two in the ones place.

00:06:55.986 --> 00:06:57.955
So then we just have to
go to the tenths place.

00:06:58.122 --> 00:06:59.860
And you see, this has the most tenths,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.687
five tenths, this is the second most,

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:04.176
four tenths, and this
has the least tenths,

00:07:04.296 --> 00:07:08.005
three tenths, so, ordering
from least to greatest:

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.781
the least is two and three tenths,

00:07:10.436 --> 00:07:14.400
the least and three tenths,
which is equal to 2.3.

00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:18.521
The next, the one larger,
next larger than that,

00:07:18.573 --> 00:07:23.573
is going to be 24 tenths, 24
tenths, which is equal to 2.4,

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:30.306
and then the largest is 2.59.

00:07:30.334 --> 00:07:31.587
And once again, this only, they all have

00:07:31.587 --> 00:07:34.037
two in the ones place and
then you go to the tenths,

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:37.422
this has three tenths,
four tenths, five tenths.
