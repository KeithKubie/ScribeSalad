build the bridge with several arches so
you start from knowledge and then you

you start from knowledge and then you

you start from knowledge and then you
have to build an arch which needs from

you know this focus back to back down to
 

01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:11.630
you know this focus back to back down to
the local really by putting more like

01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640
the local really by putting more like
 

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:12.830
the local really by putting more like
you said more of the eggs back down to

01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840
you said more of the eggs back down to
 

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:13.490
you said more of the eggs back down to
the local level

01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:13.500

I was wondering from your experience

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:15.270
I was wondering from your experience
 

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:16.670
I was wondering from your experience
working across all these different

01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:16.680
working across all these different
 

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.350
working across all these different
levels of government do you still see a

01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:18.360
levels of government do you still see a
 

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.450
levels of government do you still see a
place or the for the nation-state like

01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:20.460
place or the for the nation-state like
 

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.770
place or the for the nation-state like
how will that change if there's even a

01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780
how will that change if there's even a
 

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:34.400
how will that change if there's even a
place for it at all I'm sorry of course

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:34.410
place for it at all I'm sorry of course
 

01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:36.350
place for it at all I'm sorry of course
there is a place for the nation-state

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360
there is a place for the nation-state
 

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.480
there is a place for the nation-state
and there is a place for the

I give a premium to a parameter which
 

01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:25.790
I give a premium to a parameter which
has a strong sense of belonging because

this is the justification of political
power now we may we may think that

constructed this country with their
great heart and their big river but the

01:13:57.839 --> 01:13:57.849
great heart and their big river but the
 

01:13:57.849 --> 01:14:00.510
great heart and their big river but the
reality is that in public perceptions it

01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:00.520
reality is that in public perceptions it
 

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:05.430
reality is that in public perceptions it
is a level of political legitimacy

01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440
is a level of political legitimacy

is a level of political legitimacy
it might change but it will only change

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:08.170
it might change but it will only change
 

01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:10.830
it might change but it will only change
if the sense of belonging and

if the sense of belonging and
 

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:13.950
if the sense of belonging and
togetherness of people change and this

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:13.960
togetherness of people change and this
 

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.560
togetherness of people change and this
is a very very long process and the

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:16.570
is a very very long process and the
 

01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:18.859
is a very very long process and the
experience in the Opera Union showed up

01:14:18.859 --> 01:14:18.869
experience in the Opera Union showed up
 

01:14:18.869 --> 01:14:23.700

although these countries have a lot in

although these countries have a lot in
 

01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:24.450
although these countries have a lot in
common

common
 

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:28.290

for instance in terms of values I mean

01:14:28.290 --> 01:14:28.300
for instance in terms of values I mean
 

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:32.549
for instance in terms of values I mean
if you analyze the 28 members of the

01:14:32.549 --> 01:14:32.559
if you analyze the 28 members of the
 

01:14:32.559 --> 01:14:34.020
if you analyze the 28 members of the
plan Union and you could add to that

01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:34.030
plan Union and you could add to that
 

01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:35.669
plan Union and you could add to that
Switzerland or no way because the fact

01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679
Switzerland or no way because the fact
 

01:14:35.679 --> 01:14:37.260
Switzerland or no way because the fact
that they are not a member of the Union

01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:37.270
that they are not a member of the Union
 

01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:41.609
that they are not a member of the Union
is is in history accident but if you

01:14:41.609 --> 01:14:41.619
is is in history accident but if you
 

01:14:41.619 --> 01:14:44.100
is is in history accident but if you
look at what they have in common they

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:44.110
look at what they have in common they
 

01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:47.399
look at what they have in common they
have a lot in common in values and yet

01:14:47.399 --> 01:14:47.409
have a lot in common in values and yet
 

01:14:47.409 --> 01:14:52.350
have a lot in common in values and yet
and yet there are still areas or

01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:52.360
and yet there are still areas or
 

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:56.870
and yet there are still areas or
elements where the legitimacy of a

01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880
elements where the legitimacy of a
 

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.729
elements where the legitimacy of a
supranational space and we'll see that

01:14:59.729 --> 01:14:59.739
supranational space and we'll see that
 

01:14:59.739 --> 01:15:01.700
supranational space and we'll see that
in the next European elections it's

01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:01.710
in the next European elections it's
 

01:15:01.710 --> 01:15:04.700
in the next European elections it's
probable that the level of participation

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:04.710
probable that the level of participation
 

01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:08.419
probable that the level of participation
in the European elections which is

01:15:08.419 --> 01:15:08.429
in the European elections which is
 

01:15:08.429 --> 01:15:14.399
in the European elections which is
roughly 40 percent less than national

01:15:14.399 --> 01:15:14.409
roughly 40 percent less than national
 

01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:17.279
roughly 40 percent less than national
elections and national elections by the

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:17.289
elections and national elections by the
 

01:15:17.289 --> 01:15:20.790
elections and national elections by the
way are usually less participation than

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800
way are usually less participation than
 

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.240
way are usually less participation than
local elections says I think a lot on

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:24.250
local elections says I think a lot on
 

01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:31.500
local elections says I think a lot on
this hierarchy legitimacy I must say

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:31.510
this hierarchy legitimacy I must say
 

01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:33.810
this hierarchy legitimacy I must say
that in many countries local versus

01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:33.820
that in many countries local versus
 

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.720
that in many countries local versus
national it's actually the opposite yeah

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:36.730
national it's actually the opposite yeah
 

01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:39.870
national it's actually the opposite yeah
in America generally the participation

01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:39.880
in America generally the participation
 

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.209
in America generally the participation
national elections is higher than in

01:15:42.209 --> 01:15:42.219
national elections is higher than in
