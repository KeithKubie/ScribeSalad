[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:10.085
SPEAKER 1: Good morning.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.870
Today I am delighted
to introduce

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.050
our moderator, Jack Hidary.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.170
Jack was trained in
neuroscience and AI

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.640
and then started
several companies,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.940
including dice.com, which
he took public, and remains

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.250
public, and is a leading
tech job board to this day.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.080
Jack has been
involved personally

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.040
with microfinance
for many years,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.090
both in the US and
abroad, and has

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.240
been named a global
leader of tomorrow

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.490
by the World Economic
Forum at Davos.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.740
Here at Google,
Jack is at Google X,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.580
where he is the quantum
magician and helps lead machine

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.940
learning.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.320
Please join me in
welcoming Jack Hidary.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.640
JACK HIDARY: Thanks, David.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.437
Welcome today.

00:01:04.437 --> 00:01:06.520
We have a very, very special
guest here at Google.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.040
We're happy and honored
to host this guest.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.460
In 1976, a young
professor of economics

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.460
at Chittagong
University in Bangladesh

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.320
went to a local village, Jobra.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.990
And what he realized
interacting in that village,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.550
as he talked to the woman in
the village, the various people

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.280
in village, is that if
he gave out small loans,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.330
he can create a series of
sustainable businesses.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.270
And betting on women
would be the way to go.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.390
Protip-- don't lend to a man.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.640
Lend to a woman.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.450
Number one, the stability, the
connection to the community,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.640
and also all the
people around her

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.850
that she brings aboard in
that sustainable business--

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.530
customers, vendors, employees--
as she grows that business.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.320
30 years later, the
work of Grameen Bank,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.680
started in that Jobra village,
was recognized by the Nobel

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.040
Committee with a Nobel Prize
in peace for Professor Muhammad

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.029
Yunus.

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:04.496
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Thank you.

00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:05.474
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:05.474 --> 00:02:06.941
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Thank you, Jack.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.389
Thank you.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.980
JACK HIDARY: Thank you.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.770
And so we're delighted to
have the professor here today.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.440
Just in terms of
our agenda, we'll

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.349
be chatting together, professor
and I, for about 30 minutes.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.390
And then please start
thinking of your questions.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.870
For those who ask questions,
we have a book for you.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.330
And so that's a bit of an
incentive to get up there.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.850
So professor, let's start.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.900
Professor, before we
start talking about much

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.910
of what you do
internationally, let's actually

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.130
start right here in the US.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.600
Many people know about Grameen.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.100
Many people know
the wonderful work

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.020
that you've done
all over the world.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.050
Many people do not know
about Grameen America.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.510
We have with us here
in the audience the CEO

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.610
and head of Grameen
America, Andrea Jung.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.430
Andrea, thank you
very much for coming.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.950
And people don't know that
while the model has been working

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.575
very, very well
overseas, it's actually

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:00.800
working very well here.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.716
In fact, Grameen America,
in my understanding,

00:03:02.716 --> 00:03:07.430
has already loaned out
over $700 million of loans

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.260
and to thousands and
thousands of borrowers

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.820
right here in the United States
with a 99% repayment rate.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.340
I think you're on the way to
do about $1 billion of loans

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.840
next year.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.200
So I think it's very exciting
that the model has extended

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.320
and scaled, not just in
countries like Bangladesh,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.732
Uganda, and others, but
also right here in the US.

00:03:26.732 --> 00:03:28.940
So maybe just first some
comments about your thoughts

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.460
on microfinance here in the US.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.520
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Thank you,
Jack, for inviting me here.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.860
Actually, I'm just coming
from San Jose branch

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.490
of Grameen America right here.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.520
So it's not New York
or someplace else,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.220
right next to home.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.610
California has four
branches of Grameen America,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.280
two in Los Angeles, two here in
San Jose and as well Oakland.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.440
In total, we have 20 branches
all over the United States--

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.510
seven branches in New York, in
total 11 cities, 20 branches.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.020
So within these four
branches in California,

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.470
there are 17,000 borrowers.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.740
It started four years back here.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.860
It started eight years
back in New York.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.620
So within that, we have
given out within 40 years

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.890
nearly $100 million
dollars here.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.190
Mostly women,
undocumented women.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.940
We don't require any
documents and so on.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.030
So no collateral-- just
like we do in Bangladesh.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.750
They have taken--

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.710
JACK HIDARY: So the
pattern continues.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.000
Better to bet on women than men.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.350
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Absolutely.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.960
Oh, it is 100% women.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.260
Bangladesh 97% women.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.310
Here, 100% women.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.220
So totally within
the United States,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.640
we did 20 branches,
as you mentioned.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.044
We'll be coming to about $1
billion loaned next year.

00:04:50.044 --> 00:04:51.710
That would be our
10th year of operation

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.940
since we began in one branch in
the Jackson Heights, New York.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.550
And we just recently
opened a new branch--

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.200
or about to be opened
a new branch in Miami.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.990
So this is how it's expanding.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.190
And these women,
totally about 100,000,

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.600
nearly 100,000
borrowers right now.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.630
And we are planning
how to next 10 years.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.050
Next 10 years, if you continue,
with just mere doubling

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.290
of the number of
branches from 20 to 40,

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.420
it will mean half a million
borrowers from 100,000

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.070
to half a million borrowers.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.180
And lending out to, in 10
years, about $10 billion

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.520
with the same repayment
record of near

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.610
100% without any documentations
or anything else.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.730
So that also shows
what we started back

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.730
home in Jobra village
in a small way.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.580
Not only has it expanded
globally, it reached out

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.270
to countries like United States,
a difficult life of the people

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.270
even the inner cities,
every city that you have.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.580
Everybody says we have
lots of poor people

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.900
and invite us to do that.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.730
Our problem is we
don't have a banking

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.826
license in this country.

00:05:55.826 --> 00:05:56.950
So we cannot take deposit--

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.030
JACK HIDARY: That would allow
you to scale even further.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.155
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Absolutely.

00:05:59.155 --> 00:06:00.220
We can go unlimited way.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.800
So until then, we have to
have money from somebody else

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.350
to lend out money
to reach $10 billion

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.290
in in the next 10 years.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.150
We need $250 million.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.470
So with $250 million--

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.442
JACK HIDARY: The license will
allow you to have that capital,

00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:15.025
take deposits.

00:06:15.025 --> 00:06:16.274
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Take deposits.

00:06:16.274 --> 00:06:21.040
Globally today, we have over
300 million borrowers, mostly

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.080
women, all over the world.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.530
So almost every single country
has microcredit program.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.930
Europe and Asia and everybody.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.346
JACK HIDARY: Yeah,
let's come back

00:06:29.346 --> 00:06:31.180
to Bangladesh, where
it all started.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.350
People know Bangladesh is
a very populous country,

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.407
165 million people.

00:06:35.407 --> 00:06:37.990
One thing you point out in your
book, a very interesting stat,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.540
that all those
165 million people

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.740
are living in a landmass
smaller than the size of Iowa.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.990
Now we looked it up,
checked it out on Google,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.900
that Iowa has a population
of 3.1 million people.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.770
So 165 million people
living in the space

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.790
of Iowa, not to mention which
the danger of climate change,

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.055
which Bangladesh is really
at the front line of.

00:07:00.055 --> 00:07:03.010
We're going to get to that
zero in terms of the climate

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.180
change one in a bit.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.610
But talk to me about
what you took away

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.950
from your early experiences
over the first 20 plus

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.080
years in Bangladesh,
and then how

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.630
you evolve from thinking
about just microfinance, which

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.802
is really the early part of your
career, to now social business.

00:07:17.802 --> 00:07:19.690
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: As we
did the microfinance

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.230
in a small way in
Bangladesh, as it's growing,

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.060
I was noticing
many other problems

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.130
of the people, poor people.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.870
First of all, poverty
also means poor in health

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.950
because it goes together.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.800
When you're poor, you don't
have enough nutrition and so on.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.110
And it creates lots of
problems for children, mothers,

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.460
and everybody else, poor people.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.090
So I was drawn into that, how
to address the health care

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.080
issues of them.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.700
The first one was the
problem of night blindness.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.290
Children cannot see at night.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.340
Most of the families, at
least, one or two children

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.080
do not see at night.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.264
So I got involved with that.

00:07:57.264 --> 00:07:59.180
I started trying to
understand why it happens.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.240
This is such a disease.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.370
So everybody told me that
it's vitamin A deficiency.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.010
So what we did, we
start a business

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.865
of selling vegetable seeds
after a long process of what

00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:10.990
we should do.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.930
Encourage them to grow
vegetable, eat vegetable.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.680
Close to their own home,
they can grow that.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.880
As Grameen Bank grew, as seed
businesses grew, at one point,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.270
we became the largest seed
seller in the country.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.830
And the night
blindness disappeared

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.300
from the whole country.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.730
So we saw that even in
such a simple thing,

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:31.750
you don't need a doctor.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.909
You don't need a
big infrastructure.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.654
Simply getting
used to that idea.

00:08:35.654 --> 00:08:37.320
JACK HIDARY: And on
the needs, actually,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.850
you then were able to
create a few years later,

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.100
another social business on
top of that business, which

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.510
is an insurance
program for farmers,

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.860
that when you buy the packet
of seeds, it builds in.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.090
You have insurance in that.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.490
And then actually you can
get repaid out depending

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.979
on how the weather turns out.

00:08:52.979 --> 00:08:54.520
So you actually
build social business

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.603
on top of social business.

00:08:55.603 --> 00:08:57.720
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Yes, it
kept continuing that way.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.155
Have the health insurance, more
comprehensive health insurance

00:09:01.155 --> 00:09:02.890
of any disease.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.760
We set up little clinics with
full doctors in the village

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.740
because people cannot
go to the city.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.970
So we have the doctor.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.350
We have the paramedics.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.540
We have the clinics,
everything in the village,

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.050
covered by the
insurance program.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.260
So insurance program
is a separate program

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.930
done in a business way so
we cover all the costs.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.840
Within this money that we
generate from the insurance

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.330
coverage, we have
all the facilities.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.540
We cover our cost of
every single health

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.320
centers that we do.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.780
So we have cities of
those kind of things,

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:38.030
health centers, which I still
do, and the insurance program.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.040
So we did the insurance.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.500
And now we have a joint
venture social business

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.740
with the Intel
Corporation to bring

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.520
a special kind of technology
for women for identifying

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.930
risky pregnancies.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.480
It comes in the
form of a bangle.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.030
It's a beautifully designed
ornament but very powerful

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.310
technology to
monitor your system

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:01.630
and also give you messages week
after week in the pregnancy

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.670
situation, telling
you at this week,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.360
this is a six-week-old
pregnancy.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.180
You may feel these
kind of symptoms.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.150
Don't worry about it.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.100
This is normal.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.020
But if you feel these kind
of symptoms, push the button.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.237
We'll get connected with you.

00:10:14.237 --> 00:10:15.820
JACK HIDARY: We know
from many studies

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.655
that prenatal information really
helps for successful birth.

00:10:20.655 --> 00:10:23.220
Let's talk about another social
business that you started,

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.730
Grameen Shakti, in
terms of solar power.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.450
And that gets us to
one of the zeros.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.440
We do have your book here
today, "A World of Three Zeros."

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.340
One of those zeros is
about climate change.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.800
So you put that
in the top three.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.510
And all of us are very,
very concerned about it.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.540
Bangladesh, your home
country, is, again,

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.550
on that front line with,
I think, 80 million

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.845
of people in
Bangladesh literally

00:10:43.845 --> 00:10:46.920
in the potential flood
zone as waters rise.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.555
But talk about Grameen Shakti
about not just giving away

00:10:49.555 --> 00:10:51.430
solar panels but making
a business out of it.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.650
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Yeah,
every time I see a problem,

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.450
I want address that.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.240
I create a business to do that.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.950
But the business of
the kind that where

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.430
we don't want to make
money at all personally,

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.550
company has to recover the
cost that in operation and all

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.960
the costs involved in it.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.690
And the surplus will be
plugged back into the business.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.990
Investor can take back the
investment money over time,

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.990
nothing else from that.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.380
That's the spirit in which we
created the social businesses.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.150
And we continue to do that.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.820
When we go in the villages,
we see as the sun goes down,

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.820
everything gets dark because
there is no electricity all

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.780
over Bangladesh.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.130
Only the kerosene lamp comes
up with the very feeble kind

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.420
of light that you get.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.000
You feel sorry that as if you
are still in the cave age.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.790
You have all these
Googles and everything--

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.400
didn't change the life
of Bandladeshi people.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.750
So one idea came to my mind.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.610
Why don't we bring solar energy?

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.320
Everybody said, no,
this is difficult.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.900
You can't do it in Bangladesh.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.860
It's very expensive technology.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.840
So I started looking at it, how
expensive it is, cn it be done.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.810
So finally, I decided
we'll do that.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.230
We created a company right away.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.300
We called it Grameen
Energy, or Grameen Shakti,

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.800
in Bengali, to sell
solar home system.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.930
Initially, it was so
difficult to convince people.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:01.680
They said, no, no.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.950
This is too expensive.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.020
We are not used to it.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.270
Maybe it's just a magic.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.100
It will disappear after a while.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.310
It's not a guaranteed thing.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:13.290
So then we learn how to address
this issue with the people.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.357
We ask them how much money you
spend on kerosene every month.

00:12:16.357 --> 00:12:17.190
Then they calculate.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:18.950
Ah, we spend so much.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.709
And our deal is you give me
the kerosene money every month,

00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:22.500
whatever was spent.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.112
I give you the electricity.

00:12:24.112 --> 00:12:26.570
And you continue to pay the
same amount over the next three

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:27.730
years.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.910
And then after the
three years, you

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.425
don't have to pay a penny
to anybody anywhere.

00:12:32.425 --> 00:12:34.050
So you also don't
have to buy kerosene.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.490
You don't have to pay anybody.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.010
So then this is
attractive proposition.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.260
Then it started soaring.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.540
We started selling thousands and
thousands of solar home system.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:47.160
Today, we have 1.8 million
solar home in Bangladesh.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.500
In the middle of it, we became
the largest off-grid energy

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.822
system in the whole world
because there isn't any more.

00:12:54.822 --> 00:12:56.280
JACK HIDARY: Also
you're empowering

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.360
all those entrepreneurs who
are selling the Shakti system.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.880
And that brings us really to
the second two zeros, right?

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.980
So we have first zero in
terms of climate change.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.920
And then in terms
of carbon emissions,

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.884
we want to have net
zero in terms of that,

00:13:09.884 --> 00:13:11.800
and then in terms of
unemployment and poverty.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.770
So many of your
businesses are not just

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.070
delivering interesting services
to people, such as solar power.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.450
We also can look
at Grameenphone,

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:19.324
which is [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:19.324 --> 00:13:22.410
But also empowers
thousands to millions

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.810
of entrepreneurs who
take control of that

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:25.820
and then deliver that.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.920
And Grameenphone is an example.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.670
So maybe talk about
these next two zeros--

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.300
zero unemployment
and zero poverty.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.610
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: On the zero
poverty, one of the things

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:35.330
we did, the microcredit,
to help people to start

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.080
income generation for them.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.140
And focusing on women because
they are the unused resource,

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.680
and people never thought
that women can contribute

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.680
in income of the family.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.900
We just focused on them.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.690
JACK HIDARY: What's
your statistics,

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.023
by the way, in terms of how
many people in the community

00:13:49.023 --> 00:13:51.160
are affected when you
help start one business,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.620
one microfinance business?

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.970
What's been your stats on that?

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.000
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: We don't have
stat in that research terms.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.480
But you start buying things.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.550
Somebody sells more.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.390
So you start selling
things, somebody starts--

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.805
JACK HIDARY: I've seen a
stat of about 50 to one,

00:14:05.805 --> 00:14:07.860
that for every
one woman that you

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.830
help with a
microfinance-oriented

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.410
entrepreneurship, about
50 people are directly

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.999
affected in terms of that.

00:14:14.999 --> 00:14:16.290
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: So we did that.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:21.940
And we said the poverty is not
created by the poor people.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.150
Poverty is created by
the system that we built.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.460
That's the reason how
they're poor because it

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.040
is imposed from outside.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.150
It is not grown from inside.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.990
So we are trying
to fix that system.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.560
One of the things
which came to us

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.170
quickly is the
financial system, how

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:41.100
to amend the financial system,
design the financial system

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.200
to work for the poor people.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.020
They were explaining to us,
the bankers and so on, no,

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.510
it cannot be done because
poor are not creditworthy.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.710
So I kept asking them,
should you tell poor

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.439
if they are creditworthy or
not, or whether poor people,

00:14:54.439 --> 00:14:56.480
or the people in [INAUDIBLE]
tell you whether you

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.170
are people-worthy or not.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.979
So you have to be people-worthy.

00:14:59.979 --> 00:15:01.020
So that's your challenge.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.220
You have to come up with that.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.636
But they didn't
take it seriously.

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:07.520
We took our job seriously to
make it a people-worthy system.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.060
And we created that system.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.630
And it works not only
in Bangladesh, globally.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.070
Today, Grameen Bank,
within Bangladesh,

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.050
has over 9 million borrowers.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.900
97% of them are women.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.380
And they own the bank.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.900
And the city and the board,
making decisions for the bank

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.190
and so on.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.820
Largest bank in the country
in terms of clientele.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.770
And it's very
well-run in the sense

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.830
that it is sustainable,
never lost money.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:33.730
Surpluses come.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:34.390
Profits come.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.669
Profit is distributed.

00:15:35.669 --> 00:15:37.710
JACK HIDARY: Having
borrowers on the board itself

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.100
is an unusual move for a bank.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.597
Let's just put it that way.

00:15:41.597 --> 00:15:43.180
MUHAMMAD YUNUS:
Because they own this.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.190
This is their bank.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:46.930
And they run it
for their benefit.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.230
So we wanted to see this
is an institution which

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:54.040
is designed for the purpose
of helping people come out

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.920
of poverty.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.670
So that's one that
we try to make income

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.950
generation, poverty, and so on.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.860
And one issue come that they
are all illiterate women, all

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.440
these 9 million
families that we have.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.620
We wanted to make sure the
children from those families

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.480
do not remain illiterate.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.030
So we wanted to make sure
the children go to school,

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.780
have education.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.420
Grameen Bank took
the responsibility

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.850
of ensuring children stay
in school, don't drop out,

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:23.060
and give scholarship, give
loan for higher education.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.840
But one thing came out of it.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.840
After they come out of
graduation, after that

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.270
there's no job in Bangladesh.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.450
With 165 million, you're not
creating those kind of jobs.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.020
And I couldn't give
any solution to that.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.270
Then I took a
different position.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:38.730
I challenged the young people.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.630
I said, why are you
looking for job?

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.875
Who told you to have a job?

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:44.350
I said, a job is a
completely wrong idea.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.290
I said, it is just pushing
you in the completely wrong

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:48.370
direction.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.910
You should feel like you
are not a job seeker.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.360
You are a job creator.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.510
Feel like a job creator.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:55.500
Act like a job creator.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.070
Feel big rather than feel small.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:57.850
JACK HIDARY: And
then you started

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.810
an organization called
[? Nobin, ?] which--

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.840
talk about that in
terms of that goes

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.630
now outside of just
microfinance and banking

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:05.847
into entrepreneurship.

00:17:05.847 --> 00:17:08.180
And again, your message to
millennials around the world,

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.660
not as Bangladesh,
is instead of just

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.276
thinking about
taking a job, think

00:17:12.276 --> 00:17:13.359
about starting a business.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:15.650
Obviously here in Silicon
Valley, a lot of young people

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.450
do take that advice.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.765
But you really see that
as a global message.

00:17:19.765 --> 00:17:20.890
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Absolutely.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:24.490
So we tell them,
look, your mother

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:28.569
took a loan 20 years
back, 35 years back--

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:30.670
$20, $30, $50.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:32.890
That's how her life
began with that.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.230
And she became an entrepreneur.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.890
If your illiterate
mother, who never crossed

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.500
the boundaries of
your village, could

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.910
turn into an entrepreneur
with a $40 loan,

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.410
what's wrong with you with all
the education and everything

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.490
that you have learned?

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.760
You are looking for somebody
to help you to get a good job.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.620
This is not fair.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.780
You should be thinking
about doing better than what

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.650
your mother has done--

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:57.155
JACK HIDARY: Job creation.

00:17:57.155 --> 00:17:58.940
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Job creation.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.035
You have regressed.

00:18:00.035 --> 00:18:01.270
JACK HIDARY: So how
does the system work?

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.750
How does it know--

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.166
MUHAMMAD YUNUS:
So what we did, we

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:06.340
created a social business
fund, a venture capital fund,

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.580
and asked all the young people
to come up with business ideas.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.555
If they don't have business
ideas, we go and you say,

00:18:12.555 --> 00:18:13.850
go and consult your mother.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.650
She has lots of business ideas.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.650
So why don't you should
come up with one of them

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.233
and explain to us
what you want to do.

00:18:19.233 --> 00:18:22.990
Then we invest in your business
as a partner, not as a lender.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.000
So we become a
partner with you--

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.770
it's our business
and your business--

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.321
and make it successful.

00:18:28.321 --> 00:18:30.070
And once it's successful,
return the money

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.900
that we gave you because
we are a social business.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.600
We are not interested
in your profit.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.940
Profit just stays with you.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.440
And go on.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.760
We just put you in the orbit.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.010
You go on.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.320
Be entrepreneur like your
mother, and be proud--

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.210
JACK HIDARY: So tell
us about the process.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.302
When they apply as an
entrepreneur, what happens?

00:18:45.302 --> 00:18:46.510
How do you evaluate all this?

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:48.070
MUHAMMAD YUNUS:
The basic principle

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:51.460
of what we apply is
nobody is rejected.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.860
So anybody can apply, and
it will not be rejected.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.564
And nobody's abandoned,
meaning that even if you fail,

00:18:58.564 --> 00:18:59.730
still we'll not abandon you.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:03.860
We'll take you back to and start
helping you to do it again.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.150
But no, this action means you
come up with the basic idea,

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.194
but it's not formulated
in a elaborate manner

00:19:09.194 --> 00:19:10.610
that you have not
thought through.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.880
So we'll help you
develop it in a--

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.150
go to the full extent and
make it a complete one.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.450
And then we invest in it.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.957
So we work together rather
than say, ah, your project is--

00:19:19.957 --> 00:19:22.040
JACK HIDARY: So it's not
just the money obviously.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.831
And what we learned
here in Silicon Valley,

00:19:23.831 --> 00:19:25.900
obviously, is that looking
at Y Combinator and so

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.144
many incubators, you can't
just give someone a check

00:19:29.144 --> 00:19:30.310
and invest in their company.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.018
You've got to really
nurture that company

00:19:32.018 --> 00:19:34.060
and help them along and
help shape that company.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:34.780
And that's what you're finding.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:35.510
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: That's right.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:36.220
So we do that.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.480
Only difference between the
venture capital and Silicon

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.910
Valley, perhaps, would be
that you want to profit

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.220
from the ventures itself.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.522
We took the profit part out.

00:19:46.522 --> 00:19:47.480
We are not interested--

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.580
JACK HIDARY: Social
business fund.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.420
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: It's
a social business.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.770
So you do that.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.680
That's [INAUDIBLE] people like,
OK, if I can take the money,

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.370
I can do that.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.831
And all the profit
belongs to me.

00:19:55.831 --> 00:19:56.330
Why not?

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:57.788
JACK HIDARY: And
now professor, you

00:19:57.788 --> 00:20:00.460
are scaling because, I think,
you gave a talk in India

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.740
about seven years ago.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.281
And one of the people
in the audience

00:20:03.281 --> 00:20:05.200
came up to you after
the talk and said, hey,

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.690
I'm interested in starting
a social business fund to do

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.180
this exact same thing in India.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.300
And you said, well, maybe he is.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:10.925
Maybe he isn't.

00:20:10.925 --> 00:20:11.470
Who knows?

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.150
A few months later,
you get a letter,

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.070
saying that he's
ready with $1 million.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.110
And you gave the OK
for that to happen.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.280
And now seven years later,
they're still going.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.380
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: They're
still doing very well.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.670
JACK HIDARY: So
what happened there?

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:22.670
Who was that individual?

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.390
MUHAMMAD YUNUS:
[INAUDIBLE] from Bombay.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.014
[INAUDIBLE] just
speaking [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:26.014 --> 00:20:28.590
Then he comes out
of the lecture hall.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.110
He said, I like your
idea about this.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.740
Can I do that?

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:33.970
I said, of course you can do it.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.261
But I didn't take it seriously.

00:20:35.261 --> 00:20:37.480
People say that all the
time, that I want to do it.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.010
But I don't know what happened.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.020
But this guy became
very serious.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.280
And then he wrote me a letter.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.480
He said, I want to do that.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.950
I want to use $1
million of my own money.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.440
You said, $1 million at
the beginning is enough.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.000
I said, yes, I
still believe that.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.350
Now his answer is beautiful.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.580
JACK HIDARY: Because it recycles
the money and then it grows.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.130
We might have some people in
this audience, who will tell

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.670
you after this talk, so yeah.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:00.370
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: And that'll
encourage another person

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:01.530
in Bangalore, [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:02.350
JACK HIDARY: Who also did it.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.225
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: He also
did it because he saw

00:21:04.225 --> 00:21:05.920
that [INAUDIBLE] is doing it.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.530
He met him with a conference
like ours and so on.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.360
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.870
He said, we can do it.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.775
And [INAUDIBLE],,
who is a person we

00:21:13.775 --> 00:21:15.400
knew from before from
the microfinance,

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.790
he started from microfinance.

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.192
She said, my family
foundation can give you

00:21:20.192 --> 00:21:21.150
all the money you need.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:22.550
So together, [INAUDIBLE]
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.255
created another social
business fund [INAUDIBLE]..

00:21:24.255 --> 00:21:25.290
JACK HIDARY: Right.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.290
Another example of social
business-- a lot of us

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.430
here worry about the planet
back to climate change

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:31.882
but also in terms of recycling.

00:21:31.882 --> 00:21:33.340
And so one of the
social businesses

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.580
that Yunus social
business started

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.280
is called Savco Millers,
which takes plastics

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.110
that will be
otherwise in landfill

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.307
and recycles them into a range
of consumer products out there.

00:21:44.307 --> 00:21:45.890
And that's, I think,
doing quite well.

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:46.150
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Very well.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:46.810
JACK HIDARY: Maybe talk about--

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.370
MUHAMMAD YUNUS:
Yeah, it's in Uganda.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.040
That inspired us, seeing
that they're doing.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.200
So now we look at the
plastic as a major issue.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.660
And then we're holding a
big conference in plastic

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.560
how to save us
ourselves from plastic

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.030
because the plastic ocean
and all that's happening.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:05.200
So how to take
this waste plastic

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.340
and gather and recycle
them in making it

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.490
long-lasting products, like
furniture, like utensils,

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:15.970
and people can use,
so that they do not

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.940
end up clogging the rivers,
clogging the oceans, and so

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:20.890
on and so forth.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.565
And then it's a difficulty
of plastic waste

00:22:23.565 --> 00:22:26.790
is it's now coming to
our food chain, to fish.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.600
Fish eating them and
kind of digest it,

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.850
sitting in the stomach.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.010
And we're catching them.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.190
And it passes on to us.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.710
And even our water
system in many cities

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:40.090
have very fine fibers of plastic
coming in to many cities now.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:43.060
So it's dangerous
signals already.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.790
So one of the things
that we are doing,

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.180
as an example learning
from what we did in Uganda,

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.070
take Mekong River in Vietnam.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.290
It's also filled up
with lots of plastic.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:57.282
So set up social businesses
alongside the bank.

00:22:57.282 --> 00:22:58.004
Create--

00:22:58.004 --> 00:22:59.170
JACK HIDARY: Down the river.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.461
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Down the river.

00:23:00.461 --> 00:23:03.580
So collect it, and offer people
if you bring this, we pay you.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.450
So we don't have to
employ lots of people.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:06.320
Just you bring it.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.776
[INAUDIBLE] we buy it from
you, all the waste material.

00:23:10.776 --> 00:23:12.150
You can bring it
from your homes.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.870
You can bring it
from the rivers.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:18.670
So we keep on giving a
recycle and make furniture,

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.190
housing materials so that
people can use it as a housing

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:22.149
material, and so on.

00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:24.190
So this is something that
we are going to launch.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.610
And [INAUDIBLE] everybody
else, beware of plastic

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.660
what you do, particularly
in the packaging materials,

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.380
particularly in
the water bottles,

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.210
in the straws, which
are the dangerous part

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.160
of the plastic thing.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.150
So we see it's possible.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:41.050
If you keep your mind
in a creative way

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:44.860
to address this issue, at the
same time asking the producers

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.940
and the users, be careful.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.890
Don't use it.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:48.820
Use something else.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:53.440
Or asking the chemists to come
up with biodegradable plastics

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.454
rather than the one
which is nondegradable.

00:23:55.454 --> 00:23:56.370
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Great.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:58.280
Let's come back to where it all
started, back to microfinance.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.807
I want to talk about banking
and microfinance now.

00:24:00.807 --> 00:24:02.890
What's interesting is that
here in Silicon Valley,

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.990
there's been a number
of startups who said,

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.710
many people cannot get loans
because they don't have

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:09.700
traditional credit.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.035
We have a credit system in
the US, have a credit score.

00:24:12.035 --> 00:24:13.410
One of three big
credit agencies,

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.330
and if you're not on there and
you don't have a great credit

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:17.780
score, you can't get a loan.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.470
And so these startups said,
we have a brand new idea.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.930
Our idea is we're going to
use your social reputation.

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.190
We're going to check
out social media.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.390
We're going to use
other things like that.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.730
And of course, that's not
a very new idea at all

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:31.120
because you started
that 30 plus years ago.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.914
But they actually
have been successful.

00:24:32.914 --> 00:24:34.330
And their repayment
rates are very

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.420
high because they are using
these alternative ways

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.690
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.110
But in terms of the large
banking infrastructure,

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.610
the large banks
of the world, what

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:44.770
has been their current
stance towards microfinance?

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.760
You've proved it.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.735
Grameen America now has
proved it right here

00:24:47.735 --> 00:24:48.610
in the United States.

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:50.230
This is not something
that just works overseas.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.480
It works right here at
scale, a billion dollars

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.450
of loans going out next year.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:58.840
I know Deutsche Bank had a
microfinance-oriented support

00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.956
for some time.

00:24:59.956 --> 00:25:01.080
What has been the reaction?

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.607
And what would you want
to see the large banks do?

00:25:03.607 --> 00:25:05.190
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: This
is a battle which

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.620
was going on for many,
many years with me,

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.030
challenging them why
you should do that.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:14.050
Now I keep saying that yes, it's
very difficult for these banks

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.360
to come to the poor
people because it's

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.150
designed for the rich.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.890
I said, the structure and the
architecture of the banking

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:24.350
system is it's designed
on the more you have,

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:25.780
the more you get.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.590
So it doesn't translate itself.

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:29.590
If you have less, you
don't get anything.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.850
You have none, you get nothing.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.630
So we need a different
kind of architecture

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.290
to create bank for the poor.

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:37.450
So one is a bank for rich.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:38.920
Another is bank for the poor.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.140
That's architecture that
we used in Bangladesh,

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.930
created different
legislation for ourselves

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.420
to create the bank for the poor.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.370
The bank for the poor has
not been created elsewhere.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:51.820
We have been encouraging
India for many years

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.810
to create that law.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.780
But that [? dog ?] got
[? clocked ?] in the parliament

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.530
with the select
committee, this committee.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.320
It doesn't come out
of the legislation.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.930
So we are encouraging
Indian authorities

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.920
to make big NGOs, who
became very successful, very

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.190
good microfinance program.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.610
But NGO, they always
depend on outside money.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:13.060
So I have requested the central
bank, Reserve Bank of India,

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.420
to give them a temporary
limited license that they

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.740
can do what they are doing,
nothing more than that.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.040
But they will be allowed
to take deposits.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.500
So now there are 10 licenses
that have been issued.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.420
So now they are very happy
because they have disconnected

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.474
with the international--

00:26:26.474 --> 00:26:28.140
JACK HIDARY: And
deposits are coming in.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.931
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: And
deposits are coming in.

00:26:29.931 --> 00:26:31.070
So that's another thing.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.790
So we need to create a
different sorts of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.950
I give the example of
the conventional banks

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:39.040
are like a supertanker.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.640
They go into deep sea, carry
lots of weight and materials

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.463
with them.

00:26:43.463 --> 00:26:47.730
I said, but the microcredit
is a dinghy boat.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.600
It doesn't need a deep sea.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.990
It goes from little
shallow water and so on.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.480
The architecture
of a supertanker,

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.672
you cannot design a dinghy
boat with architecture

00:26:58.672 --> 00:26:59.380
of a supertanker.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.425
Then it'll drown itself.

00:27:02.425 --> 00:27:04.550
So I said, why don't you
design a new architecture?

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.520
There's a new
legislative formula.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.290
If you have the
resource, everybody

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.980
can create a micro
[INAUDIBLE] bank.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.235
All you need to do, this is
the objective of this bank.

00:27:15.235 --> 00:27:16.600
This is how it is done.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.550
Repeatedly it has
been proven women

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:20.710
are paying-- men and
women both are paying back

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.360
payment is not a problem.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.620
And it's a sustainable.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.880
All the branches
of Grameen America

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.050
right here, which is the most
expensive country in the world,

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:30.014
they cover the cost.

00:27:30.014 --> 00:27:31.180
They cover the operational--

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.221
JACK HIDARY: Sustainable.

00:27:32.221 --> 00:27:34.050
MUHAMMAD YUNUS:
Everything is sustainable.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.080
My question is then what's
the trouble with you?

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.620
What can't the people get it?

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.490
All you do is the flourishing
of the payday lenders.

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.090
And the payday
lenders interest rate

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:51.180
starts from 500%, 2000%, 2,500%.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.290
You tolerate it.

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.410
But you don't do the thing
that people can get rid

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:55.830
of this payday lenders.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.940
Pawn shops all over the country.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.190
So this is a kind of mismatch.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.500
We don't understand why
people do in one way

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.070
and then forget
about the things.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.740
Is it completely proven things.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.974
It's not yet unproven kind
of somebody's utopian ideas

00:28:07.974 --> 00:28:08.640
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.230
JACK HIDARY: Yeah,
so professor, let

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.230
me ask you one more question.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:12.280
And then I want to
turn to the audience.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.410
So think of your questions.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.451
There's a book in the back
if you ask a question.

00:28:15.451 --> 00:28:17.190
So there's a microphone there.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.530
So you want to line up, and
ask some questions there.

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.571
But let me ask you about
when we were in New York

00:28:21.571 --> 00:28:23.940
together recently, we
talked about how today of 7

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:27.930
plus billion people on the
planet, only about 3 billion,

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.460
only about 40%, have
access to the internet.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.006
Now then the first 3
billion took about 48 years

00:28:35.006 --> 00:28:35.880
to get online, right?

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.470
Since the start of the
early stages of the internet

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.090
till today about 48 years.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:44.400
It took about 3 billion
people to get on right now.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.100
The next 3 billion probably
will not take 48 years.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.470
We're talking about
just a handful of years

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:53.156
to double in terms of going
from 3 billion to 6 billion.

00:28:53.156 --> 00:28:55.530
And, of course, there are
various projects here at Google

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:59.120
and elsewhere to even get that
last billion online as well.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.680
So within short order,
certainly a doubling

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.000
of the size of the net.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.470
Now how do you think about that?

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.090
Most of the people
who are borrowing

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:07.970
from Grameen Bank in
various countries,

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.280
most of the people involved
say with solar power

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.000
with Grameen Shakti or others do
not yet have access to the net.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.470
But they're about to get it.

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.170
How does that, first, change
the nature of microfinance

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.900
when you can communicate
with your borrower digitally

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.290
and maybe even send and
receive digital money in terms

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:28.870
of forms of e-wallets and other
kinds of transactions that way?

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:30.600
So how does it
change microfinance?

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.790
And then, also, how do you
think about it in terms

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.520
of the greater impact
on that woman in terms

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.620
of education for her
family, for her community?

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.620
So maybe just in terms
of the doubling size

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:43.830
of the internet in terms of both
the microfinance implication

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.420
and scaling of
microfinance and then

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.850
in terms of education
of the social impact.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:50.940
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: The way I
tried to explain it, I said,

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:57.030
the technology, internet, the
connectivity is like something

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:59.520
like breathing.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.630
You have to make people breathe.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:08.020
And it's air that which is
free so that you can breathe it

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.820
without saying how much bill
is coming from air to do that.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.450
So that's the kind
of ultimate, that you

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.360
have to ensure that it is
something like air you can

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.739
breathe and function together.

00:30:20.739 --> 00:30:21.780
Several things happening.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:25.790
And I mentioned one of them
in my book about [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:30.530
He has created the
computer, which

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:35.060
he thought all these Googles
and Amazons and all the things

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.520
that you have
information that you

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.630
have on the internet,
Wikipedia and so on.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:47.330
Only 3% of this information
is used by 80% of the people.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:51.630
So his idea is, why
don't I take this 3%

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:55.010
and put it as a preloaded
into the computer?

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:57.119
So if you don't worry
about all this internet.

00:30:57.119 --> 00:30:57.910
JACK HIDARY: Right.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:59.780
So it's local on the
local hard drive.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.660
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: It's just
built into the computer itself.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.780
And he has been marketing it
as a social business and so on.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.480
We're working
together on that one.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.730
If you need to refresh
that, because once

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:14.030
you preload it, very
soon, in a week or so,

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.824
it becomes kind of outdated.

00:31:15.824 --> 00:31:17.240
So all you have
to do whenever you

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.846
are visiting a connectivity
point to somewhere,

00:31:19.846 --> 00:31:20.720
you take it with you.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.120
So it is a small gadget.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.776
Plug it in.

00:31:22.776 --> 00:31:23.900
Wait for a couple of hours.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:24.935
It refreshes itself.

00:31:24.935 --> 00:31:25.640
You come back.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.840
It's as good as new.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.250
So this is one way to do that.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.800
JACK HIDARY: And that's
a social business.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.480
Endless he calls it.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.520
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: It's
called Endless, yes.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.390
Right here, he's based right--

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.500
JACK HIDARY: Yeah, right here.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.624
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Right here.

00:31:34.624 --> 00:31:37.250
So this is one, how to
address the problem of not

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.140
reaching them.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:42.290
And now bring the basic
thing that you need,

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:45.360
which everybody needs, 3% of
the totality that everybody

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.240
is looking for.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.110
And you can choose which of
the part that you must have.

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.790
So you can add that part.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:52.820
There is a standard one.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:54.020
You can have [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.510
So you need all the things here.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:01.090
And then another activity that
I see, the telecommunication.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.650
As telecommunication
expands, here

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:06.960
comes the internet facility
with the telephone itself.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.560
So in Bangladesh,
telecommunication

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:14.240
has advanced in such a way
with 165 million people,

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.960
now we have 125 million
telephone subscribers.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.860
So every family,
poor, rich, beggars--

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.210
everybody has telephone.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.540
So with the telephone, you
have internet facilities.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.810
So this is another way.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.985
But it has to be ensured that
it goes for a good purpose

00:32:26.985 --> 00:32:28.670
that you use it.

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:30.670
Question is when we
have these facilities,

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:33.860
why don't we use it for
a purpose people need?

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.440
And that's where come your
artificial intelligence

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.790
and Google X, how to make
that artificial intelligence

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.527
to bring health care for people.

00:32:42.527 --> 00:32:43.610
JACK HIDARY: On the phone.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.901
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: On the phone,
on the phone is possible.

00:32:45.901 --> 00:32:49.550
Or phone-like gadgets, which
I don't think this gadget

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.827
will remain this shape
in the next 10 years.

00:32:51.827 --> 00:32:53.410
It will be a different
shape probably.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:55.760
But whatever gadget brings
all the information,

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.860
all the communications,
everything in that gadget.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.960
Also health care
services that you

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.880
get your body is
monitored all the time.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.864
And if you have any symptoms
of any deviation from a norm,

00:33:05.864 --> 00:33:07.280
it will be immediately
warning you

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.300
what needs to be done so that
fix it so that you can protect

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:16.120
yourself by prevention rather
than let it wait for 10 years

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.720
and it becomes a
complicated disease.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.470
You are running around.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.556
There is no cure for it.

00:33:19.556 --> 00:33:21.680
JACK HIDARY: Particularly
because the mobile phone,

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.096
as you're pointing out, is
going to be the primary, if not

00:33:24.096 --> 00:33:26.277
the only connection,
that the next 3 billion

00:33:26.277 --> 00:33:27.360
will have to the internet.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.330
You look at a startup
in London called

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:31.470
Babylon, which is
delivering today

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.390
AI-based health care
and triage to about 1

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:37.100
and 1/2 million citizens in the
UK officially by the National

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.334
Health System there.

00:33:38.334 --> 00:33:40.250
And so you can see this
is becoming a reality.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:42.349
That becomes portable
to the kind of phones

00:33:42.349 --> 00:33:44.765
to deliver health care as in
your example, AI-based health

00:33:44.765 --> 00:33:44.880
care.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.180
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: So I'm
saying that if you focus

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:51.500
on the objective that is
for something to solve

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.940
people's problem, remove
the moneymaking part of it--

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.250
I'm sure you can have a
moneymaking part on business,

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:01.970
but this business is not the
intention of making money--

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:04.580
suddenly your eyes
open up completely.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.340
You see things which you
never saw with the glasses

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.889
of the dollar sign glasses.

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:13.670
Here you don't have to worry
about the stock market, IPOs,

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:14.239
and all the--

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:14.960
JACK HIDARY: Just
focus on the goal.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.370
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Just
focus on the goal.

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:17.280
And make it happen.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.080
It's possible.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.699
That's what excites me.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:21.650
Technology is so
powerful, there's

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:23.750
no reason why anybody
has any problem

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.960
in this world if you only remove
the idea of making money out

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.402
of it.

00:34:28.402 --> 00:34:30.110
So you can have two
kinds of businesses--

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.760
moneymaking business, fine.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.580
At the same time, parallely,
you can have social businesses,

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:35.950
business to solve problems.

00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:37.449
And that's the kind
of thing that we

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:38.449
are trying to encourage.

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:40.969
I'm pointing out in the
book that it's possible.

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:44.449
Every young person, every tech
person, everybody can do that.

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:47.639
And all it needs creative
power, thinking power.

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:50.401
And once you do that, lots of
things are already available.

00:34:50.401 --> 00:34:52.900
You can create a lot more, which
you have never done before.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:53.780
JACK HIDARY: Excellent.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.238
Do you love the
professor's energy?

00:34:55.238 --> 00:34:58.195
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:00.080
Four decades in.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.157
Super strong.

00:35:01.157 --> 00:35:02.240
Let's have some questions.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.120
State your name, please,
for the professor

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.080
and then your question.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.413
Make sure it's a short question.

00:35:06.413 --> 00:35:07.707
We want to get quite a few in.

00:35:07.707 --> 00:35:08.540
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:08.980
Thank you for coming.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:09.680
My name's Tony.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.050
I work here at Google.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:15.430
I wonder if you could talk
more about the zero poverty

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:17.390
because it seems to me
there's a lot of poverty

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:18.556
which you're not addressing.

00:35:18.556 --> 00:35:20.030
There's lots of refugees.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.800
There's famine.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.640
There's oppression.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.236
How do you get to zero poverty
with all these problems?

00:35:26.236 --> 00:35:29.140
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Just bring
the case of Bangladesh

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.850
because that's where we were.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:33.550
When the Millennium Development
Goals were declared,

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:37.640
goal number one was to reduce
poverty by half by 2015.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.382
So we thought this
is just [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:39.382 --> 00:35:40.840
This is what we
are supposed to do.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.462
And this is what we are doing.

00:35:42.462 --> 00:35:44.170
So we kind of expedited
the whole process

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.320
so that we can reach
out to more people,

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.850
to see that they
can start unleashing

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:52.940
their own energy, creative
power, and so on and so forth.

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.110
Ultimately, when the 2015
came with the stocktaking

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.200
what we have done,
we've done pretty good.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.130
Out of the eight goals, we
achieved six of those goals

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:04.380
by 2015.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.070
Two came close but didn't
make it completely.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:11.140
One, which made a surprising
result is the number one--

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.730
reducing poverty by half--

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:15.790
we achieved by 2013,
middle of 2013,

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.500
2 and 1/2 years
before the target.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.090
So we felt very excited because
one of the poorest country

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:22.940
in the world achieving--

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:25.850
reaching goal number
one ahead of time

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.240
is an exciting
news for all of us.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.120
And now we see [INAUDIBLE],,
sustainable development goals,

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.120
with 17 goals.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.170
Number one goal is to reduce
poverty to zero by 2030.

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:39.580
And we calculate how we have
been reducing over past.

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:41.890
And we see at the speed that
we are reducing poverty,

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:43.900
if we continue at
this speed now,

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.920
we already will be reaching
zero poverty before 2030.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.490
So this is kind of a statistical
measurement issues and so on.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:52.240
But you are right.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.660
There are many special groups--
refugees and displaced people,

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.250
war-torn people,
all kinds of people,

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:04.970
people with the difficult
to function, disabilities,

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.080
and so on.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.310
How do you address that?

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:10.120
So that's where you have to
be creative to bring that.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.790
Just because refugees, they
are not to maimed people.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.124
They are fully energetic people.

00:37:14.124 --> 00:37:16.206
JACK HIDARY: And they could
be social businesses--

00:37:16.206 --> 00:37:17.490
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Absolutely.

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:20.950
The refugee camp is a
whole society by itself.

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:21.730
There are doctors.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:22.810
There are engineers.

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:24.740
They're just simply
pushed out of the country.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.500
Doesn't mean that they
are helpless people.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.120
They don't know what
to do, how to begin.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.070
They are functioning.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.111
They are business people.

00:37:30.111 --> 00:37:31.420
They are teachers.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.830
Everybody has been pushed out.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:34.930
So you recreate the
whole thing, society.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:37.630
But the problem is host
country, most of the time,

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.102
do not allow them.

00:37:39.102 --> 00:37:40.810
They don't give you
a license to operate.

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:43.906
They don't give you permission
to get into the law business

00:37:43.906 --> 00:37:45.280
that you want to
be in the lawyer

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.821
because you are a lawyer, a very
successful lawyer back home.

00:37:47.821 --> 00:37:49.190
You can't do that.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:51.760
So those are the things to be
resolved, political things.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.750
This has nothing to do
with poverty and so on.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:56.779
Refugee doesn't mean
he is a poor person.

00:37:56.779 --> 00:37:57.820
He is a very rich person.

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.070
Today he's a refugee.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.065
So he's looking
for opportunities

00:38:02.065 --> 00:38:04.700
to get things done, started.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:05.950
So this is a special group.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.870
But there are many
groups of tribal areas

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:12.580
in remote places, people who
are never mainstream, life

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:13.300
stream and so on.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.070
That's where the
technology comes.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.860
Technology comes to bring
information, marketing

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:18.640
facility.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.650
You don't have to go to
the city to sell things.

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:22.810
You do it on the internet,
you can sell things.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:24.730
Design business
to make it happen.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:26.980
That's what we call it in
social businesses and so on.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.700
And also bring education.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.560
You don't have to go to
Harvard University to learn.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.410
Harvard University
or a university

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:37.390
anywhere in the world,
top universities,

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:39.710
they will be everywhere
in the world.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.170
Even if you are remote
a most brilliant student

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.280
in the Harvard probably will
be someone in a remote village

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.260
in a remote country in Africa.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.300
He's a brilliant student.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.610
He never left his country,
but he's performing

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:53.300
because he's attached to it.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.050
That's the technology
is making it happen.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.820
Today, everything
is possible provided

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.600
we address this issue
not for making money.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.230
Then it limits yourself.

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:04.600
You don't want to
go to the places

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.450
where your profit is not
as much as somewhere else.

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:09.850
So you start comparing.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.370
In social business,
you don't compare.

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:13.420
Here there is a problem.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.620
Here is a solution.

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:15.850
We come with a solution.

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:16.780
Only thing you want--

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:18.010
it has to be sustainable.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.080
And make sure your cost
is as low as possible

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.640
so that people can afford it.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.127
And make sure that it's
effective, it is efficient,

00:39:25.127 --> 00:39:26.710
and you can continue
to improve on it.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.126
JACK HIDARY:
Professor, let's have

00:39:28.126 --> 00:39:30.550
some more questions because
we have quite a few people.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.310
Let's have a quick question.

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:33.010
Rapid fire.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:33.460
AUDIENCE: I'll try.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.450
JACK HIDARY: OK, your name?

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.074
AUDIENCE: My name is
David [? Karem. ?]

00:39:36.074 --> 00:39:39.110
I'm a product manager
in machine intelligence.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.950
A major concern for us is
that we're replacing many jobs

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:43.210
with automation.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:48.090
Another is that algorithms
are inheriting our biases.

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:49.760
We believe these
issues are correctable.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.064
But I'd just like to ask you
maybe your thoughts on how.

00:39:53.064 --> 00:39:54.750
AUDIENCE: How to
do the correct--

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:55.500
JACK HIDARY: Wait.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.970
So it's really two
questions here.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:58.080
So you squeezed
in two questions.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:58.590
I see that.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:39:59.480
I see what you did.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.771
AUDIENCE: And I even have more.

00:40:00.771 --> 00:40:02.525
JACK HIDARY: Yeah,
so first in terms

00:40:02.525 --> 00:40:04.650
of what you and I talked
about in New York in terms

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:07.500
of machine learning
and AI is now

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.920
going to create automation,
which may threaten

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.980
quite a number of jobs.

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.460
But also a second
question he's asking,

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.500
he was asking in terms
of AI is created by us.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.420
And sometimes
without meaning to,

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.420
we're putting our own
biases into the AI.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.580
So the AI is reflecting
human biases.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:26.220
Even though it's artificial,
it's reflecting our biases.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.350
So maybe these two
questions on, how

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:30.300
do we address some of
the joblessness that

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.650
may come from AI?

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:33.900
And how do we address
some of the biases that

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.620
may unintentionally seep in?

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.640
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Yep.

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.710
I tried to explain it in
the book, just that issue,

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:43.290
by saying that we are told that
40 million young people are

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:45.420
coming to the job
market every year.

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.460
And it is growing as the
population of the world grows.

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.670
And is a threat.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:52.830
Existing unemployment
and the threat

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:55.230
of the technology and
all this existing.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:57.660
Now 40 million young
people coming every year

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.150
to the job market.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:02.610
I said, I interpret
this in a different way.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:05.790
I see 40 million
young entrepreneurs

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:07.300
entering into the world.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.700
It's an exciting news.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:12.030
It's a question of looking
at what you're looking at.

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:16.410
I said, these young
people are there

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:18.450
to be entrepreneurs,
not a job seeker.

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:21.210
Job is a tiny little
thing for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:24.090
This doesn't fit into the
destiny of a human being.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:25.860
You sacrifice your
creative power

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.960
when you take a job
in most of the cases.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.470
So I said, why
sacrifice yourself?

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:30.289
Be yourself.

00:41:30.289 --> 00:41:31.080
Be an entrepreneur.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.060
That's natural thing
to human being.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:35.660
And I give the history of
human being on this planet.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.350
I said, we are
always go-getters.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:38.500
We are problem-solvers.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.480
That's what we are.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.090
Suddenly some theory
tells you that no, no,

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:44.340
only destiny you have,
you have to find a job.

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:46.750
So every young person is
running around to find a job.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:48.780
So this is one
direction that we have.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.955
And I said, yeah,
all the technology

00:41:50.955 --> 00:41:53.100
is they're taking away jobs.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.590
I said, who creates
this technology?

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.780
There are two drivers
of technology.

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:01.400
Now I am sitting here in Google
talking about technology.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.070
There are two drivers
of technology.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:06.510
One, money makers, who want to
make money by using technology.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:09.280
So everything is
because in your head,

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.470
you have to design
something to make money.

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:13.510
So greatest money
that you can make.

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:14.540
You create the jackpot.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.170
That's the technology
you will create.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.960
This is your built-in.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.320
Another one is war makers.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.930
War makers want technology
for different purposes.

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:25.410
There is no social
driver of technology.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:27.390
If there's a social
driver of technology,

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:29.420
they will say, how
to create technology

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.710
so that every young
person in this world

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:35.320
will absolutely have all
the knowledge and education?

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.170
Let's do that.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:37.780
And it's a costless
operation we want

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:39.710
to do it because we
don't want to make money.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:42.550
Suddenly our minds
open up completely.

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:44.410
We design those
things because we

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:46.000
have no intention
of [INAUDIBLE] as I

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.020
said about the stock market
and all the investors and so

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:49.530
nothing.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:50.488
Don't worry about them.

00:42:50.488 --> 00:42:52.290
All we worry about--
have I done that?

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:53.430
Are they doing that?

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:56.990
Have I created technology
to take all the health

00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.910
care for everyone?

00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:59.410
Health care is a
problem everywhere.

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:01.540
Look at what is health
care doing in this country.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.770
It's information politics.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.100
And the cost goes up
and up and everybody.

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.150
It doesn't matter.

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:08.830
It doesn't make
sense in this day

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:10.950
and age people don't
have health care

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:12.820
as a part of a regular thing.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.700
I said, it shouldn't
worry anybody.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.700
But it does.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.550
So we can bring
technology to make

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:21.430
it happen-- education,
health care, opportunities,

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:22.690
being entrepreneurs.

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:24.490
We can create a
whole slew of things

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:26.350
within technology
so that anybody

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:28.330
who wants to get into
entrepreneurial activity

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:29.110
will help them.

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:29.990
We can do that.

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:32.570
We connect everybody
to make that happen.

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:34.660
So that's the driving
force missing.

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.850
If we have that, then
suddenly those whole new world

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:38.350
will emerge.

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:40.040
JACK HIDARY: Professor,
let's take more questions

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.220
because we have so many people
who want to ask questions.

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.220
Your name, and go ahead.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.070
AUDIENCE: My name
is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:49.390
So I was wondering about how
social businesses will compete

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.580
with money-making businesses?

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:55.570
And I think you have talked
about having different stock

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:57.820
exchanges for social businesses.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.270
So can you talk more about it?

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:05.324
How will the economic model
look for that as a social stock

00:44:05.324 --> 00:44:06.240
exchange or something?

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.970
JACK HIDARY: Yeah, let's
give some short answers

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:08.970
because we have so many people.

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:09.510
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: OK, yeah.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:11.560
In a social stock exchange,
we have been talking about it.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.850
It has not been created yet.

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:17.590
We need a minimum concentration
of social business

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:19.600
so that people could
start buying and things.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.570
We have crowd funding
kind of things today

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:23.372
in social business.

00:44:23.372 --> 00:44:25.330
People who want to invest
in social businesses,

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:28.300
they can do as a crowd funding.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:32.830
Social business funds are being
created but not an institution

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:37.930
to exchange shares
from each other.

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:38.950
That we have not done.

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:40.330
But this is an idea.

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:44.050
Some call themselves social
exchange, social stock

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:44.590
exchange.

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:46.952
But this is more of a
charity kind of thing.

00:44:46.952 --> 00:44:49.160
They're not the one that we
are really talking about,

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.709
real shares being
transferred to each other.

00:44:51.709 --> 00:44:52.500
JACK HIDARY: Great.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.416
Next question, please.

00:44:53.416 --> 00:44:54.620
Your name?

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:57.730
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm [? Sonali. ?]
And I'm from India.

00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:00.324
And my question is regarding
the agriculture sector.

00:45:00.324 --> 00:45:01.990
I know that in India,
agriculture sector

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.610
is the biggest employer.

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:06.670
And I know that's true
of Bangladesh as well.

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.140
And the problem is
that in India, I

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:12.630
see a lot of nonprofits which
are trying to help families

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:14.890
who are dealing with climate
change or bad government

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:15.940
policies.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.620
And usually what
happens is that they

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:19.690
are able to deal with them.

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:23.230
But whenever there's
climate change or something,

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:26.020
it's causing the farmers to
actually abandon whatever

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:27.510
their primary occupation is.

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:31.000
And it's leading
to open migration

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.600
because they go and seek jobs
that's construction workers.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.400
And I know that's
true of Bangladesh

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:41.770
as well, where a lot of people
are working in these cloth

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:42.810
factories, which are--

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:43.810
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Garment.

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:45.393
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the
garment factories.

00:45:45.393 --> 00:45:47.960
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: And he threatens
that [? you ?] will be over.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:48.430
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:49.096
So my question--

00:45:49.096 --> 00:45:51.330
JACK HIDARY: Not me but
something out there.

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.510
Yeah, so bring us
to your question.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:56.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
my question is that

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:58.180
even if you build up
a social enterprise

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:02.120
and you're kind of
funding enterprises

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.910
which are very
susceptible to, say,

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:05.977
climate change or
government policies,

00:46:05.977 --> 00:46:07.060
how do you deal with that?

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.860
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Quickly
to respond to that,

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:12.511
you have been talking about NGOs
and nonprofit, not-for-profit

00:46:12.511 --> 00:46:13.760
entrepreneurial organizations.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.700
Yes, they have their
own way of doing that.

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:19.590
Because we tried to bring
it to a business formula.

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.400
So that you are responsible.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.920
You make sure your cost
is covered by operations

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.550
so that you sustain yourself.

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:26.980
Continue in business.

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:31.990
And no feel uncertainties
of NGO world

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:34.660
because funding has to be
done from outside every year

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.940
to keep you running.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:40.130
So agriculture is a fantastic
area of a social business.

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:41.902
And we see everyday examples.

00:46:41.902 --> 00:46:43.360
There are many
examples in the book

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.690
also that what can be done.

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:49.470
And one example is, quickly,
one company, big company,

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.160
was involved in potato.

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.950
Got interested in
social business.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:53.800
We did that.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:57.760
Then what he did, he created a
new social business in Europe.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.540
30% of the vegetables grown
in Europe are thrown away.

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.240
What is their problem?

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.890
What did they do wrong?

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:09.310
They are not shaped in a way the
consumers have been interested.

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:11.260
A cucumber fat on
one side, thin--

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.010
JACK HIDARY: The
bananas, the wrong angle.

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:14.490
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: The wrong angle.

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:16.900
In the industry, it is
known as ugly vegetable.

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.460
And the ugly vegetable
happens to be

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.900
30% of the total
vegetable production.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.560
So what this company has done,
created a new social business

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:24.564
company.

00:47:24.564 --> 00:47:26.980
Absolutely nothing to do with
making money for themselves.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.980
To solve the problem of
throw away good food.

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.530
So they buy up all the
throwaway vegetables

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:36.480
and chop them up and make nice
little packages, calling them

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.170
ready-to-cook vegetables.

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:39.670
JACK HIDARY: So you
didn't know when

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:41.550
you're eating it that it
was an ugly fruit before.

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:43.383
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Whether
it ugly or not ugly,

00:47:43.383 --> 00:47:46.000
the shape doesn't matter
when you cut them up.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:46.900
So people like it.

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.910
It's very cheap because it came
from a very different source.

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:53.590
So this is one area, how to
protect from the wastage.

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.140
And marketing is always a
big problem in agriculture

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.940
everywhere all over the world.

00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.440
Coffee growers
don't get the money

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.120
that the coffee drinkers
are paying for it.

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.810
Comparison is
unbelievable comparison.

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:07.810
It's a penny versus several
dollars kind of thing.

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:10.180
Cotton growers don't get
the money what the cotton

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.680
consumers are paying.

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.560
Similarly cocoa
growers don't get

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.920
the money what chocolate
eaters are paying them.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:21.610
So we create a social
business in the middle.

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.160
We take the coffee
from the growers

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.690
and sell it in the
ultimate market.

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:28.847
Whatever processing is needed,
we do that and bring the money

00:48:28.847 --> 00:48:29.680
back to the growers.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.430
Because we are social
business, we are not

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:32.830
interested in making money.

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:34.340
We are only solving
your problems.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:35.450
That's it.

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:38.860
Once you have that idea, this
is a very, very simple idea.

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:41.200
You can make a more
interesting thing

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.920
to make that happen
back and forth.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:46.000
So the problem of market--
and this is a huge problem.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.600
Wastage is a big problem.

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.900
How to make [INAUDIBLE]
save this wastage.

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.300
Many [INAUDIBLE] gave
one after the production.

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.720
Before the production
and after the eating,

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:58.240
there is a lot of [INAUDIBLE]
Lots of waste in the industry,

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.250
in the agriculture
industries, lots of waste.

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:02.740
And you can create social
business to bring it back

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.180
into the good food chain.

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.750
So it's a question of
where our mind goes.

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:10.110
If there is a problem, if our
mind goes in a simple way,

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:14.750
removing all the hazy ideas
of profit-making into that,

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:17.180
then suddenly you'll see
in a very transparent way.

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:19.750
And your creativity
comes into action.

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:22.990
You create a business, which not
only works in this tiny corner

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:24.080
or where you're working.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.080
Suddenly it becomes a
global because the problem

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:26.920
is everywhere.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.500
Whether you're working in
India, whether you're in USA,

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.120
in Africa, it doesn't matter.

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.650
And amazing things happen.

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:36.750
Similarly, from the agriculture,
you move into the forestry.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:40.450
Today, deforestation is
the standard in everywhere.

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:42.040
You can turn it
completely around

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:45.320
because forestry is a very good
income-generating activity.

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.080
So if you see that possibility,
instead of leaving forestry

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:50.200
as a ministry of forestry
in the government,

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.674
nothing will happen.

00:49:51.674 --> 00:49:52.590
Nothing will get done.

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:53.950
It will get on deforestation.

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:56.340
If people say, no, we
want to keep the forest.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.260
We want to make sure
the forest grows.

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.610
We want to make sure
deforestation is reversed.

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:04.299
And deforestation in a social
business way, it's impossible.

00:50:04.299 --> 00:50:05.840
It's a question of
changing the mind.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:06.225
That's all.

00:50:06.225 --> 00:50:07.641
JACK HIDARY: Thank
you, professor.

00:50:07.641 --> 00:50:08.860
Next question, please.

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:11.130
AUDIENCE: My name is Dan.

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:13.860
Are there barriers to
creating social businesses

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.920
either in Bangladesh
or maybe in the US, who

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.600
are more familiar that are
preventing people, either legal

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.340
or do we need encouragements?

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.816
And because obviously we
have lots of nonprofits,

00:50:22.816 --> 00:50:23.940
which is a different model.

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.190
But probably a lot of people
who are doing nonprofits,

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:30.550
would they be better doing
social business in some cases?

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:32.730
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: We don't
face any hostility.

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:34.209
The oh, you're social business.

00:50:34.209 --> 00:50:35.500
You're taking away my business.

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.740
Nothing like that because
in most of the cases,

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:40.096
there is none
operating in there.

00:50:40.096 --> 00:50:41.970
For example, if you want
to bring clean water

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:45.240
to the villages as a social
business so that they can drink

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.590
clean water.

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:48.570
We do that because
nobody else is there.

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:50.176
Even the profit-makers
is not there.

00:50:50.176 --> 00:50:52.050
AUDIENCE: Are other
legal barriers, like in--

00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:53.175
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: No, no, no.

00:50:53.175 --> 00:50:55.050
We said, all the laws
that are existing,

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:56.070
we follow the same law.

00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:58.950
We don't want to
violate any law.

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:01.890
We proceed with all the
regularity authority,

00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:03.280
restrictions, and so on.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.580
We don't want to
disrupt anybody's work.

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:09.120
We want to play in the same
marketing place, no problem.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.350
If somebody's already
doing it, we applause them.

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:12.180
You are doing it.

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.721
But we want to do it, make it
cheaper for the people that you

00:51:14.721 --> 00:51:15.390
cannot reach.

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:16.720
That's fine with us.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.650
So we don't see anybody as
taking away our business

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:22.410
because we don't want to protect
our business because we are not

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:23.740
here to make money.

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.680
When you to make
money, then you see

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:29.810
as a kind of somebody who's
competing with you, taking away

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:30.510
something.

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:31.590
We say, you want to work?

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:33.540
We want to work to
solve the problem.

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:34.810
You want to make money?

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:35.310
Go ahead.

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:36.600
Make money as long as you can.

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.520
But we are coming to
make it cheaper, better

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.990
for people who are
not rich by you.

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.490
That's all.

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:43.115
JACK HIDARY: Professor,
here in the US,

00:51:43.115 --> 00:51:46.200
we've seen the rise of the B
corp movement, which is exactly

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.280
the end to this point.

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.450
Because when you start a C
corp or a traditional LLC,

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:54.960
there's certain responsibilities
you have to your investors.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.720
And there is this expectation
of dividends going out

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:00.090
of the company on
a typical basis.

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:03.780
The B corp allows for more of
a social business structure.

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.460
Started in Vermont
initially, but now

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.482
has spread to a good number
of states across the US

00:52:08.482 --> 00:52:10.440
because companies are
incorporated at the state

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.180
level, not at the federal level.

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:14.040
And we're seeing a
lot of good traction

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.540
with the B corp
model, which is one

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:17.970
of the primary social
business models out there.

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.250
So I think we're seeing
some good initial traction.

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:24.600
And it does help to smooth
out some legal difficulties

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.085
that if you try the C
corp social business,

00:52:27.085 --> 00:52:28.210
you might have some issues.

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.187
So some good signs, I would say.

00:52:30.187 --> 00:52:31.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:32.103
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Thank you.

00:52:32.103 --> 00:52:33.562
JACK HIDARY: Next
question, please.

00:52:33.562 --> 00:52:34.936
We are just moving
through these.

00:52:34.936 --> 00:52:35.510
This is good.

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:36.176
Good, professor.

00:52:36.176 --> 00:52:38.530
AUDIENCE: Going back to giving
out loans to women only,

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:42.100
I was curious if it's because
you try the same model with men

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:44.590
first and you weren't
getting the money back.

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:47.410
Or where was this decision
in the trial and error?

00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:52.290
And then also subquestion
is of these businesses

00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:54.790
that these female entrepreneurs
started either in Bangladesh

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:56.665
or around the world,
was there a common trend

00:52:56.665 --> 00:52:58.500
in the businesses
that they started

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:00.700
or the ones that
were successful?

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:02.590
What types of businesses
were successful?

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:04.340
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: On
the men-women issue,

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:07.300
that we started this
in Grameen Bank when

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:12.100
we just a little initiative
in one village in Jobra,

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:15.970
which is just next to
the university campus.

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:18.070
I have been criticizing
the bankers a lot.

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:20.920
I was very nasty towards
the bankers in Bangladesh,

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.630
criticizing them that are wrong.

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:24.230
Their design is wrong.

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:25.780
They created an
institution which

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:27.910
doesn't make any
sense because banks

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:29.380
are supposed to lend money.

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:31.030
They do it in such a funny way.

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:33.482
They lend money to people who
already have lots of money.

00:53:33.482 --> 00:53:35.690
They don't lend money to
people who don't have money.

00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:37.240
I said this should
be the other way.

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.590
That's the logic.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:40.120
So they laugh, like he laughed.

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.286
Everybody laughed and said--

00:53:41.286 --> 00:53:42.659
[LAUGHING]

00:53:42.659 --> 00:53:44.450
JACK HIDARY: That's
the evil banking laugh.

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.650
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Absolutely.

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:46.120
What a silly thing to ask.

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.740
That's what we do.

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:49.450
And then I hit on another point.

00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:51.994
I said, you also don't
lend money to women.

00:53:51.994 --> 00:53:53.410
Because in Bangladesh,
at the time

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:55.420
that I was raising
this question,

00:53:55.420 --> 00:54:01.130
99% of the borrowers of all the
banks of Bangladesh are men.

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:03.120
1% or less are the woman.

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.710
So I said, you are not
only against poor people.

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:09.830
You are also against women
because your results show that.

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:12.260
This is not me making it up.

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:14.330
So they said, no, no,
women don't come to us.

00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:17.540
I said, no, your rules are so
bad because when a woman comes

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:20.000
to the proposition with
if she's a rich person,

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.360
she's a able person,
always manager will

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:26.600
look at the business
proposition and then say,

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.300
have you discussed
with your husband?

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.040
And then he will
say, why don't you

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:34.580
bring your husband along next
Monday so that we can discuss?

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.950
I said, has it ever happened
in the history of banking

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:40.520
in Bangladesh a man brought
his proposal to a manager

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:43.660
and manager said, have you
discussed with your wife?

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.600
Why didn't you bring
your wife with you

00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:46.880
so that we can discuss that?

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.017
And I said, that's where
the discrimination begins.

00:54:49.017 --> 00:54:50.850
And that's why people
don't feel encouraged.

00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:53.850
Women don't feel-- when I
begin, I wanted to make sure

00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:57.450
I correct it because I've
been so vocal against it.

00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:59.710
So I shouldn't commit
the same mistake.

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:02.670
So I wanted to make sure half
the borrowers in my program

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:04.640
are women.

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.260
And it was a tough job.

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:07.890
Women say, no, no,
don't give it to me.

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:09.670
Give it to my husband.

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:11.230
So I don't know what to do.

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:13.270
I keep on explaining
to my students

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:17.019
because I'm working with the
students, who work together.

00:55:17.019 --> 00:55:19.060
They were very frustrated
working with the women.

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:20.890
These are girl students
who were working

00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:22.810
with me to go to the women.

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:25.000
They said, maybe we
should forget about them.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.500
They said, they
don't know anything.

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:27.970
I said, no, that's not the way.

00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:30.430
When you hear that they are
saying they cannot do anything.

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:31.900
They are afraid of money.

00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:34.060
They don't want to create
trouble for the family.

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:37.110
Always remember this
is the history which

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:39.280
is making them say
that because history

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.460
made them so fearful of
everything that happens new.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:45.130
So they want to cling
to the old things.

00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:46.730
They don't want to
expose themselves

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:49.540
on new danger of
exposing themselves.

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:52.300
I said, we have to peel off
the fear layer by layer.

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.260
It takes time.

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:54.740
So we go back again and again.

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:55.870
Build confidence in them.

00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:58.210
It took us six
years in doing that.

00:55:58.210 --> 00:56:00.100
Then we came to 50-50.

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:02.740
Then we saw something
new coming up.

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:05.080
Money going to the
family through women

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.169
brought so much more
benefit to the family

00:56:07.169 --> 00:56:09.210
than the same amount of
money going to the family

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:10.270
through men.

00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:11.970
And you can write a
whole book on that.

00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:16.960
The kind of differences that you
see is so visible, so obvious

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.390
doing that every
family have them.

00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:21.700
Then we said, why are we
having this restriction

00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:23.680
of 50% for women?

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.270
Why don't you open it up?

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:27.340
Then we opened it up
and focused on women.

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:30.880
It slowed down our work so
much because men are just

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.410
jumping around to take money.

00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:35.510
Here, women are so
reluctant, so make sure

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:37.390
that she understands everything.

00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:39.140
So we accepted that.

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:44.270
But gradually, it jumped up to
60%, 70%, and went beyond 90%.

00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:46.570
Then we say, let's slow
down so that we can

00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:49.610
keep some men into the picture.

00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:51.520
So we stopped in 97%.

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.380
That's how we
remained 97% forever

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:55.990
so that we don't
eliminate everything.

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:59.200
But when it came to the USA,
they didn't bother about men,

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.940
just went straight to women.

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.764
And that's done
fantastically well.

00:57:02.764 --> 00:57:03.930
JACK HIDARY: Good learnings.

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:05.140
One last question, please.

00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:06.400
But don't worry, you
guys will get books.

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:06.720
Don't worry.

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.219
Go ahead.

00:57:07.219 --> 00:57:08.005
One last question.

00:57:08.005 --> 00:57:08.230
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:09.188
JACK HIDARY: Your name?

00:57:09.188 --> 00:57:10.369
AUDIENCE: I'm Melissa.

00:57:10.369 --> 00:57:12.160
Earlier you were
mentioning how it's really

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.480
exciting that 14 million people
a year entering the workforce

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.290
and how everyone should
be an entrepreneur

00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:18.609
and go into social business.

00:57:18.609 --> 00:57:20.650
But it seems to a very
small percentage of people

00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:22.233
are willing to become
an entrepreneur.

00:57:22.233 --> 00:57:24.280
And even a smaller
percentage are

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:26.707
willing to go into
social business.

00:57:26.707 --> 00:57:29.290
What's going to have to change
to mobilize young people to get

00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:30.250
into social business?

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:32.530
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: See, I
have always feel inspired.

00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:36.375
The previous question was what
is successful in businesses

00:57:36.375 --> 00:57:38.950
and new entrepreneurs
that are coming up.

00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:42.880
I feel encouraged what I already
explained to the young people

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.110
in Bangladesh.

00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:48.190
If your illiterate mother,
who never had any experience

00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:49.810
of business of any type--

00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:51.400
she doesn't even watch TV.

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.180
She doesn't know how
business is done.

00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:57.280
If she can become
entrepreneur, not one,

00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.220
millions of them in
Bangladesh, now probably

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:02.170
millions of them in the US.

00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:05.320
And 300 millions
of them worldwide.

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.170
I don't believe people
are not entrepreneur.

00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:10.030
I believe they are entrepreneur.

00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:13.840
Simply, our system that we build
suppressed it, locked it up,

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.250
said you have to have a job.

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:17.520
So everybody is running
around with the CV,

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.770
with the recommendations,
telephone calls

00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:22.850
so that I can get a
little job with you

00:58:22.850 --> 00:58:24.420
so that my life is done.

00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:27.330
I said, that's not what the
human beings are created for.

00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:28.870
It is wrongly designed.

00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:31.540
Our mind is twisted
around to make

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:34.870
us believe that job is the
only thing that we have to do.

00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:37.210
Our education system
is twisted around.

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:40.180
Our family conversation
are twisted around

00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:41.770
because that's what
the theory says.

00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:43.394
You are born to work
for somebody else.

00:58:43.394 --> 00:58:45.650
I said, we are not born
to work for somebody else.

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:46.990
I'm a free person.

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:49.110
I do things on my own way.

00:58:49.110 --> 00:58:51.700
Unleash my own energy
on creative power.

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:55.840
So once we establish that,
everybody will be entrepreneur.

00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.820
So why did all these
women become entrepreneur?

00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:01.050
Because you put the
money on the table.

00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:02.720
That's the only trick we play.

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.530
When you see money
on the table, I said,

00:59:04.530 --> 00:59:05.530
why am I sitting around?

00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:06.140
There's money.

00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:07.740
I can do something.

00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:09.860
So today, that
money doesn't exist.

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:12.440
In the schools and
colleges, you traditionally

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:15.020
see recruiters coming
from different companies.

00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:16.460
You see that all the time.

00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:18.880
And see which of the
recruiter you can discuss,

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:23.370
see who can get a
job in that company.

00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:25.040
No financier comes
into the campus

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.930
saying that if you want
to be entrepreneur,

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:28.670
this is what your
facility would give.

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:29.880
This is our social venture.

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:30.754
This is this venture.

00:59:30.754 --> 00:59:31.310
This is that.

00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:33.030
We are better than anybody else.

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:35.060
Even if you fail,
it's OK for you.

00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.590
All kinds of
attractive offer there.

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:37.790
Nobody comes.

00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:40.220
So I don't know how do
we become entrepreneur.

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.410
In empty hand, you
cannot be entrepreneur.

00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:44.060
You need some
money in your hand.

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.670
And the financial institution
is responsible to provide

00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:47.660
that money.

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:51.380
I said, in order to catch a
dollar, you need a dollar.

00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:53.870
Without the first dollar, you
don't catch the next dollar.

00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:55.790
But nobody gives
that first dollar

00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:58.750
in the hands of an
unemployed young person.

00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:00.470
That's the tricky thing.

01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:03.070
You may have a most
brilliant idea of business.

01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:05.140
You go to any
bank, any investor.

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.300
They will just throw you out.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.829
Who are you?

01:00:08.829 --> 01:00:09.620
That's the trouble.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.942
JACK HIDARY: Professor, it
is an honor and pleasure

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:13.900
to have one of the true
visionaries of our time

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.156
here with us today.

01:00:15.156 --> 01:00:17.030
Please let me thank
Professor Muhammad Yunus.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.113
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Thank you.

01:00:18.113 --> 01:00:18.810
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:20.350
JACK HIDARY: "World
of Three Zeros."

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.300
We have some of the back
for the questioners.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:23.460
Thank you very much, professor.

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:24.543
MUHAMMAD YUNUS: Thank you.

01:00:24.543 --> 01:00:25.270
Thank you.

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:26.230
Wonderful.

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:28.080
Thank you, too.
