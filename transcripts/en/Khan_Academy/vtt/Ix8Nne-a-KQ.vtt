00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.700
Is the system of
linear equations below

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.370
consistent or inconsistent?

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.330
And they give us x
plus 2y is equal to 13

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.590
and 3x minus y is
equal to negative 11.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.205
So to answer this
question, we need

00:00:13.205 --> 00:00:16.430
to know what it means to be
consistent or inconsistent.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.460
So a consistent
system of equations.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.815
has at least one solution.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.510
And an inconsistent system of
equations, as you can imagine,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.685
has no solutions.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.300
So if we think about
it graphically,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.600
what would the graph of a
consistent system look like?

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.620
Let me just draw a
really rough graph.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.750
So that's my x-axis,
and that is my y-axis.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.480
So if I have just two
different lines that intersect,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.250
that would be consistent.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.860
So that's one line, and
then that's another line.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.300
They clearly have
that one solution

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.300
where they both
intersect, so that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.980
would be a consistent system.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.179
Another consistent
system would be

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:08.970
if they're the same
line, because then they

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.430
would intersect at
a ton of points,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.250
actually at an infinite
number of points.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.520
So let's say one of the
lines looks like that.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.190
And then the other line is
actually the exact same line.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.200
So it's exactly
right on top of it.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.220
So those two intersect at
every point along those lines,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.500
so that also would
be consistent.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.010
An inconsistent system
would have no solutions.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.230
So let me again draw my axes.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.940
Let me once again draw my axes.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.470
It will have no solutions.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.300
And so the only way
that you're going

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.030
to have two lines
in two dimensions

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.280
have no solutions is if
they don't intersect,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.990
or if they are parallel.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.580
So one line could
look like this.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.802
And then the other line
would have the same slope,

00:01:52.802 --> 00:01:54.010
but it would be shifted over.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.056
It would have a
different y-intercept,

00:01:56.056 --> 00:01:57.180
so it would look like this.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.900
So that's what an inconsistent
system would look like.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.720
You have parallel lines.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.650
This right here is inconsistent.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.610
So what we could do is
just do a rough graph

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.250
of both of these lines
and see if they intersect.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.620
Another way to do it is,
you could look at the slope.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.700
And if they have the same slope
and different y-intercepts,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.610
then you'd also have
an inconsistent system.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.410
But let's just graph them.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.506
So let me draw my x-axis
and let me draw my y-axis.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.389
So this is x and then this is y.

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.430
And then there's a couple
of ways we could do it.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.346
The easiest way is really
just find two points

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:41.730
on each of these that satisfy
each of these equations,

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.590
and that's enough
to define a line.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.230
So for this first one, let's
just make a little table

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.890
of x's and y's.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.940
When x is 0, you have
2y is equal to 13,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:05.170
or y is equal to 13/2, which
is the same thing as 6 and 1/2.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.710
So when x is 0, y is 6 and 1/2.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.390
I'll just put it
right over here.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.440
So this is 0 comma 13/2.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.890
And then let's just see
what happens when y is 0.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.950
When y is 0, then
2 times y is 0.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.230
You have x equaling 13.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.150
x equals 13.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.810
So we have the point 13 comma 0.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.920
So this is 0, 6 and
1/2, so 13 comma 0

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.420
would be right about there.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.780
We're just trying to
approximate-- 13 comma 0.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.750
And so this line right
up here, this equation

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.480
can be represented by this line.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.880
Let me try my best to draw it.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.050
It would look
something like that.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.950
Now let's worry about this one.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.400
Let's worry about that one.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.980
So once again, let's make a
little table, x's and y's.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.840
I'm really just looking for
two points on this graph.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.970
So when x is equal to
0, 3 times 0 is just 0.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.460
So you get negative y
is equal to negative 11,

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.890
or you get y is equal to 11.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.380
So you have the point 0, 11, so
that's maybe right over there.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.110
0 comma 11 is on that line.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.680
And then when y is 0,
you have 3x minus 0

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.640
is equal to negative 11, or
3x is equal to negative 11.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.250
Or if you divide
both sides by 3,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.060
you get x is equal
to negative 11/3.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.320
And this is the exact same
thing as negative 3 and 2/3.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.490
So when y is 0, you have x
being negative 3 and 2/3.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.600
So maybe this is about
6, so negative 3 and 2/3

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.090
would be right about here.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.440
So this is the point
negative 11/3 comma 0.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.380
And so the second equation will
look like something like this.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.790
Will look something like that.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.270
Now clearly-- and I might have
not been completely precise

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.230
when I did this hand-drawn
graph-- clearly these two

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.790
guys intersect.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.360
They intersect right over here.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.734
And to answer
their question, you

00:05:08.734 --> 00:05:11.380
don't even have to find the
point that they intersect at.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.060
We just have to
see, very clearly,

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.950
that these two lines intersect.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.480
So this is a consistent
system of equations.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.510
It has one solution.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.840
You just have to have at least
one in order to be consistent.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.567
So once again, consistent
system of equations.
