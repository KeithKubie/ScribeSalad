bipedal, naked, large brain. Long the

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.650
master of fire, tools, and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:48.630
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.310
- [Anne] So I wanted to say just a couple
of things about today's talks, which I

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:22.720
think you'll all agree were fantastic and
very interesting. Yes. Hopefully I'm not

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.550
as...when I think back about all that's
really happened and developed in the field

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.760
of ancient DNA, it's really quite amazing.
And you know, I'm older than I hopefully

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:44.790
look, but when I was a graduate student in
1990, I actually started working on

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.940
ancient DNA and this very new field of
ancient DNA. There were only a handful of

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.560
papers that were published. And I talked
to my adviser and got him to agree that I

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.930
could give this a try and I started doing
some preliminary work with this brand new

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.760
technology called PCR, right, and it was
great, and I managed to work really hard,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.870
and I got a few bands, and I did these
analyses and saved them on my five and a

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:21.570
half inch floppy. And my adviser, it was
very laborious let me tell you, my adviser

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.690
said, "There's this new conference,
international conference on ancient DNA.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.090
Why don't you go to that and talk about
what you've done?" And so, I printed out

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.400
my paper on the dot matrix and off I went
to Nottingham, England, and there were

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.820
really only 30 or 40 of us there. It
included Svante Paabo, Erika Hagelberg,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:50.000
and Dan Bradley, who's done some amazing
work on domestication of cattle. And I

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.230
don't think any of us there thought that
now we would be looking at these genome

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.420
sequences from archaic humans. I think
that was really beyond the pale because if

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:11.410
you think back, those of you who were even
alive, some of you were I know. That was a

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.180
time when the human genome project was
just beginning and these technological

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.040
advances have both in terms of just the
sequencing technology, but also the

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.160
computational biology necessary to analyze
these data have just...it's been really

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.570
astounding. And with the Neanderthal
genome project these ancient DNA methods

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:39.610
were really pushed farther and like
Matthias Meyer, I'm very excited to see

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.130
what comes next. You know, also in the
early 90s, we were in the out of Africa

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.760
versus multi-regionalism debate and I
think we now are, it's obvious from

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.670
today's talks that we're in the mostly out
of Africa, look at all these interactions

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.850
and admixture events that have happened
and it's really quite fascinating. Another

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.180
thing that I would point out is the
analysis of the modern human genomes is

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.760
imperative for understanding the context
and seeing these patterns of local

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.460
adaptation and then now with the ancient
data of seeing how they develop through

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.740
time. I think Johannes' talk was really
lovely in giving us that really fine grain

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.820
sense of population history in Europe. And
we're beginning to also see that to some

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.820
extent in the Americas. I think it's also
fascinating to think that the archaic

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:39.290
human cousins are still with us, in a
sense. In that we have these pieces of DNA

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:46.240
that give us a really fascinating insight
into what they have given us, and also

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.030
into what they haven't given us. I think
is also quite fascinating. And so, now I

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.780
think perhaps we are ready for some
questions. All right, so I'm going to turn

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.394
it over to Ed for the first 20 minutes of
questions.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.750
- [Ed] Thank you. Anne, you have your work
cut out for you too there are a bunch of

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.600
questions for the second half. I have
picked out a few of the many fantastic--

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.330
we have a question over here if someone
wants to get that-- questions that were

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:27.490
submitted via these cards, so speakers
from the first part, on your toes. So the

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:38.490
first one comes for Sriram, and the
question is "Did we inherit diabetes

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.710
strictly from the Neanderthals?" And I
would like to embellish this question a

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.540
little bit. Is there any particular single
thing that we can say, "We got that from

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.610
Neanderthals?"

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:59.540
- [Sriram] Yeah, I think this was also
pointed out in Tony's talk, which is for

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.700
most phenotypes that we care about, they
are what we call complex phenotypes which

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.990
means they are influenced my a multitude
of genes, each of which has a small

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:17.010
effect, coupled with the environment. So
given that one of these genes, or a few of

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:25.020
them came in from the Neanderthals doesn't
really tell us that Neanderthals gave

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:32.010
us...are the reason why we have increased
risk for type 2 diabetes. So they do

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:38.470
moderate the risk, to a small extent, but
by no means are they the single dominant

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:45.940
reason why we have type 2 diabetes, or for
that matter, any other complex phenotype.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:53.230
I think we have yet to find a good example
of a phenotype where Neanderthals gave us

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.570
"the" gene for the trait of interest.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:07.950
- Thank you. So the next question is for
Brenna, and this is concerning the much

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:14.250
older Y chromosome that was found in
current populations in West Africa. That

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.890
was a bit of a stunning thing that this Y
chromosome tree we thought we knew

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:23.220
forever, then, I think, initially was
found in someone in South Carolina, then

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:29.420
later West African population. “How does
this influence how we interpret African

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.620
population history?”

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.960
- [Brenna] That's a great question. Sorry,
that's a great question. Yes, there have

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.950
been initially this one very divergent Y
chromosome that was found in an African

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:46.980
American individual and coalesces much
deeper in the tree than the Y chromosome

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:52.960
phylogeny that I presented, approximately
200,000 years ago. And I personally think

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:59.900
that this is probably the best evidence we
actually have for archaic intergression

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:05.940
within contemporary African populations. I
would like to point out that it's

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.580
basically only been found in a handful of
individuals, so it doesn't really explain

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:15.350
the vast majority of Y chromosome
variation that you see in Africa, which is

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:20.810
really more representative of the tree
that I put up, but it's certainly

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.250
suggestive of archaic intergression.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:32.570
- Great. So the next series of questions
here, kind of on the theme for Christina

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:38.940
Warner. First one, “How is the use of
mouthwashes seriously effected our

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:44.280
microbiome, has that happened.” So a very
kind of contemporary thing, and then a

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:50.380
similar question. “What about cooking? Do
we see anything in the record of dental

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.330
calculus to reflect any kind of changes
that might have happened around cooking

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.444
our food?”

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:04.840
- [Christina] So these are great
questions. I can leave you assured that

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.210
mouthwash actually does absolutely nothing
except give you fresh breath for a brief

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:14.230
period of time. So it doesn't appear to
really alter, in any persistent way, your

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.830
microbiome. What probably is having a much
more intense effect, is toothbrushing,

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:23.930
obviously you're constantly removing the
plaque from your teeth. And as a result,

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:29.440
one thing that I've noticed, and in
combination with modern dentrifices, or

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.970
toothpastes, that are tarter control
toothpastes, they actually slowly dissolve

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:37.710
the tarter on your teeth, and that does
seem to actually shift your microbiome. As

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.800
I showed you those layers that form on
teeth, they are actually microbially

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.690
structured. The first bacteria that can
attach to teeth are called early

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.500
colonizers. They're primarily
Streptococcus and Actinomyces and then

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.300
other bacteria build on them, and if
you're a really aggressive tooth brusher,

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.040
you keep scrapping off all that plaque,
and so you constantly have early

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.440
colonizers and you don't get the late
colonizers that form. It's actually really

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.030
good for your health because the
periodontal pathogens are late colonizers,

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.480
so toothbrushing is highly effective and
does change your oral microbiome but

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.120
mouthwash does not. That's a long answer
to a short question. And the second

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.630
question was about cooking. That's
actually a fantastic question and it's one

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.910
that I'd really like to investigate myself
and I haven't made much progress in that

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.990
direction. I can say, though, that some
really interesting work, done by Amanda

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:28.400
Henry at the Max Planck, she actually
works on starch granules, similar to the

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.790
ones that I showed and she has been
looking at whether or not she can identify

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.740
cooked starch versus uncooked starch by
looking at some of those. And there are

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.410
some changes that occur to starch during
cooking that might indicate the

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.740
introduction of cooking. That then we
could potentially triangulate with oral

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.400
microbial changes but we aren't quite
there yet but I think it's actually a

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.230
great question.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:54.930
- Thank you. One for Matthias Meyer.
Someone very impatiently asks, "Why is it

00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:02.687
taking so long to date Homo naledi and has
its DNA been sequenced?” So I will put

00:12:02.687 --> 00:12:11.317
that to you and broaden the question a
little bit. This field has been, since the

00:12:11.317 --> 00:12:16.239
beginning, kind of driven by technology.
For this sample, or any other samples, are

00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:22.330
there any great technologies that you can
imagine on the horizon that might be the

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:26.992
thing that we, in five years, look back on
and say, "Yeah, that really sparked the

00:12:26.992 --> 00:12:28.747
next revolution."

00:12:29.986 --> 00:12:33.209
- [Matthias] I mean, regarding the Homo
naledi, I think that is a question for the

00:12:33.209 --> 00:12:38.292
rising star expedition team. I think it's
a very sort of complex site to date for

00:12:38.292 --> 00:12:45.317
geological methods. I think the stuff sort
of lies on the ground, basically there's

00:12:45.317 --> 00:12:49.978
nothing on top of it, it's probably going
to be very difficult. There are no sort of

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:55.163
DNA results from this as far as I know,
but who knows if that would ever come.

00:12:55.163 --> 00:13:01.899
Generally, I think there's still room for
improvements in ancient DNA research, for

00:13:01.899 --> 00:13:06.985
example, my group we're also working on
DNA repair attempts. That has been done in

00:13:06.985 --> 00:13:12.356
the past, but I have some reason to
believe we would do better now. Yeah, I

00:13:12.356 --> 00:13:17.119
think it's too early to give up, right, so
yeah, I think there will be more things

00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:18.130
coming.

00:13:22.308 --> 00:13:30.755
- Great. Next question for Kay. Someone
wants to know, “Could the extinction of

00:13:30.755 --> 00:13:35.874
Neanderthals be related to the inbreeding
that you showed?''

00:13:35.874 --> 00:13:45.630
- [Kay] That's a good question. So, I
can't really answer this really.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:52.014
Inbreeding itself is not necessarily
deleterious, right. So you can have lab

00:13:52.014 --> 00:13:55.515
mice that are inbred, for instance, and
they are living very happily in their

00:13:55.515 --> 00:14:03.340
cages. So inbreeding itself is certainly
not necessarily a reason that a group of

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:09.340
humans must go extinct. So that's for
sure. But of course, if you see a decline

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:14.600
in the size of the population, then you
can kind of say, "Okay, this might be

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.820
caused by something." And what this
"something" is we don't really know. So it

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:27.090
could be pathogens, or it could be just
harsh living conditions or just changes in

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:33.780
environment. And I really have to say that
there are many different papers that have

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:39.910
actually tried to answer what made
Neanderthals extinct. I think for me I

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:47.450
have no heard an answer I believe 100%.
Maybe it's a mixture of different things.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:54.890
- Very nice. We're going to do another one
now for Brenna, and then perhaps it will

00:14:54.890 --> 00:15:02.270
be time to switch over to the second group
of speakers. This goes to Brenna. “We see

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.180
a strong drive in humans to spread
throughout the world and interact in some

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:12.250
way with archaic species, but there seems
to be very little back flow into Africa as

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.830
evidence by a lack of
Neanderthal/Denisovan DNA in African

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:22.770
genome. What factors may have prevented
back flow of genes into Africa?”

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:33.600
- That's a complex question. There
actually was a recent paper arguing that

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.250
there was gene flow back to Africa,
specifically into northeastern Africa and

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:44.360
Ethiopia using an ancient genome. That
paper is now somewhat controversial due to

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:53.310
some biostatistical mistakes. I actually,
a few years ago, looked at gene flow from

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:58.560
the east into north Africa and one of the
things that we did see in that paper, is

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:04.810
that there likely was an event back to
Africa approximately 30,000 years ago, or

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:12.500
30 to 40,000 years ago. So I would say
it's not a closed junction. I think there

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.870
have been periods in time that are
probably climatically influenced, in which

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.680
populations did move back and forth
between the near east and northeastern

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:26.490
Africa. But Africa is a highly complex
environmental area, so if you think about

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:31.690
adaptation to local environment, for
example, malaria is really prevalent in

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:36.260
some areas of central and eastern and
western Africa, and you're going to have a

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:41.100
hard time surviving there if you don't
carry alleles that allow you to be not

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.910
susceptible to malaria, for example. So I
thinks it's probably a combination of both

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:52.020
environment and local adaptation to some
pathogens that have probably influenced

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:56.270
relatively low levels of back to Africa
migration.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:00.690
- All right, I said that was the last one,
but I'm going to take the organizer's

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:10.200
prerogative and ask Matthias Meyer one
more question. So the dating for the split

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.960
between what would become modern humans
and what would become Neanderthals and

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:20.850
Denisovans, with the Sima de los Huesos
sample, this has been pushed back in time.

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:29.700
But we thought we had a a reasonably good
answer for that with wide error bars, and

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:35.930
that was up to something like 400,000
years ago. Now, you've shown this was more

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:43.220
distant in the past. The first estimate
was based on comparing alleles that we

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:48.220
share with Neanderthals. How often can we
expect to see this in a modern human

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.020
population? So how old are these things?
How long ago in the past they must have

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:57.630
split? But now we know somehow that must
have been, there must have been something

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:08.230
wrong with that. Where does the discord
come from, and is there a chance that we

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:15.310
find yet another archaic hominid that can
cause us to revisit this yet again? Is

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:21.750
this the final answer on the split between
human and things that we are most closely

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:30.356
related to but they're extinct? And don't
say good question.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:38.590
- I mean, in principle, there is some
uncertainty there, of course, with the

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:43.940
dating of the Sima site, also. I mean its
genetic evidence and geological evidence

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:49.400
seem to sort of converge with confidence
towards a very large also in this case.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.487
But to give a good answer to this rather
detailed question, I think Kay might be a

00:18:53.487 --> 00:18:59.072
better person to do that. As the genetic
estimates of populations splits, were

00:18:59.072 --> 00:19:11.430
actually sort of described in the Altai
Neanderthal paper that he first authored,

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.390
so I think he has a chance to explain it
in better detail.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:21.640
- So I think Christina might also be in on
this question. Okay so, essentially

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:30.360
there's one big thing, one kind of very
basic problem in any study of evolutionary

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.730
questions that have to do with time and
that is the mutation rate. It is actually

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:39.370
massively surprising that it took us so
long to kind of come to or halfway to a

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:45.450
conclusion of what this number should be.
So then, one of the reasons for this, is

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.660
that it's actually quite hard to measure.
So until now, we didn't have the

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:54.400
opportunity to sequence entire
genomes...or just recently we actually

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.680
came around to do it. And so when we
started doing this with humans, as modern

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.710
humans, just parents and offspring, we
started seeing there are actually only few

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:08.920
differences between parent and offspring
and the mutation rate that we always

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:15.020
assumed would be true actually doesn't
really fit very well. And so with less

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.440
mutations that you see from generation to
generation, that actually appears that

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.720
events that we just measure by the number
of mutations that happen in a certain

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.560
amount of time are actually further back
in the past. And I think this switch of

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.920
understanding mutations rate better
explains this discordance between these

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:48.030
two initial estimates and the later
estimates.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:55.940
- Was that praise for the answer?
Fantastic. Good job guys. We'll now switch

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.110
to the second half.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:05.130
- First off, we will put Josh on the spot.
Where's Josh? Okay, I have a couple

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:11.670
questions for you. “What evidence supports
presence of Neanderthal genes in human

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:19.930
populations due to admixture as opposed to
DNA coming from an ancestor to both?”

00:21:22.018 --> 00:21:27.440
- [Josh] Am I allowed to say good
question? It's a fantastic question,

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.480
actually, because it's one of the most
difficult things in these types of

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:36.310
inferences is distinguishing sequences
that were inherited from admixture versus

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:43.630
being shared from a common ancestor. The
approach that we're using really relies on

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:50.130
finding Neanderthal sequences based on
both divergence and how long those

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:55.890
sequences are. And so, if was just a
common ancestor so incomplete lineage

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.540
sorting, you would expect the chunks to be
much smaller in size compared to what

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.730
we're detecting. But it does complicate
the inference and that's something that

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.960
you have to be really careful about.

00:22:05.594 --> 00:22:16.944
- “In the hybridization of archaic and
modern humans, was it male moderns and

00:22:16.944 --> 00:22:22.720
female Neanderthals or vice versa or
both?”

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:31.550
- I'll paraphrase the question. So was
there a sex bias in hybridization? And I

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:37.900
think it's a fascinating question that
we've thought a lot about but haven't come

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.370
up with a way to distinguish sort of if
there was a bias, and if there was, in

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:47.460
what direction. In fact, we know that
there's sex bias gene flow that has

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:54.150
happened in different modern human
populations, so it wouldn't be surprising,

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:59.830
I think, if that was the case. But the
approaches that we use to study sex bias

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:06.870
migration in modern human populations,
doesn't really work well in applying it to

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:10.560
the interaction between modern and archaic
populations. I think it's a great

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.790
question. We don't know the answer yet. I
think it's something that hopefully a lot

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.890
of people are thinking about because it's
a complicated question but one that I

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.560
think is worth figuring out how to answer.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:28.940
- “According to my National Geographic
report, I'm smack in the average for

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:37.530
Neanderthal at 2%, but I also have 2.6
Denisovan. I'm of basically European

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:44.840
ancestry. How did I get so much Denisovan
considering my background?”

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.340
- This is also a good question and
actually I don't know why, but I've

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:54.870
received about 10 emails in the last
couple days asking this exact question.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:24:00.900
I'm going to probably get myself in
trouble. This is being recorded, so

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:07.191
National Geographic is going to sue me.
But those estimates are just wrong. In

00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:16.933
fact, if you look at the genochip
frequently asked questions page, at some

00:24:16.933 --> 00:24:24.248
point they admitted that the Denisovan
estimates were wrong, too. So I think it's

00:24:24.248 --> 00:24:29.619
a complicated sort of question to try to
tease apart sequences that you're

00:24:29.619 --> 00:24:34.148
confident is Neanderthal versus confident
they were Denisovan and sometimes you can

00:24:34.148 --> 00:24:38.534
actually tell the difference. I suspect
that sort of, the higher percentage of

00:24:38.534 --> 00:24:43.628
Denisovan ancestry estimated by the
National Geographic project was just cases

00:24:43.628 --> 00:24:49.252
of them sort of overestimating the
Denisovan contribution. Maybe over time,

00:24:49.252 --> 00:24:55.028
they can do a better job, but I would be
suspicious of what your ancestry estimates

00:24:55.028 --> 00:25:00.416
are, at least from Denisovan right now.
And if you would like to donate to my

00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:06.312
legal fund, maybe we can post a website
later.

00:25:08.054 --> 00:25:16.212
- I'm of course, just pleased that my
husband's percentage is higher. Okay,

00:25:16.212 --> 00:25:22.605
Tony. Where are you? There you are. All
right, “I heard a great deal about

00:25:22.605 --> 00:25:29.173
Neanderthal DNA in European genomes, but
has there been any contribution or

00:25:29.173 --> 00:25:37.711
variation in mitochondrial DNA?” A number
of you could answer this but they put your

00:25:37.711 --> 00:25:39.803
name down.

00:25:42.704 --> 00:25:46.142
- [Tony] So I'll start first with the
context of the sorts of things I talked

00:25:46.142 --> 00:25:51.017
about and no, we haven't really looked at
that at all. One of the big reasons is

00:25:51.017 --> 00:25:56.747
because the initial studies that tried to
decide if there was admixture were focused

00:25:56.747 --> 00:26:01.109
on mitochondrial DNA for reasons that have
come up in some of the earlier talks and

00:26:01.109 --> 00:26:05.420
found very limited evidence, in fact no
evidence of that in those mitochondrial

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.750
sequences. There really wouldn't be a
clear signature of what would be

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:17.960
intergressed there or not. It's not really
possible to look at that.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:23.590
- “Is there an ongoing effort, on the part
of scientists to encourage the expansion

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:33.080
of genomic information for medical data or
from these large medical organizations

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:38.260
like Scripts and UCSD?” A number of people
asked why there weren't any dots on your

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:43.720
map in the West?

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:50.310
- Yes, there was one in University of
Washington that's a partner in this

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:55.540
network that we used. There are similar
efforts that are coming up on the West

00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:00.140
coast. For example Kaiser, has a large
database that has some similar attributes

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:05.480
to what we have and have been looking at
that they're building. This is a wide, as

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:13.130
I showed across a lot of the world,
countries and individual hospital systems

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:17.200
are really really excited about the
potential of electronic medical record

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.730
data linked to genetic data for the
purposes of precision or personalized

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:24.320
medicine as you've heard. So there's
great, great interest. You might also have

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.540
heard, several months ago, there's the
precision medicine initiative announced by

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:32.630
the President. It's a nationwide effort to
get millions of people across the country

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.540
to get involved in systems like this.
That's great from the perspective of

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.870
understanding the genetics of disease. But
from my perspective it's also great about

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:46.790
trying to understand the evolution of our
species and how that relates to our risk

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:47.894
for disease.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:28:05.790
- Okay, Johannes, “Since you're German, is
it Neandertal or Neanderthal?”

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:14.830
- [Johannes] Wow. Wrong question, I should
refer to Kay or Matthias for that again. I

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:20.530
actually came from the Leipzig School
myself as well, and there we call it “tal”

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:25.120
not "thal," which goes back to some
phonetic change that actually happened

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:31.130
about 100 years ago in Germany where we
now call a valley "tals" it was "t".

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.590
Whereas 150 years ago, when the Neandertal
was discovered in the Neander Valley, it

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:38.380
was still with "th." So therefore, I think
we have changed our language and we

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:42.780
therefore adopted also the "t" and not the
"th" but I know it's under discussion and

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.000
debate so....

00:28:48.364 --> 00:28:56.300
- Our linguistics for today. Okay, “Is the
second migration related to the spread of

00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:01.160
Indo-European language and what
contribution to do you think warfare

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:06.120
played in some of these large scale
genetic migrations?”

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:11.140
- In the paper that we published last
year, we actually hypothesized that the

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.330
second migration was also related to
spread of the Indo-European languages and

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:19.510
I think there is more and more evidence
actually popping up that this is actually

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:24.260
true. I'm working in the institute now. I
was one of the leading linguists that

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.990
actually has done divergence estimates of
ancient language with [inaudible

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:32.280
00:29:30], and they have actually dated
that the early divergence of Indo-European

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:36.630
languages was something like 8,000 years
ago, which is actually younger than the

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:43.500
separation of Anatolian populations from
basically the near east to Europe. It

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:48.820
really seems to better actually relate to
this split that might have happened 6 to

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.500
7,000 years ago maybe in the steppe. I
think there is actually very good evidence

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:58.000
for that, also there is more evidence
coming to light soon on the genetic makeup

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.780
of early farmers in the near east and I
think that will also be interesting to

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:07.030
look at that. But from my point of view, I
think there is very good evidence for

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:11.400
that. But of course, it's very difficult
to link genes and language, because of

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.490
course, those ancient skeletons and DNA
doesn't really tell us what those people

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.482
were speaking. But I think there's
actually a good case for that. What was

00:30:19.482 --> 00:30:26.400
the second question? Warfare, yes. The
people that actually spread during the

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.500
time, this corded ware culture, is
actually also called the battle axe

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:37.500
culture. So much for that question. I
think there's very strong evidence that

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.980
those people have actually been quite
violent. There almost all of them are

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:48.160
buried with axes, which were probably not
just used to chop wood, but maybe also

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:52.780
heads. So I think there is actually some
evidence for that. How strong that

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:58.430
evidence is, and if that would explain the
complete turnover is quite uncertain, but

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:03.030
it also might have been related to that.
Again, we don't really know whether it was

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:09.010
diseases, whether it was some other
changes in the environment or really

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:16.780
warfare that have actually caused this
genetic turnover. It's a good question.

00:31:17.993 --> 00:31:25.150
- So there were a couple questions
basically asking, "We have this really

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:30.620
rich detailed record in Europe. Why don't
we have it anywhere else?"

00:31:31.794 --> 00:31:36.990
- I think as Anne said, we are getting
there. So I think Maria has shown that

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:41.050
more and more genetic information from the
Americas. I think there's also a lot of

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.840
ancient genomes coming to light in the
next few years in the Americas, even for

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.590
Africa, we have seen the first ancient
genomes now from Africa. They're only

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:53.250
about 4,000 years old, but still they have
actually given us first controversial

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:58.530
results as we heard, but also I think some
very exciting and interesting insight. So

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:03.500
I think we are getting material now from
Africa, the Americas, also probably from

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:07.910
Australia, and Oceania. I think we will
actually learn more about those different

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:11.140
parts of the world that we know so much
about Europe is also because there's been

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.880
a lot of archaeology and paleoanthropology
done in Europe, so therefore we have

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.300
probably many more skeletons that have
been excavated in Europe. But I think

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:22.240
we're soon catching up also in other parts
of the world, which is an extremely

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.880
exciting time. Because unlike people that
are working on archaic humans, we're not

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:30.270
just dealing with 300 fossils. We are
actually dealing with millions of fossils

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:34.680
that basically can be actually studied
genetically. We will learn a tremendous

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:39.050
amount about human history studying those
millions of fossils over the next few

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:43.300
years, which is a really exciting time and
really glad to be a part of that.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:52.230
- Let's see, “How fast,” in miles per
year, I guess, “do you think ancient

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:59.810
people would have migrated since they've
got 8,000 plus miles to get all the way

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:07.653
down to Chile to Monte Verde? Does 1,000
years seem likely?

00:33:11.711 --> 00:33:22.249
- [Maria] I think in kilometers, not in
miles. But actually 1,000 years is like an

00:33:22.249 --> 00:33:28.396
estimate now, for the time that it took
people to move all the way from Alaska to

00:33:28.396 --> 00:33:34.757
Monte Verde. So that's an estimate now. I
don't know how many miles or kilometers

00:33:34.757 --> 00:33:36.336
that is.

00:33:39.009 --> 00:33:45.731
- “Is there some evidence for migration
into the Americas around 30,000 years BP?”

00:33:45.731 --> 00:33:52.670
There's some questions, I guess, about
some bones in caves in Brazil.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:58.810
- That's still very controversial. I
didn't want to bring it up because it's

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:06.040
very debatable. So there is evidence in
Brazil, of something that looks like stone

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:11.720
tools that could have been made by humans.
But it also, like some people argue,

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:17.120
that's just the shape of a rock falling
from somewhere that is somewhere high. So

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:21.790
yeah. It's inconclusive.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:27.520
- The last question, “Could the shared
skull morphology among Austronesians and

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:35.670
South Americans be a result of shared
Denisovan or Denisovan-like ancestry?”

00:34:37.777 --> 00:34:43.320
- I don't know. Actually, what we know
about skull morphology, is that it's

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:49.830
highly variable and that there is many
environmental factors that weigh in. What

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:55.960
we actually think is happening here is
some sort of adaptation at least in the

00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:03.580
Pericose and the Fuego-Patagonians. I had
that question myself as well. Maybe the

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:10.810
signal that we see in South America, could
be something of shared Denisovan ancestry

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:17.272
because it's been observed also. But in
these particular groups [inaudible

00:35:17.272 --> 00:35:22.130
00:35:17] there's also high Denisovan
ancestry there. So I don't know if that

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.871
could be a contender.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:33.500
- [Ajit] On behalf of CARTA, I'd like to
thank all those that made this symposium

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:39.270
possible. To the chairs, featured
speakers, the supporters, and to the

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:44.880
audience attending and your great
questions. We forgot to specifically thank

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:55.302
Judd Svabota [SP] for playing the guitar
so well at the beginning. And the person

00:35:55.302 --> 00:36:05.460
who made this slide always leaves his name
off, Jesse Robbe did the artwork. So I

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:12.270
would like to leave you with a closing
question to ponder. “Why are there no

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:17.630
persisting true hybrid species of us
humans, with Denisovans, Neanderthals, or

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:24.500
anyone else?” In other words, what
happened to everyone else? So Svante Paabo

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:29.030
was visiting here a month or two ago, and
he and I had a chat. He came up with a

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:34.410
possible answer. The answer is that humans
are the most dominate, expansive,

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:40.010
ecologically invasive, aggressive, and
destructive species this planet has ever

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:48.650
experienced. And that took care of
everybody else. And so we needn't to

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:52.934
understand our species of course. Thank
you.
