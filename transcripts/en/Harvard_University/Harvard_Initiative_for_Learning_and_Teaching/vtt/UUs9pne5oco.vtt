00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:06.210
We're going to get started
because we have a very

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.890
short period of time together.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.305
It's exactly 20 of 11.

00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:13.462
So we have with us Carolyn
Wood from the now the Medical

00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:15.990
School formerly the
Kennedy School and Monica

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.780
Higgins from the Ed School.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.850
And I'm Nancy Kane from the TH
Chan School of Public Health.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.100
And we're all educators.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.907
We're all very much supporting
the educational mission

00:00:27.907 --> 00:00:28.990
of our respective schools.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.230
Sometimes against the grain.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.490
Sometimes more with the grain.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.546
And many of us--

00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:34.920
I think all three
of us have been

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.940
in different parts of
Harvard in different parts

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.920
of our careers in education.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.140
So what strikes
all us, I think, is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.870
that although we want to do a
lot of focus on this-- a lot

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.390
of the conferences around
this instructor at the middle

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.680
of this circle, that context
that the instructor is in

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.640
has an enormous impact on
how well that structure can

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.640
perform.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.080
And should we be thinking
of how to evaluate

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.890
the quality of the
decision making

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.220
that creates this context?

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.136
I mean, one colleague
looked at this and said,

00:01:05.136 --> 00:01:07.096
oh, you're talking
about the culture.

00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:10.360
Yes, but it's not an
immutable culture.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.230
What are some of the decisions
that-- or the ways decisions

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.090
are made that
effect that culture,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.800
that create that culture.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.850
So that's what we wanted to have
this group be talking about.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.690
And even thinking of
how to ask about it

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.799
was really quite a long process.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.257
We really appreciate the input
of the HILT people and we've

00:01:26.257 --> 00:01:29.170
all been going in
circles around this--

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.790
So this is from a public
health concept called

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.670
the socio-ecological
framework for health,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.432
with a patient or the
individual in the middle,

00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:39.390
but then there's all
these different influences

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.410
on the individual.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.245
But we thought we'd sort of
steal from it a little bit

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:46.200
and apply it to
teaching and talk.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.330
So what I'd like for
people to talk about

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.960
is how are decisions
made about these things

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.900
in your institutions?

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.858
What's your experience?

00:01:53.858 --> 00:01:54.936
And what can be improved?

00:01:54.936 --> 00:01:56.310
Where are we--
how can we come up

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.890
with a list of best practices to
improve the culture of teaching

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.540
and the likelihood of success
of teaching in our schools.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.017
I'm going to very quickly.

00:02:06.017 --> 00:02:08.475
In our school, we have a set
of students whose expectations

00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:13.410
are that attendance is optional
and that they should be told

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.030
what to think, because they went
to, frankly, medical schools,

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.206
many of them.

00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:20.230
And no offence, but that's where
a lot of them got their habits.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.354
So just that alone has been a
real challenge for those of us

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:24.770
that believe in a
more interactive

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.874
and engaging and presence
and mind and body.

00:02:28.874 --> 00:02:30.540
In terms of how
programs are structured,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.620
you can have a program
that is actually

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.950
not built so that courses
build on each other

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.160
or that people are
overlapping or that they're

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.210
well-coordinated and
so the students get

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.190
the maximum benefit
out of whatever

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.710
you're doing as an instructor.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.405
So things about how those
educational programs are

00:02:45.405 --> 00:02:47.677
designed and coordinated
is another one

00:02:47.677 --> 00:02:50.010
of the many things that can
effect the quality of what's

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.599
going on in the classroom.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.390
School-wide policy.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.750
We've all talked about
promotion criteria,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.340
although that may not--

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.640
in our school, we find most of
our senior faculty are teaching

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.930
and some of that teaching
is highly variable.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.900
But also how
teaching is paid for,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.340
what kind of
classroom facilities

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.260
are out there for
you to teach in.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.330
All kinds of different
types of decisions

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.399
that effect whether you can
actually teach in the most

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:16.440
interactive way possible.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.460
How well your IT systems work--

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.760
your technology works.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.470
Whether you have support to do
technology assisted learning.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.680
And then external forces.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.280
Carolyn and I were
having a great discussion

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.196
at one point about the
role that accreditation

00:03:29.196 --> 00:03:32.880
plays in medical school, driving
so much of the context there.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.160
And licensing exams,
whereas public health

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.650
doesn't have that
external pressure

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.365
to hit the targets and measure
that learning through passage

00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:43.390
of the licensure exam.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.349
So this is the topics
we wanted to talk about.

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.890
Maybe Carolyn, you want to make
a couple remarks, and Monica,

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.860
too, about what you observed.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.850
And then we'd like
to let you loose

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.330
talking about the question that
you're sitting at the table of,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.080
and maybe we'll have
to get your comments,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.640
and then we'll make sure
we understand the question.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.510
Sure.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.870
So from my perspective, when
Nancy proposed this idea,

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.050
I found it really engaging.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.720
I have spent more than a
decade at the Kennedy School

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.630
working to build the
teaching and learning unit

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.180
over there, the SLATE
program and the Case program.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.149
And I think the Kennedy School
invested incredibly heavily

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:22.440
in supporting faculty to teach
in a broad array of ways.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.480
It's very heterogeneous
curriculum.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.150
And I think they
had a lot of success

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.840
in the elective curriculum
on an opt-in basis.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.714
So individual
faculty working alone

00:04:31.714 --> 00:04:33.880
in their classrooms in their
elective courses, which

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.080
constitute about 90% of
their course offerings,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.900
chose to engage with this
incredible array of resources

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.680
that we provided.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.390
But it Was a little bit tougher
to get really meaningful change

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.770
in the core curriculum.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.130
So now having recently--
very recently-- joined

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.440
the medical school,
one of the reasons

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.750
that I chose to make
that move is I'm

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.540
really interested
in working at scale.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.700
And the medical
school has decided

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.370
to do what I would describe as
a big bang change to the way

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.890
that they're teaching.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.130
So it's not just individual
faculty opting in.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.610
It was faculty working
together to define what

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.880
should our graduates
know and be able to do

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.280
at the end of four years
at Harvard Medical School.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.870
And they basically
worked backwards

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.450
to redesign
competencies, courses,

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.540
and even change the pedagogy
across the board with a much

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.120
larger faculty than
the Kennedy School has.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.327
And so for me, that was
a really inspiring move,

00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:32.910
and I joined the team to try to
figure out how did they do it?

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.744
How do you make it successful?

00:05:34.744 --> 00:05:36.160
And is there
anything there that's

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.040
replicable for other
parts of Harvard

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.550
or other parts of higher ed.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.160
So that's kind of the
lens that I'm bringing.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.780
Great.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.190
So welcome, everybody.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.340
My name is Monica Higgins.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.930
So I've been at Harvard's
graduate school of education

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.890
for about 12 years now, but
before that at Harvard Business

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:52.705
School.

00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:56.110
And I actually did my PhD work
where I spent most of my time

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.210
in the psych department.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.480
So I've kind of gotten to see a
lot of different places, parts

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.913
of the university.

00:06:01.913 --> 00:06:03.630
And one of the things
that strikes me--

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.520
so this is a learning
session, so we're

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.590
kind of building off of and kind
of tweaking each other's work.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.020
When over at the
Ed school we like

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.660
to talk about the
instructional core.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:20.940
So teacher, you know, students,
and content in this triangle.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.821
Which, I guess, Nancy, we
might put in the middle, right?

00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:25.320
Somewhere.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.750
Maybe even put
students in the middle

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.083
and structures in the next ring.

00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:32.670
But this triangle is so key
to everything that we do.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.050
And then for us
at the Ed school,

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.870
when we think
about this, we have

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.840
this larger external
environment,

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.539
which is comprised
of all these rings.

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:43.830
But what's interesting at
the Ed school that's going on

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.726
that we really should echo--

00:06:46.726 --> 00:06:47.225
I'm sorry.

00:06:47.225 --> 00:06:48.720
What's going on
in the environment

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.030
that we need to echo
at the Ed school is

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.440
this real shift towards
thinking about how to recreate

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.550
an environment here in which
students are not just kind

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.040
of engaging in rote memorization
and so forth, but really

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.640
engaging in what we call--

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.740
some of the faculty
called deeper learning

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.790
and complex cognitive
thinking skills

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.750
and project-based
learning and all of those

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.640
that we're actually
enabling our own students

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.700
to go out and enact and
be professionals, right?

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.760
But then we need to
do the same thing.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.570
Right?

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.040
So we can't sit and
lecture and so forth.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.235
It's a lot more than
flipped classrooms.

00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:28.774
I mean, we've gotten rid
of courses, in some cases.

00:07:28.774 --> 00:07:29.940
Some cases, we have modules.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.350
Some cases, we have labs.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.270
Some cases, we are actually
consulting to the Children's

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.470
Defense Fund and so forth.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.760
And we're doing-- we're
trying to really recreate

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.640
the environment that we
aspire for our students

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.950
when they leave the Ed school.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.620
But then that creates
really interesting questions

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.540
as professional school,
which is how do you actually

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.580
evaluate teaching?

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.860
So professor has
gone from being used

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.760
to kind of a lecture-based
or PowerPoint,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.450
et cetera, some a little
bit of flipped classroom,

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.500
but not that much to a
completely different model.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.955
How do we evaluate that?

00:08:05.955 --> 00:08:07.810
How do we teach--

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:12.324
how do we teach our faculty
how to change in that way?

00:08:12.324 --> 00:08:13.920
How do we select faculty?

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.692
That's our biggest
issue right now.

00:08:15.692 --> 00:08:17.400
We look at their course
evals, but that's

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.733
nothing-- has nothing to do
with what we want them to do

00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:21.120
once they get to the Ed school.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.930
So I guess what I'm
saying is we think

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.540
about this as kind of a mirror.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.820
You know, what's
going on in k-12,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.330
and how do we create that
and inspire our faculty

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
to follow the model
that they hope

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.330
their students will actually go
out and enact once they leave.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.535
So that's why I'm
interested in the topic.

00:08:38.535 --> 00:08:40.919
And you have three
specific questions.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.152
Yes.

00:08:42.152 --> 00:08:44.610
So at this point, we wanted to
really use our time together

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:49.110
to just foster a conversation
among you all about some

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.512
of the deeper dive
questions that

00:08:50.512 --> 00:08:51.720
were in the session overview.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.800
You So you have on
your table a document

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.043
that lists the three questions.

00:08:57.043 --> 00:09:00.390
And you'll have a question
number on your table.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.590
So we're going to ask each
table to discuss as a group

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.420
one of these three questions.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.730
And we're going to have
about 20 minutes to do that.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.480
We're going to ask each table
to identify one person to kind

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.540
of share and report out
the conversation that you

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.290
have had about your question.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.430
So we'll have multiple groups
working on the same question.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.910
So we'll-- when
we do the report,

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.170
I'll be able to get some
dialogue or interplay between

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.830
the various groups working
on the same question.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.710
And then at the
very end, we're just

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.500
going to pull out a few themes.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.130
And I want to just
give you a heads

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.360
up, just to close
out the session,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.225
you each have an index
card on your table,

00:09:37.225 --> 00:09:41.010
and we're going to ask you to
write down on the index card

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.190
one thing you've learned
at today's session

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.910
and one question
that you still have.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.820
And we're going
to collect those,

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.910
type them up, and
then email out to you

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.580
the kind of collective
work of our group

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.690
today so that you can
use that as fodder

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.747
for further conversation.

00:09:55.747 --> 00:09:57.330
We're also going to
share it with HILT

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.990
to inform their future work.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.450
So we'll remind you at the
end on the index cards.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.680
But now-- so questions.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.440
If you're not at a table
that has the question

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.330
number that you want to work on,
now would be the time to move.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.350
So question number one.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.110
So if you're at a table
with question one.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.060
What criteria are uses
to approve new courses?

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.550
How is course coherence
maintained across the degree

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.040
program over time?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.700
What criteria are used
to retire courses?

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.820
How might the decision-making
process effecting-- processes

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.680
that effect what
course is offered

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.040
and how they can be improved?

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.130
One question.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.185
That's question one.

00:10:39.185 --> 00:10:42.430
Question two is how is the
value of teaching excellence

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.130
introduced to new faculty?

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.000
How is it reinforced throughout
the faculty member's career,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.800
including after tenure?

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.782
And how might that
process be improved?

00:10:51.782 --> 00:10:53.873
And then question three.

00:10:53.873 --> 00:10:56.200
What carrots and sticks
and pressure points

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.690
are used to encourage excellent
teaching in our research

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.020
university setting?

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.625
How can they be more effective?

00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:03.250
What are the challenges
to implementing

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.805
more effective measures?

00:11:04.805 --> 00:11:07.265
Nancy and I worked some of
these questions in the past,

00:11:07.265 --> 00:11:08.640
and some of them are
actually very difficult,

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.431
so we're dying to see
what you guys come up

00:11:10.431 --> 00:11:11.610
with from your own settings.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.020
So with that, make
sure that you're

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.980
at a table that's working on the
question you're interested in.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.830
And why don't you begin
your conversations

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.544
after you establish
a rapporteur.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:30.970
So I mean, I think given
that people kind of randomly

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.810
sat down at tables, it
would be terrific to benefit

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.630
from hearing from what the
table discussions were.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.952
I know that you slopped over
into different questions.

00:11:40.952 --> 00:11:42.670
That's fine.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.500
And it's natural,
and it's normal.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.430
And the questions
are interrelated.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.160
And there are many
questions per question.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.910
What we'd like to do
now is just make sure

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.950
that we hear from
each of the tables.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.050
So there are eight tables.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.262
And if somebody just
in terms of the --

00:11:57.262 --> 00:12:01.480
they're pointing at each other's
friends can just give us some

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.780
highlights of the discussion
just for a couple of minutes.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.580
I'm going to just track time,
and I'll just kind of give you

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.290
the signal if you're going on.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.300
Or I'm being drawn in,
you can do that to me.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.330
So let's start with this table.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.160
So you all had the
first question.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.770
[CHATTER]

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:19.765
[CHATTER]

00:12:19.765 --> 00:12:21.096
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:21.096 --> 00:12:22.470
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.935
Keith, did your table
want to get started?

00:12:29.935 --> 00:12:33.050
And we'll come back then.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.550
All right.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:34.972
I'll take one for the team.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.000
Just a couple of minutes.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.020
We were the team-- one of
the groups that's lumped

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.876
into different questions.

00:12:44.876 --> 00:12:47.560
But I think that
the challenge is

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.740
that we were highlighting
the fact that we all

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.040
had different structures,
different constituents,

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.590
different processes, protocols,
and different students

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.050
that we were trying to serve
for different organizations

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.430
and regulatory boards.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:07.970
And so for answering a question,
it all worked very different

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:08.660
for each of us.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.760
We needed to
contextualize who we were

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.990
and what some of our
motivations and guidelines were.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.970
Also the fact that we also had
a different set of core courses

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.570
versus electives.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.030
We also had a
different way in which

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.660
we vetted those or
different groups that

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.500
helped to support those.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.580
And I love the fact that
we also kind of threw

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.535
in the wild, wild west
in terms of sometimes it

00:13:39.535 --> 00:13:43.840
was very organic, and sometimes
it was far more structured

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.460
in that process.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.170
What was the--

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.590
I'm sorry?

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.320
The approval of new courses
and what that looked like

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.470
and who taught those
and for how long.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:57.000
And one thing that we kind
of touched on-- people,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.560
please jump in if
I'm misspeaking--

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.590
but some of the
information that informed

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.670
our decisions about
new course offerings

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.940
or different curriculum
changes, maybe

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.170
different policies,
different what we're

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:17.110
hearing from marketing,
different employment

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:22.170
demands, student
surveys, and also

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.000
what lights up the
instructors and the faculty.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.370
And how to keep all of
these different data

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.970
sets kind of in
check meaningfully.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.360
Great.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.595
I'm going to add one
thing since I hung out

00:14:35.595 --> 00:14:36.720
with you guys a little bit.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.810
One of the really interesting, I
thought, kind of back and forth

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.770
was asking employers
what they think.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.402
But then it came up
at the table, what

00:14:45.402 --> 00:14:47.735
do they think the students
need to be able to know or be

00:14:47.735 --> 00:14:48.620
or do and so forth,
and then kind

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.990
of trying to map that back.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.385
And then the
interesting question

00:14:51.385 --> 00:14:53.860
that they talked about was well
is that even a good question?

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:54.900
I mean, do the employers know?

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.568
Maybe we should be
ahead of the game

00:14:56.568 --> 00:14:58.230
and trying to
change that sector.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.830
And so that was clearly
an interesting case.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:02.550
Back to you guys.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:03.050
Yes.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.850
So similarly, just
trying to understand

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.190
each other's
contexts, and what we

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.820
found is the main thing
that came out, I think,

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.810
was around faculty autonomy.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:19.310
So how decisions got made about
curriculum design and whatnot

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.460
may--

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.620
may or may not have been
within particular departments

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.800
or different faculties.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.687
But ultimately
whether a course got

00:15:26.687 --> 00:15:30.340
offered or not was based on
what the faculty wanted to offer

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.320
and how much it would
or wouldn't take away

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.681
from their own research time.

00:15:34.681 --> 00:15:37.330
But that was also--

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.320
depends on the graduate
level or undergraduate.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.020
So we also talked about
what it means for FAS

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.760
and how departments have
to navigate that with them.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.140
And then how
sometimes those things

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:54.250
are tracked by a staff
person within the office--

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:55.750
within the department,
who says hey,

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.910
we need someone to
teach over here.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.360
You also mentioned how
one of your takeaways

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.065
was the lack of transparency.

00:16:05.065 --> 00:16:06.670
That if you are--

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.590
maybe if you're not a--

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.460
in the tenure line,
you may not really

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.970
even understand
the processes that

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:18.350
are happening in designing
or to build the curriculum.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.950
I also distinguish between--

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.260
the difference between a single
course and a whole curriculum

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.130
and how those structures
might be different, even

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.280
within a single school.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:28.780
Absolutely.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:29.980
I don't even know--

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.150
transparency is part of it, too.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.750
Sometimes it's just
information not

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.890
getting to the people who
are enacting the programs.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:39.390
Right.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.710
It's been decided,
and then all of sudden

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.370
we're having to make all
these adjustments to program

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.660
requirements, not to mention
get the word out to the students

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.400
that something's changed.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.780
So that's an interesting
personal school challenge.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.690
I also heard an
interesting discussion here

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.640
about what constitutes teaching.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.109
So for example, is advising
part of teaching, or in HBS?

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:07.599
Writing cases is actually
considered part of teaching.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.819
So that was also interesting.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:12.819
And you guys also
had question one?

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:13.390
We did.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.440
And we have a broad array.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.329
So we had the school of
public health, Houghton excuse

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:23.380
me, Widener and Lamont
Library, medical school,

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.619
and we're from the college
in romance languages

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:27.910
and literatures.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:32.050
And so the question of--

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.460
what I took from
what you said is

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.920
that people offer the courses
they want, more or less.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.200
Sometimes there's been
a proliferation of them,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.160
and they need to be
cut back a little bit

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.740
because there may be too many.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.340
And the decision
there, different bodies

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.180
in the different --except maybe
the library may have a body

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.940
but you didn't mention it.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:00.370
Different bodies within schools
that determine what's OK.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.490
In our particular
department, once a course

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.770
is approved by a
committee, I can't

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.980
remember whose name is,
the educational something

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:08.480
committee.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.850
They have to say--

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.460
no, it's not even a course.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.110
It's a line of study.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:16.330
But once they've approved
what makes a French major,

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.870
then the freedom is
within the department

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.190
to say what levels are.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.180
And we do to try to have
a balance of courses

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.830
for undergrads and grads
where there's a progression.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:32.080
But that isn't to say
that they're aren't kinks.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.560
And one of the questions
that interests me,

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.970
which someone else
had brought up,

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:41.380
is how you address a course
whose faculty member--

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:47.260
it's a core course that repeats,
but it isn't drawing very well.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:52.870
Because it's very delicate
to talk to a tenured--

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:53.960
right.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.090
Absolutely.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.240
Yeah.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.090
And I think the
faculty who are tenured

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.860
feel that it's a
delicate discussion.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.860
So that's a tough one.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.360
Yeah.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.340
Around evaluation when there
isn't generally evaluation.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:06.840
Right?

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.760
Yeah.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.370
OK.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.580
Thank you.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.080
OK.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.540
So that was a
question one, which

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.373
are kind of what are
the different processes

00:19:13.373 --> 00:19:16.420
and systems in place for
bringing a course on board

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.330
or retiring a course.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.550
And so for question
two, it's just

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.620
about how the value
of teaching excellence

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.670
is actually even
introduced to faculty.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.920
How is it reinforced.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.165
So question two folks.

00:19:30.165 --> 00:19:31.233
Can I take your table?

00:19:31.233 --> 00:19:31.732
Thank you.

00:19:31.732 --> 00:19:33.060
Sure.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.420
So almost all of our group
comes from med school,

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.990
so I guess we're pretty
specific in that way.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:42.750
But we talked a lot about how
new teachers coming in to--

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.420
from our perspective,
don't receive a whole lot

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.300
of introduction as far as
what teaching excellence is

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.555
or what's kind of expected.

00:19:51.555 --> 00:19:54.390
We actually have a new
faculty member in our group,

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.110
so we actually had
a window straight

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:59.850
into kind of what she received
and how helpful that was.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.950
So we talked about
that a little bit.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.850
And then we also talked
about this kind of buy-in

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.620
from the leadership team
and for people overall.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.760
We talked a little bit
about the promotion metrics

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.870
at the med school and how
within the promotion metrics,

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.756
every faculty member has to
teach for 50 hours a year,

00:20:18.756 --> 00:20:20.130
but it's a little
bit ill defined

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.349
as to what those
teaching hours are

00:20:22.349 --> 00:20:23.640
and what's considered teaching.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.470
Is it actually
classroom teaching,

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.410
or is it teaching at the
bedside or one-on-one in a lab.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.220
Where does mentorship
fall into that,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.290
and should mentorship
be a separate category.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.880
So we also talked about kind
of buy-in from leadership

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.900
as far as their
values in teaching.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.420
So there is this 50
hour requirement,

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.900
but a lot of people
kind of dread

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.200
that component and make that
clear to people under them

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.330
that they don't want to
be doing those hours.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.800
And so if that's the culture
that's coming from the top,

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.940
how can that encourage
other people to kind of buy

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.600
into the psyche of
it, that teaching

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.332
is good and wanting to
learn more about it.

00:21:04.332 --> 00:21:05.790
And overall, we
kind of just talked

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:09.210
about how the ability to teach
is not necessarily something

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.770
you're born with and that
there are skills we can learn.

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:15.650
And so how are ways we can
start incorporating more of that

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.764
into as well.

00:21:17.764 --> 00:21:20.530
Wonderful.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.030
Great.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.840
And you all as well
had question two.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.530
Yeah.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:31.080
We talked about how
graduate students are often

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:37.440
a major venue for instilling
the value of teaching, and that,

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.540
for example, the work at the
Bok Center in providing support

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.380
for doing that at
the department level

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.440
and for assisting graduate
students with both awareness

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:54.630
of their teaching and of
the Bok Center services.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:22:01.160
And how there would be an ideal
for doctoral students to have,

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:06.490
longitudinal development
around teaching

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.580
in the time of their
degree program.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.590
And what would it take
to work towards that

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.230
in a particular department?

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.290
That would probably
look different

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.730
in different disciplines
and different departments.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:25.370
We talked about, we know
that there are evaluations,

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:30.720
but it's not necessarily clear
whether department chairs

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.960
work with that
content or feedback

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.320
or provide feedback from
that, but that itself

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.650
would be a signal
that could be very

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.740
powerful in a
specific department.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.810
We didn't have any
particular insight into it,

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.080
but it struck us
as an opportunity.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.020
Whether it happens or
not says something,

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.150
no matter what the
experience is like.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.790
And we also talked about
how despite the fact that--

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.990
we talked about mentoring
programs and the ability

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.310
for faculty to
mentor each other.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:12.300
But then again, it's not
clear the extent to which

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.980
that ultimately gets
focused on research agenda

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:21.570
and how to really be productive
with your research agenda as

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:22.870
opposed to teaching.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:26.619
So again, there's not a lot
of structure to make sure.

00:23:26.619 --> 00:23:28.910
There are some opportunities
for where this can happen.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.840
We were less clear
on whether that

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.740
actually is happening or let
alone the effectiveness in--.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.860
Right.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.540
I like how you opened
up that up for us

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.390
to think about in
terms of opportunities.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.560
One last opportunity,
we were talking

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:51.330
about how many
faculty members often

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.010
found their passion
in their research

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.140
because they had
a great teacher.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:55.740
Right.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:00.270
And so how could
we reconnect them

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.231
to that early experience
as a motivator.

00:24:03.231 --> 00:24:03.730
Nice.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:04.496
Yes.

00:24:04.496 --> 00:24:05.710
Interesting.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.210
Great.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:07.760
And were you three tables--

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.370
I can't see.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:09.990
We're question two as well.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.870
Great.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:11.370
Thank you.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:14.250
So we ended up, I think, having
an interesting discussion

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.240
as the spectrum of offerings.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.402
So we had the business school.

00:24:18.402 --> 00:24:20.110
I'm from the business
school, and Nancy's

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.526
from the business
school, where we

00:24:21.526 --> 00:24:24.360
have I think the
most significantly

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.220
hands-on new teacher training.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:31.080
So we have a three
day compulsory program

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.430
for new faculty to come through
where they observe classes

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.760
being taught to
them as students,

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.000
they teach to themselves
and they get feedback on it,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.460
and then are introduced to
the Christensen Center, which

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:49.770
is a administration
supported and funded

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:54.370
voluntary group of five
people who are purely there

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.810
for their teaching development.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.530
To the opposite end of the
spectrum at the law school,

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.500
where they're given a
mentor when they come in,

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.370
but it's more self-forming
groups around academic interest

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.270
areas and research
areas where they kind of

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.120
get together and talk about the
teaching of that little moment.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.661
And it's not that
it's not happening,

00:25:13.661 --> 00:25:14.790
but it's more informal.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.030
So the question is
whose responsibility

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.880
is teaching excellence, then?

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:25.500
Is it administrative, as a
school and as a department,

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.450
that we will set
these things in motion

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:31.480
and give them financial support
and administrative support?

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.421
Or is it the faculty?

00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:33.795
So one of the
things I shared was

00:25:33.795 --> 00:25:36.910
when the Christensen Center
was first established,

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.400
there was questioning
amongst the faculty

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.230
that a center like that
would allow and give

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:47.550
a pass to a tenured faculty
to miss their mentoring

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:52.592
opportunities and basically
abdicate their responsibility

00:25:52.592 --> 00:25:55.220
to the junior faculty.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.050
To not have to take part
in that process of teaching

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.260
junior faculty because somebody
else is going to do it.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:07.020
And that they don't-- that the
burden is off the shoulders

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.890
of the senior faculty, but
that their voices are just

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:11.670
as important.

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:17.010
So as a center, we learned
early to make those voices come

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.030
into the work of the center.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.220
And how do we keep that.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.680
But that is then our
administrative department's

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:26.790
burden of maintaining
that ecosystem.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.620
So it becomes its own beast.

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:34.800
And the third leg to the
stool then is from the library

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.530
perspective, if
you've got suddenly

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:40.540
a new technology and
a new way of using

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.020
maps and data and
analysis and you're

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.110
training doctoral
students but not faculty,

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:50.490
do you not have a
responsibility to the prestige

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:54.270
of the university as a whole
to be demanding that faculty

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.555
understand the latest and
greatest for their own good

00:26:56.555 --> 00:26:57.680
and for the students' good.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:02.170
So it's this three-way
conversation of how do we--

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:04.580
we don't disagree that
excellence is needed.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.249
It's who is ultimately
responsible.

00:27:06.249 --> 00:27:07.248
That's a great question.

00:27:07.248 --> 00:27:08.580
Such a great question.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.960
And how we establish
that in the community

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.630
that we are in [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:15.730
So one of the things
that became important

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.370
when we were discussing is that
the business school faculty's

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.260
backgrounds is pretty diverse.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.640
So you can have non-MBAs,
Harvard MBAs, other MBAs,

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.660
practitioners from 20
years, newly minted PhDs,

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.960
and that does require
some leveling of the field

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.460
if you're going
to go in and teach

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.480
900 students a core course.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.100
But at the law
school, he was saying

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.290
that everybody-- everybody
has a law degree, so everybody

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:47.800
has been through a law degree
program, and to the point

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.723
where it's either
Harvard or Yale has

00:27:49.723 --> 00:27:52.555
a law degree [LAUGHTER].

00:27:52.555 --> 00:27:55.860
To the point where you already
have an established set

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.745
of rules versus
when you don't --.

00:27:57.745 --> 00:27:58.245
Yes.

00:27:58.245 --> 00:27:59.180
Selection versus development.

00:27:59.180 --> 00:27:59.820
Yes.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.420
Great.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:00.920
All right.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.500
This is very helpful.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.192
Thank you.

00:28:03.192 --> 00:28:04.150
I really appreciate it.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:04.650
OK.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:06.230
We're moving on
to question three.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:09.109
So question three was
what carrots and sticks

00:28:09.109 --> 00:28:11.400
and pressure points are used
with projects on teaching.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.790
We're kind of looping
into that realm.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.350
I'm pretty sure when we
hear from these tables

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:19.494
that we'll move back the
first question as well.

00:28:19.494 --> 00:28:21.160
But tell us what you
were talking about.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.493
How about this table right here?

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.550
So we also touched on the
diversity in the approaches

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.920
and carrots and sticks
and pressure point

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.990
across different
parts of Harvard.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:38.890
So the difference of like
meeting at the medical school,

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.190
like some real
carrots and sticks

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:44.190
for why teaching is important
there when it's not as much

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:48.000
of a focus in their practice,
whereas at the ed school,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.030
where people are
teaching about teaching,

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.750
and so therefore may want to try
new things in their classroom

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:59.040
or be exposed to what is
the latest technologies

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.700
or approaches or practices
in the classroom.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.400
And we talked a little bit
about exposure to opportunities.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.542
So I think there, it sounds--

00:29:08.542 --> 00:29:10.875
you know, it's interesting
to get this wide perspective,

00:29:10.875 --> 00:29:14.790
because there's sort of a
different level of thinking

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:18.270
about teaching
for a new faculty.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.010
At the ed school, I was--

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:25.380
I was hawking the Instructional
Moves program, which is really

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:32.010
trying to get the ed school to
be a leader, since our focus is

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.840
on teaching and education,
to be a leader in sort

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.840
of dissecting the science
of teaching for all four

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.550
universities.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:40.740
And you should all
check out the website.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:45.290
But part of the idea there is
to really get teaching down

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:48.600
to these bite-sized chunks
so that, you know, it's

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.010
great to have a three-day
teacher development training,

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.780
but this is sort of an
ongoing resource So.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:58.230
If someone-- say someone reads
their teaching evaluation,

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.260
and they're feeling
kind of downtrodden,

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.330
and they want to do
something over the summer

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:03.790
or over a break or something.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:06.090
This is a resource
for people to say,

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:09.000
I'm going to try something new
in the lecturing interactively

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.360
category, because I got some
low results on my lecturing

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.400
feedback.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.397
So that's nice resource there.

00:30:16.397 --> 00:30:18.230
And then we also talked
about the difference

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.290
between intrinsic
motivation, people

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:23.970
who want to be good teachers or
feel like that's an area they

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:27.590
need to improve
versus extrinsic,

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:33.090
like Tamara, who teaches
freshman writing at FAS

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:36.610
and has a Q score
next to her name.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.330
And that is, like, the
difference between her

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.440
continuing her job or not.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.120
And one of the things that came
up at the end of our discussion

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.890
was the idea of these
less monumentous end

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:53.580
of course evaluations and
more of things like this.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.380
You know, like this
constant feedback.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.470
And I know at the
ed school, I work

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:00.300
on a lot of the online
course development,

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.032
and we have weekly
course evaluations

00:31:03.032 --> 00:31:04.740
for the online courses,
mostly because we

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.270
don't have as much--
well, we don't

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.250
have any face-to-face
interaction with the students.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:12.015
And so having a weekly
evaluation where

00:31:12.015 --> 00:31:15.720
we're just taking the pulse of
the classes or they're saying

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.840
I found this particular
reading offensive.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.730
I found that
lecture not helpful.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.170
And it's less of--

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:23.840
what Tamara was
saying is sort of how

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.590
they're feeling in the
moment when they're

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:29.130
writing the full course
evaluation versus this dialogue

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.946
about teaching evaluation
during the course.

00:31:31.946 --> 00:31:32.445
Great.

00:31:32.445 --> 00:31:32.830
Thank you.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.330
I might throw out
a general question

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:36.290
that I think will be
somewhat controversial.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:36.860
Yes.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:37.860
If I said to the group--

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.200
I polled the group, and said
do you think that everybody

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.740
on the factory can be
a great researcher,

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.820
my guess is people'd say no.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.290
Or everybody who
enters the faculty

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:49.210
is going to be a
great researcher.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:51.840
Why do we assume everybody
can be a great teacher?

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.480
Or do we assume that?

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.400
And yes, we have lots of
faculty development programs

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.086
to make you a better
teacher than you may be.

00:31:59.086 --> 00:32:01.170
But shouldn't we
aspire just to have

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:05.671
the great teachers with our
students and really rethink--

00:32:05.671 --> 00:32:08.170
I mean, that's something we've
been doing at the med school.

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:09.910
We've talked about core faculty.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.615
But that fundamental
question, why do we

00:32:12.615 --> 00:32:14.760
assume everybody can
be a great teacher?

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.730
Because I think that
demeans teaching.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:20.460
I mean, what really great
educators are about.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.520
And I think --.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.550
[COUGHING]

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:25.400
I think that's a
terrific question.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.845
Better versus great.

00:32:26.845 --> 00:32:29.290
But certainly, I think we're
in the process of learning.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:32.070
Obviously, we're all
in part teachers,

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:35.279
so we do believe that people
can change and grow and learn.

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:37.820
And then it kind of depends in
part on what your threshold is

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.905
for great, which might
vary depending --.

00:32:39.905 --> 00:32:41.655
Well, the medical
school has three tracks.

00:32:41.655 --> 00:32:42.155
Yes.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.610
So that gets to the carrots
and sticks kind of thing,

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:46.410
too, right?

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:50.250
So what we are saying, we are
prioritizing one over the other

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:53.502
because you can't be here as a
researcher without being great.

00:32:53.502 --> 00:32:55.210
You know, again, how
do you define great?

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:56.557
I don't know.

00:32:56.557 --> 00:32:57.640
By their peers, et cetera.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:01.400
Well, and every school does
have different criteria.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.192
Promotion criteria.

00:33:02.192 --> 00:33:03.733
Which I heard some
tables talk about.

00:33:03.733 --> 00:33:05.270
In fact, Judy, you
were talking also

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:06.728
about the importance
of measurement

00:33:06.728 --> 00:33:09.300
and understanding for what
audiences and that oftentimes

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.420
their measurement
doesn't necessarily

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.650
serve their purposes
that we need it to serve.

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.829
I want to hear from
this last table,

00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:20.120
and then if we want to come
back also to this question,

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.220
we can do it in
the time remaining.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:22.820
Yes.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.320
Well, I think we
have seven minutes,

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.211
so take a couple for your table,
and then we'll bring it back.

00:33:27.211 --> 00:33:27.710
Sure.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:29.460
We talked for a while,
and what we sort of

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.220
realized after
talking for a bit was

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.480
that in a lot of ways,
the incentives that we saw

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:39.110
are actually the exact opposite
of what you would want in that

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.510
for the most part,
you know, you're

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:44.880
not going to get promotion
based on your teaching.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.036
You can only maybe not
get promoted if you

00:33:47.036 --> 00:33:48.665
have truly abysmal teaching.

00:33:48.665 --> 00:33:51.870
And so what that does
is it incentivizes

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.020
people to explicitly
not try something

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.550
that might be new and risky.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:57.371
Right.

00:33:57.371 --> 00:33:59.120
And then we, from
there, went to this idea

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.780
that we also recognize that
often good teaching yields

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.750
bad evaluations because it's
harder for the students.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.305
And so actually, our evaluations
are-- and we talked about this

00:34:09.305 --> 00:34:10.846
early this morning--
are not actually

00:34:10.846 --> 00:34:12.570
evaluating what we need
them to be evaluating.

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:13.159
That's great.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:14.908
That's exactly what
this table was saying.

00:34:14.908 --> 00:34:20.870
So what we recognized is that
you have to align those things.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:25.040
So you have to actually
create evaluations

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.380
that evaluate what you
want, but then also take it

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:31.991
into account in a way that sort
of shows what your values are.

00:34:31.991 --> 00:34:34.650
And right now, it shows
that actually, you

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:40.110
know, good teaching is not
valued over passable teaching,

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:43.670
because you're not going
to really get much benefit

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.145
from excellent teaching.

00:34:46.145 --> 00:34:47.520
And so then the
incentives end up

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.800
being more intrinsic incentives.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.090
Or we talked a little bit,
just from my experience,

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:53.857
in the medical school,
you end up with--

00:34:53.857 --> 00:34:55.773
you get graduate students
doing the teaching..

00:34:55.773 --> 00:34:57.500
Which is very
important, actually,

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.730
but also ends up sort of
being intrinsic or separate

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.741
from any sort of
structural system.

00:35:04.741 --> 00:35:05.240
Great.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.948
I love this discussion
around incentives.

00:35:06.948 --> 00:35:08.600
So we have five minutes left.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.670
I don't mind if you
end with questions.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:14.014
I think that that's
actually good.

00:35:14.014 --> 00:35:15.972
Don't forget we need time
to fill out the index

00:35:15.972 --> 00:35:16.870
cards for the last minute.

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:17.370
Yeah.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:21.731
You guys can fill out
while you're listening.

00:35:21.731 --> 00:35:24.500
Do you guys have a couple
of things you want to share?

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.670
Or do you want to take
a couple of questions?

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.050
I think the incentive question
is really interesting.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:29.870
It does vary across schools.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:31.670
I remember when I got
a teaching award when

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.487
I moved over to the
ed school, and I

00:35:33.487 --> 00:35:34.570
said is this a good thing?

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:36.028
Because I was coming
up for tenure,

00:35:36.028 --> 00:35:38.050
which is so strange
to have to as.

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:40.280
So your point about
the ed school--

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.840
I mean, it's just
very interesting,

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.955
because our incentives
are not always clear.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.204
Why is it a bad thing?

00:35:48.204 --> 00:35:50.704
Because it means you're not
doing your research [LAUGHTER]..

00:35:50.704 --> 00:35:51.560
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.634
I thought that was obvious.

00:35:53.634 --> 00:35:55.502
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:55.502 --> 00:35:57.486
I think a couple
questions would be great.

00:35:57.486 --> 00:36:01.390
And then I have one
big observation,

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:03.270
but I would love to
hear from others.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.540
One of you had-- two
of you had hands up.

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:06.040
In the back.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.290
I was just going to follow
up on the incentives thing.

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:10.625
It's not only that great
teaching isn't incentivized.

00:36:10.625 --> 00:36:13.130
It's actually the reward
for great teaching

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:13.910
is more teaching.

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:17.230
Absolutely.

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:19.680
And then your time.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.090
And sometimes I think bad
teaching or just barely

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:27.020
passable teaching is
incentivized because, honestly,

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:31.160
scholarship is where promotion
and standing in the community

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.100
is, and honestly, should be.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.606
We are a research institution.

00:36:35.606 --> 00:36:36.980
And so if there's
a problem, it's

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:39.500
not like we can just say, oh,
we'll realign our incentives.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.270
Teaching is really
where it's all at.

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:43.010
Because scholarship is.

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:45.560
And there's always so
many hours in the day.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.200
I know.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.175
Just something to keep in mind.

00:36:49.175 --> 00:36:50.800
I had a different
question, but now I'm

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.258
thinking about this
question that's

00:36:52.258 --> 00:36:54.110
the balance of research
and teaching, which

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:57.014
is part of the incentives.

00:36:57.014 --> 00:36:58.430
I'm not sure-- it
seems like we're

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:02.630
living during a pretty historic
period, where we are rethinking

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:06.110
what knowledge is, whether
knowledge should be carved up

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:08.015
into what we call
fields or disciplines

00:37:08.015 --> 00:37:11.670
or this 19th century German
model of the research

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:12.170
university.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:15.740
It seems like we're still taking
that for granted at least in,

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:16.860
I would say, in FAS.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.480
I'm not sure about
other schools,

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.810
so I only speak to that.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:24.050
And you know, I know plenty
of students personally

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:28.310
who were baffled by
the implicit acceptance

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:31.250
that there is a link between
research and teaching

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:36.350
and that scholar teachers, it
feeds each other, as opposed

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:39.830
to say taking somebody who
actually can communicate

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:42.590
and can get people to
understand a concept,

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:44.960
even if that person is
not the best in the field

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.040
or contributing new knowledge.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.980
And I wonder if that--

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.170
uncoupling that or
maybe even questioning

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:55.280
that as a kind of article
of faith in the research

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.350
university maybe will
help us understand

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:00.815
that there are different people
who need different things.

00:38:00.815 --> 00:38:03.470
People who've committed
to a concentration,

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.025
but then maybe
never go back to it.

00:38:05.025 --> 00:38:06.900
Go off and do something
completely different.

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.441
As opposed to a
graduate student, who

00:38:08.441 --> 00:38:10.410
is committing to it for life.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:14.330
I know a lot of freshmen
who could care less, really,

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:19.730
about the research element
of their professor's life

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:23.177
and don't understand why the
teaching is not prioritized.

00:38:23.177 --> 00:38:24.610
And I just want
to build on that.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:28.190
I want to push back a
little bit on just the depth

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.840
of the focus on
research to the point

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.490
where it crowds out teaching.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:35.340
We had a dean at the Kennedy
school that used to say,

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.144
we're a school.

00:38:36.144 --> 00:38:38.060
You have to remind people
that we're a school.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.460
We are not a think tank.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.135
There are think tanks out there.

00:38:41.135 --> 00:38:43.170
Harvard University
is not one of them.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.440
So if we're going
to accept students,

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.480
we actually do
have an obligation

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.210
to do a good job in
building their skills

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:51.680
and their progress
towards mastery.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.730
And I actually wanted to
draw a parallel to the idea

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:57.950
that President Faust raised
about creating synergies

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:00.000
between your research
and your teaching

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.510
to creating synergies
about kind of being

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:08.582
a strong leader or a strong
citizen and your teaching.

00:39:08.582 --> 00:39:10.790
And I think that at the med
school, one of the things

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:12.340
that struck me most
when I got there

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.840
was that the way
that they've define

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.130
their competencies
for doctors has

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:19.730
very little to do with factual
knowledge of hard science.

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:23.270
I would say 80% of the
competencies fall around things

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.270
like, can you ask
the right questions?

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.000
Can you empathize
with your patient?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.110
Are you open to
their perspective?

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:34.510
Are you going to give
them a care routine

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:36.650
that they can actually
comply with, based

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:38.450
on their socioeconomic status?

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:39.920
So these are leadership skills.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.440
These are communication skills.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.980
These a human skills.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.510
And in my view, those
things are as or more

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:47.795
important than any factual
knowledge or research

00:39:47.795 --> 00:39:50.240
knowledge that might come out.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.870
So I would just pose
another alternative.

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.540
I think we are out of time.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.840
Just-- my last observation.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.480
I teach strategy,
organizational strategy.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.570
And the one thing
that always strikes me

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:05.050
in these conversations
is how rarely one

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:07.640
says we have educational
goals we want to reach

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.460
and we have a process for
making sure that we reach them.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.390
And so much of
education is indeed

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.980
this sort of organic
entrepreneurial individual

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.100
faculty interest, but
does that measure up?

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.202
Does that sum up
to where we want--

00:40:20.202 --> 00:40:21.660
what we want our
students to learn?

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.201
And the environment
at medical school

00:40:23.201 --> 00:40:25.050
is far more required
to go that way because

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:26.060
of the external demand.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:27.780
But in these softer
fields where there

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:31.740
aren't these external
demands, it's not clear to me

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.620
that the educational
goal-setting process

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.577
is one that is linked to the
rest of what happens in terms

00:40:36.577 --> 00:40:38.660
of what gets offered and
how programs are designed

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.010
and what courses.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:41.630
So our --my school
really doesn't

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:44.118
have a strategic planning
process for education.

00:40:44.118 --> 00:40:46.076
But I think-- I don't
know about other schools,

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:48.740
but I think that's one of
the missing links for making

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:51.792
all this sort of get and give
people reason for why they

00:40:51.792 --> 00:40:53.500
teach what they teach
that may or may not

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.880
be linked to research.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.060
But this was a
fantastic conversation.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.745
It was great to hear from so
many different perspectives.

00:41:00.745 --> 00:41:03.800
Please spend time thinking
about what one thing

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.585
you learned that
you hadn't already--

00:41:05.585 --> 00:41:07.660
Or one question you could ask.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.436
You could add a question.

00:41:09.436 --> 00:41:12.800
It's a sign of a good session
if you leave with questions.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.460
So thank you.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.100
And we'll share back
to you by email.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.600
Thank you.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.750
[APPLAUSE]
