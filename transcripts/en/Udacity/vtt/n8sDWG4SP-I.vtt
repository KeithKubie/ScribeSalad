In 1995, four master software designers documented their knowledge in

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.260
a now classical book called Design Patterns. They were Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.660
Vlissides. Because of the number of the authors, this book is sometimes called

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.590
the Gang of Four book, or simply GOF. After the publication of GOF,

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.500
the idea of Design Patterns caught fire in the software design community. And

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.880
books and websites have been publishing a variety of related topics,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.800
including analysis and refinement patterns. As well as programming language

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.470
specific pattern catalogs. And even a book on anti-patterns,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.860
which are common problems to avoid. The resources page, of the class

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.350
includes a citation of the Gang of Four book as well as Alexander's book.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.620
And a pointer to a website which has a catalog of such software design patterns
