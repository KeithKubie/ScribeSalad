00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.634
First, let's check and see if we can easily factor this equation. We need to

00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:09.209
move the 16 over so that we have 0 on one side of the equation and everything

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.518
else on the other side. Then we need to try to think of two numbers that

00:00:13.518 --> 00:00:18.191
multiply to equal 9 times 16 and add to equal 24. Since we can't find two

00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:23.452
numbers like this, we can't easily factor this. Since we can't easily factor,

00:00:23.452 --> 00:00:28.535
let's try and substitute into the quadratic formula. We must determine our

00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:34.075
values for a, b, and c before substituting. Because our discriminant is equal to

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:37.840
0, we have only one solution, which is negative 4 3rds.
