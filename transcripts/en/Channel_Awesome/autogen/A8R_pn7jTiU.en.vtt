00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.500
and I still don't have time actually to
do a build today but I thought I would

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
do a build today but I thought I would
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.479

so it really inspired me to go home and

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560
so it really inspired me to go home and
 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.950
so it really inspired me to go home and
and see what I could make just using

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
and see what I could make just using
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.420
and see what I could make just using
some of the junk and stuff like that I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
some of the junk and stuff like that I
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.760
some of the junk and stuff like that I
had lying around I kind of took that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
had lying around I kind of took that
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.820
had lying around I kind of took that
challenge on and decided to make my own

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830
challenge on and decided to make my own
 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.060
challenge on and decided to make my own
set of ray guns and that actually kind

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
set of ray guns and that actually kind
 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.030
set of ray guns and that actually kind
of led into a whole other project that I

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
of led into a whole other project that I
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.580
of led into a whole other project that I
wound up doing or working on that I'm

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
wound up doing or working on that I'm
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.980
wound up doing or working on that I'm
actually still working on today and it's

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
actually still working on today and it's
 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.470
actually still working on today and it's
kind of a long process but this was one

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480
kind of a long process but this was one
 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.630
kind of a long process but this was one
of the first ray guns that I made the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
of the first ray guns that I made the
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.540
of the first ray guns that I made the
body of it is an electrical connector

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550
body of it is an electrical connector
 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.500
body of it is an electrical connector
box just a two-port and I left the top

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510
box just a two-port and I left the top
 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.670
box just a two-port and I left the top
open and popped in a PVC pipe with a cap

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680
open and popped in a PVC pipe with a cap
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.190
open and popped in a PVC pipe with a cap
and some fake rivets held it all

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200
and some fake rivets held it all
 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.960
and some fake rivets held it all
together with plumber's putty and the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970
together with plumber's putty and the
 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.089
together with plumber's putty and the
handle was - a cheap dollar store car

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099
handle was - a cheap dollar store car
 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.949

chamois or something like that not that
 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.770
chamois or something like that not that
I just cut off and cut off the bottom of

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780
I just cut off and cut off the bottom of
 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.649
I just cut off and cut off the bottom of
the box and insert it in there shot some

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659
the box and insert it in there shot some
 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.140
the box and insert it in there shot some
screws in it and because the the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150
screws in it and because the the
 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.460
screws in it and because the the
electrical boxes are they hollow I

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470
electrical boxes are they hollow I
 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.800
electrical boxes are they hollow I
actually put like a toy gun trigger

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
actually put like a toy gun trigger
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.660
actually put like a toy gun trigger
mount inside there with the springs and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670
mount inside there with the springs and
 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.700
mount inside there with the springs and
stuff like that so it

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710
stuff like that so it
 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.120
stuff like that so it
we kind of you know press depress the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130
we kind of you know press depress the
 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.540
we kind of you know press depress the
the trigger and it kind of works and

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550
the trigger and it kind of works and
 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.360
the trigger and it kind of works and
then as the piece of I think it was

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370
then as the piece of I think it was
 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.520
then as the piece of I think it was
maybe aluminum strapped that I used for

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530
maybe aluminum strapped that I used for
 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.820
maybe aluminum strapped that I used for
the trigger guard and screwed it in and

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830
the trigger guard and screwed it in and
 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.370
the trigger guard and screwed it in and
then the barrel consists of a piece of

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380
then the barrel consists of a piece of
 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.080
then the barrel consists of a piece of
conduit with some washers conduit

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090
conduit with some washers conduit
 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.680
conduit with some washers conduit
connector and then that and here this is

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690
connector and then that and here this is
 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.740
connector and then that and here this is
just off of a flashlight broken

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750
just off of a flashlight broken
 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.730
just off of a flashlight broken
flashlight and this part here is the

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740
flashlight and this part here is the
 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.150
flashlight and this part here is the
stem off of our cartridge off of a

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160
stem off of our cartridge off of a
 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.010

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.600
metering like shower handle and he had a
bunch of I was replaced them all the

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610
bunch of I was replaced them all the
 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.890
bunch of I was replaced them all the
time at my old job and I thought they

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900
time at my old job and I thought they
 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.830
time at my old job and I thought they
kind of look cool and be a good part to

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840
kind of look cool and be a good part to
 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.330
kind of look cool and be a good part to
something else and so that was just the

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340
something else and so that was just the
 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.450
something else and so that was just the
end of it and then this part here is a

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460
end of it and then this part here is a
 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.820

lawnmower muffler and it was kind of it
 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.320
lawnmower muffler and it was kind of it
was threaded on one end and it actually

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330
was threaded on one end and it actually
 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.110
was threaded on one end and it actually
fit perfectly into the threads on the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120
fit perfectly into the threads on the
 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.040
fit perfectly into the threads on the
electrical connector box so yeah and

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050
electrical connector box so yeah and
 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.720
electrical connector box so yeah and
this other parts are just pieces of

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730
this other parts are just pieces of
 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.050
this other parts are just pieces of
plastic that I filled with some putty to

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060
plastic that I filled with some putty to
 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.730
plastic that I filled with some putty to
kind of keep more rigid and some pieces

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740
kind of keep more rigid and some pieces
 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.720

elbow there but that was it it was just

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840
elbow there but that was it it was just
 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.500
elbow there but that was it it was just
kind of an organic process I was finding

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510
kind of an organic process I was finding
 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.700
kind of an organic process I was finding
parts and I thought then this is the

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710
parts and I thought then this is the
 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.130
parts and I thought then this is the
cool I think I could use this and I just

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140
cool I think I could use this and I just
 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.990
cool I think I could use this and I just
kind of cobbled it together and yeah he

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000
kind of cobbled it together and yeah he
 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.120
kind of cobbled it together and yeah he
just repurposed them and you know give

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130
just repurposed them and you know give
 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.250
just repurposed them and you know give
him another paint job and it becomes a

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260
him another paint job and it becomes a
 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.730
him another paint job and it becomes a
pretty cool looking Arabia you know the

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740
pretty cool looking Arabia you know the
 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.470
pretty cool looking Arabia you know the
second one that I did was a little bit I

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480

I would hope inspires you to just go out
 

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.380
I would hope inspires you to just go out
and start building stuff you don't need

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:00.390
and start building stuff you don't need

that specific design if you have the
 

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.150
that specific design if you have the
ability to do that and the materials to

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160
ability to do that and the materials to
 

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.590
ability to do that and the materials to
do that that's a very important skill to

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:28.600
do that that's a very important skill to
 

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.090
do that that's a very important skill to
have you know because of you're working

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:30.100
have you know because of you're working
 

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.640
have you know because of you're working
in the industry then you're gonna be

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:32.650
in the industry then you're gonna be
 

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.829
in the industry then you're gonna be
working with directors and producers and

00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:34.839
working with directors and producers and
 

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:36.480
working with directors and producers and
stuff like that and they're you're gonna

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:36.490
stuff like that and they're you're gonna
 

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.850
stuff like that and they're you're gonna
have a very specific idea of how they

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:38.860
have a very specific idea of how they
 

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.740
have a very specific idea of how they
want the design to look and then you

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:40.750
want the design to look and then you
 

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.550
want the design to look and then you
have to match that exactly but a lot of

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560
have to match that exactly but a lot of
 

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.140
have to match that exactly but a lot of
times then if you're just creating like

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.150
times then if you're just creating like
 

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.720
times then if you're just creating like
background props and stuff like that but

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:48.730
background props and stuff like that but
 

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:49.920
background props and stuff like that but
they still have to look interesting and

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:49.930
they still have to look interesting and
 

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.230
they still have to look interesting and
cool and you have to build them quick

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240
cool and you have to build them quick
 

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.740
cool and you have to build them quick
and cheap a good skill to have is it's

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:55.750
and cheap a good skill to have is it's
 

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.170
and cheap a good skill to have is it's
kind of taking bits and pieces of other

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:58.180
kind of taking bits and pieces of other
 

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.120
kind of taking bits and pieces of other
leftover parts and putting something

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.130
leftover parts and putting something
 

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.340
leftover parts and putting something
together and making something completely

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:02.350
together and making something completely
 

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.460
together and making something completely
new and it kind of hones your skills

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:05.470
new and it kind of hones your skills
 

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.850
new and it kind of hones your skills
kinda keeps you sharp when you're

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:08.860
kinda keeps you sharp when you're
 

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.750
kinda keeps you sharp when you're
working with a lot of when you have

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:10.760
working with a lot of when you have
 

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.889
working with a lot of when you have
access to a line of those different

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:11.899
access to a line of those different
 

00:09:11.899 --> 00:09:13.210
access to a line of those different
materials or if you're like pulling

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:13.220
materials or if you're like pulling
 

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.949
materials or if you're like pulling
stuff off the shelf

00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959
stuff off the shelf
 

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:16.540
stuff off the shelf
you're like I actually that looks cool I

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:16.550
you're like I actually that looks cool I
 

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.460
you're like I actually that looks cool I
could use that for this or you know that

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:18.470
could use that for this or you know that
 

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:19.810
could use that for this or you know that
plumbing part looks kind of need if I

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:19.820
plumbing part looks kind of need if I
 

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.430
plumbing part looks kind of need if I
totally repurpose it and just use that

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440
totally repurpose it and just use that
 

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.449
totally repurpose it and just use that
part for this another part for this and

00:09:24.449 --> 00:09:24.459
part for this another part for this and
 

00:09:24.459 --> 00:09:26.620
part for this another part for this and
because sometimes that the elements

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:26.630
because sometimes that the elements
 

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.730
because sometimes that the elements
become very recognizable unless you hide

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:30.740
become very recognizable unless you hide
 

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.129
become very recognizable unless you hide
within another object and you know

00:09:33.129 --> 00:09:33.139
within another object and you know
 

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:35.050
within another object and you know
repaint it and other things it kind of

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:35.060
repaint it and other things it kind of
 

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.780
repaint it and other things it kind of
becomes very obvious that you know like

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:37.790
becomes very obvious that you know like
 

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.370
becomes very obvious that you know like
this is an electrical box or that this

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:39.380
this is an electrical box or that this
 

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.530
this is an electrical box or that this
is a piece of and conduit connector and

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:41.540
is a piece of and conduit connector and
 

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:46.509
is a piece of and conduit connector and
stuff but yeah this spacesuit once I I

00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:46.519
stuff but yeah this spacesuit once I I
 

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:48.699
stuff but yeah this spacesuit once I I
built the ray guns and I kind of put the

00:09:48.699 --> 00:09:48.709
built the ray guns and I kind of put the
 

00:09:48.709 --> 00:09:49.840
built the ray guns and I kind of put the
time and I was happy with what they

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:49.850
time and I was happy with what they
 

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.100
time and I was happy with what they
turned out I thought it'd be fun to make

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:51.110
turned out I thought it'd be fun to make
 

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.050
turned out I thought it'd be fun to make
a little short film and then then

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:53.060
a little short film and then then
 

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.449
a little short film and then then
actually kind of escalated into a whole

00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:55.459
actually kind of escalated into a whole
 

00:09:55.459 --> 00:09:58.509
actually kind of escalated into a whole
series that I'm kind of still working on

00:09:58.509 --> 00:09:58.519
series that I'm kind of still working on
 

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:00.250
series that I'm kind of still working on
hopefully one day I'll have an

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:00.260
hopefully one day I'll have an
 

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.470
hopefully one day I'll have an
opportunity to share with you guys but

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480
opportunity to share with you guys but
 

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.480
opportunity to share with you guys but
this one I know people have inquired

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:04.490
this one I know people have inquired
 

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.910
this one I know people have inquired
about this giant diving helmet thing

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:06.920
about this giant diving helmet thing
 

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.810
about this giant diving helmet thing
this and actually it's it's a spacesuit

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:09.820
this and actually it's it's a spacesuit
 

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.430
this and actually it's it's a spacesuit
my head actually comes out or the ecers

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:12.440
my head actually comes out or the ecers
 

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:27.939
my head actually comes out or the ecers
head comes out here and and so it

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:27.949
head comes out here and and so it
 

00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:29.740
head comes out here and and so it
basically comes up to like here like my

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:29.750
basically comes up to like here like my
 

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.650
basically comes up to like here like my
nose kind of an eyes fit in it and so

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:32.660
nose kind of an eyes fit in it and so
 

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.970
nose kind of an eyes fit in it and so
I've got this piece so I can breathe and

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:35.980
I've got this piece so I can breathe and
 

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.360
I've got this piece so I can breathe and
this is just a door stopper with piece

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:40.370
this is just a door stopper with piece
 

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.569
this is just a door stopper with piece
of plumber's putty on the tip there but

00:10:43.569 --> 00:10:43.579
of plumber's putty on the tip there but
 

00:10:43.579 --> 00:10:46.090
of plumber's putty on the tip there but
the the overall design kind of started

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:46.100
the the overall design kind of started
 

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.240
the the overall design kind of started
from from this I found this dome as a

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:48.250
from from this I found this dome as a
 

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:52.319
from from this I found this dome as a
irrigation dome I had a nurse door and

00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:52.329
irrigation dome I had a nurse door and
 

00:10:52.329 --> 00:10:55.660
irrigation dome I had a nurse door and
part of a planter and that's the

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:55.670
part of a planter and that's the
 

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.090
part of a planter and that's the
irrigation dome and it was like 2 bucks

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:58.100
irrigation dome and it was like 2 bucks
 

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.439
irrigation dome and it was like 2 bucks
or something like that and I was like I

00:10:59.439 --> 00:10:59.449
or something like that and I was like I
 

00:10:59.449 --> 00:11:02.400
or something like that and I was like I
gotta build a spacesuit around this dome

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:02.410
gotta build a spacesuit around this dome
 

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:08.759
gotta build a spacesuit around this dome
so initially what I did so initially

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:08.769
so initially what I did so initially
 

00:11:08.769 --> 00:11:11.759
so initially what I did so initially
this was actually I just got another

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:11.769
this was actually I just got another
 

00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:16.900
this was actually I just got another
planter and cut it so that it would fit

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:16.910
planter and cut it so that it would fit
 

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.350
planter and cut it so that it would fit
like this and then I was gonna add stuff

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360
like this and then I was gonna add stuff
 

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.140
like this and then I was gonna add stuff
to it

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:21.150
to it
 

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.440
to it
I would have to have some kind of way to

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:24.450
I would have to have some kind of way to
 

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.690
I would have to have some kind of way to
reduce it so that the dome would fit on

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700
reduce it so that the dome would fit on
 

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.210
reduce it so that the dome would fit on
top of this and that was in the process

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220
top of this and that was in the process
 

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.270
top of this and that was in the process
of making this be the top her the suit

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:32.280
of making this be the top her the suit
 

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.580
of making this be the top her the suit
and I realized I needed to get something

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:34.590
and I realized I needed to get something
 

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.940
and I realized I needed to get something
that would connect the dome to it so I

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:37.950
that would connect the dome to it so I
 

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.720
that would connect the dome to it so I
was gonna go to a party store and get

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:40.730
was gonna go to a party store and get
 

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.720
was gonna go to a party store and get
just a cheap punch bowl and cut out the

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:44.730
just a cheap punch bowl and cut out the
 

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.030
just a cheap punch bowl and cut out the
top and then use that and I could stick

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040
top and then use that and I could stick
 

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.740
top and then use that and I could stick
my head through and put the dome on and

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:48.750
my head through and put the dome on and
 

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.930
my head through and put the dome on and
when I walked in it was like early

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:50.940
when I walked in it was like early
 

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.340
when I walked in it was like early
September and they already had their

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:52.350
September and they already had their
 

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:57.020

cauldron
 

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.540
cauldron
that they were selling for like 12 bucks

00:11:59.540 --> 00:11:59.550
that they were selling for like 12 bucks
 

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.860
that they were selling for like 12 bucks
it was super cheap and so that's all

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:03.870
it was super cheap and so that's all
 

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.230
it was super cheap and so that's all
this is is a cauldron that I turned

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240
this is is a cauldron that I turned
 

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.970
this is is a cauldron that I turned
upside down and I cut a hole out of the

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:07.980
upside down and I cut a hole out of the
 

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.530
upside down and I cut a hole out of the
top of my head I still bought the punch

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540
top of my head I still bought the punch
 

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.620
top of my head I still bought the punch
bowl and put that as the top part and

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:12.630
bowl and put that as the top part and
 

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:17.680
bowl and put that as the top part and
cut out these pieces for my arms and

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:17.690
cut out these pieces for my arms and
 

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.030
cut out these pieces for my arms and
yeah I did I cut out the center piece

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040
yeah I did I cut out the center piece
 

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.610
yeah I did I cut out the center piece
and added like the tap light or whatever

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:22.620
and added like the tap light or whatever
 

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.310
and added like the tap light or whatever
so it has that kind of you know now

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320
so it has that kind of you know now
 

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.800
so it has that kind of you know now
Jules Verne sort of style it does look

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:27.810
Jules Verne sort of style it does look
 

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.160

like a like a diving helmet
 

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.270
like a like a diving helmet
but that's the idea is that looked kind

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:32.280
but that's the idea is that looked kind
 

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.100
but that's the idea is that looked kind
of like big and cumbersome and iron and

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:34.110
of like big and cumbersome and iron and
 

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.830
of like big and cumbersome and iron and

yeah once you throw some phony rivets on

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:49.140
yeah once you throw some phony rivets on
 

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.560
yeah once you throw some phony rivets on

cut the handle and stuff into and then
the top is yeah just a piece of plastic

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480
the top is yeah just a piece of plastic
 

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.390
the top is yeah just a piece of plastic
again that I just cut and shaped real

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400
again that I just cut and shaped real
 

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.650
again that I just cut and shaped real
quick

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:23.660
quick
 

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.079
quick
but yeah it's overall it gives kind of a

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:26.089
but yeah it's overall it gives kind of a
 

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:29.170
but yeah it's overall it gives kind of a
neat very iconic sort of retro sci-fi

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:29.180
neat very iconic sort of retro sci-fi
 

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.410
neat very iconic sort of retro sci-fi
look and it kind of has a neat sort of

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:32.420
look and it kind of has a neat sort of
 

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.640
look and it kind of has a neat sort of
feel to on-screen it's like it looked

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:36.650
feel to on-screen it's like it looked
 

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.350
feel to on-screen it's like it looked
really neat the one problem was I shed a

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360
really neat the one problem was I shed a
 

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.380
really neat the one problem was I shed a
lot of green screen stuff and the when

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:41.390
lot of green screen stuff and the when
 

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.610
lot of green screen stuff and the when
you have stuff that's very reflective

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:42.620
you have stuff that's very reflective
 

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.150
you have stuff that's very reflective
it's really hard to key so I would

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160
it's really hard to key so I would
 

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.290
it's really hard to key so I would
recommend possibly dirtying up a bit if

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:50.300
recommend possibly dirtying up a bit if
 

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.120
recommend possibly dirtying up a bit if
you're gonna shoot stuff doing green

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:52.130
you're gonna shoot stuff doing green
 

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:58.930
you're gonna shoot stuff doing green
screen but do you otherwise

00:17:58.930 --> 00:17:58.940
screen but do you otherwise
 

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.190
screen but do you otherwise
maybe they'll save those for another

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:00.200
maybe they'll save those for another
 

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.040
maybe they'll save those for another
time this episodes already gotten

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.050
time this episodes already gotten
 

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.040
time this episodes already gotten
probably a little bit longer than you

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:05.050
probably a little bit longer than you
 

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.940
probably a little bit longer than you
have any patience for something Oh

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:08.950
have any patience for something Oh
 

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.930
have any patience for something Oh
actually you know one more thing I

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:10.940
actually you know one more thing I
 

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.460
actually you know one more thing I
actually going to talk about this how

there and again it's all the same
 

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.950
there and again it's all the same
project and it was really I know it has

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:23.960
project and it was really I know it has
 

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.900
project and it was really I know it has
kind of a Rocketeer look

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:25.910
kind of a Rocketeer look
 

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.360
kind of a Rocketeer look
but the The Rocketeer helmet and that

but the The Rocketeer helmet and that
 

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.400
but the The Rocketeer helmet and that
whole design was very closely modeled

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:30.410
whole design was very closely modeled
 

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.970
whole design was very closely modeled
after a lot of other kind of movie

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:33.980
after a lot of other kind of movie
 

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.730
after a lot of other kind of movie
serial type characters like Buck Rogers

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:36.740
serial type characters like Buck Rogers
 

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.370
serial type characters like Buck Rogers
and Flash Gordon and spice masher and

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:39.380
and Flash Gordon and spice masher and
 

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.540
and Flash Gordon and spice masher and
stuff like that and really this this

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:42.550
stuff like that and really this this
 

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:46.380
stuff like that and really this this
design that I used was modeled after

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:46.390
design that I used was modeled after
 

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:53.590
design that I used was modeled after
Buck Rogers comic book and it had this

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600
Buck Rogers comic book and it had this
 

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.580
Buck Rogers comic book and it had this
very specific type of look I gave it the

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:56.590
very specific type of look I gave it the
 

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.320
very specific type of look I gave it the
the paint job that kind of lends itself

00:18:59.320 --> 00:18:59.330
the paint job that kind of lends itself
 

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:03.100
the paint job that kind of lends itself
a little bit more to that Rocketeer kind

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:03.110
a little bit more to that Rocketeer kind
 

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.780
a little bit more to that Rocketeer kind
of style but yeah it's a very Art Deco

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:06.790
of style but yeah it's a very Art Deco
 

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:10.990
of style but yeah it's a very Art Deco
kind of piece and again I was super

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.000
kind of piece and again I was super
 

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.050
kind of piece and again I was super
cheap I wanted to make the helmet I had

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:14.060
cheap I wanted to make the helmet I had
 

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.910
cheap I wanted to make the helmet I had
the idea for the design of my head and

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:15.920
the idea for the design of my head and
 

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.610
the idea for the design of my head and
so I went to a costume shop and they had

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620
so I went to a costume shop and they had
 

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.980
so I went to a costume shop and they had
Centurion helmet like a Roman centurion

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:21.990
Centurion helmet like a Roman centurion
 

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.560
Centurion helmet like a Roman centurion
helmet and I was like that's pretty

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:24.570
helmet and I was like that's pretty
 

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.840
helmet and I was like that's pretty
close I think that's close enough or as

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:26.850
close I think that's close enough or as
 

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.029
close I think that's close enough or as
close as I'm gonna get to the helmet I

00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039
close as I'm gonna get to the helmet I
 

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:32.210
close as I'm gonna get to the helmet I
want and it's really cheap being I did I

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:32.220
want and it's really cheap being I did I
 

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.180
want and it's really cheap being I did I
again I was trying to build it but it's

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:35.190
again I was trying to build it but it's
 

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.120
again I was trying to build it but it's
very little to no money so I think that

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:38.130
very little to no money so I think that
 

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.680
very little to no money so I think that
that's ensuring helmet was maybe like 12

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:39.690
that's ensuring helmet was maybe like 12
 

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.919
that's ensuring helmet was maybe like 12
bucks and it was really made a comic a

00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:42.929
bucks and it was really made a comic a
 

00:19:42.929 --> 00:19:45.740
bucks and it was really made a comic a
cheap plastic but when I heated it it

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:45.750
cheap plastic but when I heated it it
 

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.750
cheap plastic but when I heated it it
was able I could actually kind of reform

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760
was able I could actually kind of reform
 

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.370
was able I could actually kind of reform
it a little bit so I wound up cutting

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.380
it a little bit so I wound up cutting
 

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.409
it a little bit so I wound up cutting
off the back of the helmet that kind of

00:19:51.409 --> 00:19:51.419
off the back of the helmet that kind of
 

00:19:51.419 --> 00:19:53.600
off the back of the helmet that kind of
swooped out I didn't like that design

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:53.610
swooped out I didn't like that design
 

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.549
swooped out I didn't like that design
and I didn't want it to look too much

00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559
and I didn't want it to look too much
 

00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:57.320
and I didn't want it to look too much
like a century gnome and I took the

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:57.330
like a century gnome and I took the
 

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.390
like a century gnome and I took the
crust off the top with the plume and

00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400
crust off the top with the plume and
 

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.240
crust off the top with the plume and
everything and then replaced it with

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:01.250
everything and then replaced it with
 

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.770
everything and then replaced it with
again is the piece of plastic that I cut

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:03.780
again is the piece of plastic that I cut
 

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:08.539
again is the piece of plastic that I cut
and then to give it some texture or

00:20:08.539 --> 00:20:08.549
and then to give it some texture or
 

00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:10.990
and then to give it some texture or
layers I just added another piece here

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000
layers I just added another piece here
 

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.930
layers I just added another piece here
that was made out of craft foam and then

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940
that was made out of craft foam and then
 

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:18.100
that was made out of craft foam and then
the ear pieces are just craft foam

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:18.110
the ear pieces are just craft foam
 

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:20.510
the ear pieces are just craft foam
cutting the circles and then reshaped

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520
cutting the circles and then reshaped
 

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.880
cutting the circles and then reshaped
kind of give it that rounded kind of

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:22.890
kind of give it that rounded kind of
 

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.760
kind of give it that rounded kind of
feel and the back is craft foam I have a

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:25.770
feel and the back is craft foam I have a
 

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.020
feel and the back is craft foam I have a
kind of just several pieces that I glued

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.030
kind of just several pieces that I glued
 

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:33.169
kind of just several pieces that I glued
and that sort of reduces the helmet

00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179
and that sort of reduces the helmet
 

00:20:33.179 --> 00:20:34.820
and that sort of reduces the helmet
kinda brings it back in and makes it a

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:34.830
kinda brings it back in and makes it a
 

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.130
kinda brings it back in and makes it a
little bit more form-fitting and then

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.140
little bit more form-fitting and then
 

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.899
little bit more form-fitting and then
again using some craft or some this is a

00:20:41.899 --> 00:20:41.909
again using some craft or some this is a
 

00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:44.510
again using some craft or some this is a
foam man actually that I built the jaw

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520
foam man actually that I built the jaw
 

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.480
foam man actually that I built the jaw
piece out of its kind of falling apart

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:47.490
piece out of its kind of falling apart
 

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:52.940
piece out of its kind of falling apart
now but it would snap in like that and I

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:52.950
now but it would snap in like that and I
 

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:57.700
now but it would snap in like that and I
had the the chin piece actually has a

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:57.710
had the the chin piece actually has a
 

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.260
had the the chin piece actually has a
elastic strap I had the to it so I could

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:00.270
elastic strap I had the to it so I could
 

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.850
elastic strap I had the to it so I could
talk and stuff like that I wasn't

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:01.860
talk and stuff like that I wasn't
 

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.669
talk and stuff like that I wasn't
restricted but it also was still held

00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679
restricted but it also was still held
 

00:21:04.679 --> 00:21:07.220
restricted but it also was still held
its shape and its form and then I could

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:07.230
its shape and its form and then I could
 

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.840
its shape and its form and then I could
also talk and it would move around and

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:08.850
also talk and it would move around and
 

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.659
also talk and it would move around and
stuff like that yeah I think that's

00:21:11.659 --> 00:21:11.669
stuff like that yeah I think that's
 

00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:13.850
stuff like that yeah I think that's
about it for today I've got a few more

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.860
about it for today I've got a few more
 

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.169
about it for today I've got a few more
pieces and stuff like that but I'll

00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179
pieces and stuff like that but I'll
 

00:21:15.179 --> 00:21:17.659
pieces and stuff like that but I'll
probably go into more that next time or

00:21:17.659 --> 00:21:17.669
probably go into more that next time or
 

00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:21.080
probably go into more that next time or
hopefully I'm when the project kind of

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:21.090
hopefully I'm when the project kind of
 

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.419
hopefully I'm when the project kind of
ramps up again maybe I'll I'll show you

00:21:23.419 --> 00:21:23.429
ramps up again maybe I'll I'll show you
 

00:21:23.429 --> 00:21:24.600
ramps up again maybe I'll I'll show you
guys a little bit more

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:24.610
guys a little bit more
 

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:25.980
