00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.310
There's one more useful thing we can add to our polygon creator, changing the

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.288
radius of the polygon. By default, the distance of all the points from the

00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:12.386
polygon center is 1. Now, modify the program to use a radius to make the polygon

00:00:12.386 --> 00:00:16.350
generated larger or smaller. Here's your new interface. Notice that we've

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.605
changed the order of arguments here. In the previous problem, the location was

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:24.497
the second argument. Now it's the third. This is usually not a great idea,

00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:28.523
especially in JavaScript, as this language does not really check if the number

00:00:28.523 --> 00:00:32.566
of arguments passed in matches the number of arguments expected. We did it this

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:36.150
way because we felt the location change is a bit easier than the radius change

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.262
and wanted to save the trickier problem for later. When your work is complete,

00:00:40.262 --> 00:00:42.113
this is what you should see on the screen.
