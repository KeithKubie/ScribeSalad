00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.879
For all the things that Charles Dickens’
“A Christmas Carol” is known for, Tiny

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.099
Tim, a relatively minor character in terms
of appearances in the story (but, importantly,

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.120
one of wholesome heart despite his physical
condition), was one of the characters that

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.949
Dickens wanted people to pay the most attention
to.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.050
After all, he wrote “A Christmas Carol”
to bring more attention to the plight of the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.930
children of the poor- a subject Dickens was
extremely passionate about owing to his own

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.890
experience with poverty as a child.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.170
Dickens was born on February 7, 1812 in rural
England to a middle class family turned impoverished

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.120
when his father, a clerk named John, mismanaged
his finances and ended up being sent to Marshalsea

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.420
debtors’ prison.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.870
As was the practice at the time, most of the
family joined him in jail – but not so for

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.269
Charles, who was deemed old enough to make
his own way in the world.

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.010
The 12 year old boy was moved into cheap lodgings
away from his family, removed from school,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.580
and sent to Warren’s Shoe Blacking Factory.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.350
His job there was to spend six days per week
pasting labels on jars of shoe polish.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.030
His weekly pay for this was six shillings
(about £22 or $29 today) with which he had

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.770
to entirely support himself on.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.610
Beyond having to endure insanely long work
hours at a monotonous task, he also was subjected

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.780
to appalling work conditions, including the
occasional physical abuse.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.259
However, it was the psychological trauma of
the situation, and that nobody seemed at all

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.310
even mildly interested in his plight, that
Dickens would later lament the most when describing

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.590
what he considered the low point of his life:

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.930
It is wonderful to me how I could have been
so easily cast away at such an age.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.829
It is wonderful to me that, even after my
descent into the poor little drudge I had

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.549
been since we came to London, no one had compassion
enough on me- a child of singular abilities,

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.759
quick, eager, delicate, and soon hurt, bodily
or mentally- to suggest that something might

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.939
have been spared, as certainly it might have
been, to place me at any common school.

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.640
Our friends, I take it, were tired out.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.090
No one made any sign.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.180
My father and mother were quite satisfied.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.160
They could hardly have been more so if I had
been twenty years of age, distinguished at

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.730
a grammar-school, and going to Cambridge.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.130
The blacking-warehouse was the last house
on the left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.130
Stairs.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.110
It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting
of course on the river, and literally overrun

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.150
with rats.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.830
Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors
and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.050
down in the cellars, and the sound of their
squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.629
at all times, and the dirt and decay of the
place, rise up visibly before me, as if I

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:46.690
were there again.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.470
The counting-house was on the first floor,
looking over the coal-barges and the river.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.069
There was a recess in it, in which I was to
sit and work.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.129
My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking;
first with a piece of oil-paper, and then

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.319
with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round
with a string; and then to clip the paper

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.019
close and neat, all round, until it looked
as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary’s

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.019
shop.

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.540
When a certain number of grosses of pots had
attained this pitch of perfection, I was to

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.599
paste on each a printed label, and then go
on again with more pots.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.010
Two or three other boys were kept at similar
duty down-stairs on similar wages.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.709
One of them came up, in a ragged apron and
a paper cap, on the first Monday morning,

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.780
to show me the trick of using the string and
tying the knot.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.680
His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty
of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.680
Twist….

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.819
No words can express the secret agony of my
soul as I sunk into this companionship; compared

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.319
these every-day associates with those of my
happier childhood; and felt my early hopes

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.090
of growing up to be a learned and distinguished
man, crushed in my breast.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.150
The deep remembrance of the sense I had of
being utterly neglected and hopeless; of the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.250
shame I felt in my position; of the misery
it was to my young heart to believe that,

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.620
day by day, what I had learned, and thought,
and delighted in, and raised my fancy and

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.319
my emulation up by, was passing away from
me, never to be brought back any more; cannot

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.319
be written.

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.470
My whole nature was so penetrated with the
grief and humiliation of such considerations,

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.310
that even now, famous and caressed and happy,
I often forget in my dreams that I have a

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.250
dear wife and children; even that I am a man;
and wander desolately back to that time of

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.870
my life.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.289
Deliverance from this fate came in the form
of John Dickens inheriting £450 upon the

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.810
death of John’s mother, Elizabeth Dickens.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.210
With this money, the Dickens family was able
to get out of debtors’ prison (though John

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.790
would later end up back there again, and likely
many times, had it not been for Charles, due

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.169
to a habit of over spending).

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.890
This was not an immediate end to Charles’
miserable situation, however.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.860
Rather than being returned to school, he was
forced to continue to work at the shoe blacking

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.510
factory for another year, apparently largely
due to his mother’s insistence, something

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.550
Dickens later would write of, “I never afterwards
forgot, I never shall forget, I never can

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.970
forget, that my mother was warm for my being
sent back.”

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.700
Eventually, however, he was allowed to quit
and go back to school.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.220
After quick dalliances as a law clerk at the
age of 15 and later a theater actor, he became

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.840
a political journalist covering the House
of Commons.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.680
At the same time, he also began to write his
first fiction pieces under the pseudonym of

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.440
“Boz” (a nickname family members had given
him).

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.480
His work began to gain traction, punctuated
by Dickens’ marriage to his book editor’s

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.210
daughter, Catherine, and the publishing of
Pickwick Papers – which both occurred in

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.440
April of 1836.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.740
Two years later, he published Oliver Twist
and Dickens’ road to literary stardom was

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.740
paved.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.420
In 1843, Dickens was only 31 years old and
already perhaps the most famous author of

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.420
his day.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.380
Despite this, he was constantly in need of
money.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.570
Much like his father before him, he had a
habit of seemingly always living at the limits

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.870
of his means.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.390
Unlike his father, however, his means were
considerable and generally grew over time.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.789
This was a good thing as he was also financially
responsible for a large family, which included

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.669
his wife, (eventually) ten children, a mistress,
brothers, sisters, and his parents.

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.380
Needless to say, even before all his children
arrived and he took up a mistress at the age

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.430
of 45, he wasn’t well prepared financially
to handle one of his works not selling well,

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.310
which is exactly what happened when he published
a serial beginning in 1842 that was a relative

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.839
flop – “Martin Chuzzlewit.”

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:30.280
While teetering on the edge of financial ruin,
a report came out, compiled by one of Dickens’

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.070
friends, Richard Henry Horne, that is today
considered one of the most important documents

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.620
in British industrial revolution history.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.610
In short, the comprehensive Report of the
Children’s Employment Commission details

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:50.010
the extreme, unhealthy, dangerous, exploitative,
and just generally horrific working conditions

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.950
many poor children were forced to endure in
the UK.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.419
The report did this in the most heartbreak
fashion- through countless first-hand testimonials

00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:59.500
of the kids themselves.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.010
Stories like teenager Isaac Tipton, who said
he started in the coal mines at seven years

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.349
old, working 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:11.470
Over the course of his duties, he notes he
was regularly beaten by the older miners,

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.350
but “[I] deserved it…”

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.039
There were also more extreme reports of children
being killed or mangled owing to being treated

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:21.470
as disposable commodities, rather than human
beings.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.719
For example, it outlines the practice of having
children climb into industrial machinery to

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:30.840
do things like remove jams, with the report
noting cases where removal resulted in the

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.720
child’s death when the machinery starting
again with them still inside of it.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.039
On top of this, there were stories of young
girls working in garment factories sewing

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:43.400
with bleeding fingers- 16 hours per day, 6
days a week.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.550
The most shocking thing of all brought to
light by the massive report was that these

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:52.270
conditions weren’t the exceptions, but more
the rule for the children of the poor in the

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.360
newly industrialized Britain.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.650
The report also seemed to debunk by numerous
examples a commonly held idea about the poor-

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.940
that they were only poor because they were
lazy, drunks, inherently immoral, lacking

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.970
in intelligence, or were deformed in some
way.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.270
Along this line of thinking, proposed government
aid to such individuals was intentionally

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.650
harsh- like the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act,
which stopped government aid to the poor unless

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.589
they went to a workhouse, with said institutions
meant just as much to act as discouragement

00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:24.969
from being poor as to actually help those
in need.

00:08:24.969 --> 00:08:29.570
As such, as “Factory King” Richard Oastler
noted, workhouses essentially became “Prisons

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.620
for the Poor”.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.430
Families were split in the workhouses and
the work provided was generally incredibly

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.760
grueling, with little food given to sustain
the occupants.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.730
On top of that, workhouse masters were deliberately
cruel and abusive to those who resided in

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:43.750
their workhouse.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:48.410
After all, if workhouse conditions were fully
humane, it only encouraged people to remain

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:54.410
lazy and immoral, which was of course the
cause of their being poor in the first place…

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.430
As you might imagine from all this, there
were frequent scandals that emerged about

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:03.300
various workhouses, such as reports of starving
residents being forced to eat rotting flesh

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.730
just to survive.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:05.730
Unsurprisingly, as proclaimed by the unnamed
charitable solicitor in A Christmas Carol,

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.730
workhouses were places that many “would
rather die” than go.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.380
On this note, the fact that losing one’s
job might have meant having to go to a workhouse

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:14.090
was something that many business owners used
to further exploit their workers.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.960
This brings us to Scrooge’s famous remark,
“If they would rather die, they had better

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.510
do it, and decrease the surplus population.”

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:26.740
While this seems to us today to demonstrate
clearly Scrooge was a true villain- not something

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.780
a normal person would ever think- this wasn’t
true in Dickens’ day.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.070
Besides the popular idea that poor people
were only poor because of their own vices,

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:39.190
another popular notion was one hinted at by
Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus, in his famed

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.130
1798 An Essay on the Principles of Population.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.280
In it, he writes,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.790
The power of population is so superior to
the power of the earth to produce subsistence

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:54.290
for man, that premature death must in some
shape or other visit the human race.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.610
The vices of mankind are active and able ministers
of depopulation.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:03.150
He further notes, “That the superior power
of population is repressed by moral restraint,

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.150
vice and misery…

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:10.060
Yet in all societies, even those that are
most vicious, the tendency to a virtuous attachment

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:14.940
is so strong, that there is a constant effort
towards an increase of population.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.850
This constant effort as constantly tends to
subject the lower classes of the society to

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.770
distress and to prevent any great permanent
amelioration of their condition…”

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:30.470
His main overarching point here was that overpopulation
would inevitably lead to lower wages and worsening

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:35.740
work conditions via more workers available,
while simultaneously scarcity of food would

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.870
result in said sustenance becoming more expensive.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.820
The ultimate result of all this would be famine
and disease as the population swelled beyond

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.680
what could be adequately sustained by available
resources.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.980
Eventually this rise in famine and disease
would then see the population decrease, reducing

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.190
instances of famine, disease, etc.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.750
Doing anything to stop the natural population
die-off of the impoverished, like giving widespread

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:03.540
government aid to poor people, would only
serve to make the problem worse for everyone

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.570
by keeping more people alive and breeding.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:11.920
Thus, in his view, laws that sought to help
poor people, in reality, helped no one when

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.240
looking at the big picture and, indeed, hurt
society as a whole.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.920
It’s no surprise then that Scrooge’s remark
that it was best for the poor to “die and

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.150
decrease the surplus population” is generally
thought to be directed towards many who were

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:32.150
using ideas in Malthus’ Principles of Population
to morally justify not helping those in need

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.200
in the present day.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.780
This, of course, is an argument Dickens takes
a moment to explicitly condemn when the Ghost

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.660
of Christmas Present states,

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:44.870
Man, if man you be in heart… forbear that
wicked cant until you have discovered What

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.010
the surplus is, and Where it is.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.070
Will you decide what men shall live, what
men shall die?

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:55.470
It may be, that in the sight of Heaven, you
are more worthless and less fit to live than

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.790
millions like this poor man’s child.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:03.960
Oh God! to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing
there is too much life among his hungry brothers

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.310
in the dust!

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:10.690
(Malthus himself was quite disturbed by accusations
from those who felt he was advocating for

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:15.520
an end to all charity and that he was unsympathetic
to the plight of the poor.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.610
He argued that one of his main points was
to try to illustrate the source of the problem

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:25.390
and thus help provide a solution via things
like controlling birth rates and making sure

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:30.760
resources were sufficient to support population
growth before such occurred.)

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.770
In any event, Dickens, like many others, was
outraged over what he read in the Report of

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:39.540
the Children’s Employment Commission, and
the Second Report published in 1843- with

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:44.050
the stories perhaps more stinging to him than
most wealthy individuals given his own experiences

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.540
as a child laborer.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.810
After all, this would have likely been his
own life-long fate, if not for the inheritance

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.100
from his grandmother.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:56.160
Shortly after reading the Second Report, Dickens
declared to one Dr. Southwood Smith that he

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.140
would deliver a “sledge-hammer” blow on
behalf of the Poor Man’s Child.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:05.380
He soon, however, became convinced that the
best way to do this was not, as he originally

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.050
intended, to publish a philosophical pamphlet
on the subject, which he proposed to title

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.950
“An Appeal to the People of England on behalf
of the Poor Man’s Child.”

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:19.290
Rather, he decided to write a story illustrating
the points he wished to impart.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.250
On the switch, Dickens wrote to Dr. Smith,

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:25.740
rest assured that when you know [it], and
see what I do, and where and how, you will

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:30.600
certainly feel that a sledge-hammer has come
down with twenty times the force — twenty

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.250
thousand times the force I could exert by
following out my first idea.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:39.880
Even so recently as when I wrote to you the
other day I had not contemplated the means

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.200
I shall now, please God, use.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.160
But they have been suggested to me; and I
have girded myself for their seizure— as

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.920
you shall see in due time.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.960
This is all set the stage for Dickens penning
his most famous work, which he began writing

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.590
in October of 1843, finishing in a mere six
weeks.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:03.080
The rush in completing the story was both
because he needed money fast and because he

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.360
had in mind to make it a Christmas tale.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.420
At the time, Christmas was considered something
of a “second-rate” holiday in much of

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.420
Britain.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.920
However, the holiday had begun seeing something
of an upswing in popularity as a festive event

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.440
in Britain starting around the early 19th
century- something Dickens was hoping to capitalize

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.670
on, leveraging it for a quick burst of sales
to supplement his waning income.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:28.820
Just as importantly, there was a notion, though
not nearly as popular as after A Christmas

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:34.000
Carol was published, that Christmas should
be a time of charity, which coincided well

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.680
with the point he was trying to get across
in the novella.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.850
As Dickens’ himself wrote in A Christmas
Carol (uttered by Fred, Scrooge’s gold-hearted

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:41.850
nephew):

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.960
But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas
time, when it has come round–apart from

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.620
the veneration due to its sacred name and
origin, if anything belonging to it can be

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:55.970
apart from that–as a good time; a kind,
forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:01.080
only time I know of, in the long calendar
of the year, when men and women seem by one

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.250
consent to open their shut-up hearts freely,
and to think of people below them as if they

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:11.100
really were fellow-passengers to the grave,
and not another race of creatures bound on

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.100
other journeys.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:17.540
And so it was that on December 19, 1843, Charles
Dickens’ A Christmas Carol was published.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:22.930
The original run of 6,000 copies sold out
by Christmas and the book sold very well beyond,

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.930
with 13 official editions published by the
end of the following year.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.680
Unfortunately for Dickens, the profits were
not nearly what he’d initially anticipated.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.680
For reasons not fully clear today (and something
occasionally criticized at the time for, ironically,

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.190
pricing the book out of the reach of any among
the poor), he insisted that the physical book

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:41.120
be a prize in and of itself; throwing out
initial plainly bound copies, he stipulated

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.930
that the binding must be top-notch with gold
lettering on the spine and front cover.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:51.790
The pages had to also be gold-gilded, accompanied
by four full-pages of colored hand-etchings,

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:55.589
four woodcut images, and with title pages
printed in bright red and green ink.

00:15:55.589 --> 00:15:59.260
All of this came at a high cost, resulting
in the production costs going significantly

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.020
over initial projections.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.210
As mentioned, this also priced the book out
of a range that any among the poor could ever

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.070
afford, though perhaps Dickens didn’t mind
this; while the book was technically for the

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:13.710
poor in some sense, his target reading audience
on this one was actually those who were a

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.600
bit more affluent- perhaps explaining his
choice to spare no expense in the physical

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.960
book’s construction to help it appeal more
to the wealthy on look alone.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.990
Whatever his true motivation here, despite
the book selling well, the initial high production

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:31.540
cost left him with a marginal profit of just
£230 off the first run (about £20,000 today),

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.520
a number that was reportedly about four times
less than he had expected.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.950
Subsequently, countless counterfeiters published
and sold the story themselves (strong copyright

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.870
protection not really being a thing at the
time), further hindering his profits in later

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.420
editions, though he would go on to make a
fortune on the book largely thanks to live

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.149
readings of the story, which included Dickens
acting out the parts while he read.

00:16:52.149 --> 00:16:56.800
While not initially achieving the goal of
solving his financial difficulties (though

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.140
it did, at least, help), the book had the
intended effect on the public, with it claimed

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:06.480
in Gentleman’s Magazine in the spring of
1844 that A Christmas Carol was directly responsible

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.270
for the significant rise in charitable giving
that occurred in Britain the months following

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.630
the publication of the book.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.110
As noted British author G.K.

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:17.000
Chesterton would later proclaim,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.240
The beauty and the real blessing of the story
do not lie in the mechanical plot of it, the

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.650
repentance of Scrooge, probable or improbable;
they lie in the great furnace of real happiness

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:31.010
that glows through Scrooge and everything
around him…

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:35.150
Whether the Christmas visions would or would
not convert Scrooge, they convert us…

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.970
While nobody knows for sure, as Dickens doesn’t
appear to have mentioned in a form that has

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.180
survived through today his reasoning behind
the name “Ebeneezer Scrooge”, it is speculated

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.080
that his choice of said name was a very deliberate
one.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:49.260
To begin with, Scrooge, a name seemingly coined
by Dickens himself, is thought to be derived

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.960
from a now antiquated English word “scrouge”
meaning “to squeeze or press”.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.790
Support for this notion is provided in the
opening description of the character, being

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:02.910
someone who was “was a tight-fisted hand
at the grind-stone… a squeezing, wrenching,

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.200
graspsing, scraping, clutching, covetous,
old sinner!”

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.601
As for the name “Ebeneezer,” the origin
of this name would not have been lost on his

00:18:10.601 --> 00:18:11.890
many religious fans.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:16.809
This is derived from the Hebrew for “stone”
and “helper”- thus the “stone of help”.

00:18:16.809 --> 00:18:21.350
In its mention in the Bible, the particular
stone named Eben-haezar was used as a symbol

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.630
of remembrance of the Israelites’ defeat
of the Philistines with the help of divine

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:26.630
aid.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.340
Thus, it is speculated that Dickens’ choice
of first name for the character was chosen

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:35.140
perhaps as Scrooge himself was to function
as something of a “stone of remembrance”

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:40.120
for everyone- helping people to remember to
keep a spirit of charity not just on Christmas,

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.760
but all year round.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.590
Whether that was Dickens’ intention or not,
another interesting word choice not familiar

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:49.330
to many today outside of this story is the
word “humbug”.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:50.850
So what’s a humbug?

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:56.360
At the time, this word simply meant something
(or someone) that was an imposter or a fraud.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:01.210
Hence, when Scrooge called Christmas a humbug,
he was calling the whole idea of the holiday

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:11.970
a fraud.
