00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.150
So let's talk about the feasibility of the

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.540
vision of active networks. The reality is, router

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.710
makers like Cisco are loath to opening of

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.470
the network. So while the idea of active networks

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.820
is very fascinating, that we can be frugal

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.910
about the resources that we use in the Internet

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.220
for different network flows and we can actually

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.500
virtualize the physical infrastructure by slapping on. Our own

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.830
idea of what should be the, the kind of

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.110
network flow that I want for my packets, seems very

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.070
attractive, but really it's not going to be feasible given that

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.140
we have to open up the network. So it's going to

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.430
be feasible only at the edge of the network.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.310
Secondly, when we are using active networks, we are talking

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.010
about executing code in a router in order to determine

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.930
the routing decision at that node. Or in other words,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.990
we're doing software routing. Software routing cannot match the hardware

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.840
routing, because at the core of the network, there's so

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.430
much of traffic being handled that you really want to do

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.830
this in hardware, and doing this at software speed is

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.360
not going to match the hardware speed of packet processing in

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.740
the core of the network. So once again, this argues

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.220
that active network is only feasible at the edge of

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.890
the network and finally there are social and psychological reasons why

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.960
active networks is maybe a little bit hard to

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.500
digest. It is hard for the user community to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.700
accept arbitrary code executing in a public routing fabric.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.930
If my traffic is flowing through the network and if

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.580
the router is going to actually execute some code in

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.090
order to do the processing of my packet, that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.280
worries me. Already, we talk a lot about privacy

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.300
and the fact that in corporate networks, in university networks,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.660
we are losing a lot of privacy. People

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.600
are watching what's going on. And now, saying that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.400
the routers are going to do something intelligent, a smart

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.780
processing packets, that might be a socially and psychologically

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.250
unacceptable proposition. So these are reasons why it would

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.490
make it difficult to sell the idea of active

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.290
networks to the wide area internet. On the other

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.350
hand, the idea of virtualizing the network flow is

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.570
very appealing. And if you put together the two thoughts that I had,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.462
one is the idea that we can virtualize the network and the second that

00:02:16.462 --> 00:02:21.380
active networks is only feasible at the edge of the network, that brings up

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.410
a very interesting proposition, which I am

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.860
going to mention in my concluding remarks.
