00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 to regain the confidence of the Brazilian people 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:18.960
 necessarily means defending the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:20.400
 democracy the majority of the population is 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.029
 against impeachment 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.199

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:02.659
 government can only be through elections 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:04.280
 democratic thinker who said 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.550
 the next thing we had to be 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.229
 optimist of the will and pessimistic 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.700
 reason 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.700
 I think it's these two things.
